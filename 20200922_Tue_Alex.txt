[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Directed energy weapons, also known as DOES, are weapons that deploy a highly focused energy beam, including lasers, microwaves, and particle beams.
[00:12.000 --> 00:23.000]  After decades of research in the United States, defense contractors announced back in 2015 that these systems are expected to come online by 2020,
[00:23.000 --> 00:34.000]  and are currently announcing that they are ready to deploy in the field. Russia, China, India, and the UK are developing directed energy weapons as well.
[00:34.000 --> 00:46.000]  And Iran has had them in use since at least 2013. In 2019, Turkey was the first to officially deploy this technology in combat,
[00:46.000 --> 00:53.000]  when they claimed to have shot down a Chinese-made drone supplied to the Libyan National Army.
[00:53.000 --> 01:03.000]  On September 16th, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced that China and Russia have already weaponized satellites with directed energy weapons.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  Meanwhile, in space, Moscow and Beijing have turned a once-peaceful arena into a warfighting domain.
[01:10.000 --> 01:19.000]  They have weaponized space through killer satellites, directed energy weapons, and more, in an effort to exploit our systems and chip away at our military advantage.
[01:19.000 --> 01:30.000]  And for the past few years, many have wondered if these advanced weapon systems have anything to do with the unprecedented fires we have seen in the past few years.
[01:30.000 --> 01:42.000]  Laser-based weapons are able to destroy the target with external heat, and microwave weapons are designed to penetrate the target through external antennas and sensors
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  and ignite the internal electronics, destroying them from the inside out.
[01:48.000 --> 01:57.000]  This could explain how thousands of homes have rapidly burned into their own footprint, while the trees surrounding them survive.
[01:57.000 --> 02:07.000]  And it could explain the several cars we have seen utterly destroyed, with temperatures hot enough to liquefy glass and metal.
[02:07.000 --> 02:16.000]  Michael Janic, host of the YouTube DutchSense channel, has been researching the Earth's seismic activity for the past ten years.
[02:16.000 --> 02:26.000]  During the past few weeks, he has discovered satellite imagery that show an equal-distance spread of fires, all starting within the same four hours.
[02:26.000 --> 02:35.000]  We've got ourselves an equal-distance spread of fires, here, here, here, here, and here.
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  So, what could cause an equal-distance spread of fires? Well, only two things, mother nature or man, right?
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  There's no storm in the area. You can't blame a storm.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  So, what could cause equal-distance-spaced fires to spread out across...
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  What do you think that is? One-third of Idaho?
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  And he also discovered what looks to be a beam of light that can be seen in the infrared spectrum, like a microwave.
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  On September 8th, a beam of light can be seen directed to the Dolan Fire of California.
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  The beam appears to excite the heat signature of the fire, as it is held on target for over two hours.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  Right before dawn, watch that. This is yesterday, going into this morning.
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  This is in California, the beam coming from space up above Oregon, or somewhere in between this and Oregon.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  And as it's going through, see how it excites?
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  As the beam is spreading, look how it excites. It's no doubt about it.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  And the beam spreads first. Look, beam spreads first.
[03:39.000 --> 03:47.000]  It goes from a tiny, little, tight beam to a wide beam, then the fire spreads to a wide fire.
[03:47.000 --> 03:55.000]  The next day, a beam of light is seen directed at and excites the heat signature of the holiday farm fire in Oregon for over an hour.
[03:55.000 --> 04:04.000]  Here, here it is now, and it's two of them, and it's only going to one fire, a different fire, and it's moving.
[04:04.000 --> 04:11.000]  Okay, it's moving. There's clouds going through it, which rules out it being an artifact.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  The clouds are passing through and interfering with the beam.
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  Meanwhile, in space, Moscow and Beijing have turned a once peaceful arena into a warfighting domain.
[04:22.000 --> 04:32.000]  They have weaponized space through killer satellites, directed energy weapons, and more, in an effort to exploit our systems and chip away at our military advantage.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  The timing of this public admission is interesting. These weapons of the future are now officially being deployed.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  Are we currently being attacked with directed energy weapons? And if so, by who?
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[05:16.000 --> 05:22.000]  200 million people have died. Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[05:22.000 --> 05:30.000]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 in reality,
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  he would want to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage. It's all made up.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  But you know where he got it? The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[05:39.000 --> 05:49.000]  They said that 4% of America would be dead already. Of course, it's.000 and then add a number, because the numbers vary.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[05:53.000 --> 06:10.000]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[06:10.000 --> 06:16.000]  Appai, Klobuchar and others back then were saying, you gotta have a full bench.
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.000]  Because of what the Republicans did in 2016. Democrats didn't do that in 2016.
[06:22.000 --> 06:29.000]  If Democrats actually put the person, wanted the person that was in office now, to do it, they would be making the same choice.
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  They would be consistent with their principles.
[06:32.000 --> 06:39.000]  I don't know that. And I think that most people don't agree with that idea, which is why they don't care about the difference between left and right.
[06:39.000 --> 06:49.000]  See, until you have a group of people that decide to consistently be better than what they reject, you're going to have people in the exact position they are right now, Don,
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  which is no matter what happens, everybody sticks with the team.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  We're going to have to blow up the entire system. And you know what we're going to have to do?
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  You know what we're going to have to do? Honestly, from what you're closing argument is, you're going to have to get rid of the electoral college.
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  Because the minority in this country decides who the judges are and they decide who the president is.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  But you need a constitutional amendment to do that.
[07:10.000 --> 07:17.000]  And if Joe Biden wins, Democrats can stack the courts and they can do that amendment and they can get it passed.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  Well, you need two thirds vote in the Congress and three quarters of the state legislature.
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.000]  They may be able to do that.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  Maybe, but that's a that's a tall task. I think if people vote, if you had 80% participation in our elections.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  I'm in so much trouble. You know what?
[07:30.000 --> 07:48.000]  What's better than this? Everybody, what do people say when they stop us?
[07:48.000 --> 08:01.000]  The Democrats are openly announcing they want a physical civil war and are implementing it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  And that civil war that they're backing is foreign backed.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  They believe the country shouldn't even exist.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  They hate the military. They hate police because it represents our republic.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  They want control of them. Then they tell you, oh, Trump hates the military.
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  Trump hates police and they lie to you and they lie to you and they lie to you again.
[08:25.000 --> 08:31.000]  Dr. Carlson always knocks it out of the park, but he did a grand slam yesterday.
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  We're going to play some of it in a moment.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  Democrats threaten to fly to Washington and prevent Senate vote on Supreme Court to the United States nomination.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Lay it on the floor block entry to Senate.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  We're going to play some of that in a moment.
[08:42.000 --> 08:53.000]  But remember, this is all just setting the stage for them to contest the election no matter what they said they will and have Democrat states to see.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  Trump needs to directly respond to their calls for civil war.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  And the fact that you can say what you wanted about the South and the North and who was right in a civil war.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  You can see both sides historically.
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  But the people breaking away from the union did not hate America.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  They saw themselves as Americans, but they were setting up the real form of the republic to control Western expansion.
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  And they shared a lot of the values of the Northerners and they were related to each other.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  They were bound by a common history.
[09:29.000 --> 09:43.000]  When they talk about on CNN, MSNBC, all the major colleges everywhere, when they have NFL games now and the one player who's a bronze star recipient refuses to not come out for the Star Spangled Banner.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  And the rest of the team stays inside.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  He got in trouble.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  That's 2020 America, the one guy that wants to go out.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  I've got the article right here and stand for the Star Spangled Banner.
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.000]  He gets in trouble.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  I thought we were all individuals. I thought we all had freedom, but you see, you don't under the system.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  The globalist cannot compete against an American system.
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  They cannot compete against something that makes people fabulously successful that they want to work hard.
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  They cannot compete with something that challenges authoritarianism.
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000]  Does free market, Americana capitalism make us fabulously rich?
[10:23.000 --> 10:35.000]  Does it make us corrupt and decadent? That's the problem is that historically any time a country or a nation or a system becomes very stoic, very strong, very, very manly.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  They have a time of incredible success.
[10:38.000 --> 10:46.000]  Then people become decadent, then corruption sets in, then they decline and they usually collapse very spectacularly.
[10:46.000 --> 10:54.000]  And younger, more hungry cultures come in and take them over and burn it to the ground.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  Because the barbarians are always challenged by the high culture of the technology and they know it could come back.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  And it took them so long to take it over, they don't want to adopt it.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  They want to burn it because that's what vandals do.
[11:10.000 --> 11:27.000]  That's why we get the term vandals from the Visigoths and the Ostria Goths that poured down from north of Italy in 410 with the Germans led by Alaric.
[11:27.000 --> 11:34.000]  And they burned Rome to the ground.
[11:34.000 --> 11:43.000]  Except for one temple that was so spectacular when they walked into it, they said surely this is where the gods resigned and they ran out.
[11:43.000 --> 11:53.000]  And so that building stands today 1,500 plus years later.
[11:53.000 --> 12:03.000]  So there is red fire in the sky on the west coast and there is political red fire above DC.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  And we're living in such an incredibly amazing and thought provoking and dangerous time.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  But you're seeing humanity awaken, but only partially the Democrats will wreck the nation and the Democrats are bad people.
[12:14.000 --> 12:23.000]  Folks, they are sinister forces of foreign powers that want to totally implode the nation so they can consolidate power and control.
[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  And that's their own admissions so that they can get all the land, the property, the wealth, the weapons for nothing.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  And it's Chinese, communist backed through the globalist that controlled China.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  And it should be so simple for Americans to come together against this.
[12:40.000 --> 12:57.000]  Because even if you were a psychotic person, you would realize that for 99.99% of people, the Republic's implosion is going to be horrible culturally, horrible spiritually, horrible financially.
[12:57.000 --> 13:05.000]  And most people are never going to recover and there's going to be blood the streets for decades and mass suicides and just things that are unimaginable.
[13:05.000 --> 13:17.000]  Because if you study who we were during the Great Depression that lasted 10 years and 7 million people starved to death quietly and politely, with 90% of folks living in rural areas,
[13:17.000 --> 13:30.000]  you reverse those numbers, 90% living in urban areas, only half the countryside self-sufficient, 5% of the public self-sufficient versus 50, 60% because not everybody in the country was self-sufficient.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  90% were in the country but only about 60% they estimate were self-sufficient.
[13:35.000 --> 13:46.000]  So 60% self-sufficient, 7 million starved to death, absolute horrific conditions versus 5% self-sufficient.
[13:46.000 --> 13:54.000]  This is a doomsday scenario and communist China has been flying bombers over Taiwan and Hong Kong threatening to attack.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  Hong Kong and Taiwan have issued statements saying they're ready to go to war.
[13:58.000 --> 14:06.000]  This is the type of political and cultural and historical climate where you get big wars.
[14:06.000 --> 14:15.000]  And all the mainline historians and analysts agree we are right where we were at the beginning of World War One, right where we were at the beginning of World War Two, all of the ingredients are there.
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  There's like a huge cold front coming in, in the fall, in the plains of Kansas.
[14:25.000 --> 14:34.000]  And you know when that cold air hits that hot air, that 90 degree air, what happens? Tornadoes.
[14:34.000 --> 14:42.000]  So you see that big blue northern coming in, it's not going to get there for another day, but you know, get batten down the hatches, look for tornadoes.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  So back before, they had even good radar.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  You know, they'd be in the newspaper that a big blue northern came out of Canada, it's coming down from Illinois.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  And you'd know, boy, in a day or two, it's going to hit in this hot weather, we're going to have tornadoes.
[14:54.000 --> 15:02.000]  Well, it's the same thing here, ladies and gentlemen, you've got a perfect storm of all of this stuff coming together.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  And China putting out videos where they bomb U.S. cities.
[15:06.000 --> 15:21.000]  And you know, they've got direct energy weapons in space, as Greg Reese's excellent report breaks down, and it's just a time to have our head screwed on straight and to get on our knees to God, because this is the big one, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:21.000 --> 15:40.000]  His report is at infowars.com, it's also at band.video in the Gregory section, beam of light aimed at West Coast fires as Pentagon warns that China has weaponized space with direct energy weapons destroying spacecraft, satellites in space and attacking targets on the ground.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  Greg, a year ago, put out reports saying it looks like direct energy weapons from China, and now it's definitely feeding into it.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  They even pick up the lasers on satellite and radar.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  Because it affects the atmosphere, so the laser line picks up in the radar.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  We'll be right back today with us.
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  I've got some bad news for you, and I've got some really bad news, and I've got some good news.
[16:02.000 --> 16:11.000]  The bad news is, even if Trump gets reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at martial law, medical lockdowns, race riots, and a depression.
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  That's the globalists, they're trying to bring America to our knees.
[16:14.000 --> 16:29.000]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression, total control, and like Australia's already doing, rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  That's the really bad news.
[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  The good news is, this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world, and the resistance is mounting, and the globalists are panicking.
[16:38.000 --> 16:48.000]  So, bottom line, we're in the fight, we're starting to win, but it's serious, so pray to God for a global awakening, support InfoWars, spread the word, and buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now, please visit InfoWarsTour and keep us on air.
[16:54.000 --> 17:09.000]  Thank you so much.
[17:24.000 --> 17:30.000]  Now, their global plan of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air.
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.000]  If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now, they're going to shut InfoWars down and shut everybody else down as well.
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  You already know that, it's out in the open.
[17:38.000 --> 17:50.000]  So, again, count the cost, focus, and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth, spreading the word, that overrides the sensors, your financial support, getting the products at InfoWarsTour.com, and your prayer.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  I'm praying for you, please pray for us, let's do this together.
[17:53.000 --> 18:01.000]  We're going to win. We are winning, but it's not going to be easy. The enemy is trying to take it all from us. Let's not let them succeed.
[18:01.000 --> 18:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  We are not living in normal times. We are not living in the year 2015 or the year 1999 or the year 1982.
[18:37.000 --> 18:46.000]  We're living in the year 2020, and it's a battle between the 1984 ideology of the New World Order and the 1776 ideology of America.
[18:46.000 --> 18:55.000]  And the worldwide authoritarians know that their system cannot survive if freedom exists anywhere in any way, people will choose it.
[18:55.000 --> 19:08.000]  And I have the live feed that I hope you'll share for your future in mind as well on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com is Democrats officially launch foreign-backed civil war.
[19:08.000 --> 19:18.000]  CNN calls for blowing up America. They say blow up the American system and bring in what?
[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  Well, we know the Council on Foreign Relations has told us thousands of times, the communist Chinese system.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  Now, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to get into the latest on the COVID-19 global power grab.
[19:32.000 --> 19:38.000]  Big developments there. I'm going to get into the attacks on free speech and how it's metastasizing and where it's going next.
[19:38.000 --> 19:49.000]  I'm also going to get into U.S. Marshall's recovered 35 missing Northeastern Ohio children that have been grabbed up by sex rings and how that ties into FBI agent who found Wiener laptop with Clinton's emails.
[19:49.000 --> 20:01.000]  It says FBI leadership ordered him to erase his filings, just incredible criminal activity of that child sex ring and more child sex ring and child porn news coming up on that front and so much more.
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  And a lot of really informative guests that I'll tell you about the start of the next segment.
[20:06.000 --> 20:15.000]  Tucker Carlson really is getting that the Democrats are bringing us into this hot civil war and that they're going to stop at nothing.
[20:15.000 --> 20:24.000]  And of course, they said they'll pack the court if Republicans don't wait till after the election.
[20:24.000 --> 20:31.000]  If the Republicans go ahead and do what the Democrats would do and anybody would do what the Constitution says and put in their nominee.
[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  They said they've got the votes now will break that down as well next segment, but now Mitt Romney says he's going to follow the Constitution.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  Well, he's never really done that before.
[20:39.000 --> 20:44.000]  I predict Romney wants the hearings are going is going to find some reason to remove his vote.
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  He is a nasty, nasty globalist creature.
[20:48.000 --> 20:55.000]  There's nothing evil that he hasn't found that he doesn't like to back, but that remains to be seen.
[20:55.000 --> 21:03.000]  But Tucker Carlson really gets what's going on and it dovetails with Don Lemon saying he wants to blow up the whole system, meaning America.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  For who Don Lemon owe the chai comms and the globalists.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  That's right.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night.
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  As you know, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last Friday.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  She passed away of cancer.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  It was a sad moment because death is always sad no matter who dies.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  Death is coming for all of us someday.
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  For that reason, we ought to mark a person's passing with a bow of respect.
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.000]  Take a moment for humility and perspective, meditate on the fragility of our own lives and the lives of those we love.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  Remember that death is the one thing that unites every human being.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  No matter how powerful we imagine we are at some point, we will be gone.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  All of us.
[21:41.000 --> 21:49.000]  In our case, we almost never agreed with Justice Ginsburg's decisions, but on Friday night show, we did our best to show some reverence because that's the right thing to do.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  The left, by contrast, made no attempt at all.
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  Prominent progressives immediately descended into hysteria and rage, unbridled rage.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  They told us that Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death was more than sad.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  They said it was a national crisis that imperiled this country's freedoms.
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, they told us, single-handedly kept America from descending into fascism and tyranny.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  Now that she's gone, only her words can keep us safe.
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  That's an odd claim, if you think about it.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  This is supposed to be a democracy no one ever voted for Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[22:23.000 --> 22:31.000]  No matter how much you liked her or agreed with her, she was, in the end, a single judge in a country of 350 million people.
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.000]  She was not God.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  Yet, according to the left, Ginsburg was all we had.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  We must obey her dying words as if they were a religious text.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  Her final wish supersedes our founding documents.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  What would Ruth Bader Ginsburg do?
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  We must ask ourselves that and then do it.
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.000]  Watch.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  As a nation, we should heed her final call to us.
[22:55.000 --> 23:03.000]  Not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  Stop it for a minute.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  Honor her last word.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  Back in five seconds for me.
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  These are the people dismantling the country that sold us out to China and say the country shouldn't even exist.
[23:14.000 --> 23:21.000]  And by the way, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has come out that you talk to her and she had to wait like a minute to answer that she was almost mentally retarded.
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000]  And part of a horrible communist think tank, that's why they put her in because she follows orders.
[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  It's well known, ladies and gentlemen, that she is extremely stupid.
[23:32.000 --> 23:40.000]  Bare minimum autistic, another against autistic people, but that's why they want Biden then because he is a mental moron that they can control as well.
[23:40.000 --> 23:47.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a meat puppet who loved abortion.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  What about the children?
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  What about them being revered?
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  What about them being remembered?
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  I refused to bow at the knees of this rotting witch.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  Continue.
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  As a nation, we should heed her final call to us.
[24:02.000 --> 24:10.000]  Not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country at a crossroads.
[24:10.000 --> 24:17.000]  Honor her last words that she not be replaced until a new president is installed.
[24:17.000 --> 24:27.000]  She said, my most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced by a new until a new president is installed.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  We believe that.
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  Her fervent wish is that the next president pick.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  That was the last thing she said to the public.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  We know who this man is.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  We know who this man is.
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  This is a man who does not care about a dying woman's final wish.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  Clearly.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  So turn down the volume and consider for a moment the reasoning here, the argument that they're making.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  Nothing is more important than our constitution.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  That constitution is in grave jeopardy.
[25:01.000 --> 25:11.000]  That's why we must substitute an 87 year old woman's final wish for the constitutionally prescribed process for filling a Supreme Court seat.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  That's what they're arguing.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  Got that?
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  Pretty amusing.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  Keep in mind we don't really know actually what Ruth Bader Ginsburg's final words were.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  Did she really leave this world fretting about a presidential election?
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  We don't believe that for a second.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  If it were true, it would be pathetic.
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.000]  Because life is bigger than politics. Even this year, we wouldn't wish final words that small on anyone.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  So we're going to again choose to believe that Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn't really say that.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  That in real life, she was thinking at the end about her family and where she might be going next.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  Human concerns, not partisan ones.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  But in practical terms, it's irrelevant what she said.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg doesn't get to pick her replacement from her deathbed.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  That's not how it works.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  We have a constitution we're supposed to be defending, remember, and that's the whole point of the constitution.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  If Justice Scalia had said something like that, nobody would have cared.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  We would have been embarrassed for him.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  Thankfully, he didn't say that.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  On some level, Democrats know all this.
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.000]  All this talk about Ginsburg's dying wish is ridiculous and insulting to all of us and our country.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  And they'll stop soon.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  Democrats have an alternative argument at the ready, and that's one they've been honing all year.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  It goes like this, do what we want or we will hurt you.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  That's the real argument they're making.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  Reza Aslan, a longtime CNN employee, wrote this.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  All right, again, we're going to go to break.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  And we're going to come back and finish up a few minutes of this, and then I'm going to get into fact-checking.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  Ginsburg, in 2016, she said, you must move forward with a nomination if someone dies, regardless.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  But of course, now she's flip-flopped on that.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  It doesn't even matter.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  These people aren't even Americans.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  They hate you.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  Don't just say that.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  You know that.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  The Democrats are Satanists.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  They hate America's existence.
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.000]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city,
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  This is a power grab.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if the U.S. for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans,
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.000]  is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian, and they are using this as their cover
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  for an authoritarian takeover because they know the world's waiting to them.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  It's a very simple equation.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  It's illegal.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  We must resist it.
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  Remember, the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent people all over the world.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  The globalist have a plan for total vertical integration.
[28:10.000 --> 28:19.000]  Absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices, of their control.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  But that is only a means to an end.
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place, they are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.000]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio and actually give people cancer.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  Most cancer is viral.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  That's a big secret, but the secret is beginning to come out.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  It's even in the associated press.
[28:47.000 --> 28:56.000]  Remember, all of these banned videos and reports are banned out of video, but only you can share them and save humanity.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  The planets have aligned globally.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  They've aligned nationally.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[29:05.000 --> 29:13.000]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species.
[29:13.000 --> 29:20.000]  That's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate us,
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  make us depressed, make us alone, and track and control every aspect of our lives,
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  literally grainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright,
[29:31.000 --> 29:37.000]  not just of Americana, but of true Christmode and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension,
[29:42.000 --> 29:49.000]  and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  This is their plan.
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no.
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  We must embrace God.
[29:57.000 --> 30:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:28.000 --> 30:33.000]  We are back live on this Tuesday, September 22 transmission.
[30:33.000 --> 30:41.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I do want to open the phones up in the last segment of this hour
[30:41.000 --> 30:48.000]  and in the second hour, G. Edward Griffin to cover the waterfront, one of the longest living grandfathers
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.000]  of the whole anti-New World War movement, totally vindicated.
[30:51.000 --> 30:58.000]  We should talk about that famous defector with the high-level KGB defector interview that he did that's gone so viral again,
[30:58.000 --> 31:08.000]  and it's part of a lot of the major discourse going on in the United States and the world that is all coming up.
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  And you can talk about the Democrats openly announcing they want a civil war and how they're firing back.
[31:13.000 --> 31:19.000]  You can talk about COVID-19 and that whole power grabbin' and the next phase of that already launching.
[31:19.000 --> 31:26.000]  You get into any subject you basically want to, but I'd like to ask listeners,
[31:26.000 --> 31:29.000]  what should we all be doing 41 days out from this?
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  Because I realized this this morning and it really clicked.
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  Normally with an election, you'd have the countdown of how many days to the election,
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.000]  but with them saying they're going to contest it and put down 80 million ballots illegally in most cases
[31:45.000 --> 31:51.000]  to confuse things and sabotage the whole system.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  Really, the countdown should be to inauguration day.
[31:54.000 --> 31:59.000]  So guys, you do a great job putting the countdown every day up there on screen for me.
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  Can we start having a countdown to the election, but then a countdown to January 20th?
[32:04.000 --> 32:12.000]  Because that's the real countdown here for all the marbles.
[32:12.000 --> 32:18.000]  Election day is important, but we know they're going to contest it.
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.000]  We know they're firing back.
[32:19.000 --> 32:26.000]  When you look at how weak the Democrats are, when you see how pathetic they are,
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  when you see how their leaders aren't leaders at all and can barely talk,
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  you're like, why are they like this?
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  Because that's what traders look like.
[32:36.000 --> 32:42.000]  The FBI reportedly talked to more than 5,000 people in the Mueller probe
[32:42.000 --> 32:50.000]  trying to set somebody up for being a Russian agent and they couldn't get one American to take the money,
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  one American to sell out.
[32:54.000 --> 32:58.000]  That's because they were going after Republicans.
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  Republicans have had their problems at the leadership level because they've been globalist,
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  but now you look at it, it's a populist nationalist movement.
[33:04.000 --> 33:12.000]  The Republicans I grew up knowing at the grassroots were so straight-laced like leave it to Beaver's parents.
[33:12.000 --> 33:18.000]  And that's really who we are, except I'm not one of those naive leave it to Beaver people.
[33:18.000 --> 33:24.000]  I live my life pretty much like leave it to Beaver's dad, but I'm not naive about the system
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  and I won't be trampled on and run over.
[33:27.000 --> 33:37.000]  Now, imagine if the FBI went to the Democrats and offered them millions of dollars to sell their country out to the Russians.
[33:37.000 --> 33:45.000]  They would have gotten most Democrats to take the money in a split second because they hate America.
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.000]  It's their religion.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  I'm going to say that again.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  They estimate between 4,000 and 8,000 people were interviewed,
[33:51.000 --> 33:58.000]  that the FBI with special task forces offered thousands of people money posing as Russians after Trump was elected
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.000]  trying to find something and they could find nothing.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  They had to take CIA agents they knew who were ordered to infiltrate the Russians
[34:09.000 --> 34:16.000]  knowing they couldn't blow their cover under federal law to then set up a few CIA assets and agents,
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  operatives, actual agents.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  So they could have somebody that talked to a Russian.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  Meanwhile, China owns the debt.
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.000]  It owns Hollywood, Nancy Pelosi and all of them hide it in plain view and say we want Biden.
[34:32.000 --> 34:40.000]  China wants Biden and Biden says China should be involved in every aspect of American life from our work to our schools
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  to our churches to our sporting events.
[34:44.000 --> 34:53.000]  Every facet of our culture, he literally gets on his knees beyond Benedict Arnold and does that.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  We were back in 1939.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  He'd salute Hitler.
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.000]  That's the level of quizzling enemy of humanity.
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  I mean, these people are flaming enemies.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  They are outrageous pieces of garbage.
[35:07.000 --> 35:13.000]  They are so absolutely out of the open and our media is bought and paid for by the same groups.
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  And so they just sit there hating the very nation's existence.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  Yeah, they just charge the NYPD officer for spying for China.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  It's everywhere, folks.
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.000]  But they couldn't get one American, including me, and I'm not liberty to get into it.
[35:32.000 --> 35:41.000]  They couldn't get one American to take the money.
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  I mean, I obviously knew it was a complete joke when it went down and what was going on.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  Man, I tell you folks, this is so horrible.
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  And then they criminally investigated my father.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  That's the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  They went after my family and I told them burn in hell.
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  I don't care.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  Go ahead and arrest us all.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  FU, burn in hell.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  I'll piss on you.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  But that's why it's so important that Trump get reelected.
[36:09.000 --> 36:21.000]  That's why it's so important we hold the course because this country is two minutes from destruction and total annihilation and war in the streets and everything we've built flushed down the toilet by a bunch of America hating trash.
[36:21.000 --> 36:28.000]  But I'll tell you this, it's time to stop kissing the ass of Black Lives Matter and George Soros and Antifa and all these criminal organizations.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  And it's time to stop bowing to political correctness to always prove, oh, we're not racist.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  We're not bad.
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  Let us battle whatever new outrageous crap you want us to do.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  No.
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.000]  Now they've got checkpoints set up on the highways.
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  Telling us with random Antifa shooting people in the head saying, raise your fist, say Black Lives Matter.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  Black Lives Matter.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  I said say it louder.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  That's a damn cult.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  I'm not living on my knees and I'm sure it's hell not bound down to these commie trash.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  They're trying to destroy their own country.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  Let's finish up with what Tucker was doing when he talks about them getting into violence.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  I'll come back, then I'll get into all the news.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  I said I would and I'll give the number out again.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  877-789-2539-877-789-2539-877-789.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  Alex?
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  877-789-2539.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  Let's do first time callers today.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  Or if you were on hold yesterday when the show ended.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  Let's go ahead and finish up with Tucker Carlson though laying out Democrats going into terror mode.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  They're making.
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  Reza Aslan, a longtime CNN employee, wrote this in the hours after Ginsburg died.
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.000]  If they even try to replace RBG, we burn the entire effing thing down.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  That effing thing being our country that we built.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  On Friday night, another Democrat tweeted instructions for how to begin that process.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  Quote, we're now walking to Mitch McConnell's house to protest.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  More than 120,000 people liked that post, shockingly.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  The follow-up came a few minutes later.
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  Quote, his house is entirely dark, significant police presence out front.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  It's not clear that he's here.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  It's clear that he's not here as confirmed by a neighbor who is not fond of him.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  People are going home.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  That's not a protest.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  That's a threat.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  The point of it was to terrorize Mitch McConnell and his family.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  McConnell knew it was coming because that's how things seem to work now.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  The police guarding his house are probably the only reason it's still standing.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  Watch.
[38:27.000 --> 38:35.000]  Quote, his house! Quote, his house! Quote, his house! Quote, his house! Quote, his house!
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  All I care about, I don't want you guys to get hit.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  So, okay, well, we can make a sense of this all along.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  We were fine!
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  We were in a bad situation.
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  Quote, his house is entirely dark, significant police presence out front.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  We shouldn't be surprised by that.
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.000]  It was just last year that another group of Democrats gathered outside Mitch McConnell's home chanting death threats.
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  It was all on video.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  We put up with it, of course, so it's happened again.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  You get what you put up with.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  That's true of children. It's true of countries.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  And we're putting up with this, so we shouldn't be surprised.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  Who's doing it?
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Well, Trump voters are fascists, they tell us.
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.000]  But when was the last time Trump voters threatened Democratic politicians in their homes?
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  Hard to recall that happening.
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  No, the tactics are always the same, and it's always the same people doing it.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  Then in case Mitch McConnell didn't get the message,
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  Biden voters assembled the home of Senator Lindsey Graham.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  Graham chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  And then he goes on how they're pledging to fly to D.C. and burn everything down and block all the buildings.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  And we told you that's coming, and Soros is the main funder of that group.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  The election transition integrity group.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  When we come back, though, I'm going to hit the other issues, the COVID-19, the big rollout there,
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  because I told you they're never going to end the lockdown.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  This is their move. It's never ending until we end it.
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses,
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said,
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  You get a lot of sunlight, it's on record, to produce a ton of vitamin D3,
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well, that's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter,
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  Now, I've pointed this out, and the media has called me a scammer
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  for saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C.
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  He should have also added zinc, because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[40:55.000 --> 41:00.000]  Last week, Tucker Carlson came out and said, America is becoming the Soviet Union.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  In many ways, we're worse than the Soviet Union.
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what Big Tech could do, surveilling and censoring us.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  And we're going to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to force inoculations
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations,
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  now in control of what you can and can't say online.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting for its life.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  And the enemy's number one mission is to get Trump out of office,
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  and number two is to silence info wars, because we understand just how diabolical they are,
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  just how evil they are, and we won't miss words.
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.000]  We know who the global star, we've got their number, and we know how to beat them,
[41:37.000 --> 41:43.000]  and we cover it seven days a week live at info wars, and it's only because of your support.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us, and take advantage of the sales
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  and get great products at infowarstore.com now.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  It is now confirmed.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  Every organization affiliated with President Trump and his campaign
[42:03.000 --> 42:10.000]  is being attacked out of Communist China in the biggest coordinated cyber attacks the planet has ever seen.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  Joe Biden has openly said China should run every facet of our lives.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  The Speaker of the House Pelosi has said that China wants Joe Biden.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  Info wars is under dozens of different types of cyber attack a day.
[42:24.000 --> 42:31.000]  Info wars.com, news wars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowarstore.com,
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  and they're not even hiding that it's coming directly out of Communist China.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  Everyone that votes for Joe Biden is a stooge of Communist China and an idiot trying to destroy not just their future, but our future.
[42:48.000 --> 42:56.000]  But no matter what happens to this election, the awakening and the chain reaction has begun, and cannot be reversed!
[42:56.000 --> 43:03.000]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.000]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.000]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids,
[43:14.000 --> 43:21.000]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.000]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[43:26.000 --> 43:32.000]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do,
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  and putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[43:46.000 --> 43:53.000]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  infowarstore.com
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  Introducing Democrats.
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with liars,
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.000]  looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  No more pesky law and order.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts,
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.000]  election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  And that video is called Democrats.
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  Please ask the great crew that put that together to make it the featured video at band.video.
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.000]  And let's make sure that we put that into a lot of the other videos we upload each day
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.000]  so that the great listeners go to band.video and find out which they think is most important
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  and then you share them and that's how we get around the censors.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  It's how we win.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  Okay, I can sit here and raise the alarm.
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  I can sit here and scream and yell and I do do that.
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  But it's probably more effective just to be very calm and lay this out.
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  But I just want to explain this again to new listeners.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  There's probably two niggas you've heard of Alex Jones being demonized.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  You want to find out what it's all about?
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  It's way worse than I can even tell you, okay? So that's my frustration is I feel guilty
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  that I'm not doing a good enough job describing how bad these people are.
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  It took me a long time to figure out how bad they are.
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  I mean, they're so bad it makes your head spin.
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  But it's because they have no bottom.
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  A lot of these people are very stupid.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  I think stupidity goes along with general evil.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  Now, there's some smart evil people in control of them,
[46:13.000 --> 46:19.000]  and leftist is just a lazy, drug addict devil worshipper.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  And by that, they reject God and they love death and they love discord
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  and they take no responsibility.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  And I guess I know why they do that.
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.000]  I remember back when I didn't feel as much responsibility.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  I did have more fun sometimes.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  I mean, I was not an evil person, but I got into ego and got into, you know,
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  triumphs and got into little side issues.
[46:46.000 --> 46:52.000]  And I got into little ignorant, you know, side, side rabbit trails.
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  I mean, once you really know how the world works, it is a wait.
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  But you understand things better and there's a lot of other good things that come with it.
[47:02.000 --> 47:05.000]  And you really have a consciousness and you're a lot smarter.
[47:05.000 --> 47:11.000]  But with it, it is very, very frustrating to watch how many people are completely ignorant
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  and they get off on being ignorant.
[47:13.000 --> 47:20.000]  I mean, take COVID-19, Operation Lockstep, Rockefeller, Bill and the Gates Foundation plan
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.000]  to bring in world government, to bring in casual societies, to bring in tracking apps
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.000]  and to bring in forced inoculation and to make you take vaccines that are on record
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  designed to lower your fertility and give you cancer.
[47:32.000 --> 47:38.000]  And so we knew when they said 15 days to slow the spread
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.000]  and to leave the hospitals open that they would never take the handcuffs off.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  And every time you get pissed, they say just a few more weeks, a few more months
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  and then right before that happens, all the cases are spiking.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  We can't do that now.
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  And so Australia is like, we're going to take some of the restrictions off.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  Oh, sorry, I couldn't do it. Spain.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  Oh, take restrictions off for a few weeks.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  Oh, sorry, they're right back on.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  And the same thing is being done here in the United States and it's not about the deaths.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  The deaths are way down because people now know that they shouldn't be putting on the list.
[48:09.000 --> 48:15.000]  Some of the died from a car wreck or something else.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  And so it's the same thing here yet again over and over again.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.000]  Oh, the stock market's down because Trump didn't handle the markets right.
[48:25.000 --> 48:33.000]  And, you know, Trump didn't stop COVID correctly.
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  And now the winter is going to begin.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  We're already into the fall and they're going to have all those flu and all those pneumonia deaths
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  of people that don't have enough vitamin D3 and they're going to all say it's COVID
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  and then use that as the excuse to lock everything down.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  Even though they said 2.5 million would be dead and it's only 200,000.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  And again, most of those died of something else.
[48:52.000 --> 48:59.000]  U.S. suffers most new COVID-19 cases in five weeks as doctors warn of apocalyptic fall.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  Remember six months ago everything was apocalyptic, that was the word, apocalyptic, apocalyptic.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  And now, and there's always, oh, a baby died.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  Oh, it turns out the baby was born without a brain, with holes in their heart,
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  with the intestines on the outside of their body.
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  They never died of COVID.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  They just lied to get the money at the hospital.
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  Congressional report concludes China could easily have prevented the pandemic
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  and lied about it being airborne.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  But again, it is man-made, so Gates can own it,
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  so it'll scare researchers when they look at it.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  But that's it.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's meant to spread to then make you a criminal,
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  make you someone that can be rounded up and taken away.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  That's really the end game of this, which is now happening.
[49:44.000 --> 49:56.000]  They're coming door to door in Houston, in Atlanta, in New York, in Trenton, in Chicago, in Detroit,
[49:56.000 --> 50:09.000]  in Los Angeles, in Oakland, in Seattle, in Portland, everywhere the same thing.
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  Continuing, oh, professor under investigation for calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus,
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  an M4Words.com article, the Cincinnati professor, John Euker.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  And it's the same thing here.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.000]  In stunning reversal, CDC says it published new guidance of risk of airborne COVID-19 error.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  Of course, regular cold viruses or flu can be carried in the air in a water droplet.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  That's all known.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  But because China said eight months ago through the WHO that it wasn't airborne,
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  we have to follow China and the UN that are the boss.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  And it says right here, yet the WHO refused these overtures,
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  and this week successfully convinced the CDC to do the same.
[50:51.000 --> 51:00.000]  China and the WHO, the AP is reporting, are the reason that they now say it's not airborne
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  and, quote, hurt the credibility of the CDC.
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  Why the hell is the WHO in charge of the CDC?
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  How are they in charge of Big Tech?
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  Because it's world government, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  So the professor can't say Chinese virus.
[51:15.000 --> 51:23.000]  The CDC and Redfield, all of them have to take their orders when, of course, COVID-19 is airborne.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  And so are all the other coronaviruses, and so is the flu virus.
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  They're all airborne.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  They've got different studies on different viruses, but they live a few minutes to a few hours to a few days.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  And coronaviruses are very weak in the air, and they die in 25 seconds in direct sunlight,
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  about two minutes in partial sunlight.
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  But you can't say that because the UN says it's not true.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  Even though it's been known, in fact, for 70, 80 years.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  How do we know what temperature water boils at?
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  We know.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  How do we know what temperature water freezes at?
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.000]  We know.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  How do we know how long the virus lasts in the sunlight?
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  We know.
[52:01.000 --> 52:06.000]  But it's like a new dark age where people are so dumb, oh, we can't say UV light.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  You can't go to the beach.
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  That's where the virus is the worst.
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  Yeah, Forbes.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  Why speaking English may spread more coronaviruses than other languages?
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  I'm not joking, folks.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  That's Forbes.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  That's not the onion.
[52:21.000 --> 52:22.000]  And I told you this was coming.
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  CDC says breathing is bad.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  Humans living is spreading coronavirus.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  And it gets worse.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  I mentioned this ghoulish fraud.
[52:31.000 --> 52:40.000]  Youngest C-19 victim in Michigan actually died a birth defect where the baby is born with intestines located on the outside of the body.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  And even old CNN had to do a little retracting tracker.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  There it is.
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  Breathing is now bad.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  CDC said it mistakenly published guidance that COVID-19 was airborne.
[52:52.000 --> 52:59.000]  But when the U.N. said that they were wrong, yes, sorry, that's the U.N.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  Don't worry.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  It gets crazier.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  You heard breathing is bad.
[53:03.000 --> 53:10.000]  Remembering Godfather II where the guy's got the pillow trying to smother the other mob boss?
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  Whatever.
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is not smothering someone.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  That is resuscitating them.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  That is someone being given CPR.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  I'm not joking.
[53:19.000 --> 53:29.000]  U.K. government says you give someone CPR by holding a cloth over their face and covering their nose and mouth.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  And you go, well, that's crazy.
[53:31.000 --> 53:42.000]  It's all supposed to be crazy like having convicted pedophiles come to your public school with erections through their pants and gyrate little girls and boys on them.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  Here, let me help you.
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  We're going to put this over your face.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  That's the new thing, folks.
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  That's how you administer CPR.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  It's a war on logic.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  It's a cult.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  We're going to come back.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  I'm going to get to all the other news.
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  It's just that I have, well, you can't forget I haven't told you yet.
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.000]  They haven't put it up yet, but they said they're going to reset the timer and do it again because of such demand.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  Prepare with Alex.com.

[54:43.840 --> 54:45.600]  Because the fall is here
[54:45.600 --> 54:48.480]  real power comes from the grassroots and
[54:49.120 --> 54:54.080]  Real power comes from experience and I've been the fight more than 26 years against the globalist
[54:54.080 --> 54:58.760]  So it's important for listeners and viewers to understand when you support info wars that keep us on the air
[54:58.760 --> 55:03.520]  You're not supporting a news outlet that has sources and so we're able to always tell you what's coming
[55:03.960 --> 55:08.860]  When others can't it's because we are studying the enemy and doing the original
[55:09.160 --> 55:16.080]  Analysis that gets picked up by Trump intelligence agencies and major corporations that are part of the resistance that are part of the resistance
[55:16.080 --> 55:17.840]  To the overarching globalist system
[55:17.840 --> 55:22.720]  So I have to tell you how the hierarchy works in many cases info wars is at the head
[55:22.720 --> 55:28.480]  We're not the tail that means you're at the head and that's why your support of us is so critical
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.120]  Biden and his constellation of criminals have told us and many others that if they get elected
[55:33.280 --> 55:38.640]  They're not just going to shut down info wars. They're going to shut you down the long depression forced inoculations and more
[55:38.640 --> 55:43.520]  So now more than ever keep info wars on the air with high quality products at infowarstore.com
[55:46.720 --> 55:49.720]  The answer to 1984
[55:49.720 --> 55:53.320]  is 1776
[56:01.480 --> 56:03.480]  Info wars has been banned
[56:06.080 --> 56:08.080]  Arrested
[56:09.800 --> 56:11.800]  Attacked and threatened
[56:12.600 --> 56:14.600]  Because we are effective
[56:14.600 --> 56:22.160]  The great awakening is here. Go to banned video download the videos and share
[56:24.120 --> 56:28.240]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[56:31.080 --> 56:33.240]  And never give up the fight
[56:33.240 --> 56:35.240]  Fight
[56:42.920 --> 56:44.920]  Info war.com
[56:49.480 --> 56:52.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[56:52.320 --> 57:05.840]  We are now into hour number two broadcasted worldwide
[57:09.920 --> 57:12.420]  How many times must I tell you
[57:12.420 --> 57:27.060]  We finally crossed those bridges and now I can talk to the boss that means you
[57:28.420 --> 57:30.420]  I can talk to the president that means you
[57:31.060 --> 57:33.060]  We the people
[57:33.140 --> 57:34.660]  Before I could talk to the boss
[57:34.660 --> 57:37.460]  This is a very important report about the covet tyranny
[57:37.460 --> 57:42.980]  We're going to go to break and come back with your phone calls on this live Tuesday edition. Please stay with us
[57:43.220 --> 57:47.460]  We knew the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bellarmollinigades group and and
[57:48.180 --> 57:50.180]  John Hopkins and and
[57:50.180 --> 57:54.420]  All these other groups were developing injectable vaccines nanotech
[57:54.900 --> 57:59.460]  Little bitty microchips because they can miniaturize stuff so much now they go with the vaccine
[57:59.940 --> 58:06.180]  That's why researchers in Singapore have developed a chip which can be plugged into an existing DNA analysis machine
[58:06.180 --> 58:08.900]  As a result a single sample from a patient
[58:08.900 --> 58:15.140]  Perhaps a saliva or a blood sample can be checked for 70 000 different viruses and bacteria
[58:15.540 --> 58:18.980]  Each of these tests currently cost between 20 and 200 dollars
[58:19.300 --> 58:24.100]  So to be able to do the lot for just four hundred and fifty dollars represents a massive advance
[58:24.420 --> 58:27.700]  I love gadgets and now I kind of feel like i'm a gadget myself
[58:28.020 --> 58:31.060]  Even a car door can be tweaked to open with a touch
[58:31.060 --> 58:36.420]  But each touch leaves a digital footprint and that can compromise privacy
[58:36.660 --> 58:43.460]  Many of the employees including the CEO will voluntarily have the microchips implanted into their bodies
[58:43.860 --> 58:48.020]  And they're calling it. I'm not kidding here a chips and salsa party
[58:48.740 --> 58:53.860]  This has been announced by major universities. This is all over the news on drugsreport.com last night
[58:54.260 --> 58:57.300]  My wife tweeted this and people are like this isn't true
[58:57.300 --> 59:03.620]  This couldn't be happening because they have that pre-built-in disposition that oh that you know, there's no way that could actually be going on
[59:03.940 --> 59:08.980]  You know, Alexa is not listening to us. Google assist isn't listening to us now. They admitted it. They're like, okay
[59:08.980 --> 59:16.260]  Well, that's fine. It's DARPA funded implantable bio chip to detect covet 19 could hit markets in 2021
[59:16.900 --> 59:18.900]  But all the tests are fake 90
[59:19.780 --> 59:24.020]  False positives. It's just the excuse to get a chip in you. You've wondered how they do it. Here it is
[59:24.180 --> 59:26.180]  They have another digital chip
[59:26.180 --> 59:31.140]  Uh, that's injected. That's liquid. You can't get out of your body. You can always cut a chip out. Oh, no, sorry. This is nanotech
[59:31.940 --> 59:32.980]  that
[59:32.980 --> 59:34.980]  Surveils whether you've had the vaccine
[59:35.940 --> 59:40.980]  CDC going door to door in Atlanta asking for blood samples for coronavirus study
[59:41.460 --> 59:43.700]  Now I saw this this week in houston
[59:44.900 --> 59:46.900]  I talked about it. It was a big controversy
[59:47.940 --> 59:51.540]  They had snopes fact checkers and people saying it's made up doesn't exist
[59:51.540 --> 59:58.820]  This first notice we got from someone said my mother got a text saying the cdc is going door to door to do testing
[59:59.220 --> 1:00:03.060]  Well, that is false. The cdc is not allowing that
[1:00:03.460 --> 1:00:09.540]  Sean the cdc were hitting the pavement tonight here in candler park where the neighborhood was happy to welcome them in
[1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:12.020]  But many online saying they wouldn't have a bar of it
[1:00:12.260 --> 1:00:19.060]  Officials randomly selecting houses and drawing blood for antibodies and conducting a questionnaire to better understand a deadly virus
[1:00:19.060 --> 1:00:21.860]  Is spread john bear was one of the first to be tested
[1:00:22.260 --> 1:00:27.380]  Normally, I wouldn't have opened the door, but I looked outside and saw some folks in some ppe gear one of them had a
[1:00:28.180 --> 1:00:34.180]  Clipboard with cdc visible on it and prompt doesn't have orange hair. That doesn't exist either. Well, turns out it's in Atlanta
[1:00:34.260 --> 1:00:36.020]  It's everywhere. We have the articles
[1:00:36.020 --> 1:00:38.660]  We have the videos showing the blood draws at the houses
[1:00:38.900 --> 1:00:45.460]  CDC will be knocking on doors this week asking for blood samples to get a better understanding of how many
[1:00:45.460 --> 1:00:52.820]  Georgians have already had coronavirus the homes will be randomly selected across folton into cab counties from tomorrow
[1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:56.420]  Through next monday. All right, you may be a little thrown off by this
[1:00:56.500 --> 1:01:02.900]  But if you get a knock on the door expect to answer a few questions and provide a blood sample to be tested for antibodies
[1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:09.060]  msm welcomes whistleblowers reporting party college students breaking covet 19 reports
[1:01:09.620 --> 1:01:11.620]  But democrats don't want you reporting
[1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:16.340]  Black lives matter a million person marches or anything like that. Oh, no, no, no
[1:01:16.660 --> 1:01:21.380]  It's only just random people or any conservative groups or trump rallies have to be shut down
[1:01:21.780 --> 1:01:29.860]  Professor who told students she hopes trump supporters gets coveted die has been suspended. You can't argue with and you can't talk sense into them. Um
[1:01:32.820 --> 1:01:35.620]  I said to somebody yesterday, I hope they'll die before the election
[1:01:35.620 --> 1:01:41.220]  There is a real man made virus and people get scared so virologists see and get scared and so bill gates can then own it
[1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:43.380]  With his sub companies and come with a vaccine for
[1:01:44.340 --> 1:01:46.340]  That's all real
[1:01:55.300 --> 1:02:02.900]  Remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent people all over the world
[1:02:02.900 --> 1:02:07.620]  The globalist have a plan for total vertical integration
[1:02:08.820 --> 1:02:10.420]  absolute
[1:02:10.420 --> 1:02:16.260]  authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices of their control
[1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:19.220]  But that is only a means to an end
[1:02:20.100 --> 1:02:22.900]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place
[1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:29.140]  They are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse
[1:02:29.140 --> 1:02:33.220]  Many but the vaccine is being pushed by the united nations
[1:02:33.700 --> 1:02:39.140]  Actually give people polio and actually give people cancer. Most cancer is viral
[1:02:39.380 --> 1:02:45.300]  That's a big secret. But the secret is beginning to come out. It's even in the associated press
[1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:50.980]  Remember all of these banned videos and reports are banned on video
[1:02:50.980 --> 1:03:00.980]  But only you can share them and save humanity
[1:03:02.740 --> 1:03:08.980]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex jones

[1:03:59.860 --> 1:04:01.860]  It deals with forced inoculation
[1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:05.780]  It deals with censorship. It deals with mind control
[1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:11.540]  You know, i hadn't seen the john bound report that i just aired last segment some stations don't carry that for a segment
[1:04:13.060 --> 1:04:15.780]  DARPA unleashes covid microchip domination
[1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:20.740]  It's in the john bound section left hand corner of band.video just click that find it
[1:04:20.980 --> 1:04:25.780]  You want to share a video though on facebook or twitter? You've got to go to 2020electioncenter.com

[1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:40.580]  And i i knew that that was in the news they were saying alex jones is a liar
[1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:43.460]  just last week
[1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:46.500]  No one is coming door to door to take blood samples for the cdc
[1:04:48.340 --> 1:04:51.940]  And alex jones is a liar the un is not in control
[1:04:51.940 --> 1:04:56.820]  Of every major nation states governmental response to covid 19
[1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:03.940]  And then i was watching john bound's report where he took things i said yesterday about it and he went and found the newscast
[1:05:03.940 --> 1:05:04.900]  They're like
[1:05:04.900 --> 1:05:09.860]  There's no one coming to get your blood and that's like the same time it's been on the news for months
[1:05:09.860 --> 1:05:14.340]  They're coming and trying to force you to take blood the mayor of husan says well, we do pressure you to do it
[1:05:15.220 --> 1:05:17.860]  And again in australia, they're making you do it
[1:05:17.860 --> 1:05:21.860]  And then see it and goes oh, we're actually following the un mandate
[1:05:22.820 --> 1:05:27.620]  And sundar pachai says they're following it the head of google and the head of youtube says we follow un orders
[1:05:27.620 --> 1:05:29.620]  I mean i can play you the clips again
[1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:35.460]  And then they're running around saying it doesn't exist. It's not happening. We're under un control
[1:05:36.580 --> 1:05:39.860]  And then the cdc comes out last night and says we're sorry
[1:05:40.260 --> 1:05:42.260]  We said covid 19 is airborne
[1:05:42.660 --> 1:05:45.220]  The un said in february it wasn't
[1:05:45.220 --> 1:05:47.540]  And so we they are the boss and we
[1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:51.380]  Deferred to them i covered it last hour
[1:05:53.060 --> 1:05:55.060]  CDC embarrassed after they
[1:05:55.780 --> 1:05:59.860]  Were too big for their britches and said covid can be transmitted in the air
[1:06:03.220 --> 1:06:06.900]  When that's a fact does it mean it kills you no
[1:06:08.260 --> 1:06:10.260]  very weak virus
[1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:18.420]  But it obviously can be carried in the air in a sneeze droplet. Hell of it if the wind hits it right it might travel a thousand yards
[1:06:20.260 --> 1:06:26.180]  They don't know that six feet or 20 feet. They've already got studies at 28 feet or 79 feet because
[1:06:28.260 --> 1:06:30.260]  They can sit there with
[1:06:30.900 --> 1:06:34.500]  It you know spray bottle and put it in the air and and then have a sensor pick it up
[1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:37.940]  But our own cdc
[1:06:37.940 --> 1:06:39.940]  can't
[1:06:40.020 --> 1:06:42.020]  take
[1:06:42.260 --> 1:06:48.900]  Their shoes off i guess or or or make a cup of coffee without the un's authorization. I mean think about that level of slavery
[1:06:50.260 --> 1:06:53.300]  Remember just a few years ago. We would talk about the eu
[1:06:54.100 --> 1:06:56.100]  Going back a decade ago with facebook
[1:06:56.820 --> 1:07:04.100]  Hiring former members of the stasi secret police to oversee it moving into the old stasi headquarters and all the rest of it just bizarre
[1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:08.180]  And they would say at that time
[1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:16.580]  That well you covered that migrants not invaders burned this down or killed these people or did that and if you reported on
[1:07:16.980 --> 1:07:22.020]  Who killed the girl or who robbed somebody or who murdered somebody or who burned this down or who stabbed this person
[1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:28.900]  You would get suspended on facebook and the police would come and charge you and you'd spend six months to a year in prison
[1:07:29.140 --> 1:07:31.140]  Now it's 10 years in prison
[1:07:31.140 --> 1:07:33.140]  You
[1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:35.220]  Well now in america
[1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:43.460]  You can't even criticize the un you can't even say i don't want the un run in my life. I didn't elect the united nations
[1:07:45.860 --> 1:07:49.860]  And now a football player for the pittsburgh stealers who's a ron star winner
[1:07:51.620 --> 1:07:53.620]  Play this video later
[1:07:53.700 --> 1:07:54.980]  alejandro
[1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:57.220]  Villarro, I say that right i always pronounce everything wrong
[1:07:57.220 --> 1:07:59.380]  He went out and went ahead and stood
[1:08:00.020 --> 1:08:04.820]  Nobody else did and now they're talking about getting him in trouble. Oh just a few years ago
[1:08:04.820 --> 1:08:08.740]  It was okay. If you want to take a knee there in this thing or do the black power fist for all this crap
[1:08:08.740 --> 1:08:13.620]  Nike would fund you and it was everybody's right to what they want, but now he's in trouble
[1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:18.180]  Because he's a veteran and he didn't like that
[1:08:18.740 --> 1:08:20.740]  That's a cult folks in america
[1:08:20.740 --> 1:08:28.100]  I've got the articles right here. The team's really mad and the coach is mad and he's apologized for not being in solidarity with his team
[1:08:31.700 --> 1:08:33.700]  Man that's a fate worse than death man
[1:08:33.780 --> 1:08:40.100]  So just like that suddenly you're not allowed to stand for the national anthem
[1:08:41.380 --> 1:08:43.380]  You've not told you 10 years ago
[1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:45.620]  that the year 2020
[1:08:45.860 --> 1:08:47.860]  High school students would be suspended
[1:08:47.860 --> 1:08:49.860]  High school students would be suspended
[1:08:50.660 --> 1:08:55.940]  For having american flags at a football game and that the principal said that that's a symbol of evil
[1:08:56.980 --> 1:09:02.980]  You'd say that'll never happen. Well, guess what had happened last week. This is what we put up with look in the mirror
[1:09:03.380 --> 1:09:05.380]  We're to blame
[1:09:07.780 --> 1:09:15.220]  Kevin joshua jim travis kasey rockwave joey d matt ryan i'm gonna get to every one of you
[1:09:15.220 --> 1:09:20.740]  So i'll do the next two segments of calls and i'll cover the other news then i started covering some of it now
[1:09:21.060 --> 1:09:24.100]  But this is just getting absolutely crazy
[1:09:25.860 --> 1:09:27.860]  Separately
[1:09:27.940 --> 1:09:30.500]  I've come to listeners many times and i thank you for your support
[1:09:30.900 --> 1:09:34.180]  But i just want you to understand that everything's been critical up until now
[1:09:34.580 --> 1:09:40.500]  But this is when the planets are politically aligning. This is this is this is super bowl time use a football analogy
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:46.020]  And if this isn't just super bowl, we've been this for a while. We're in sudden death overtime right now
[1:09:46.260 --> 1:09:47.620]  And it's not about who wins the game
[1:09:47.620 --> 1:09:54.420]  It's about going under a scientific tyranny run by big tech and the chai comms the globalists that wants to
[1:09:54.980 --> 1:10:00.340]  Absolutely crush america and dominate us and enslave us in their own words
[1:10:02.100 --> 1:10:04.100]  This is a
[1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:10.740]  existential will of the satanist to destroy what was the greatest christian nation on earth and the most powerful
[1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:14.900]  We forgot our power. We gave up our power and now we're falling and pathetic
[1:10:15.220 --> 1:10:20.260]  But still they want to bring us down because we're coming down fast, but we're miles above them
[1:10:21.700 --> 1:10:23.700]  to quote
[1:10:25.540 --> 1:10:27.540]  Charlie Manson
[1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:30.100]  So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:31.140 --> 1:10:33.140]  So i'm just going to tell you
[1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:35.140]  I
[1:10:36.740 --> 1:10:41.620]  Don't take vitamin d3 because of their hyped up garbage in the new world order
[1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:47.620]  I take it because a regular cold virus or a regular flu virus can kill a baby
[1:10:47.940 --> 1:10:54.100]  It can kill an old person. It can kill anybody that doesn't have d3 if you have a deficiency of d3
[1:10:55.860 --> 1:11:00.020]  It's only a matter of time until you get degenerative diseases from it and you die
[1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:04.500]  And it's the same thing for every essential vitamin and mineral that is a scientific fact
[1:11:04.660 --> 1:11:11.940]  But the un came out this year and said oh, there's nothing that can be a preventative. No vitamins and minerals aren't needed
[1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:18.260]  Just like telling a catfish you don't need water to live you can you can live in the you can live in the desert
[1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:21.940]  It's that level of an insult. So yes, I sell things
[1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:24.500]  That you have to have to live
[1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:29.460]  We sell water filtration to cut out all the chemicals and problems and give you good clean pure water
[1:11:29.940 --> 1:11:34.740]  Highest rated people go. Wow. I looked at what jones sells the two brandy seller of the two highest rated
[1:11:36.820 --> 1:11:38.820]  Exactly
[1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:42.100]  That's what I do. It's it's how I treat myself see
[1:11:43.380 --> 1:11:47.380]  If they're safe folks, I knew radically have to treat you like I treat myself. That's my rule
[1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:52.420]  It's not even something i'm in control of and I just can't believe everybody else doesn't follow that rule
[1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:56.820]  But I love you and I appreciate you. This is stuff you need you should go to info or store.com
[1:11:56.820 --> 1:11:57.860]  Get your water filtration
[1:11:57.860 --> 1:12:03.300]  But winter sun highest quality d3 under the tongue with vitamin k that helps it absorb somehow
[1:12:03.300 --> 1:12:06.020]  I'm not the scientist tell me that it's essential as well
[1:12:06.020 --> 1:12:09.380]  But they go together like a horse and carriage like a key and a keyhole
[1:12:09.860 --> 1:12:15.940]  That is 50 off with free shipping despite the fact it's selling out and I'm told more isn't coming in until november
[1:12:16.260 --> 1:12:21.460]  Stuff's so crazy if if if trump loses they're gonna come in here and shut us down after that
[1:12:21.460 --> 1:12:27.860]  So that's why i'm selling everything out even though a lot of this stuff is dna force plus. Oh, how about for your cells and your health?
[1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:30.180]  It's the next level
[1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:37.460]  pqq coqt and organic reishi astragalus even more a el ev atp ancient pete apple extract
[1:12:38.580 --> 1:12:43.620]  It's 50 60 off that's with free shipping and it's selling out
[1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:46.020]  But I just got to get the funds in because stuff's so dangerous the future
[1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:48.980]  So if you ever waited to get dna force, that's the lowest price ever
[1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:52.020]  I take advantage of that right now or we come right back with your phone calls
[1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:53.860]  Stay with us
[1:12:53.860 --> 1:12:56.740]  There is a forced evolution taking place
[1:12:57.380 --> 1:13:02.660]  The scientific ruling elite believe they are transcending to a silicon live form
[1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:09.700]  While they are making this hypothetical very dangerous transition that is guaranteed doom to fail and create nightmares
[1:13:10.100 --> 1:13:11.860]  They're almost unimaginable
[1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:14.500]  their plan for us is extermination or
[1:13:14.500 --> 1:13:20.900]  Spiking the cannon like after a major war is done. You don't want those weapons used again. You get rid of them
[1:13:21.380 --> 1:13:23.380]  We are being rendered into scrap
[1:13:23.860 --> 1:13:29.220]  Metal right now. So think about all your ancestors think about your grandparents think about your parents think about your shoulder
[1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:35.700]  Think about the future and ask yourself are you really going to let a bunch of crazy mad scientists steal the future destiny of everyone?
[1:13:36.180 --> 1:13:42.340]  And basically use us like guinea pigs to experiment so they can try to find cures the cancer and things not for us
[1:13:42.340 --> 1:13:44.980]  But for them bill gates is the leader
[1:13:45.700 --> 1:13:52.100]  Of this organization bill gates is the enemy of humanity decide what you're going to do america decide. We're going to do humanity
[1:13:54.020 --> 1:13:57.140]  A little more than a decade ago it happened in salt lake city
[1:13:57.700 --> 1:13:58.980]  utah
[1:13:58.980 --> 1:14:02.580]  The public came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet
[1:14:03.220 --> 1:14:05.460]  So what they thought was a giant ufo
[1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:10.100]  Was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp
[1:14:10.100 --> 1:14:17.700]  There were thousands of phone calls made of police departments newspapers tv stations thinking it was an alien craft when the public was told
[1:14:18.100 --> 1:14:20.500]  That it was a blimp. They didn't want to believe it. You see they'd already
[1:14:21.300 --> 1:14:23.300]  told themselves it was a ufo so they
[1:14:24.340 --> 1:14:26.180]  Had cognitive distance
[1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:29.700]  It's kind of like de facto COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu
[1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:35.060]  Let people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside even in their cars even in their houses
[1:14:35.060 --> 1:14:40.260]  Well, it happened again over new jersey yesterday the good year blimp was out there with a big gumbotron
[1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:46.260]  tv screen on the side of it and had flashing lights on it just like an airplane and the public thought it was ufo and
[1:14:46.900 --> 1:14:49.700]  Now the public still believes it was ufo. No, they were told it wasn't
[1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:52.580]  You see that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves
[1:14:52.580 --> 1:15:02.580]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:11.940 --> 1:15:18.580]  Are you sick and tired of your calm peaceful life? Are you sleeping too well at night? Is your city too safe?
[1:15:18.580 --> 1:15:20.580]  Well, not any more
[1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:24.580]  Introducing democrats
[1:15:25.220 --> 1:15:28.580]  politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with riots
[1:15:29.380 --> 1:15:30.900]  looting
[1:15:30.900 --> 1:15:33.300]  rampant violence and even homelessness
[1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:38.340]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity
[1:15:39.140 --> 1:15:44.100]  No more pesky lawn order when democrats are in charge. Nobody's safe
[1:15:44.100 --> 1:15:49.780]  Simply vote for democrats sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground
[1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:57.140]  But wait vote for democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts election fraud cancel culture
[1:15:57.860 --> 1:15:59.860]  taxes and more taxes
[1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:03.540]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door
[1:16:03.540 --> 1:16:11.540]  And when you're out there without care, yeah, I was out of touch
[1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:13.540]  But it wasn't because I didn't know too much
[1:16:13.540 --> 1:16:15.540]  But it was because I didn't know enough
[1:16:15.540 --> 1:16:17.540]  I knew too much
[1:16:17.540 --> 1:16:19.540]  I just knew too much
[1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:23.540]  This is the battle for the whole world as America goes
[1:16:23.540 --> 1:16:25.540]  So goes the planet
[1:16:27.540 --> 1:16:29.540]  Now America that even sleeping knows she's in a fight of her life
[1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:33.540]  And everybody's got a fighting spirit is awakening and rallying to fight
[1:16:33.540 --> 1:16:35.540]  That's a beautiful thing to see
[1:16:35.540 --> 1:16:39.540]  And out of this I foresee America coming together like never before
[1:16:41.540 --> 1:16:47.540]  And in the future standing against the great technocracy threat and overcoming it
[1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:51.540]  This is only the prelude to the future
[1:16:53.540 --> 1:16:55.540]  All right, I want to go to your calls, but just look at these headlines
[1:16:55.540 --> 1:17:00.540]  Young man injured by Gardasil falls lost to it against Merck as cases pile up
[1:17:00.540 --> 1:17:04.540]  But it goes to a vaccine damage fund so you can't do anything. It's just insane
[1:17:04.540 --> 1:17:06.540]  Look at this one Bloomberg
[1:17:06.540 --> 1:17:10.540]  Pays fines of 32,000 felons in Florida so they can vote
[1:17:11.540 --> 1:17:13.540]  Now again
[1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:16.540]  While at Bloomberg spend millions and millions of dollars to pay those fines
[1:17:19.540 --> 1:17:21.540]  Because Trump barely won Florida
[1:17:21.540 --> 1:17:23.540]  Because Trump barely won Florida
[1:17:25.540 --> 1:17:27.540]  Trump barely won Florida
[1:17:29.540 --> 1:17:31.540]  By a hundred thousand votes and change
[1:17:33.540 --> 1:17:35.540]  Hillary got four million five hundred and four thousand
[1:17:36.540 --> 1:17:38.540]  Trump four hundred and
[1:17:39.540 --> 1:17:42.540]  Four million Hillary at four million five hundred four thousand
[1:17:42.540 --> 1:17:45.540]  Trump got four million six hundred and seventeen thousand
[1:17:45.540 --> 1:17:48.540]  So all you gotta do is you know get a couple hundred more thousand to vote
[1:17:48.540 --> 1:17:50.540]  I think they're in it to win it
[1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:53.540]  I'm telling you man. This is such a close fight ladies and gentlemen
[1:17:55.540 --> 1:17:58.540]  But I know a lot of people that have been wrongfully convicted felons
[1:17:59.540 --> 1:18:03.540]  Mainly in Democrat jurisdictions who get what's going on they're gonna vote Trump
[1:18:03.540 --> 1:18:05.540]  Trump's the one saying
[1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:10.540]  Let nonviolent people out of prison Trump's the one trying to actually get jobs back to America
[1:18:11.540 --> 1:18:17.540]  So this cheap trick by the Democrats is just that a cheap trick. Okay. Let's go to the calls. Let's go to the calls. Let's go to the calls
[1:18:17.540 --> 1:18:20.540]  Who has been holding the longest?
[1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:26.540]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in Texas Ryan. Thanks for holding her on the air
[1:18:29.540 --> 1:18:31.540]  Hey Alex every day listener first-time caller. Thank you, sir
[1:18:33.540 --> 1:18:35.540]  Hey, so I've been following along with you
[1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:42.540]  Every day is just about and since this COVID thing started I really
[1:18:42.540 --> 1:18:49.540]  Got into what's been going on in the world and my dad got home from a business trip
[1:18:50.540 --> 1:18:54.540]  about mid-March on the East Coast and
[1:18:55.540 --> 1:19:01.540]  He right away start feeling pretty bad and went to the doctor and they said well you got blue top beat and
[1:19:02.540 --> 1:19:04.540]  Stayed at home thick just kept deteriorating
[1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:10.540]  Ended up had like a hundred and three degree fever and this is when they were just starting to do drive-thru testing
[1:19:11.540 --> 1:19:15.540]  Well, he went to try to get a drive-thru test done in our hometown and
[1:19:16.540 --> 1:19:18.540]  He didn't have a high enough fever
[1:19:18.540 --> 1:19:20.540]  apparently
[1:19:20.540 --> 1:19:21.540]  So they sent him turned him away
[1:19:22.540 --> 1:19:27.540]  And he finally went to our family position again and he said look I'm just not getting any better
[1:19:28.540 --> 1:19:32.540]  And they did a test and it turned out to be coronavirus
[1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:41.540]  And so so they said and he got he prescribed hydroxychloroquine Z-PAC and was feeling better within 24 hours
[1:19:42.540 --> 1:19:47.540]  Oh listen, that's why people that say it doesn't exist for doing a disservice. It's a real virus. It's been scanned
[1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:51.540]  And it spreads really easy. It's airborne
[1:19:51.540 --> 1:19:53.540]  Of course the UN says it's not because everything they say is a lie
[1:19:54.540 --> 1:19:58.540]  But if people just have D3 zinc and C at a high level
[1:19:58.540 --> 1:20:01.540]  Especially as you get older your guts don't absorb it as much
[1:20:02.540 --> 1:20:06.540]  But again people found out about this we're going to medical doctors and getting
[1:20:07.540 --> 1:20:15.540]  Preventative IV so I got some I mean I took this serious of of C and other things and I felt great and again
[1:20:16.540 --> 1:20:21.540]  They don't want you to know that how crazy is that so how big a wake-up call or was your dad already awake
[1:20:21.540 --> 1:20:25.540]  And how big a deal is that that your dad might have died unless the doctor actually knew what to do
[1:20:25.540 --> 1:20:32.540]  And ignored Fauci in the UN and Bill Gates and got him that hydroxychloroquine that pushes zinc into the cells
[1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:37.540]  Well like I said this was early on before hydroxychloroquine was so demonized
[1:20:38.540 --> 1:20:44.540]  And I mean the local media even did a story on him afterwards but this the craziest thing at all this is
[1:20:45.540 --> 1:20:49.540]  My mom so my dad's 65 my mom's younger than my dad
[1:20:49.540 --> 1:20:54.540]  But anyway she was quarantined in the same house this year
[1:20:55.540 --> 1:21:01.540]  Door shut for six weeks they did an antibody test after their quarantine was over
[1:21:02.540 --> 1:21:06.540]  She did not have the antibodies they did another one she did not have the antibodies
[1:21:07.540 --> 1:21:08.540]  Well you know why?
[1:21:09.540 --> 1:21:14.540]  My dad did two antibody tests spread apart about a month and he did a third one
[1:21:14.540 --> 1:21:20.540]  Because somebody in his office got COVID the antibodies were already gone within a month
[1:21:21.540 --> 1:21:25.540]  That's what's weird this thing's genetically engineered that's why it keeps coming back it doesn't produce antibodies most of the time
[1:21:26.540 --> 1:21:30.540]  And I'm no scientist I'm just saying there's a curve ball in this COVID folks I haven't figured it out yet
[1:21:31.540 --> 1:21:36.540]  But the way it's got five different viruses the way it's mutating Gates even told us he said it's going to mutate again and be even worse
[1:21:37.540 --> 1:21:39.540]  I think that's true this is just the beta test God bless you brother
[1:21:39.540 --> 1:21:43.540]  And so the bottom line is fortify your immune system and while that sun's still out
[1:21:44.540 --> 1:21:47.540]  Take your shirt off when you're mowing the yard who cares what neighbors think
[1:21:48.540 --> 1:21:51.540]  That's what I do when I'm working in the yard or something I just put on a short shorts
[1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:55.540]  You know my wife makes a joke about it and I'm out there in my tennis shoes and I mean I get the sun
[1:21:56.540 --> 1:22:02.540]  Get the sun even if you're like in the southern area of the country you can still get sun even in the deep winter
[1:22:02.540 --> 1:22:09.540]  But you know up north you've got to fortify yourselves and again D3 does not absorb well in the gut
[1:22:10.540 --> 1:22:16.540]  That's why under the tongue is the way to do it when her son and it's just the enemy like Jones is claiming he's got COVID cures
[1:22:17.540 --> 1:22:21.540]  Well, yeah, I mean if you're in the desert and you don't have water
[1:22:22.540 --> 1:22:27.540]  You will die of thirst so if somebody's like hey you better buy some canteens for you going to the desert
[1:22:27.540 --> 1:22:31.540]  It's ridiculous. I don't have a COVID cure once you've got it once you run down once you're dying
[1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:38.540]  This isn't about COVID I've been selling winter sun for six years because you need D3 in the winter and Fauci said it
[1:22:39.540 --> 1:22:45.540]  But again the mainstream murdering media is like you don't need D3
[1:22:46.540 --> 1:22:52.540]  There's scammers why the FBI rated medical doctors that are prescribing vitamin C and D3 and zinc as a preventative
[1:22:52.540 --> 1:22:56.540]  Why the UN says there's no preventative
[1:22:57.540 --> 1:23:02.540]  It's like saying food the preventative starvation water the preventative to dehydration
[1:23:05.540 --> 1:23:08.540]  I even saw an article a few years ago where the FDA was trying to tell one of them
[1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:15.540]  Was it power aid was it I forget who it was that you can't put on there on the on the bottle of
[1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:21.540]  Fights dehydration hydrate hydrate. Oh, that's medical. You can't say something medical
[1:23:22.540 --> 1:23:25.540]  You can't say Gatorade hydrates or whatever it was. This is a cult man
[1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:32.540]  Every word every language they're telling us we can't say on the entrance forms for our kids in school
[1:23:33.540 --> 1:23:35.540]  The mother and father because some people don't have mothers and fathers
[1:23:36.540 --> 1:23:40.540]  It's a cult that wants to outlaw all language except what big tech says
[1:23:40.540 --> 1:23:45.540]  You need air you need water and now Fauci has been forced to admit it
[1:23:46.540 --> 1:23:49.540]  We don't need him to tell us that. They don't even tell us we need D3 that little demon
[1:23:50.540 --> 1:23:56.540]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it
[1:23:57.540 --> 1:23:59.540]  You can with great wall of fire fireplace grates
[1:24:00.540 --> 1:24:04.540]  Our US patented made in America wall of fire grates increase fireplace efficiency

[1:24:21.540 --> 1:24:28.540]  Last week Tucker Carlson came out and said America is becoming the Soviet Union in many ways. We're worse than the Soviet Union
[1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:33.540]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do surveilling and censoring us
[1:24:34.540 --> 1:24:40.540]  And we're gonna get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to forced inoculations and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations
[1:24:41.540 --> 1:24:44.540]  Now in control of what you can and can't say online
[1:24:45.540 --> 1:24:47.540]  The truth is ladies and gentlemen America is fighting for its life
[1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:54.540]  And the enemy's number one mission is to get Trump out of office and number two is to silence info wars
[1:24:54.540 --> 1:24:59.540]  Because we understand just how pediabolical they are just how evil they are and we won't miss words
[1:25:00.540 --> 1:25:03.540]  We know who the globalist are we've got their number and we know how to beat them
[1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:09.540]  And we cover it seven days a week live at info wars and it's only because of your support

[1:25:16.540 --> 1:25:18.540]  The globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com
[1:25:18.540 --> 1:25:20.540]  And perhaps
[1:25:21.540 --> 1:25:23.540]  Most cruelly of all
[1:25:24.540 --> 1:25:27.540]  If Donald Trump has his way the complications from COVID-19
[1:25:28.540 --> 1:25:30.540]  Which are well beyond
[1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:36.540]  What they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died
[1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:39.540]  Probably by the time I finish this talk
[1:25:40.540 --> 1:25:42.540]  Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar
[1:25:43.540 --> 1:25:45.540]  Part of the establishment for close to 50 years
[1:25:45.540 --> 1:25:48.540]  But now boy as his brain degenerates
[1:25:49.540 --> 1:25:55.540]  We are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage in the world the 2020 election
[1:25:56.540 --> 1:25:58.540]  There are 370 million people in the United States
[1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:03.540]  If 200 million died from COVID that'd be more than half of the population
[1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:06.540]  When not even one tenth of one percent have actually died
[1:26:07.540 --> 1:26:13.540]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damaged statements out is emblematic of the world
[1:26:13.540 --> 1:26:19.540]  Being in a trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre
[1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:22.540]  I've got some bad news for you
[1:26:23.540 --> 1:26:25.540]  Then I've got some really bad news and then I've got some good news
[1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:33.540]  The bad news is even if Trump gets reelected they're gonna still trigger attempts at martial law medical lockdowns race riots and a depression
[1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:36.540]  That's the globalists they're trying to bring America to our knees
[1:26:37.540 --> 1:26:39.540]  Now if Trump doesn't get elected
[1:26:39.540 --> 1:26:45.540]  They're still planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression
[1:26:46.540 --> 1:26:52.540]  Total control and like Australia is already doing rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing
[1:26:53.540 --> 1:26:57.540]  That's the really bad news the good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:01.540]  And the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking
[1:27:02.540 --> 1:27:05.540]  So bottom line we're in the fight we're starting to win but it's serious
[1:27:05.540 --> 1:27:11.540]  So pray to God for a global awakening support info or spread the word and buy products at info or store calm
[1:27:12.540 --> 1:27:18.540]  Literally we're having an emergency keep info or sale happening right now. Please visit info or store and keep us on air. Thank you so much
[1:27:18.540 --> 1:27:29.540]  Your listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:27:48.540 --> 1:27:54.540]  All right, you ever griffin is gonna be on with us on the Yuri Brevenoff interview that's gone mega viral
[1:27:55.540 --> 1:28:04.540]  I was Aaron on access TV 26 27 years ago, but it's it's back and it's in top video games and in movies and people watch it and go
[1:28:05.540 --> 1:28:08.540]  My god, everything this guy said is coming true, but it's not Russian
[1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:15.540]  The globalists went and took over Russia and set all this up and then use them and that's actually what he gets into
[1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:20.540]  So there's a there's a bigger picture and she ever griffin is the leading intellectual
[1:28:21.540 --> 1:28:23.540]  Mac daddy original gangster
[1:28:24.540 --> 1:28:27.540]  When it comes to the Liberty movement that he's the og
[1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:33.540]  Okay, he's joining us next hour. All right, I just spent five minutes with one caller incredible caller incredible story
[1:28:34.540 --> 1:28:36.540]  But I won't get to you all so we got to do two minutes of caller here
[1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:41.540]  Let's go to Matt in Nebraska Matt. Thanks for calling go ahead
[1:28:41.540 --> 1:28:48.540]  Hey, what's going on Alex man? I'll tell you I'm a I'm in suspense every day like I'm watching a Super Bowl game
[1:28:49.540 --> 1:28:51.540]  Yeah, I mean, it's like this is crazy
[1:28:52.540 --> 1:28:54.540]  Think of 300 million people are right there with you
[1:28:55.540 --> 1:29:01.540]  Hey, um, Governor Rick, it's just that he will not mandate a COVID-19 vaccine
[1:29:02.540 --> 1:29:06.540]  He'll leave it up to the Nebraska citizens. He said that today that is a good I didn't know that that's a good precedent
[1:29:06.540 --> 1:29:11.540]  Federal judge ruled that Pennsylvania Governor Wolf is a criminal and then his whole lockdowns illegal
[1:29:12.540 --> 1:29:18.540]  So we've got those rights and we need again what they use what the globalists say they'll use corporations and then localities
[1:29:19.540 --> 1:29:21.540]  They control to override central governments and governors
[1:29:22.540 --> 1:29:28.540]  Well, we need governors to then go after the cities that keep the lockdown going and after the corporations that keep it going
[1:29:29.540 --> 1:29:33.540]  Because remember that's why Amazon's doubled its profits since they started shutting down Main Street
[1:29:33.540 --> 1:29:37.540]  So this is economic warfare brother up against you're saying the governor of Nebraska just did this
[1:29:38.540 --> 1:29:45.540]  Yeah, he said that this morning in his weekly press conference. He said he will not mandate any COVID-19 vaccine by when it comes out
[1:29:46.540 --> 1:29:50.540]  Beautiful so Nebraska governor will not mandate COVID-19 vaccine. That's beautiful. That's wonderful
[1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:55.540]  It should be first it should be if anybody Google this should be like in the first headline so
[1:29:56.540 --> 1:29:58.540]  Well, that is certainly some good news any other good news my friend
[1:29:58.540 --> 1:30:02.540]  No, but I noticed listening to the Omaha Z92 radio station
[1:30:03.540 --> 1:30:10.540]  They were saying that if you get a call from an unknown number there saying that you have been caught you have been in contact with a
[1:30:11.540 --> 1:30:16.540]  COVID-19 person so now there's I don't know how they get there so they're doing contract tracing in Omaha
[1:30:17.540 --> 1:30:21.540]  Oh sir, this is all a systematic you in plan beta tested in
[1:30:21.540 --> 1:30:26.540]  Australia and in Spain and then now they're phasing it in here everything they did there
[1:30:27.540 --> 1:30:33.540]  We already could tell that was happening is that you and said they would but CNN now officially said we're gonna be like Australia by next year
[1:30:34.540 --> 1:30:38.540]  You believe that and if Joe Biden gets in man, they are gonna clamp down forever brother
[1:30:39.540 --> 1:30:42.540]  Thing they're gonna try to push it even if Trump does get reelected
[1:30:43.540 --> 1:30:46.540]  So I mean it's just gonna be crazy and people get pissed at Trump and they go well he should stop that
[1:30:46.540 --> 1:30:54.540]  He ordered he ordered the federal government not to teach that white people are racist 13 week class and the federal agencies literally told him burn in hell
[1:30:55.540 --> 1:30:57.540]  They just do whatever they want brother
[1:30:58.540 --> 1:31:02.540]  So mad at him because they gave he gave the power to the governor to order lockdowns on
[1:31:03.540 --> 1:31:06.540]  COVID-19 and he didn't do he never said anything about locking down
[1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:09.540]  He just gave all power to the governor's
[1:31:09.540 --> 1:31:12.540]  Well, that's because it's the Constitution and he's following it
[1:31:12.540 --> 1:31:19.540]  Constitution but when the governors violate the Constitution the federal government supposed to kick in if the federal government if Biden gets in and is doing tyrannical
[1:31:20.540 --> 1:31:25.540]  Unconstitutional stuff. It's the state's job to organize and say no well instead the states are doing bad stuff
[1:31:26.540 --> 1:31:29.540]  That's how the federalist system works when they violate the Constitution the feds come in
[1:31:30.540 --> 1:31:32.540]  When the feds violate we stand up see how that works
[1:31:33.540 --> 1:31:36.540]  Now wasn't it Obama that said there's no tyranny going on
[1:31:37.540 --> 1:31:38.540]  Oh
[1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:42.540]  We ought to play that speech. It was like a West Point commencement speech
[1:31:43.540 --> 1:31:48.540]  And he said don't believe people there's a new world order and that tyranny's coming and that there's going to be martial law and a lockdown
[1:31:49.540 --> 1:31:53.540]  I'm glad you mentioned that guys fine asked Rob do he's good at finding stuff
[1:31:55.540 --> 1:31:59.540]  Obama says in speech there is no tyranny God bless you sir great points Matt
[1:32:00.540 --> 1:32:02.540]  And I'm glad you called in to let us know about
[1:32:03.540 --> 1:32:05.540]  Nebraska did you guys find anything else
[1:32:05.540 --> 1:32:07.540]  I don't know about
[1:32:08.540 --> 1:32:11.540]  Nebraska did you guys finding articles on that I'm sure he's right but
[1:32:12.540 --> 1:32:17.540]  Nebraska governor but you know every time we put out some good news Google blocks it
[1:32:18.540 --> 1:32:25.540]  So I wouldn't be surprised if there it is governor Ricketts Nebraska will encourage government 19 vaccines but will not mandate them
[1:32:27.540 --> 1:32:30.540]  That's the media spin on it but that means they're not going to try to make it forced
[1:32:30.540 --> 1:32:34.540]  Which it still is recommended by the governor that kicks in the health department to make it a list of recommended
[1:32:35.540 --> 1:32:39.540]  Doesn't still mean you have to do it even if he quote mandates it but they use that color along
[1:32:43.540 --> 1:32:45.540]  Joey in Miami you're on the air welcome
[1:32:52.540 --> 1:32:56.540]  I guess he just hung up. All right Casey in North Dakota. Thanks for holding go ahead Casey
[1:32:56.540 --> 1:32:58.540]  Well sensei
[1:32:58.540 --> 1:33:00.540]  Welcome my friend go ahead
[1:33:01.540 --> 1:33:06.540]  Yes, sir. Well, I just want to send a little message to the New World Order
[1:33:06.540 --> 1:33:12.540]  We just thought that we know one way or the other no matter how this election turns out
[1:33:13.540 --> 1:33:15.540]  No quarter is going to be given
[1:33:15.540 --> 1:33:18.540]  It's on like Donkey Kong and we're ready
[1:33:19.540 --> 1:33:22.540]  We're ready to ram head wherever beachhead may be
[1:33:22.540 --> 1:33:25.540]  It's in Texas, Illinois, Minnesota
[1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:30.540]  Whenever we need to be there we're gonna be there and hopefully the military can take care of it themselves and
[1:33:30.540 --> 1:33:32.540]  We don't need to get the citizens involved
[1:33:32.540 --> 1:33:38.540]  But we're ready to roll when we need to and this isn't a threat. We love the military. There's more of us people but
[1:33:38.540 --> 1:33:43.540]  If the globalist could control the military and come against us the military better decide which side they're on
[1:33:44.540 --> 1:33:46.540]  Absolutely and we know that
[1:33:46.540 --> 1:33:53.540]  Through everything that they've done that no quarter is going to be given to us. Well, no quarter will be given to them at all
[1:33:53.540 --> 1:34:00.540]  And I just want to send a lot of love and prayers to you the informers team the president in this whole country
[1:34:00.540 --> 1:34:07.540]  Now's the time people get it together because 40 days out. It's coming to a head
[1:34:09.540 --> 1:34:14.540]  I agree with your brother and it's like Carlos Zapata said he doesn't want to walk away
[1:34:14.540 --> 1:34:19.540]  Carlos Zapata said he doesn't want to war but we're under attack and if they keep pushing there's millions of us
[1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:23.540]  And we will not fail. We will win. We have the power. We don't want the power
[1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:27.540]  But to all these dirty communists and people you guys are really asking for it
[1:34:27.540 --> 1:34:34.540]  And so once once once once it's go time once once we decide that we can't fix this peacefully there's there's no stopping
[1:34:36.540 --> 1:34:42.540]  Absolutely, there's a great Garth Brooks song. It's an old one off his first album not to plug Garth Brooks. It's okay
[1:34:42.540 --> 1:34:44.540]  I like Garth Brooks
[1:34:44.540 --> 1:34:47.540]  Yes, sir. It's called against the grain. It's off his first album there
[1:34:47.540 --> 1:34:52.540]  That is info wars and you to a T and the rest of the Patriots out there. Check it out sometime when you got time out
[1:34:52.540 --> 1:34:55.540]  Alright, God bless you Casey. Let's jam another call before we got a break
[1:34:55.540 --> 1:35:00.540]  Who's been holding longest here Travis? Is it D? Is it Rockwave?
[1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:06.540]  It'd be Rockwave then we'll go to Kevin Rockwave in the great state of Texas
[1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:12.540]  Still still Texas not for long though folks don't understand up and speak out Rockwave go ahead
[1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:18.540]  Bless you. We pray for you every day. We really appreciate everything you're doing all of your products are top notch
[1:35:18.540 --> 1:35:23.540]  Let me just say this Rockwave was I mean it without your prayer. I'd be destroyed. You are literally holding me up now
[1:35:23.540 --> 1:35:25.540]  So thank you
[1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:30.540]  Absolutely. We're everyday listeners and I've we just moved here from California
[1:35:30.540 --> 1:35:33.540]  We we got out of the exodus with all the fires surrounding us
[1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:36.540]  All the ridiculous mandates that the governor has and
[1:35:37.540 --> 1:35:41.540]  We finally we we got the Texas and we've been street teaming for info wars getting
[1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:48.540]  Getting the stickers up banned out video stickers up and we printed up our own business cards with the links on there
[1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:54.540]  And doing a lot of face-to-face contact with people just talking to people all about how you how you
[1:35:55.540 --> 1:36:01.540]  Approach them all the delivery and people are very receptive. We're really excited new information is getting out there now
[1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:03.540]  Well, I love you brother keep it up
[1:36:03.540 --> 1:36:08.540]  And we'll we'll definitely continue to work with everybody out there like you and we love you and we understand that your
[1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:11.540]  Spirit is leading you to do this and we love you and we appreciate you as well
[1:36:12.540 --> 1:36:18.540]  You know when I said I couldn't be on air but wasn't for your prayers. I'm serious folks because I'm I'm strong
[1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:20.540]  I'll never give up
[1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:25.540]  I'll never give in but I can give out and I literally when these horrible things happen to me behind the scenes
[1:36:25.540 --> 1:36:27.540]  Which I don't even feel sorry for me. I asked for all this
[1:36:27.540 --> 1:36:33.540]  I want to say it's God's spirit and your prayers calling for that because God it's it's an energy God faces that you are
[1:36:33.540 --> 1:36:38.540]  Literally holding me up because now I just get hit by absolutely horrible stuff on a routine basis
[1:36:38.540 --> 1:36:42.540]  And I just like and it's like I feel myself being weak. It's just like
[1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:45.540]  I certainly in the back this thing goes
[1:36:46.540 --> 1:36:47.540]  And I
[1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:52.540]  In fact the worst it is now and I mean this is the real spiritual thing. It's like now. It's like
[1:36:52.540 --> 1:36:57.540]  My understanding my discernment. I know yours as well, but it's like when you guys are praying for me
[1:36:58.540 --> 1:37:01.540]  I literally it's like space warp like like light speed
[1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:04.540]  It's like whoa
[1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:09.540]  This is a lot better than being on my knees with the devil strangling me is to have you
[1:37:10.540 --> 1:37:12.540]  Turn that Holy Spirit loose with your prayers man
[1:37:12.540 --> 1:37:16.540]  It's like getting like a car going from zero to two hundred and a second. It's like
[1:37:17.540 --> 1:37:19.540]  Whoa, I've come to you many times
[1:37:19.540 --> 1:37:24.540]  And ask for your support and you've always come through and info wars has come through
[1:37:24.540 --> 1:37:29.540]  We've never sold out. We've never backed down. We've always told the truth. We've made mistakes
[1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:36.540]  But 98% of the time or so we're dead on and the enemy knows that info wars is a thought leader
[1:37:37.540 --> 1:37:43.540]  Not just here but around the world and that's why the chai comms Hollywood the globalist won us off the air
[1:37:43.540 --> 1:37:49.540]  Because their global plan of total tyranny and a post human world will not succeed if we stay on air
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:51.540]  If you don't support us ladies and gentlemen now
[1:37:51.540 --> 1:37:57.540]  They're going to shut info wars down and shut everybody else down as well. You already know that it's out the open
[1:37:57.540 --> 1:37:59.540]  So again count the cost
[1:37:59.540 --> 1:38:04.540]  Focus and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors
[1:38:04.540 --> 1:38:10.540]  Your financial support getting the products at infowarstore.com and your prayer. I'm praying for you
[1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:15.540]  Please pray for us. Let's do this together. We're going to win. We are winning, but it's not going to be easy
[1:38:15.540 --> 1:38:18.540]  The enemy is trying to take it all from us. Let's not let them succeed
[1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:25.540]  Servants of Satan are working around the clock to silence people of not just the United States but of the world
[1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:29.540]  Because there is a great awakening taking place. Everyone I talk to everywhere I go
[1:38:29.540 --> 1:38:35.540]  People that weren't even religious or spiritual now understand this is a fight between good and evil
[1:38:35.540 --> 1:38:42.540]  And they're finding Christ and they're finding the prophecies that aren't like Nostradamus they but are very very detailed
[1:38:42.540 --> 1:38:48.540]  Extremely specific that are now coming true at a frightening rate
[1:38:48.540 --> 1:38:56.540]  Frightening because so many people are still living under the control of the god of this world Satan did not realize that their
[1:38:56.540 --> 1:38:59.540]  Immortal souls are in grave danger
[1:38:59.540 --> 1:39:06.540]  Do not fear he who can kill the body fear he who can kill the soul as the good book warns us
[1:39:06.540 --> 1:39:10.540]  I'm Alex Jones and I'm very honored to be on air still during this time
[1:39:10.540 --> 1:39:12.540]  Every day we're still on air as a blessing
[1:39:12.540 --> 1:39:16.540]  So please pray for info wars, pray for yourself, pray for the children, pray for the world
[1:39:16.540 --> 1:39:17.540]  God bless you all
[1:39:18.540 --> 1:39:20.540]  Dependency
[1:39:20.540 --> 1:39:22.540]  Domestication
[1:39:22.540 --> 1:39:24.540]  In the real world
[1:39:24.540 --> 1:39:26.540]  Ignorance is not blessed
[1:39:26.540 --> 1:39:29.540]  It's enslavement and it's death
[1:39:29.540 --> 1:39:32.540]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential
[1:39:32.540 --> 1:39:36.540]  With automation they're bringing in a world that doesn't power humanity
[1:39:36.540 --> 1:39:37.540]  But makes us obsolete
[1:39:37.540 --> 1:39:38.540]  But we're not obsolete
[1:39:38.540 --> 1:39:40.540]  We don't have to listen to them
[1:39:40.540 --> 1:39:41.540]  We can farm again
[1:39:41.540 --> 1:39:42.540]  We can garden
[1:39:42.540 --> 1:39:43.540]  We can become self-sufficient
[1:39:43.540 --> 1:39:47.540]  But first we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves
[1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:49.540]  And we need to become self-sufficient
[1:39:49.540 --> 1:39:52.540]  That begins with water filtration
[1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:56.540]  To take control of that from the globalists and their fluoride and their dumbing down agenda
[1:39:56.540 --> 1:39:57.540]  And with storeable food
[1:39:57.540 --> 1:40:00.540]  And we have it all the highest quality, the highest rated
[1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:01.540]  At the lowest prices
[1:40:01.540 --> 1:40:03.540]  At m4warstore.com
[1:40:03.540 --> 1:40:05.540]  Take action now
[1:40:05.540 --> 1:40:07.540]  You cannot lose unless you do not take action
[1:40:07.540 --> 1:40:09.540]  We have the best water filtration
[1:40:09.540 --> 1:40:10.540]  The best storeable food
[1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:12.540]  And it funds the info war
[1:40:12.540 --> 1:40:14.540]  Take action now while you still can
[1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:15.540]  Become prepared
[1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:17.540]  Become self-sufficient now
[1:40:17.540 --> 1:40:22.540]  At m4warstore.com
[1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:49.540]  You can see the world
[1:40:49.540 --> 1:40:51.540]  And track and control every aspect of our lives
[1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:54.540]  Literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward
[1:40:54.540 --> 1:40:57.540]  Because they do not want us to take our birthright
[1:40:57.540 --> 1:40:59.540]  Not just of Americana
[1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:02.540]  But of true Christendom and the Renaissance
[1:41:02.540 --> 1:41:03.540]  And the Enlightenment
[1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:06.540]  They are trying to create the new Dark Age
[1:41:06.540 --> 1:41:08.540]  Where they have all the high technology and life extension
[1:41:08.540 --> 1:41:11.540]  And we are walled off in a technocracy
[1:41:11.540 --> 1:41:13.540]  That controls us through carbon credits
[1:41:13.540 --> 1:41:15.540]  And through a social credit score
[1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:16.540]  This is their plan
[1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:19.540]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance
[1:41:19.540 --> 1:41:20.540]  And say no
[1:41:20.540 --> 1:41:49.540]  We must embrace God
[1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:53.540]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide
[1:41:53.540 --> 1:41:56.540]  The American system that threatens the tyrants
[1:41:56.540 --> 1:41:58.540]  The wild, wild west of freedom
[1:41:58.540 --> 1:42:03.540]  Versus the nightmare of North Korean chai-com tyranny
[1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:07.540]  G. Ebert Gribbon is going to be joining us coming up
[1:42:07.540 --> 1:42:10.540]  The granddaddy of Resisting the New World Order
[1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:12.540]  We're taking your phone calls right now
[1:42:12.540 --> 1:42:14.540]  I'm not going to belabor this
[1:42:14.540 --> 1:42:16.540]  But it was a very successful campaign
[1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:18.540]  So thank you all for supporting the broadcast
[1:42:18.540 --> 1:42:20.540]  And doing common sense things
[1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:21.540]  In the highest quality storeable foods
[1:42:21.540 --> 1:42:23.540]  The lowest price you're going to find for quality
[1:42:23.540 --> 1:42:25.540]  At PrepareWithAlex.com
[1:42:25.540 --> 1:42:28.540]  And so the week-long special
[1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:30.540]  Or I guess five-day special
[1:42:30.540 --> 1:42:31.540]  Ended
[1:42:31.540 --> 1:42:32.540]  And I called them up last night
[1:42:32.540 --> 1:42:33.540]  And called them up this morning
[1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:34.540]  And they said, okay
[1:42:34.540 --> 1:42:37.540]  We'll extend it for another five days or so
[1:42:37.540 --> 1:42:39.540]  But we really can't do that
[1:42:39.540 --> 1:42:42.540]  Because a lot of our other distributors
[1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:44.540]  People that buy from us are upset
[1:42:44.540 --> 1:42:46.540]  That we have this one low price
[1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:48.540]  And that we're doing this special for you
[1:42:48.540 --> 1:42:50.540]  That's $170 off one food package
[1:42:50.540 --> 1:42:53.540]  And $100 off a water filtration package
[1:42:53.540 --> 1:42:55.540]  And these are the smaller packages
[1:42:55.540 --> 1:42:56.540]  But they're still really good deals
[1:42:56.540 --> 1:42:59.540]  They said, we'll extend it one more week
[1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:01.540]  And I said, well, how about a new special then
[1:43:01.540 --> 1:43:03.540]  How about a discount on your big food supplies
[1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:04.540]  Or something
[1:43:04.540 --> 1:43:05.540]  So we're talking about that right now
[1:43:05.540 --> 1:43:06.540]  But whatever you do
[1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:09.540]  There's only a one to two-week delay in shipping
[1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:11.540]  It's really like a week delay
[1:43:11.540 --> 1:43:12.540]  But they just don't want me to say that
[1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:14.540]  Because they want you to under promise
[1:43:14.540 --> 1:43:16.540]  Over deliver is the rule
[1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:17.540]  But prepare with Alex.com
[1:43:17.540 --> 1:43:19.540]  High-quality swarble food
[1:43:19.540 --> 1:43:22.540]  The lowest price you're going to find for food this good
[1:43:22.540 --> 1:43:24.540]  And the percentage we make off of it
[1:43:24.540 --> 1:43:26.540]  Is key to keeping the lights on here
[1:43:26.540 --> 1:43:28.540]  So you couldn't buy higher-quality food
[1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:30.540]  At a lower price that then actually funds
[1:43:30.540 --> 1:43:32.540]  An operation like this
[1:43:32.540 --> 1:43:33.540]  You couldn't find food at this price
[1:43:33.540 --> 1:43:36.540]  At this quality that doesn't fund an operation like this
[1:43:36.540 --> 1:43:38.540]  This is the unicorn
[1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:40.540]  This is the zeitgeist
[1:43:40.540 --> 1:43:42.540]  This is the best deal
[1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:44.540]  The full list of their larger supplies
[1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:46.540]  And their smaller supplies
[1:43:46.540 --> 1:43:47.540]  Is at infowarstore.com
[1:43:47.540 --> 1:43:49.540]  They're in our back end
[1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:50.540]  It's a mirror of what they've got
[1:43:50.540 --> 1:43:51.540]  Exact same prices
[1:43:51.540 --> 1:43:53.540]  You go in the exact same queue
[1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:54.540]  When you order at infowarstore.com
[1:43:54.540 --> 1:43:56.540]  Though it funds our operation
[1:43:56.540 --> 1:43:58.540]  But they have this special
[1:43:58.540 --> 1:43:59.540]  At preparewithalex.com
[1:43:59.540 --> 1:44:01.540]  Because I haven't gotten into this
[1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:02.540]  For obvious reasons
[1:44:02.540 --> 1:44:04.540]  For those that work in business and life
[1:44:04.540 --> 1:44:08.540]  But now that we have secured backups
[1:44:08.540 --> 1:44:10.540]  I'm getting ready to tell people about it very soon
[1:44:10.540 --> 1:44:11.540]  But they took all our bank accounts away
[1:44:11.540 --> 1:44:13.540]  They took our shopping carts away
[1:44:13.540 --> 1:44:15.540]  And our merchant accounts
[1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:16.540]  And luckily I had backups
[1:44:16.540 --> 1:44:18.540]  We had to go to those and scramble
[1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:20.540]  And they are harassing people
[1:44:20.540 --> 1:44:21.540]  They are terrorizing us
[1:44:21.540 --> 1:44:22.540]  They're not just doing it to us
[1:44:22.540 --> 1:44:25.540]  The NRA gun shops all over
[1:44:25.540 --> 1:44:27.540]  Can't get credit card processing
[1:44:27.540 --> 1:44:28.540]  I mean, this is tyranny
[1:44:28.540 --> 1:44:31.540]  And so I may have product on the shelves
[1:44:31.540 --> 1:44:33.540]  If I can't process it and take your money
[1:44:33.540 --> 1:44:34.540]  I gotta shut down
[1:44:34.540 --> 1:44:36.540]  So I went and did all the accounting
[1:44:36.540 --> 1:44:37.540]  And I already mortgaged my house
[1:44:37.540 --> 1:44:40.540]  And all of them only fund this place a few months
[1:44:40.540 --> 1:44:42.540]  And so that's why I'm like
[1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:45.540]  Okay, we're selling everything out
[1:44:45.540 --> 1:44:47.540]  And I just haven't gotten up to the point
[1:44:47.540 --> 1:44:48.540]  Of coming out and saying it
[1:44:48.540 --> 1:44:49.540]  I just did
[1:44:49.540 --> 1:44:50.540]  So the special's called
[1:44:50.540 --> 1:44:51.540]  What's the special called right now?
[1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:52.540]  I came up with the name
[1:44:52.540 --> 1:44:54.540]  I should remember it
[1:44:54.540 --> 1:44:56.540]  I mean, that's just how crazy all this has gotten
[1:44:56.540 --> 1:45:00.540]  What's it called?
[1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:02.540]  Info wars emergency election sale
[1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:03.540]  Total blowout
[1:45:03.540 --> 1:45:05.540]  But what it really is
[1:45:05.540 --> 1:45:07.540]  If you want to get t-shirts, books, films
[1:45:07.540 --> 1:45:08.540]  And fund us in the future
[1:45:08.540 --> 1:45:10.540]  We might not be able to sell you stuff soon
[1:45:10.540 --> 1:45:11.540]  Because let me tell you
[1:45:11.540 --> 1:45:13.540]  This is deep state stuff, folks
[1:45:13.540 --> 1:45:14.540]  Your orders are all secure
[1:45:14.540 --> 1:45:16.540]  We've got the product ready to ship it to you
[1:45:16.540 --> 1:45:19.540]  But the 20 different types of hack attacks a day
[1:45:19.540 --> 1:45:22.540]  And the CNN with drones above the building
[1:45:22.540 --> 1:45:24.540]  And cars following us around
[1:45:24.540 --> 1:45:25.540]  And death-threading everyone
[1:45:25.540 --> 1:45:27.540]  And offering people money to lie about us
[1:45:27.540 --> 1:45:29.540]  And the FBI control of the Democrats following us
[1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:31.540]  I mean, it's a war
[1:45:31.540 --> 1:45:33.540]  And they're doing all this to Trump, too
[1:45:33.540 --> 1:45:34.540]  I'm not up here whining
[1:45:34.540 --> 1:45:35.540]  I'm just saying we're in a war, baby
[1:45:35.540 --> 1:45:37.540]  The average person in the middle of this said
[1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:39.540]  No, it's incredible
[1:45:39.540 --> 1:45:41.540]  What's going on?
[1:45:41.540 --> 1:45:42.540]  So now I'm ranting and I'm going to stop
[1:45:42.540 --> 1:45:45.540]  I'm going to stop right now and go to your calls
[1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:47.540]  Just if you ever wanted that info or t-shirt
[1:45:47.540 --> 1:45:48.540]  Ever wanted that book or film
[1:45:48.540 --> 1:45:49.540]  If you ever wanted to get those supplements
[1:45:49.540 --> 1:45:51.540]  I would get them now
[1:45:51.540 --> 1:45:53.540]  Because I was in an hour-long meeting this morning
[1:45:53.540 --> 1:45:56.540]  Just deciding if I'm going to reorder a lot of products
[1:45:56.540 --> 1:45:58.540]  And spend money we've got to then get something
[1:45:58.540 --> 1:46:00.540]  In six, eight weeks, even, I mean
[1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:02.540]  We're down to that level
[1:46:02.540 --> 1:46:05.540]  Like a farmer goes, do I take the money we've got
[1:46:05.540 --> 1:46:08.540]  And buy seed money for next year or do I sell the farm?
[1:46:08.540 --> 1:46:09.540]  Well, I'm not selling the farm, folks
[1:46:09.540 --> 1:46:12.540]  It's just that
[1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:14.540]  It won't matter if the farm goes under
[1:46:14.540 --> 1:46:15.540]  It's like you don't sell it
[1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:16.540]  Well, then it just goes under
[1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:17.540]  You know what I mean?
[1:46:17.540 --> 1:46:19.540]  You get to that point where you got to make a decision
[1:46:19.540 --> 1:46:21.540]  And I'll still be on air and still do a show
[1:46:21.540 --> 1:46:22.540]  I just love a website
[1:46:22.540 --> 1:46:24.540]  It's just the reporters and the crew and the bandwidth
[1:46:24.540 --> 1:46:26.540]  And the satellite uplinks and all this stuff I do
[1:46:26.540 --> 1:46:28.540]  That cost millions and millions of dollars
[1:46:28.540 --> 1:46:31.540]  We can't do it like that if you don't support us
[1:46:31.540 --> 1:46:33.540]  So I love you, we're not going under
[1:46:33.540 --> 1:46:35.540]  We can go another six, seven months
[1:46:35.540 --> 1:46:37.540]  It's just that because we're selling everything out
[1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:39.540]  And not buying more of it
[1:46:39.540 --> 1:46:40.540]  You got that?
[1:46:40.540 --> 1:46:41.540]  That's where we're at right now
[1:46:41.540 --> 1:46:43.540]  I need more money to order more product
[1:46:43.540 --> 1:46:44.540]  To go into the future
[1:46:44.540 --> 1:46:46.540]  In fact, God, I'm always so long-winded
[1:46:46.540 --> 1:46:49.540]  Because I just look into my mind and just say what I'm seeing
[1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:53.540]  This is the simple 32nd that I'll go to your calls
[1:46:53.540 --> 1:46:55.540]  Going forward into the future
[1:46:55.540 --> 1:46:57.540]  We have some financing issues
[1:46:57.540 --> 1:46:59.540]  And we're living off product that we're selling now
[1:46:59.540 --> 1:47:00.540]  But not reordering
[1:47:00.540 --> 1:47:03.540]  And that's not a good position to be in
[1:47:03.540 --> 1:47:04.540]  For continued resistance
[1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:08.540]  So please step up and buy the products
[1:47:08.540 --> 1:47:11.540]  So that we can buy products into the future
[1:47:11.540 --> 1:47:15.540]  And my own brain goes and then don't sell it at 50%, 60% off Jones
[1:47:15.540 --> 1:47:16.540]  That doesn't make much money
[1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:17.540]  Well, you only buy it when it's at that
[1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:19.540]  So I put myself in this position
[1:47:19.540 --> 1:47:21.540]  And it's just all up to God what's going to happen
[1:47:21.540 --> 1:47:24.540]  You can also go to infoworkstore.com in the support area
[1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:27.540]  You can click on that and make a pure donation
[1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:29.540]  After credit card fees and stuff
[1:47:29.540 --> 1:47:31.540]  We make 95% of it
[1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:34.540]  Not 30%, 40% like on the products
[1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:36.540]  And then that's pure money to keep this going
[1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:38.540]  And do what we're doing, folks
[1:47:38.540 --> 1:47:40.540]  And believe me, we're not just talking to you
[1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:42.540]  And you're important
[1:47:42.540 --> 1:47:47.540]  We are reaching out to the world
[1:47:47.540 --> 1:47:49.540]  And creating countervailing talking points
[1:47:49.540 --> 1:47:51.540]  The New World Order that are amazing
[1:47:51.540 --> 1:47:52.540]  All right, nothing about us
[1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:54.540]  I've gone ahead and said it
[1:47:54.540 --> 1:47:55.540]  That's what's going on
[1:47:55.540 --> 1:47:56.540]  That's what's happening
[1:47:56.540 --> 1:48:00.540]  And I didn't want to announce what was going on until we had backups
[1:48:00.540 --> 1:48:02.540]  But then they can take those away
[1:48:02.540 --> 1:48:03.540]  And then they know what to go after
[1:48:03.540 --> 1:48:05.540]  But at some point I got to tell you
[1:48:05.540 --> 1:48:07.540]  So I did it and that's it
[1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:10.540]  I'm not one for keeping stuff secret
[1:48:10.540 --> 1:48:14.540]  Mike, Henry, Travis, Jim, Joshua, Kevin
[1:48:14.540 --> 1:48:16.540]  Who's been holding longest here
[1:48:20.540 --> 1:48:22.540]  Yes, that'd be Kevin in Canada
[1:48:22.540 --> 1:48:24.540]  Go ahead, Kevin, thanks for calling
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:26.540]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:28.540]  In the middle of the Second American Revolution, baby
[1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:29.540]  This is it
[1:48:29.540 --> 1:48:30.540]  Yeah, baby
[1:48:38.540 --> 1:48:39.540]  You're crying
[1:48:41.540 --> 1:48:43.540]  I just do that because it makes me feel good
[1:48:43.540 --> 1:48:45.540]  Like, I just want George Soros to know
[1:48:49.540 --> 1:48:52.540]  Oh, boy, I'm calling from behind enemy lines
[1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:55.540]  In Alberta, Canada, globalist control
[1:48:55.540 --> 1:48:57.540]  And I'm calling in today because of the flu shots
[1:48:57.540 --> 1:48:59.540]  The media is pushing right now
[1:48:59.540 --> 1:49:01.540]  And I saw a video yesterday on the show
[1:49:01.540 --> 1:49:04.540]  If I were the devil, you know, what would I do?
[1:49:04.540 --> 1:49:06.540]  And if I were the devil or the globalist
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:07.540]  What would I do?
[1:49:07.540 --> 1:49:09.540]  Well, I push a flu shot this season
[1:49:09.540 --> 1:49:12.540]  To scare everybody into submission to getting a flu shot
[1:49:12.540 --> 1:49:14.540]  Because a lot of people are woken up now
[1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:16.540]  About COVID-19 and rushed vaccines
[1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:18.540]  So I think this, that would be my play
[1:49:18.540 --> 1:49:21.540]  If I were a globalist would be to push a flu shot
[1:49:21.540 --> 1:49:22.540]  Push it on the public
[1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:25.540]  And they'd, oh, well, you know, got to get that flu shot
[1:49:25.540 --> 1:49:27.540]  You know, stay safe
[1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:30.540]  Well, that's a good point because it's not hard to predict
[1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:32.540]  This is like, you know, three comes after two
[1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:34.540]  And four comes after three
[1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:37.540]  That they go because if the flu really does kill a bunch of people
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:39.540]  And they've made us run around in fear over COVID
[1:49:39.540 --> 1:49:40.540]  That kills much less
[1:49:40.540 --> 1:49:42.540]  Now they're like, oh, we need lockdowns for the flu
[1:49:42.540 --> 1:49:44.540]  They're now saying that, brother
[1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:45.540]  That's right, that's right
[1:49:45.540 --> 1:49:48.540]  And also in Canada now they're really pushing the pharmacies
[1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:49.540]  To do in-house testing
[1:49:49.540 --> 1:49:52.540]  So you're going to see a massive spike in cases
[1:49:52.540 --> 1:49:53.540]  Not death, of course
[1:49:53.540 --> 1:49:55.540]  I mean, it's all, you know, so
[1:49:55.540 --> 1:49:57.540]  They don't admit 90% of the tests are fake
[1:49:57.540 --> 1:49:58.540]  Oh, it's total crap
[1:49:58.540 --> 1:49:59.540]  Yep, thanks Alex
[1:49:59.540 --> 1:50:00.540]  Love what you do
[1:50:00.540 --> 1:50:02.540]  Buy some vitamin fusion guys
[1:50:02.540 --> 1:50:03.540]  It's the best stuff on a product
[1:50:03.540 --> 1:50:04.540]  God bless you
[1:50:04.540 --> 1:50:05.540]  I hate coming to you guys for help
[1:50:05.540 --> 1:50:08.540]  You just, most people are financed with banker money
[1:50:08.540 --> 1:50:10.540]  Fiat garbage, unlimited cash
[1:50:10.540 --> 1:50:12.540]  We're not, we're financed by you
[1:50:12.540 --> 1:50:13.540]  So I just appreciate you all
[1:50:13.540 --> 1:50:15.540]  I hate coming to you and begging for support
[1:50:15.540 --> 1:50:16.540]  Half of me wants to get shut down
[1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:17.540]  And I'll just do this anymore
[1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:19.540]  But then I got to watch the contact tracers
[1:50:19.540 --> 1:50:20.540]  Come to my house
[1:50:20.540 --> 1:50:21.540]  You want to mean like snap
[1:50:21.540 --> 1:50:22.540]  You're inside the bear trap
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:23.540]  You want to mean like
[1:50:23.540 --> 1:50:25.540]  We're not getting out of this lot of fight, folks
[1:50:25.540 --> 1:50:26.540]  Let's go to another caller
[1:50:26.540 --> 1:50:28.540]  Real quick, the men at the half rehab
[1:50:28.540 --> 1:50:30.540]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller in Canada
[1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:33.540]  Mike in Canada, go ahead
[1:50:33.540 --> 1:50:35.540]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[1:50:35.540 --> 1:50:36.540]  Yes sir, go ahead
[1:50:36.540 --> 1:50:38.540]  Yeah, first time caller, long time listener
[1:50:38.540 --> 1:50:41.540]  I'm calling important, but an important topic
[1:50:41.540 --> 1:50:44.540]  It's the Alberta Public Health Act
[1:50:44.540 --> 1:50:47.540]  That was passed in July of 2020 of this year
[1:50:47.540 --> 1:50:50.540]  The plan entails a forceful detainment
[1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:53.540]  And isolation of Canadian citizens
[1:50:53.540 --> 1:50:58.540]  Section 30 entails a plan for entry of examination
[1:50:58.540 --> 1:51:01.540]  That states where a medical officer of health knows
[1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:04.540]  Or has reason to believe that a person is suffering
[1:51:04.540 --> 1:51:07.540]  From a communicable disease referred to in section 20
[1:51:07.540 --> 1:51:11.540]  May be found in a place or that a place may be contaminated
[1:51:11.540 --> 1:51:14.540]  Henry, I'm going to hold you over then we'll go to Henry
[1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:16.540]  But let me explain something
[1:51:16.540 --> 1:51:18.540]  I don't know if you saw us like last week
[1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:22.540]  We played the clip of the Quebec City guy drooling
[1:51:22.540 --> 1:51:24.540]  How they're bringing you in control
[1:51:24.540 --> 1:51:26.540]  To come in your houses door to door
[1:51:26.540 --> 1:51:29.540]  Take your children, force inoculate you once the shots begin
[1:51:29.540 --> 1:51:32.540]  And they have a secret FEMA for Canada
[1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:34.540]  A secret federal emergency center
[1:51:34.540 --> 1:51:35.540]  That they're taking people to
[1:51:35.540 --> 1:51:37.540]  Did you see that part?
[1:51:37.540 --> 1:51:41.540]  And in this plan it details it says
[1:51:41.540 --> 1:51:44.540]  That the Lieutenant Governor in council here in Alberta
[1:51:44.540 --> 1:51:48.540]  Has the authority to postpone elections up to three months
[1:51:48.540 --> 1:51:50.540]  Stay there, stay there, exactly
[1:51:50.540 --> 1:51:52.540]  And what's the key kids?
[1:51:52.540 --> 1:51:54.540]  What's the key dad? What's the key mom?
[1:51:54.540 --> 1:51:56.540]  It's all you in run
[1:51:56.540 --> 1:51:58.540]  Just like Australia, just like Spain
[1:51:58.540 --> 1:52:00.540]  Now to Canada, Ohio's doing it under their
[1:52:00.540 --> 1:52:02.540]  Republican leadership
[1:52:02.540 --> 1:52:04.540]  This is it, this is the takeover
[1:52:04.540 --> 1:52:06.540]  This is martial law with a medical tyranny cover
[1:52:06.540 --> 1:52:09.540]  This is it, this is it boys
[1:52:12.540 --> 1:52:14.540]  You notice that over and over again
[1:52:14.540 --> 1:52:17.540]  The United Nations are supposed controllers and bosses
[1:52:17.540 --> 1:52:19.540]  The great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed
[1:52:19.540 --> 1:52:21.540]  To disagree with has come out and said
[1:52:21.540 --> 1:52:24.540]  Nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19
[1:52:24.540 --> 1:52:27.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie
[1:52:27.540 --> 1:52:29.540]  You get a lot of sunlight, it's on record
[1:52:29.540 --> 1:52:31.540]  To produce a ton of vitamin D3
[1:52:31.540 --> 1:52:34.540]  And it's almost impossible to get viral infections
[1:52:34.540 --> 1:52:36.540]  If you're getting plenty of vitamin D3
[1:52:36.540 --> 1:52:38.540]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well
[1:52:38.540 --> 1:52:41.540]  That's why people get the flues and these colds in the winter
[1:52:41.540 --> 1:52:43.540]  Because that's when vitamin D levels plunge
[1:52:43.540 --> 1:52:46.540]  Now I've pointed this out and the media has called me
[1:52:46.540 --> 1:52:49.540]  A scammer for saying that there's hope
[1:52:49.540 --> 1:52:51.540]  That people should have their vitamins and their minerals
[1:52:51.540 --> 1:52:53.540]  Well now Fauci's been forced to come out
[1:52:53.540 --> 1:52:56.540]  And admit that you need vitamin D3 and C
[1:52:56.540 --> 1:52:58.540]  He should have also added zinc
[1:52:58.540 --> 1:53:01.540]  Because the NIH website says you die without zinc
[1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:03.540]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now
[1:53:03.540 --> 1:53:05.540]  Because so many doctors and nurses
[1:53:05.540 --> 1:53:07.540]  And experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[1:53:07.540 --> 1:53:10.540]  That he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins
[1:53:11.540 --> 1:53:13.540]  Last week Tucker Carlson came out
[1:53:13.540 --> 1:53:16.540]  And said America is becoming the Soviet Union
[1:53:16.540 --> 1:53:19.540]  In many ways we're worse than the Soviet Union
[1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:21.540]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what Big Tech
[1:53:21.540 --> 1:53:24.540]  Could do surveilling and censoring us
[1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:26.540]  And we're gonna get a lot worse than the Soviet Union
[1:53:26.540 --> 1:53:28.540]  When it comes to forced inoculations
[1:53:28.540 --> 1:53:30.540]  And the medical tyranny being rolled out
[1:53:30.540 --> 1:53:32.540]  By the United Nations now in control
[1:53:32.540 --> 1:53:34.540]  Of what you can and can't say online
[1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:36.540]  The truth is ladies and gentlemen
[1:53:36.540 --> 1:53:38.540]  America is fighting for its life
[1:53:38.540 --> 1:53:40.540]  And the enemy's number one mission
[1:53:40.540 --> 1:53:42.540]  Is to get Trump out of office
[1:53:42.540 --> 1:53:44.540]  And number two is to silence info wars
[1:53:44.540 --> 1:53:47.540]  Because we understand just how diabolical they are
[1:53:47.540 --> 1:53:50.540]  Just how evil they are and we won't miss words
[1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:52.540]  We know who the global star
[1:53:52.540 --> 1:53:54.540]  We've got their number and we know how to beat them
[1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:56.540]  And we cover it seven days a week live
[1:53:56.540 --> 1:53:59.540]  At info wars and it's only because of your support
[1:53:59.540 --> 1:54:01.540]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us
[1:54:01.540 --> 1:54:04.540]  And take advantage of the sales and get great products
[1:54:04.540 --> 1:54:06.540]  At info wars store dot com now
[1:54:06.540 --> 1:54:35.540]  Globalists are hoping you don't visit info wars store dot com
[1:54:36.540 --> 1:54:38.540]  All right, I'm aware of what's going on
[1:54:38.540 --> 1:54:40.540]  In multiple states of Canada and what's going on in Europe
[1:54:40.540 --> 1:54:42.540]  But I've still dropped the ball
[1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:45.540]  I saw the video last week of Quebec City
[1:54:45.540 --> 1:54:48.540]  The health minister just acting like a villain
[1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:51.540]  From a G.I. Joe Kubber commander movie
[1:54:51.540 --> 1:54:53.540]  I mean rubbing hands together
[1:54:53.540 --> 1:54:54.540]  How it's excellent
[1:54:54.540 --> 1:54:57.540]  We'll take everyone and put them in secret facilities
[1:54:57.540 --> 1:54:59.540]  The police are following orders
[1:54:59.540 --> 1:55:02.540]  Well, the U.N. is pleased with us
[1:55:02.540 --> 1:55:07.540]  And I've got the U.N. menace
[1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:09.540]  We break up the families
[1:55:09.540 --> 1:55:13.540]  They want that power to come and take you away
[1:55:13.540 --> 1:55:16.540]  This is the cover for their final political solution
[1:55:16.540 --> 1:55:18.540]  So tell people where you're at
[1:55:18.540 --> 1:55:20.540]  The name of the document, I'm aware of it
[1:55:20.540 --> 1:55:22.540]  I saw the link last week, I didn't cover it
[1:55:22.540 --> 1:55:24.540]  They're coming around you up and it's like
[1:55:24.540 --> 1:55:26.540]  This is all happening
[1:55:26.540 --> 1:55:28.540]  The epic Biblicalness of this is just happening
[1:55:28.540 --> 1:55:30.540]  Mike and people aren't aware
[1:55:30.540 --> 1:55:32.540]  So tell them where they find it, what the document is
[1:55:32.540 --> 1:55:35.540]  Suspending elections, this is martial law
[1:55:35.540 --> 1:55:37.540]  Institutional martial law
[1:55:37.540 --> 1:55:39.540]  Under the U.N. global governance
[1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:42.540]  Dictating what the cities and states can do
[1:55:42.540 --> 1:55:46.540]  Giving the political cover for absolute evil
[1:55:46.540 --> 1:55:48.540]  This is exactly as you stated
[1:55:48.540 --> 1:55:50.540]  The U.N.'s plan to come in
[1:55:50.540 --> 1:55:53.540]  And detain people and take them from their homes
[1:55:53.540 --> 1:55:55.540]  This is the execution of that plan
[1:55:55.540 --> 1:55:57.540]  This can be found in the Public Health Act
[1:55:57.540 --> 1:56:00.540]  Right on the government of Alberta's website
[1:56:00.540 --> 1:56:03.540]  Which clearly states that the Lieutenant Governor
[1:56:03.540 --> 1:56:06.540]  And Council now is the authority to order the immunization
[1:56:06.540 --> 1:56:09.540]  Or re-immunization of persons that are not immunized
[1:56:09.540 --> 1:56:11.540]  And if you do not...
[1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:13.540]  So the Public Health Act in Alberta
[1:56:13.540 --> 1:56:17.540]  Forced inoculation, secret arrest, secret detainment
[1:56:17.540 --> 1:56:19.540]  100%, that is correct
[1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:21.540]  And if you do not comply
[1:56:21.540 --> 1:56:23.540]  They have a contingency in there for you as well
[1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:26.540]  They'll detain you and throw you in a facility
[1:56:26.540 --> 1:56:29.540]  And definitely, essentially, until you're compliant
[1:56:29.540 --> 1:56:32.540]  And in coordination with this
[1:56:32.540 --> 1:56:36.540]  I see on the government of Canada procurement website
[1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:39.540]  That they've put out of RFP a proposal
[1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:42.540]  For 36,000 tear gas canister agents
[1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:44.540]  This is a riot control agent
[1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:48.540]  There's no doubt they're making their move
[1:56:48.540 --> 1:56:50.540]  They're going to make their move here in the United States
[1:56:50.540 --> 1:56:52.540]  They're going to use COVID as the cover for martial law
[1:56:52.540 --> 1:56:55.540]  And race riots as the cover for martial law
[1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:57.540]  What do you think we should do? What should Trump do?
[1:56:57.540 --> 1:56:59.540]  I think he should assault this head on
[1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:00.540]  Call it all out
[1:57:00.540 --> 1:57:02.540]  I know the White House is watching right now
[1:57:02.540 --> 1:57:04.540]  What are they going to do about this?
[1:57:04.540 --> 1:57:06.540]  They need to call it out now
[1:57:06.540 --> 1:57:09.540]  I said citizens, Canadians and Americans
[1:57:09.540 --> 1:57:13.540]  We need to start taking action and contacting local MPs
[1:57:13.540 --> 1:57:16.540]  And making sure that our frustrations are known
[1:57:16.540 --> 1:57:18.540]  And that we're not going to stand around idly
[1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:21.540]  And let this tyranny destroy our country
[1:57:21.540 --> 1:57:23.540]  I know first fact
[1:57:23.540 --> 1:57:25.540]  I'm not going to stand here idly
[1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:28.540]  And let them just enslave us
[1:57:28.540 --> 1:57:31.540]  Anybody who tries to take me to some secret center of force
[1:57:31.540 --> 1:57:33.540]  Inoculation, they want to plunge their poison in me
[1:57:33.540 --> 1:57:35.540]  That's a physical assault
[1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:36.540]  I'm going to defend myself
[1:57:36.540 --> 1:57:37.540]  They're the ones assaulting us
[1:57:37.540 --> 1:57:39.540]  And they want to do it bureaucratically
[1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:41.540]  And poison us and kill us that way
[1:57:41.540 --> 1:57:42.540]  That's what they want to do
[1:57:42.540 --> 1:57:45.540]  No, you will not kill us, you little maggots
[1:57:46.540 --> 1:57:47.540]  That's right, Alex
[1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:49.540]  And all the wild...
[1:57:49.540 --> 1:57:51.540]  By the way, go back to that
[1:57:51.540 --> 1:57:55.540]  England just passed 13,000 dollar fines
[1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:57.540]  For not staying locked up in your house
[1:57:57.540 --> 1:58:03.540]  Now Canada, 569,000 dollar fines
[1:58:03.540 --> 1:58:05.540]  What the hell is that?
[1:58:05.540 --> 1:58:06.540]  What is that?
[1:58:06.540 --> 1:58:09.540]  That's out of KUT Austin
[1:58:09.540 --> 1:58:11.540]  Holy mackerel
[1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:12.540]  And on top of that
[1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:14.540]  They're going to give us a year and a half
[1:58:14.540 --> 1:58:16.540]  To give up our guns
[1:58:16.540 --> 1:58:18.540]  Or else they'll come in forcefully by the mountain
[1:58:18.540 --> 1:58:20.540]  But see how it's 15 days
[1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:22.540]  Just for the hospitals
[1:58:22.540 --> 1:58:24.540]  Oh, it's two months, it's six months
[1:58:24.540 --> 1:58:27.540]  Oh, now it's 750,000 dollar fines
[1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:29.540]  They're now saying that that was an old article
[1:58:29.540 --> 1:58:31.540]  I mean, it's just boom, we're here
[1:58:31.540 --> 1:58:33.540]  We're here
[1:58:33.540 --> 1:58:36.540]  And this mask mandate has no end date
[1:58:36.540 --> 1:58:37.540]  Keep that in mind
[1:58:37.540 --> 1:58:39.540]  That they do not have an end date for this
[1:58:39.540 --> 1:58:41.540]  But that said, how beautiful it is
[1:58:41.540 --> 1:58:43.540]  People aren't wearing them at Trump rallies
[1:58:43.540 --> 1:58:44.540]  Trump's coming out against it
[1:58:44.540 --> 1:58:46.540]  We need to call its bluff now, brother
[1:58:46.540 --> 1:58:48.540]  It's time to be lying
[1:58:48.540 --> 1:58:50.540]  In the herd of sheep, walk out there
[1:58:50.540 --> 1:58:51.540]  Be proud of it
[1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:53.540]  And stand up for your liberties
[1:58:53.540 --> 1:58:55.540]  They're being stripped from us on a daily basis
[1:58:55.540 --> 1:58:56.540]  Mike, incredible
[1:58:56.540 --> 1:58:58.540]  We're going to put this last segment in this one out
[1:58:58.540 --> 1:59:00.540]  Really important piece to feature
[1:59:00.540 --> 1:59:02.540]  To show the documents you mentioned
[1:59:02.540 --> 1:59:05.540]  That Canada now under full martial law
[1:59:05.540 --> 1:59:09.540]  Canada now to find and arrest
[1:59:09.540 --> 1:59:12.540]  And engage in forced inoculations, my god
[1:59:12.540 --> 1:59:18.540]  If you have a grif, it's coming up, stay with us
[1:59:42.540 --> 1:59:44.540]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement
[1:59:44.540 --> 1:59:48.540]  That more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19
[1:59:48.540 --> 1:59:50.540]  When it's not even 200,000 in reality
[1:59:50.540 --> 1:59:54.540]  He would only say 6 million have lung, scarring, and heart damage
[1:59:54.540 --> 1:59:55.540]  It's all made up
[1:59:55.540 --> 1:59:56.540]  But you know where you got it?
[1:59:56.540 --> 1:59:59.540]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that
[1:59:59.540 --> 2:00:04.540]  They said that 4% of America would be dead already
[2:00:04.540 --> 2:00:06.540]  Of course, it's.000
[2:00:06.540 --> 2:00:08.540]  And then add a number
[2:00:08.540 --> 2:00:09.540]  Because the numbers vary
[2:00:09.540 --> 2:00:13.540]  It's a real virus, just like people being stripped by lightning
[2:00:13.540 --> 2:00:14.540]  Is real
[2:00:14.540 --> 2:00:17.540]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes
[2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:40.540]  Is hysteria and is mind control
[2:00:40.540 --> 2:00:44.540]  I'm a riddle by morning
[2:00:44.540 --> 2:00:48.540]  Up from Santa Claus
[2:00:48.540 --> 2:00:51.540]  Everything that I got
[2:00:51.540 --> 2:00:54.540]  Is just what I've got on
[2:00:54.540 --> 2:00:57.540]  When that sun is high
[2:00:57.540 --> 2:00:59.540]  When that sun is high
[2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:02.540]  In that Texas sky
[2:01:02.540 --> 2:01:04.540]  We'll be interviewing G.A. Griffin
[2:01:04.540 --> 2:01:06.540]  The icon
[2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:07.540]  Bigger than Ron Paul
[2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:08.540]  Son of a how big you are
[2:01:08.540 --> 2:01:09.540]  But around before Ron Paul
[2:01:09.540 --> 2:01:11.540]  Making films in the 60s
[2:01:11.540 --> 2:01:13.540]  Exposing everything that happened
[2:01:13.540 --> 2:01:16.540]  And the communist takeover of Africa
[2:01:16.540 --> 2:01:17.540]  Asia, Latin America
[2:01:17.540 --> 2:01:20.540]  A trailblazer that we all stand on his shoulders
[2:01:20.540 --> 2:01:21.540]  G.Edward Griffin
[2:01:21.540 --> 2:01:23.540]  RedPillExpo.org
[2:01:23.540 --> 2:01:25.540]  RedPillUniversity.org
[2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:30.540]  He's with us about 15 minutes into the next hour
[2:01:30.540 --> 2:01:32.540]  I want to first get into Yuri Besmanov
[2:01:32.540 --> 2:01:34.540]  Who was the KGB defector
[2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:36.540]  Who's now gone super viral yet again
[2:01:36.540 --> 2:01:39.540]  I was playing this Yuri Besmanov interview
[2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:42.540]  In 1996 on Axis TV
[2:01:42.540 --> 2:01:44.540]  And Griffin was cool
[2:01:44.540 --> 2:01:47.540]  He'd come on by 1997 on my radio show
[2:01:47.540 --> 2:01:50.540]  But G.Edward Griffin's been active since the mid 60s
[2:01:50.540 --> 2:01:52.540]  And I believe we'll go to him in a moment
[2:01:52.540 --> 2:01:54.540]  But this interview is from the late 60s
[2:01:54.540 --> 2:01:55.540]  With Yuri Besmanov
[2:01:55.540 --> 2:01:56.540]  We'll air a few minutes of it
[2:01:56.540 --> 2:01:57.540]  And then go to G.Edward Griffin
[2:01:57.540 --> 2:01:59.540]  And talk about the big picture
[2:01:59.540 --> 2:02:01.540]  The lockdowns, the martial law
[2:02:01.540 --> 2:02:03.540]  And how he thinks humanity should counter this
[2:02:03.540 --> 2:02:05.540]  But let's go ahead and go to six minutes
[2:02:05.540 --> 2:02:07.540]  Of this amazing historical interview
[2:02:07.540 --> 2:02:11.540]  Ideological subversion is the slow process
[2:02:11.540 --> 2:02:14.540]  Which we call either ideological subversion
[2:02:14.540 --> 2:02:16.540]  Or active measures
[2:02:16.540 --> 2:02:19.540]  Active measures in the language of the KGB
[2:02:19.540 --> 2:02:21.540]  Or psychological warfare
[2:02:21.540 --> 2:02:23.540]  What it basically means is
[2:02:23.540 --> 2:02:25.540]  To change the perception of reality
[2:02:25.540 --> 2:02:28.540]  Of every American
[2:02:28.540 --> 2:02:30.540]  To such an extent
[2:02:30.540 --> 2:02:33.540]  That despite of the abundance of information
[2:02:33.540 --> 2:02:37.540]  No one is able to come to sensible conclusions
[2:02:37.540 --> 2:02:39.540]  In the interest of defending themselves
[2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:41.540]  Their families, their community
[2:02:41.540 --> 2:02:43.540]  And their country
[2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:46.540]  It's a great brainwashing process
[2:02:46.540 --> 2:02:48.540]  Which goes very slow
[2:02:48.540 --> 2:02:52.540]  And it's divided in four basic stages
[2:02:52.540 --> 2:02:55.540]  The first one being demoralization
[2:02:55.540 --> 2:02:58.540]  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation
[2:02:58.540 --> 2:03:00.540]  Why that many years?
[2:03:00.540 --> 2:03:02.540]  Because this is the minimum number of years
[2:03:02.540 --> 2:03:07.540]  Which requires to educate one generation of students
[2:03:07.540 --> 2:03:10.540]  In the country of your enemy
[2:03:10.540 --> 2:03:13.540]  Exposed to the ideology of the enemy
[2:03:13.540 --> 2:03:16.540]  In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology
[2:03:16.540 --> 2:03:18.540]  Is being pumped into the soft heads
[2:03:18.540 --> 2:03:21.540]  Of at least three generations of American students
[2:03:21.540 --> 2:03:23.540]  Without being challenged or counterbalanced
[2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:26.540]  By the basic values of Americanism
[2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:28.540]  American patriotism
[2:03:28.540 --> 2:03:31.540]  The demoralization process in the United States
[2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:34.540]  Is basically completed already
[2:03:34.540 --> 2:03:36.540]  For the last 25 years
[2:03:36.540 --> 2:03:38.540]  Actually, it's over fulfilled
[2:03:38.540 --> 2:03:41.540]  Because demoralization now reaches such areas
[2:03:41.540 --> 2:03:44.540]  Where previously, not even Comrade Andropov
[2:03:44.540 --> 2:03:48.540]  And all his experts would even dream
[2:03:48.540 --> 2:03:50.540]  Of such a tremendous success
[2:03:50.540 --> 2:03:53.540]  Most of it is done by Americans to Americans
[2:03:53.540 --> 2:03:55.540]  Thanks to lack of moral standards
[2:03:55.540 --> 2:03:57.540]  As I mentioned before
[2:03:57.540 --> 2:04:00.540]  Exposure to true information
[2:04:00.540 --> 2:04:02.540]  Does not matter anymore
[2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:04.540]  A person who was demoralized
[2:04:04.540 --> 2:04:07.540]  Is unable to assess true information
[2:04:07.540 --> 2:04:10.540]  The facts tell nothing to him
[2:04:10.540 --> 2:04:13.540]  Even if I shower him with information
[2:04:13.540 --> 2:04:16.540]  With authentic proof, with documents, with pictures
[2:04:16.540 --> 2:04:20.540]  Even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union
[2:04:20.540 --> 2:04:22.540]  And show him concentration camp
[2:04:22.540 --> 2:04:24.540]  He will refuse to believe it
[2:04:24.540 --> 2:04:27.540]  Until he is going to receive a kick
[2:04:27.540 --> 2:04:29.540]  In his fat bottom
[2:04:29.540 --> 2:04:32.540]  When a military boot crashes his bowls
[2:04:32.540 --> 2:04:34.540]  Then he will understand
[2:04:34.540 --> 2:04:35.540]  But not before that
[2:04:35.540 --> 2:04:38.540]  That's the tragic of the situation of demoralization
[2:04:38.540 --> 2:04:41.540]  The next stage is destabilization
[2:04:41.540 --> 2:04:45.540]  This time, subvertor does not care about your ideas
[2:04:45.540 --> 2:04:47.540]  And the patterns of your consumption
[2:04:47.540 --> 2:04:49.540]  Whether you eat junk food and get fat and flub
[2:04:49.540 --> 2:04:51.540]  It doesn't matter anymore
[2:04:51.540 --> 2:04:54.540]  This time, and it takes only from 2 to 5 years
[2:04:54.540 --> 2:04:56.540]  To destabilize a nation
[2:04:56.540 --> 2:04:59.540]  What matters is essentials
[2:04:59.540 --> 2:05:03.540]  The economy, foreign relations, defense systems
[2:05:03.540 --> 2:05:05.540]  And you can see it quite clearly
[2:05:05.540 --> 2:05:07.540]  That in some areas
[2:05:07.540 --> 2:05:11.540]  In such sensitive areas as defense
[2:05:11.540 --> 2:05:13.540]  And economy
[2:05:13.540 --> 2:05:16.540]  The influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas
[2:05:16.540 --> 2:05:19.540]  In the United States is absolutely fantastic
[2:05:19.540 --> 2:05:21.540]  I could never believe it 14 years ago
[2:05:21.540 --> 2:05:24.540]  When I landed in this part of the world
[2:05:24.540 --> 2:05:27.540]  That the process will go that fast
[2:05:27.540 --> 2:05:29.540]  The next stage, of course, is crisis
[2:05:29.540 --> 2:05:31.540]  It may take only up to 6 weeks
[2:05:31.540 --> 2:05:34.540]  To bring a country to the verge of crisis
[2:05:34.540 --> 2:05:36.540]  You can see it in Central America now
[2:05:36.540 --> 2:05:38.540]  And after crisis
[2:05:38.540 --> 2:05:42.540]  With the violent change of power, structure and economy
[2:05:42.540 --> 2:05:45.540]  You have so-called the period of normalization
[2:05:45.540 --> 2:05:47.540]  It may last indefinitely
[2:05:47.540 --> 2:05:49.540]  Normalization is a cynical expression
[2:05:49.540 --> 2:05:51.540]  Bored from Soviet propaganda
[2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:54.540]  When the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in 1968
[2:05:54.540 --> 2:05:56.540]  Comrade Brezhnev said
[2:05:56.540 --> 2:06:00.540]  The situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized
[2:06:00.540 --> 2:06:02.540]  This is what will happen in the United States
[2:06:02.540 --> 2:06:04.540]  If you allow all these schmucks
[2:06:04.540 --> 2:06:06.540]  To bring the country to crisis
[2:06:06.540 --> 2:06:09.540]  To promise people all kind of goodies
[2:06:09.540 --> 2:06:11.540]  And the paradise on earth
[2:06:11.540 --> 2:06:14.540]  To destabilize your economy
[2:06:14.540 --> 2:06:17.540]  To eliminate the principle of free market competition
[2:06:17.540 --> 2:06:20.540]  And to put a big brother government
[2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:22.540]  In Washington, D.C.
[2:06:22.540 --> 2:06:26.540]  With benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale
[2:06:26.540 --> 2:06:28.540]  Who will promise lots of things
[2:06:28.540 --> 2:06:31.540]  Never mind whether the promises are fulfillable or not
[2:06:31.540 --> 2:06:34.540]  Your leftists in the United States
[2:06:34.540 --> 2:06:38.540]  All these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defenders
[2:06:38.540 --> 2:06:43.540]  They are instrumental in the process of the subversion
[2:06:43.540 --> 2:06:46.540]  Only to destabilize the nation
[2:06:46.540 --> 2:06:48.540]  When their job is completed
[2:06:48.540 --> 2:06:50.540]  They are not needed anymore
[2:06:50.540 --> 2:06:52.540]  They know too much
[2:06:52.540 --> 2:06:54.540]  Some of them, when they get disillusioned
[2:06:54.540 --> 2:06:57.540]  When they see that Marxist Leninists come to power
[2:06:57.540 --> 2:06:59.540]  Obviously they get offended
[2:06:59.540 --> 2:07:01.540]  They think that they will come to power
[2:07:01.540 --> 2:07:03.540]  That will never happen, of course
[2:07:03.540 --> 2:07:05.540]  They will be lined up against the wall and shot
[2:07:05.540 --> 2:07:08.540]  But they may turn into the most bitter enemies
[2:07:08.540 --> 2:07:11.540]  Of Marxist Leninists when they come to power
[2:07:11.540 --> 2:07:13.540]  And that's what happened in Nicaragua
[2:07:13.540 --> 2:07:16.540]  You remember most of these former Marxist Leninists
[2:07:16.540 --> 2:07:19.540]  Were either put to prison or one of them split
[2:07:19.540 --> 2:07:21.540]  And now he's working against Sandinistas
[2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:23.540]  It happened in Grenada
[2:07:23.540 --> 2:07:26.540]  When Maurice Bichop was, he was already a Marxist
[2:07:26.540 --> 2:07:29.540]  He was executed by a new Marxist
[2:07:29.540 --> 2:07:31.540]  Who was more Marxist than this Marxist
[2:07:31.540 --> 2:07:32.540]  Same happened in Afghanistan
[2:07:32.540 --> 2:07:34.540]  When first there was Taraki
[2:07:34.540 --> 2:07:35.540]  He was killed by Amin
[2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:37.540]  Then Amin was killed by Babrak Karmal
[2:07:37.540 --> 2:07:38.540]  With the help of KGB
[2:07:38.540 --> 2:07:40.540]  Same happened in Bangladesh
[2:07:40.540 --> 2:07:43.540]  When Munjibur Rahman, very pro-Soviet leftist
[2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:48.540]  Was assassinated by his own Marxist Leninist military comrades
[2:07:48.540 --> 2:07:51.540]  It's the same pattern everywhere
[2:07:51.540 --> 2:07:54.540]  That the time bomb is ticking with every second
[2:07:54.540 --> 2:07:56.540]  It's closer
[2:07:56.540 --> 2:07:59.540]  Yuri Besmanov, that's an interview from 1984
[2:07:59.540 --> 2:08:01.540]  Of course, Griffin did interviews back in the early 1960s
[2:08:01.540 --> 2:08:03.540]  Mid-60s with everybody
[2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:05.540]  He joined us for the next hour, 15 minutes to the next hour
[2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:06.540]  I really appreciate him
[2:08:06.540 --> 2:08:08.540]  Hearing all that is exactly what's happening
[2:08:08.540 --> 2:08:10.540]  But the reason I wanted to get him on today
[2:08:10.540 --> 2:08:13.540]  Was to explain, we're not giving the Russians cover
[2:08:13.540 --> 2:08:14.540]  For what they did
[2:08:14.540 --> 2:08:16.540]  But it was a globalist Rothschild
[2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:19.540]  Banking cartel that put this in Russia
[2:08:19.540 --> 2:08:21.540]  As its beta test to exploit Russia
[2:08:21.540 --> 2:08:23.540]  To expand this
[2:08:23.540 --> 2:08:25.540]  And so that's why it's done so well here
[2:08:25.540 --> 2:08:27.540]  Because it actually came from here
[2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:29.540]  You talk about trailblazing, G. Everett Griffin
[2:08:29.540 --> 2:08:32.540]  Is the trailblazer exposing the whole paradigm
[2:08:32.540 --> 2:08:35.540]  G. Everett Griffin, thank you so much, my friend, for joining us
[2:08:35.540 --> 2:08:37.540]  Well, thank you, Alex
[2:08:37.540 --> 2:08:39.540]  It's always a pleasure to be on your show
[2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:42.540]  And to get your perspective on things
[2:08:42.540 --> 2:08:44.540]  Well, I'm going to try to give you the floor when we come back
[2:08:44.540 --> 2:08:46.540]  And you can talk about any subject you want
[2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:48.540]  But I'd like to go back into history
[2:08:48.540 --> 2:08:51.540]  Why the ultra-rich is none dare call conspiracy exposters
[2:08:51.540 --> 2:08:54.540]  Which you even pre-date
[2:08:54.540 --> 2:08:57.540]  Are funding communism so people can get the paradigm shift
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:00.540]  And then look at the current situation
[2:09:00.540 --> 2:09:03.540]  What else do you want to get into today?
[2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:05.540]  I think that is quite enough
[2:09:05.540 --> 2:09:07.540]  Because that's a deep topic
[2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:10.540]  When you touched on the idea that
[2:09:10.540 --> 2:09:14.540]  It was the so-called anti-communist or non-communist world
[2:09:14.540 --> 2:09:17.540]  That actually funded the communist revolution
[2:09:17.540 --> 2:09:20.540]  A lot of people have come to realize that now
[2:09:20.540 --> 2:09:23.540]  But I'm not sure they understand the significance of that
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:28.540]  When you realize that the money for sending Lenin into Russia
[2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:33.540]  To stimulate and lead the revolution against the Tsar
[2:09:33.540 --> 2:09:37.540]  That money came from Wall Street and from the city in London
[2:09:37.540 --> 2:09:41.540]  It came from very wealthy people
[2:09:41.540 --> 2:09:44.540]  The kind of people we would tend to call capitalists
[2:09:44.540 --> 2:09:47.540]  That's another topic because I want to just emphasize
[2:09:47.540 --> 2:09:50.540]  That the amount of money a person has
[2:09:50.540 --> 2:09:52.540]  Is not a measure of what they believe
[2:09:52.540 --> 2:09:55.540]  So a very rich person can be a communist
[2:09:55.540 --> 2:09:58.540]  Exactly, because it's a spiritual thing at the end of the day
[2:09:58.540 --> 2:10:00.540]  I'm here looking at G. Edward Griffin
[2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:03.540]  I've got a chance of being all these big Hollywood stars
[2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:05.540]  I even know Donald Trump
[2:10:05.540 --> 2:10:07.540]  I'm looking at G. Edward Griffin
[2:10:07.540 --> 2:10:09.540]  A living legend there on Skype
[2:10:09.540 --> 2:10:12.540]  Without him, we would not even be where we are
[2:10:12.540 --> 2:10:14.540]  Literally, this guy's one of the few people
[2:10:14.540 --> 2:10:16.540]  Early on to expose it, we're so honored to have him
[2:10:16.540 --> 2:10:36.540]  This guy's a rock star for humanity
[2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:52.540]  We've now been testing this out for several months
[2:10:52.540 --> 2:10:54.540]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies
[2:10:54.540 --> 2:10:56.540]  Some like bodies better
[2:10:56.540 --> 2:10:58.540]  For me, they're both amazing
[2:10:58.540 --> 2:11:00.540]  For their anti-inflammatory action and so much more
[2:11:00.540 --> 2:11:01.540]  And they fund the M4

[2:11:26.540 --> 2:11:29.540]  So it's important for listeners and viewers to understand
[2:11:29.540 --> 2:11:31.540]  When you support M4 Wars to keep us on the air
[2:11:31.540 --> 2:11:34.540]  You're not supporting a news outlet that has sources
[2:11:34.540 --> 2:11:36.540]  And so we're able to always tell you what's coming
[2:11:36.540 --> 2:11:38.540]  When others can't
[2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:40.540]  It's because we are studying the enemy
[2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:42.540]  And doing the original analysis
[2:11:42.540 --> 2:11:45.540]  That gets picked up by Trump intelligence agencies
[2:11:45.540 --> 2:11:47.540]  And major corporations that are part of the resistance
[2:11:47.540 --> 2:11:50.540]  That are part of the resistance to the overarching globalist system
[2:11:50.540 --> 2:11:52.540]  So I have to tell you how the hierarchy works
[2:11:52.540 --> 2:11:55.540]  In many cases M4 Wars is at the head
[2:11:55.540 --> 2:11:57.540]  Or not the tail
[2:11:57.540 --> 2:11:59.540]  That means you're at the head
[2:11:59.540 --> 2:12:01.540]  And that's why your support of us is so critical
[2:12:01.540 --> 2:12:03.540]  Biden and his constellation of criminals
[2:12:03.540 --> 2:12:05.540]  Have told us and many others
[2:12:05.540 --> 2:12:06.540]  That if they get elected
[2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:08.540]  They're not just going to shut down M4 Wars
[2:12:08.540 --> 2:12:09.540]  They're going to shut you down
[2:12:09.540 --> 2:12:11.540]  The long depression, forced inoculations and more
[2:12:11.540 --> 2:12:13.540]  So now more than ever keep M4 Wars on the air
[2:12:13.540 --> 2:12:42.540]  With high quality products at M4Store.com
[2:12:42.540 --> 2:12:44.540]  15 minutes until the next hour
[2:12:44.540 --> 2:12:46.540]  But seriously
[2:12:46.540 --> 2:12:48.540]  I was signaling out G.O. Griffin earlier
[2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:50.540]  And how important he is
[2:12:50.540 --> 2:12:52.540]  For all of our futures
[2:12:52.540 --> 2:12:54.540]  Because it needs to be singled out
[2:12:54.540 --> 2:12:55.540]  They celebrate LeBron James
[2:12:55.540 --> 2:12:56.540]  They celebrate Roger Stallback
[2:12:56.540 --> 2:12:59.540]  They celebrate things artificially
[2:12:59.540 --> 2:13:01.540]  Because they don't matter
[2:13:01.540 --> 2:13:03.540]  Instead of what was it like back in the mid 1960s
[2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:05.540]  When he woke up
[2:13:05.540 --> 2:13:07.540]  And then became one of the main
[2:13:07.540 --> 2:13:09.540]  Voices or progenitors
[2:13:09.540 --> 2:13:11.540]  Of the modern resistance to globalism
[2:13:11.540 --> 2:13:14.540]  And what is it like out of thousands of political ideologies
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:16.540]  The globalist fund that confused people
[2:13:16.540 --> 2:13:17.540]  With their tower of Babel
[2:13:17.540 --> 2:13:19.540]  To have been there accurately forecasting
[2:13:19.540 --> 2:13:21.540]  Who the players were
[2:13:21.540 --> 2:13:22.540]  What the battle space was
[2:13:22.540 --> 2:13:24.540]  And how they could be defeated
[2:13:24.540 --> 2:13:26.540]  I mean this is vindication
[2:13:26.540 --> 2:13:28.540]  People say Jones you've been on air
[2:13:28.540 --> 2:13:29.540]  26 years you're so vindicated
[2:13:29.540 --> 2:13:31.540]  Well because I was reading the work of G.O. Griffin
[2:13:31.540 --> 2:13:34.540]  And of many many others
[2:13:34.540 --> 2:13:36.540]  That came before
[2:13:36.540 --> 2:13:38.540]  And that's why we're here
[2:13:38.540 --> 2:13:40.540]  So this is a shorter segment
[2:13:40.540 --> 2:13:41.540]  Long segment coming up
[2:13:41.540 --> 2:13:43.540]  But if you can go back to your roots
[2:13:43.540 --> 2:13:44.540]  And what woke you up
[2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:46.540]  And then contemporize
[2:13:46.540 --> 2:13:48.540]  What the main players are as you did
[2:13:48.540 --> 2:13:50.540]  50 60 years ago
[2:13:50.540 --> 2:13:52.540]  And then let's move forward
[2:13:52.540 --> 2:13:54.540]  With the breakdown of exactly who we're facing
[2:13:54.540 --> 2:13:56.540]  Because knowing who the enemy is
[2:13:56.540 --> 2:13:58.540]  Is half the battle
[2:14:01.540 --> 2:14:03.540]  Well I guess that's my cue
[2:14:03.540 --> 2:14:06.540]  I was sort of looking at that old video
[2:14:06.540 --> 2:14:09.540]  Thinking how young I was
[2:14:09.540 --> 2:14:11.540]  But anyway
[2:14:11.540 --> 2:14:13.540]  How long has this been a place to start
[2:14:13.540 --> 2:14:15.540]  How long have you been in this fight
[2:14:17.540 --> 2:14:20.540]  I took my first red pill in 1960
[2:14:20.540 --> 2:14:22.540]  So that's quite a while
[2:14:22.540 --> 2:14:24.540]  Let's start there
[2:14:24.540 --> 2:14:25.540]  Yeah we can start there
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:29.540]  Well I was climbing the corporate ladder
[2:14:29.540 --> 2:14:31.540]  I was like a lot of other young people
[2:14:31.540 --> 2:14:33.540]  All the time they're trying to look good
[2:14:33.540 --> 2:14:35.540]  Trying to do well
[2:14:35.540 --> 2:14:37.540]  Had a small family and a beautiful wife
[2:14:37.540 --> 2:14:39.540]  And kids and I wanted to
[2:14:39.540 --> 2:14:41.540]  Do something
[2:14:41.540 --> 2:14:43.540]  That was fun
[2:14:43.540 --> 2:14:45.540]  I wanted to have all the good things
[2:14:45.540 --> 2:14:47.540]  I wanted to climb into the corporate world
[2:14:47.540 --> 2:14:49.540]  And become an executive
[2:14:49.540 --> 2:14:51.540]  I wanted to have money and travel
[2:14:51.540 --> 2:14:53.540]  Looking good
[2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:55.540]  And having all the good material things
[2:14:55.540 --> 2:14:57.540]  And it was a very shallow existence
[2:14:57.540 --> 2:14:58.540]  Looking back at it
[2:14:58.540 --> 2:15:00.540]  But then I stumbled across some information
[2:15:00.540 --> 2:15:03.540]  I picked up somewhere
[2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:04.540]  Written by a college professor
[2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:06.540]  In some midwestern university
[2:15:06.540 --> 2:15:07.540]  Who was critical of the United Nations
[2:15:07.540 --> 2:15:08.540]  And I thought what
[2:15:08.540 --> 2:15:10.540]  How can you be critical of the United Nations
[2:15:10.540 --> 2:15:12.540]  I just came out of the university
[2:15:12.540 --> 2:15:14.540]  And I was taught that the United Nations
[2:15:14.540 --> 2:15:16.540]  Was our last best hope for peace
[2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:18.540]  So I believed that
[2:15:18.540 --> 2:15:20.540]  So how could anybody find anything wrong
[2:15:20.540 --> 2:15:22.540]  With our last best hope for peace
[2:15:22.540 --> 2:15:24.540]  So anyway I don't want to make a big story out of that
[2:15:24.540 --> 2:15:26.540]  Because that's all ancient history
[2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:28.540]  But that was the first crack in the egg
[2:15:28.540 --> 2:15:30.540]  And I began to do some independent research
[2:15:30.540 --> 2:15:32.540]  An amazing thing Alex
[2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:34.540]  I discovered something about myself that I didn't know
[2:15:34.540 --> 2:15:36.540]  I discovered that I had a crusader gene
[2:15:36.540 --> 2:15:38.540]  And it started to vibrate
[2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:40.540]  And the minute I discovered that I was being fooled
[2:15:40.540 --> 2:15:42.540]  That everything
[2:15:42.540 --> 2:15:43.540]  Not everything at that time
[2:15:43.540 --> 2:15:45.540]  But now I know almost everything I thought
[2:15:45.540 --> 2:15:47.540]  Was real, was false
[2:15:47.540 --> 2:15:49.540]  But when I discovered that I had been lied to
[2:15:49.540 --> 2:15:50.540]  About the UN
[2:15:50.540 --> 2:15:52.540]  And then I discovered I had been lied to
[2:15:52.540 --> 2:15:53.540]  About something else
[2:15:53.540 --> 2:15:54.540]  And then something else
[2:15:54.540 --> 2:15:55.540]  I became highly indignant
[2:15:55.540 --> 2:15:56.540]  And then just going
[2:15:56.540 --> 2:15:57.540]  Sitting back on it and saying
[2:15:57.540 --> 2:15:59.540]  Well gee I wonder what's going to happen next
[2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:00.540]  I got to learn more
[2:16:00.540 --> 2:16:01.540]  I became angry and I said
[2:16:01.540 --> 2:16:03.540]  I've got to do something about this
[2:16:03.540 --> 2:16:05.540]  That was contrary to my style
[2:16:05.540 --> 2:16:07.540]  So I quit my job
[2:16:07.540 --> 2:16:08.540]  And my poor wife
[2:16:08.540 --> 2:16:09.540]  I thought she was going to die
[2:16:09.540 --> 2:16:10.540]  And she said
[2:16:10.540 --> 2:16:12.540]  How are we going to put groceries on the table
[2:16:12.540 --> 2:16:13.540]  What happened to your career
[2:16:13.540 --> 2:16:15.540]  You're out fighting communism
[2:16:15.540 --> 2:16:16.540]  Nobody cares about communism
[2:16:16.540 --> 2:16:17.540]  That's over there someplace
[2:16:17.540 --> 2:16:19.540]  Anyway that was how it all began
[2:16:19.540 --> 2:16:21.540]  And just incrementally
[2:16:21.540 --> 2:16:22.540]  I went downhill from there
[2:16:22.540 --> 2:16:25.540]  I just couldn't resist learning more
[2:16:25.540 --> 2:16:27.540]  And then once I had learned some
[2:16:27.540 --> 2:16:29.540]  Very significant information
[2:16:29.540 --> 2:16:31.540]  I felt it was my responsibility
[2:16:31.540 --> 2:16:32.540]  To explain it to others
[2:16:32.540 --> 2:16:34.540]  So that they could travel the same path
[2:16:34.540 --> 2:16:35.540]  That they wished to do that
[2:16:35.540 --> 2:16:37.540]  And you became a pretty big leader
[2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:40.540]  In the movement pretty fast didn't you
[2:16:40.540 --> 2:16:41.540]  Well I guess
[2:16:41.540 --> 2:16:43.540]  No I don't think I became a big leader
[2:16:43.540 --> 2:16:44.540]  In the movement
[2:16:44.540 --> 2:16:46.540]  I just became a small fry in the movement
[2:16:46.540 --> 2:16:47.540]  In fact I remember going to
[2:16:47.540 --> 2:16:49.540]  A lot of these patriotic meetings
[2:16:49.540 --> 2:16:52.540]  And informative meetings
[2:16:52.540 --> 2:16:54.540]  And I was always the youngest kid there
[2:16:54.540 --> 2:16:55.540]  And I was very young
[2:16:55.540 --> 2:16:57.540]  And all the old timers were up there
[2:16:57.540 --> 2:16:58.540]  In the diaz and the speakers
[2:16:58.540 --> 2:17:00.540]  With the old people that knew things
[2:17:00.540 --> 2:17:02.540]  I was just green behind the ears
[2:17:02.540 --> 2:17:04.540]  I had learned one or two things
[2:17:04.540 --> 2:17:06.540]  So I was not a leader at all
[2:17:06.540 --> 2:17:07.540]  I was just doing my best
[2:17:07.540 --> 2:17:09.540]  Well I look back on you fast
[2:17:09.540 --> 2:17:10.540]  Doing film interviews
[2:17:10.540 --> 2:17:12.540]  Back when I was so hard and huge
[2:17:12.540 --> 2:17:14.540]  Films and just I mean you were
[2:17:14.540 --> 2:17:15.540]  But you hit the ground running
[2:17:15.540 --> 2:17:16.540]  I mean you were
[2:17:16.540 --> 2:17:18.540]  I'm doing amazing stuff
[2:17:18.540 --> 2:17:20.540]  Well I did hit the ground running
[2:17:20.540 --> 2:17:21.540]  That's for sure
[2:17:21.540 --> 2:17:24.540]  But you know I forgot about those old films
[2:17:24.540 --> 2:17:26.540]  And somebody called me a few months ago
[2:17:26.540 --> 2:17:28.540]  And said you know your interview with
[2:17:28.540 --> 2:17:30.540]  Yuri Besminov is going viral
[2:17:30.540 --> 2:17:31.540]  I said oh it is
[2:17:31.540 --> 2:17:32.540]  I didn't know that
[2:17:32.540 --> 2:17:34.540]  And then somebody called me
[2:17:34.540 --> 2:17:35.540]  A few weeks later said yeah
[2:17:35.540 --> 2:17:37.540]  Somebody pulled up your old
[2:17:37.540 --> 2:17:39.540]  Your lecture on More Deadly Than War
[2:17:39.540 --> 2:17:40.540]  Which was an analysis of
[2:17:40.540 --> 2:17:42.540]  The revolutionary tactics
[2:17:42.540 --> 2:17:44.540]  That we see in our streets now
[2:17:44.540 --> 2:17:45.540]  Not only in our streets
[2:17:45.540 --> 2:17:46.540]  But in our colleges
[2:17:46.540 --> 2:17:47.540]  He made films like Katanga
[2:17:47.540 --> 2:17:48.540]  And all those are
[2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:49.540]  They're incredible
[2:17:49.540 --> 2:17:51.540]  Yeah well that's what
[2:17:51.540 --> 2:17:52.540]  That's what I was doing
[2:17:52.540 --> 2:17:54.540]  I had learned in school
[2:17:54.540 --> 2:17:55.540]  A little bit about film making
[2:17:55.540 --> 2:17:56.540]  And communications
[2:17:56.540 --> 2:17:58.540]  I had thought originally
[2:17:58.540 --> 2:17:59.540]  I was going to make that
[2:17:59.540 --> 2:18:00.540]  My career
[2:18:00.540 --> 2:18:01.540]  But that didn't pay out
[2:18:01.540 --> 2:18:02.540]  Because there were people
[2:18:02.540 --> 2:18:04.540]  With far more talent than mine
[2:18:04.540 --> 2:18:05.540]  Wasting their lives in Hollywood
[2:18:05.540 --> 2:18:07.540]  Waiting for a big chance
[2:18:07.540 --> 2:18:08.540]  And so I said well
[2:18:08.540 --> 2:18:09.540]  I got to get out with life
[2:18:09.540 --> 2:18:10.540]  I got a family to support
[2:18:10.540 --> 2:18:12.540]  So that's when I went into
[2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:14.540]  Into the corporate world
[2:18:14.540 --> 2:18:15.540]  But I did have some knowledge
[2:18:15.540 --> 2:18:17.540]  And training and aptitude
[2:18:17.540 --> 2:18:18.540]  For communication
[2:18:18.540 --> 2:18:19.540]  So I thought well I'll take
[2:18:19.540 --> 2:18:21.540]  That and apply it as best I could
[2:18:21.540 --> 2:18:23.540]  To communicate these things
[2:18:23.540 --> 2:18:25.540]  I know you want to talk about yourself all day
[2:18:25.540 --> 2:18:26.540]  The roots of this
[2:18:26.540 --> 2:18:27.540]  Because I've tracked the resistance
[2:18:27.540 --> 2:18:29.540]  And your work
[2:18:29.540 --> 2:18:30.540]  Inspired very Goldwater
[2:18:30.540 --> 2:18:31.540]  Ronald Reagan
[2:18:31.540 --> 2:18:32.540]  Ron Paul
[2:18:32.540 --> 2:18:33.540]  So many others
[2:18:33.540 --> 2:18:34.540]  I mean you've been
[2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:35.540]  I mean how's it feel
[2:18:35.540 --> 2:18:37.540]  It's got to be satisfying to know
[2:18:37.540 --> 2:18:38.540]  You've been a key
[2:18:38.540 --> 2:18:40.540]  And still been pertinent today
[2:18:40.540 --> 2:18:41.540]  You've been a key
[2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:43.540]  Bomb thrower in the resistance
[2:18:43.540 --> 2:18:44.540]  To communism and tyranny
[2:18:44.540 --> 2:18:46.540]  For 50, 60 years
[2:18:46.540 --> 2:18:47.540]  That's got to be satisfying
[2:18:47.540 --> 2:18:48.540]  I mean without you brother
[2:18:48.540 --> 2:18:49.540]  We would not be in the position
[2:18:49.540 --> 2:18:50.540]  We are now
[2:18:50.540 --> 2:18:51.540]  Having a fighting chance
[2:18:51.540 --> 2:18:53.540]  I can tell you that G-Edward
[2:18:53.540 --> 2:18:54.540]  Without you
[2:18:54.540 --> 2:18:56.540]  You've been the key man so far
[2:18:56.540 --> 2:18:57.540]  People give me that credit
[2:18:57.540 --> 2:18:59.540]  Yeah, 1996 forward
[2:18:59.540 --> 2:19:00.540]  We've been key
[2:19:00.540 --> 2:19:01.540]  But you brother
[2:19:01.540 --> 2:19:02.540]  We're patient zero
[2:19:02.540 --> 2:19:03.540]  We salute you
[2:19:03.540 --> 2:19:05.540]  Well thank you for that Alex
[2:19:05.540 --> 2:19:07.540]  I don't feel any more worthy
[2:19:07.540 --> 2:19:09.540]  Than anybody else in the trenches
[2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:11.540]  I just have been had a
[2:19:11.540 --> 2:19:12.540]  I've had many years to pursue it
[2:19:12.540 --> 2:19:14.540]  That makes a big difference too
[2:19:14.540 --> 2:19:16.540]  And things are
[2:19:16.540 --> 2:19:18.540]  Partially due to chance
[2:19:18.540 --> 2:19:19.540]  If somebody had not discovered
[2:19:19.540 --> 2:19:21.540]  My old videos
[2:19:21.540 --> 2:19:23.540]  Someone had taken it
[2:19:23.540 --> 2:19:25.540]  To sell those as VHS copies
[2:19:25.540 --> 2:19:26.540]  No tapes
[2:19:26.540 --> 2:19:27.540]  So somebody had found one of those
[2:19:27.540 --> 2:19:28.540]  And digitized it
[2:19:28.540 --> 2:19:29.540]  It wasn't me
[2:19:29.540 --> 2:19:30.540]  No no I used to buy them
[2:19:30.540 --> 2:19:31.540]  And put them on access TV
[2:19:31.540 --> 2:19:32.540]  Believe me I know
[2:19:32.540 --> 2:19:33.540]  Yo so you're the guy
[2:19:33.540 --> 2:19:34.540]  That really is responsible
[2:19:34.540 --> 2:19:35.540]  For all this
[2:19:35.540 --> 2:19:36.540]  Because without that
[2:19:36.540 --> 2:19:38.540]  Nobody would have ever seen the thing
[2:19:38.540 --> 2:19:39.540]  It would not have
[2:19:39.540 --> 2:19:40.540]  Started to go viral
[2:19:40.540 --> 2:19:43.540]  And yeah there I am
[2:19:43.540 --> 2:19:44.540]  That was
[2:19:44.540 --> 2:19:45.540]  Oh my gosh
[2:19:45.540 --> 2:19:46.540]  I started to grow a beard
[2:19:46.540 --> 2:19:47.540]  By this time
[2:19:47.540 --> 2:19:48.540]  So anyway
[2:19:48.540 --> 2:19:49.540]  It was not just me
[2:19:49.540 --> 2:19:50.540]  And I'm just trying
[2:19:50.540 --> 2:19:51.540]  I'm not just trying
[2:19:51.540 --> 2:19:52.540]  To play them
[2:19:52.540 --> 2:19:53.540]  But I want the new filmmaker
[2:19:53.540 --> 2:19:54.540]  Or the new person out there
[2:19:54.540 --> 2:19:55.540]  Listening to know
[2:19:55.540 --> 2:19:57.540]  That this has been a lonely fight
[2:19:57.540 --> 2:19:59.540]  But it's had huge successes
[2:19:59.540 --> 2:20:00.540]  That's all I'm saying
[2:20:00.540 --> 2:20:01.540]  Yeah and I
[2:20:01.540 --> 2:20:02.540]  I think there's encouragement
[2:20:02.540 --> 2:20:03.540]  From that because
[2:20:03.540 --> 2:20:04.540]  No matter what we do
[2:20:04.540 --> 2:20:05.540]  And no matter how much
[2:20:05.540 --> 2:20:06.540]  We seem to be ignored
[2:20:06.540 --> 2:20:08.540]  Or scoffed at
[2:20:08.540 --> 2:20:09.540]  Because our position is
[2:20:09.540 --> 2:20:10.540]  Not mainstream
[2:20:10.540 --> 2:20:12.540]  If you just stick with it
[2:20:12.540 --> 2:20:13.540]  And don't yield
[2:20:13.540 --> 2:20:14.540]  And say okay
[2:20:14.540 --> 2:20:15.540]  That's my mission
[2:20:15.540 --> 2:20:17.540]  Is to be a truth teller
[2:20:17.540 --> 2:20:19.540]  Sooner or later it'll come around
[2:20:19.540 --> 2:20:20.540]  And even right now
[2:20:20.540 --> 2:20:21.540]  We seem to think that
[2:20:21.540 --> 2:20:23.540]  The affairs of the world
[2:20:23.540 --> 2:20:25.540]  Are so moving so badly downward
[2:20:25.540 --> 2:20:26.540]  That we're going to hit bottom
[2:20:26.540 --> 2:20:27.540]  And we may
[2:20:27.540 --> 2:20:29.540]  But I don't care
[2:20:29.540 --> 2:20:30.540]  In spite of no matter
[2:20:30.540 --> 2:20:33.540]  How hard the hit is
[2:20:33.540 --> 2:20:34.540]  The truth will bounce back
[2:20:34.540 --> 2:20:36.540]  And it's our job to do our best
[2:20:36.540 --> 2:20:38.540]  No matter what the condition is
[2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:40.540]  Because in the long run
[2:20:40.540 --> 2:20:41.540]  A long view of history
[2:20:41.540 --> 2:20:42.540]  Truth will prevail
[2:20:42.540 --> 2:20:44.540]  And so it's our responsibility
[2:20:44.540 --> 2:20:45.540]  To make sure that that happens
[2:20:45.540 --> 2:20:47.540]  Exactly and compare you to
[2:20:47.540 --> 2:20:48.540]  Joe Biden
[2:20:48.540 --> 2:20:49.540]  It's night and day
[2:20:49.540 --> 2:20:51.540]  The accumulated gravitas
[2:20:51.540 --> 2:20:52.540]  The understanding of the truth
[2:20:52.540 --> 2:20:54.540]  Versus the system that is just
[2:20:54.540 --> 2:20:55.540]  Out of gas
[2:20:55.540 --> 2:20:56.540]  We'll come back with
[2:20:56.540 --> 2:20:57.540]  Jair Bezman off
[2:20:57.540 --> 2:20:58.540]  We'll talk about it all
[2:20:58.540 --> 2:20:59.540]  With Jair Bezman
[2:20:59.540 --> 2:21:00.540]  Powerful interview
[2:21:00.540 --> 2:21:01.540]  Tell folks tune in right now
[2:21:01.540 --> 2:21:02.540]  Because you are the final
[2:21:02.540 --> 2:21:03.540]  Equation
[2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:04.540]  You are what takes us to the
[2:21:04.540 --> 2:21:05.540]  Next level
[2:21:16.540 --> 2:21:17.540]  In Germany
[2:21:17.540 --> 2:21:18.540]  In Australia
[2:21:18.540 --> 2:21:19.540]  In Canada
[2:21:19.540 --> 2:21:21.540]  And now even in Ohio
[2:21:21.540 --> 2:21:23.540]  Every blue state
[2:21:23.540 --> 2:21:25.540]  Every blue city
[2:21:25.540 --> 2:21:27.540]  Is announcing that they are
[2:21:27.540 --> 2:21:29.540]  Establishing emergency
[2:21:29.540 --> 2:21:30.540]  COVID centers
[2:21:30.540 --> 2:21:31.540]  For people that refuse to be
[2:21:31.540 --> 2:21:33.540]  Tested or people that are
[2:21:33.540 --> 2:21:35.540]  Tested but refuse to stay in
[2:21:35.540 --> 2:21:36.540]  Place while the results are
[2:21:36.540 --> 2:21:37.540]  Coming back
[2:21:37.540 --> 2:21:38.540]  Or those that supposedly
[2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:39.540]  Break quarantine
[2:21:39.540 --> 2:21:41.540]  This of course is all based
[2:21:41.540 --> 2:21:42.540]  On the tests that are
[2:21:42.540 --> 2:21:44.540]  Over 90% fraudulent
[2:21:44.540 --> 2:21:46.540]  And were designed to be so
[2:21:46.540 --> 2:21:48.540]  This is a power grab
[2:21:48.540 --> 2:21:50.540]  The world government globalist
[2:21:50.540 --> 2:21:52.540]  System is in trouble
[2:21:52.540 --> 2:21:53.540]  All over the planet
[2:21:53.540 --> 2:21:54.540]  Free peoples are trying to
[2:21:54.540 --> 2:21:55.540]  Pull out of it
[2:21:55.540 --> 2:21:58.540]  And every blue area
[2:21:58.540 --> 2:21:59.540]  I use the term blue
[2:21:59.540 --> 2:22:00.540]  As if in the US
[2:22:00.540 --> 2:22:01.540]  Blue for Democrats
[2:22:01.540 --> 2:22:02.540]  Red for Republicans
[2:22:02.540 --> 2:22:04.540]  Is basically globalist
[2:22:04.540 --> 2:22:05.540]  Or communist
[2:22:05.540 --> 2:22:06.540]  And authoritarian
[2:22:06.540 --> 2:22:07.540]  And they are using this
[2:22:07.540 --> 2:22:08.540]  As they're covered
[2:22:08.540 --> 2:22:10.540]  For an authoritarian takeover
[2:22:10.540 --> 2:22:11.540]  Because they know the
[2:22:11.540 --> 2:22:12.540]  World's waiting to them
[2:22:12.540 --> 2:22:13.540]  It's a very simple equation
[2:22:13.540 --> 2:22:14.540]  It's illegal
[2:22:14.540 --> 2:22:16.540]  You must resist it
[2:22:16.540 --> 2:22:18.540]  Remember the enemy is
[2:22:18.540 --> 2:22:20.540]  Working around the clock
[2:22:20.540 --> 2:22:21.540]  To suppress voices of
[2:22:21.540 --> 2:22:23.540]  Independent people all over
[2:22:23.540 --> 2:22:25.540]  The world
[2:22:25.540 --> 2:22:27.540]  The globalist have a plan
[2:22:27.540 --> 2:22:30.540]  For total vertical integration
[2:22:30.540 --> 2:22:32.540]  Absolute authoritarianism
[2:22:32.540 --> 2:22:35.540]  To where you are a captive
[2:22:35.540 --> 2:22:37.540]  Of their devices
[2:22:37.540 --> 2:22:39.540]  Of their control
[2:22:39.540 --> 2:22:40.540]  But that is only a
[2:22:40.540 --> 2:22:42.540]  Means to an end
[2:22:42.540 --> 2:22:43.540]  Once they have the
[2:22:43.540 --> 2:22:45.540]  Tronic straightjacket in place
[2:22:45.540 --> 2:22:46.540]  They are on record
[2:22:46.540 --> 2:22:47.540]  That they will bring in
[2:22:47.540 --> 2:22:48.540]  Force inoculations
[2:22:48.540 --> 2:22:49.540]  That sterilize you
[2:22:49.540 --> 2:22:51.540]  And your family and worse
[2:22:51.540 --> 2:22:52.540]  Many
[2:22:52.540 --> 2:22:53.540]  With the vaccines
[2:22:53.540 --> 2:22:54.540]  Being pushed by the United Nations
[2:22:54.540 --> 2:22:56.540]  Actually give people polio
[2:22:56.540 --> 2:22:58.540]  And actually give people cancer
[2:22:58.540 --> 2:23:00.540]  Most cancer is viral
[2:23:00.540 --> 2:23:02.540]  That's a big secret
[2:23:02.540 --> 2:23:03.540]  But the secret
[2:23:03.540 --> 2:23:04.540]  Is beginning to come out
[2:23:04.540 --> 2:23:05.540]  It's even in the
[2:23:05.540 --> 2:23:07.540]  Associated Press
[2:23:07.540 --> 2:23:08.540]  Remember
[2:23:08.540 --> 2:23:10.540]  All of these banned videos
[2:23:10.540 --> 2:23:11.540]  And reports
[2:23:11.540 --> 2:23:12.540]  Are banned on video
[2:23:12.540 --> 2:23:13.540]  But only you can share them
[2:23:13.540 --> 2:23:15.540]  And save humanity
[2:23:15.540 --> 2:23:17.540]  I've got some bad news for you
[2:23:17.540 --> 2:23:18.540]  I've got some really bad news
[2:23:18.540 --> 2:23:20.540]  And I've got some good news
[2:23:20.540 --> 2:23:22.540]  The bad news is
[2:23:22.540 --> 2:23:23.540]  Even if Trump gets re-elected
[2:23:23.540 --> 2:23:24.540]  They're gonna still trigger
[2:23:24.540 --> 2:23:25.540]  Attempts at martial law
[2:23:25.540 --> 2:23:26.540]  Medical lockdowns
[2:23:26.540 --> 2:23:27.540]  Race riots
[2:23:27.540 --> 2:23:28.540]  And a depression
[2:23:28.540 --> 2:23:29.540]  That's the globalist
[2:23:29.540 --> 2:23:30.540]  They're trying to bring
[2:23:30.540 --> 2:23:31.540]  America to our knees
[2:23:31.540 --> 2:23:34.540]  Now if Trump doesn't get elected
[2:23:34.540 --> 2:23:35.540]  They're still planning to
[2:23:35.540 --> 2:23:36.540]  Bring us to our knees
[2:23:36.540 --> 2:23:37.540]  And really try to break
[2:23:37.540 --> 2:23:38.540]  Our will
[2:23:38.540 --> 2:23:39.540]  And bring us into a
[2:23:39.540 --> 2:23:40.540]  Super intense depression
[2:23:40.540 --> 2:23:41.540]  Total control
[2:23:41.540 --> 2:23:42.540]  And like Australia's already
[2:23:42.540 --> 2:23:43.540]  Doing
[2:23:43.540 --> 2:23:44.540]  Rounding up and arresting people
[2:23:44.540 --> 2:23:45.540]  That criticize
[2:23:45.540 --> 2:23:46.540]  What the left are doing
[2:23:46.540 --> 2:23:48.540]  That's the really bad news
[2:23:48.540 --> 2:23:49.540]  The good news is
[2:23:49.540 --> 2:23:50.540]  This has triggered people
[2:23:50.540 --> 2:23:51.540]  Out of their sleep
[2:23:51.540 --> 2:23:52.540]  All over the world
[2:23:52.540 --> 2:23:53.540]  And the resistance is mounting
[2:23:53.540 --> 2:23:55.540]  And the globalists are panicking
[2:23:55.540 --> 2:23:56.540]  So bottom line
[2:23:56.540 --> 2:23:57.540]  We're in the fight
[2:23:57.540 --> 2:23:58.540]  We're starting to win
[2:23:58.540 --> 2:23:59.540]  But it's serious
[2:23:59.540 --> 2:24:01.540]  So pray to God
[2:24:01.540 --> 2:24:02.540]  For a global awakening

[2:24:18.540 --> 2:24:21.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[2:24:35.540 --> 2:24:37.540]  Unfortunately you've grown up
[2:24:37.540 --> 2:24:39.540]  Hearing voices
[2:24:39.540 --> 2:24:40.540]  That incessantly
[2:24:40.540 --> 2:24:41.540]  Warn of government
[2:24:41.540 --> 2:24:42.540]  As nothing more
[2:24:42.540 --> 2:24:43.540]  Than some separate
[2:24:43.540 --> 2:24:44.540]  Sinister entity
[2:24:44.540 --> 2:24:45.540]  That's at the root
[2:24:45.540 --> 2:24:46.540]  Of all our problems
[2:24:48.540 --> 2:24:49.540]  Some of these same voices
[2:24:49.540 --> 2:24:50.540]  Also do their best
[2:24:50.540 --> 2:24:51.540]  To gum up the works
[2:24:52.540 --> 2:24:53.540]  They'll warn that
[2:24:53.540 --> 2:24:54.540]  Tyranny's always lurking
[2:24:54.540 --> 2:24:55.540]  Just around the corner
[2:24:57.540 --> 2:24:58.540]  You should reject
[2:24:58.540 --> 2:24:59.540]  These voices
[2:25:00.540 --> 2:25:01.540]  So now we're under
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:02.540]  World government
[2:25:02.540 --> 2:25:03.540]  We're told humans are
[2:25:03.540 --> 2:25:04.540]  Non-essential
[2:25:04.540 --> 2:25:05.540]  We're told we're going to
[2:25:05.540 --> 2:25:06.540]  Give them deforestation
[2:25:06.540 --> 2:25:07.540]  Charles Griffin
[2:25:07.540 --> 2:25:08.540]  Has been totally vindicated
[2:25:08.540 --> 2:25:09.540]  You know I don't
[2:25:09.540 --> 2:25:10.540]  Say this to praise him
[2:25:10.540 --> 2:25:11.540]  We don't celebrate
[2:25:11.540 --> 2:25:12.540]  The fact that we were
[2:25:12.540 --> 2:25:13.540]  Righted enough
[2:25:13.540 --> 2:25:14.540]  We've been right about
[2:25:14.540 --> 2:25:15.540]  The world government
[2:25:15.540 --> 2:25:16.540]  The UN
[2:25:18.540 --> 2:25:19.540]  The CDC just apologized
[2:25:19.540 --> 2:25:20.540]  Last night and said
[2:25:20.540 --> 2:25:21.540]  Well the UN says
[2:25:21.540 --> 2:25:23.540]  COVID-19 is not airborne
[2:25:23.540 --> 2:25:24.540]  Even though all these
[2:25:24.540 --> 2:25:25.540]  Flu viruses and cold viruses
[2:25:25.540 --> 2:25:26.540]  Are
[2:25:26.540 --> 2:25:27.540]  So since they said that
[2:25:27.540 --> 2:25:28.540]  To cover up for China
[2:25:28.540 --> 2:25:29.540]  We're apologizing
[2:25:29.540 --> 2:25:31.540]  Because they're the boss
[2:25:31.540 --> 2:25:32.540]  Who made them God
[2:25:33.540 --> 2:25:35.540]  This is such an illustration
[2:25:35.540 --> 2:25:37.400]  how we're under this UN World System.
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:38.920]  So now I'm going to shut up,
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:42.680]  Jebbert Griffin, get into the ultra-rich funding communism,
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:45.440]  how it really works, the UN, what the big plan is.
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:46.880]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:49.360]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:51.480]  I really didn't know what to expect today.
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:53.440]  And the idea that you want to just throw the ball
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:56.280]  and let me carry it wherever I want to go is kind of dangerous
[2:25:56.280 --> 2:25:59.400]  because I don't really know where I'm going to go with this.
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:02.000]  I hadn't really thought about making a presentation,
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.040]  but I'm delighted to the opportunity
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:07.080]  because there was something you said early in the introduction
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:11.240]  that really caught my attention as possibly a theme
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:13.440]  to follow if I had the chance.
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:16.400]  And that was that back in the old days,
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:21.240]  that communism was really brought to the scene
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:23.760]  funded by the elitists, the very wealthy,
[2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:26.040]  very, very, very wealthy people.
[2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:27.720]  And these were the financial interests
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:31.320]  and the banking interests in New York City and in London.
[2:26:31.320 --> 2:26:36.800]  They were the ones that paid for Trotsky to go to and Lenin
[2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:40.520]  to, you know, all these people, they took them into Russia.
[2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:44.760]  They're the ones that instigated the revolution and so forth.
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:48.080]  So that's an important fact that people increasingly know about,
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:53.200]  but I don't think they consider the significance of that.
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:56.760]  I think the significance was best described by,
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:00.760]  oh my god, I thought I'd never forget.
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:04.200]  His name was a professor that wrote a lot of books
[2:27:04.200 --> 2:27:05.520]  about communism.
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:09.280]  Anyway, the phrase is simply that communism
[2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:13.360]  was the best enemy money could buy.
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:14.160]  Let's think about that.
[2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:15.040]  It was a tricky title.
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:16.360]  You're supposed to think about it.
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:19.280]  The best enemy money could buy was the idea
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:20.920]  that somebody would want an enemy.
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:23.320]  For a world.
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:26.160]  So why would somebody want an enemy?
[2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:30.280]  Well, that would be if you wanted to scare the daylights
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:31.640]  out of your people.
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:35.320]  Let's say that we go back to Machiavelli.
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:38.080]  And Machiavelli wrote that if you're
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:42.520]  a leader of a country, if you're a dictator of a country,
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:45.920]  a ruler, a hard-handed ruler, and the people are getting fed up
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:47.840]  with you and they don't like the high taxes
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:50.320]  and they don't like the limitations on their liberty
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:53.600]  and they're rising into a revolution or a revolt.
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:56.720]  Machiavelli said that you've got to engage in a war.
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:00.240]  You've got to scare these people with either a war
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:01.480]  or the threat of war.
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:05.000]  So they will be so frightened by the tyranny
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.880]  and the tragic destruction and death of war
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:13.520]  that they will accept any kind of cruelty,
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:16.240]  any kind of high taxation, any kind of resistance.
[2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:20.160]  I mean, resistance to their level of freedom and so forth
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:22.160]  because they're filled with fear.
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:25.080]  So he said words are what you should go into.
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:26.520]  So there is the trick.
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:28.480]  That's why you would want an enemy.
[2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:32.120]  You would want an enemy in order to bring your population
[2:28:32.120 --> 2:28:34.200]  under passive control.
[2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:36.840]  So they will accept all of the absurdities
[2:28:36.840 --> 2:28:39.800]  and the up fronts under liberty and their wealth
[2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:42.360]  and their privacy in the name of fighting the war.
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:45.680]  Well, now we find out that there were a lot of books
[2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:48.960]  and conferences held by people that we consider
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:51.200]  to be very, very, very, very wealthy,
[2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:53.640]  sponsored by them at least, think tanks and so forth.
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:57.920]  And one of them was, well, I won't go into too many details,
[2:28:57.920 --> 2:29:00.000]  but anyway, these books have been written
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:04.160]  and they talk about what else other than war
[2:29:04.160 --> 2:29:07.640]  can we use to frighten people into subservience.
[2:29:07.640 --> 2:29:10.120]  And so they talk about, well, we could use the fear
[2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:12.640]  of maybe environmental destruction.
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:15.840]  Maybe we could play that up and people would do anything
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:17.600]  to save the planet.
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:20.160]  Maybe we could have an act of terrorism.
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:23.040]  We could have somebody invade and blow up buildings
[2:29:23.040 --> 2:29:24.800]  and that would scare the dickens out of people.
[2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:26.760]  And they'd be willing to give up their freedoms
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:29.480]  in order to have security against terrorists.
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:31.440]  And of course, in those days, nobody was thinking
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:34.200]  about using a pandemic or anything like that.
[2:29:34.200 --> 2:29:38.280]  But if they had the technology in those days,
[2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:39.440]  by the way, that book was called,
[2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:41.040]  The Report from Iron Mountain,
[2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:43.520]  and if they had the technology back in the days
[2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:48.200]  when the mayor was the secretary of defense,
[2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:50.080]  why then they would have said, yeah,
[2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:52.040]  a threat from a viral infection, a pandemic.
[2:29:52.040 --> 2:29:53.600]  That'll scare the dickens out of everybody
[2:29:53.600 --> 2:29:55.000]  and they'll certainly give up their liberties
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:57.800]  and accept all kinds of obscenities against them
[2:29:57.800 --> 2:29:59.360]  in the name of security.
[2:29:59.360 --> 2:30:03.680]  So there you have why the very, very, very rich
[2:30:03.680 --> 2:30:05.760]  in the banking fraternity and all that,
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:08.160]  often find it, there's a book, yes,
[2:30:08.160 --> 2:30:12.600]  often find it advantageous to buy an enemy
[2:30:12.600 --> 2:30:15.280]  or finance an enemy or create an enemy.
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:16.520]  So it's not really an enemy at all
[2:30:16.520 --> 2:30:20.320]  or they're a companion, you might say, in their plan.
[2:30:20.320 --> 2:30:23.000]  So we go back to communism and we realize
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:26.320]  that communism for a long time up through the Cold War
[2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:28.960]  was the best enemy that money could buy
[2:30:28.960 --> 2:30:30.880]  because during those days,
[2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:34.240]  our leaders here in the United States were,
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:35.680]  and by the way, I fell for this
[2:30:35.680 --> 2:30:38.120]  because remember I came into this in the 60s
[2:30:38.120 --> 2:30:40.560]  and from the 60s through the early 70s,
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:42.120]  I was all worried about communism.
[2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:43.920]  Communism, look, they're taking over this country
[2:30:43.920 --> 2:30:44.960]  and that country and look,
[2:30:44.960 --> 2:30:46.960]  they're sending their agents into our own government
[2:30:46.960 --> 2:30:48.960]  and look, they're doing this and look, they're doing that.
[2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:50.240]  Nobody was much interested
[2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:52.640]  because they couldn't really see the effects of it
[2:30:52.640 --> 2:30:53.480]  on the surface yet,
[2:30:53.480 --> 2:30:55.480]  but I could see what was being done,
[2:30:55.480 --> 2:30:57.160]  the tunneling that was being underground,
[2:30:57.160 --> 2:30:59.520]  how the whole thing was being put into place.
[2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:02.200]  And, but the point is that I was so,
[2:31:02.200 --> 2:31:03.880]  and my friends were also concerned
[2:31:03.880 --> 2:31:05.440]  about communism, communism,
[2:31:05.440 --> 2:31:10.240]  that we didn't notice that some of our anti-communist leaders
[2:31:10.240 --> 2:31:11.280]  here in the United States
[2:31:11.280 --> 2:31:14.400]  who were leading this whole anti-communist movement
[2:31:14.400 --> 2:31:18.280]  themselves did not object to the principles of communism
[2:31:18.280 --> 2:31:21.160]  and they were building what you might call communism
[2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:22.760]  here in the United States,
[2:31:22.760 --> 2:31:24.920]  they were building a totalitarian system
[2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:26.480]  in the United States,
[2:31:26.480 --> 2:31:29.160]  calling it Americanism, calling it patriotism,
[2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:32.160]  and they were doing it in the name of fighting communism.
[2:31:32.160 --> 2:31:35.000]  And if it hadn't been for the threat of communism
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.280]  and the scaring of people with all that,
[2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:38.520]  well, then they couldn't,
[2:31:38.520 --> 2:31:40.480]  wouldn't have been able to build the system
[2:31:40.480 --> 2:31:43.760]  that we now see here in America that is really not,
[2:31:43.760 --> 2:31:45.640]  any different at all than communism
[2:31:45.640 --> 2:31:48.360]  or fascism or Nazism, the correct name for it.
[2:31:48.360 --> 2:31:51.600]  So they use an outside threat, many times they're financing
[2:31:51.600 --> 2:31:54.800]  to then create a police state control arm here.
[2:31:54.800 --> 2:31:55.640]  Exactly.
[2:31:55.640 --> 2:31:56.640]  Now, once you understand that,
[2:31:56.640 --> 2:31:58.560]  and this has happened over and over and over again,
[2:31:58.560 --> 2:32:01.080]  and then you have to look at today's world events
[2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:03.320]  and you say, are they doing that again?
[2:32:03.320 --> 2:32:07.800]  Now, this is a profound question because if they are,
[2:32:07.800 --> 2:32:09.960]  and there's no reason to think they wouldn't,
[2:32:09.960 --> 2:32:11.960]  it's a good trick, it always works,
[2:32:11.960 --> 2:32:13.800]  then that means that the communists
[2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:16.000]  that we see on our streets today,
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:17.880]  all the people that are scaring us
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:22.040]  and making us indignant and making us filled with rage,
[2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:24.640]  why don't they do something about this?
[2:32:24.640 --> 2:32:27.200]  Which is naturally what we would think.
[2:32:27.200 --> 2:32:30.120]  We have to realize that if those same forces
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:31.840]  that I was talking about are still running
[2:32:31.840 --> 2:32:32.920]  in the show here in America,
[2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:35.200]  we call that now the deep state,
[2:32:35.200 --> 2:32:38.280]  then we find out that yes, yes, yes,
[2:32:38.280 --> 2:32:40.400]  the deep state wants that
[2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:43.800]  because it's the best enemy you can buy right now.
[2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:46.480]  And so now suddenly the name George Soros pops up.
[2:32:46.480 --> 2:32:49.640]  Where does he get all of his money?
[2:32:49.640 --> 2:32:51.760]  Is he really this financial genius
[2:32:51.760 --> 2:32:53.600]  that makes all this money out of thin air?
[2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:54.440]  And he can-
[2:32:54.440 --> 2:32:55.680]  Turns out he's been getting it from the state department,
[2:32:55.680 --> 2:32:57.480]  tens of millions over the years.
[2:32:57.480 --> 2:33:00.840]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, and elsewhere too.
[2:33:00.840 --> 2:33:02.400]  Now you're looking deeper.
[2:33:02.400 --> 2:33:04.040]  See, finally we get off at this level
[2:33:04.040 --> 2:33:05.600]  of look those bad guys over there
[2:33:05.600 --> 2:33:07.240]  and anybody that opposes the bad guys
[2:33:07.240 --> 2:33:08.880]  has gotta be a good guy, right?
[2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:10.680]  I fell for that in the sixties.
[2:33:10.680 --> 2:33:12.440]  I'm not gonna fall for it again.
[2:33:12.440 --> 2:33:15.880]  Just because somebody is the apparent opponent
[2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:17.160]  of the bad guys,
[2:33:17.160 --> 2:33:20.280]  we have to look at that somebody just as deeply
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:23.000]  and to make sure that it's not controlled opposition.
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:23.840]  Because this is-
[2:33:23.840 --> 2:33:24.800]  I agree with you, so when we come back,
[2:33:24.800 --> 2:33:27.600]  give us your honest assessment of Donald John Trump.
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:28.800]  I mean, I know he has real enemies,
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:30.640]  but is it just power structures fighting over
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:32.840]  who gets control over the ship of state?
[2:33:32.840 --> 2:33:34.360]  I don't think Trump himself is a bad guy,
[2:33:34.360 --> 2:33:37.800]  but clearly he's not stood up to the censorship.
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:39.760]  He stood up to China and he's done a lot of good things,
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:43.160]  but he says, well, if I crack down on Antifa,
[2:33:43.160 --> 2:33:45.400]  it'll be an adjaprop, it'll make us look bad.
[2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:47.360]  Doesn't matter, it's your duty to do it.
[2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:49.120]  So it's a very, very dangerous precedent.
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:50.480]  We'll talk about what G. Edward Griffin,
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:54.200]  who is kicking butt, as usual, redpilluniversity.org,
[2:33:54.200 --> 2:33:55.320]  redpillexpo.org.
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:33:58.600]  Is there other psych people should visit G. Edward?
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:02.360]  Well, I think the redpillexpo.org is the big one right now
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:04.360]  because we're putting on the Red Pill Expo
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:05.920]  on October 10 and 11.
[2:34:05.920 --> 2:34:08.480]  We'll talk about the Red Pill Expo when we come back.
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:09.480]  We'll be right back.
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:19.960]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election,
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:21.960]  but I need to be honest with everybody.
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:24.480]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers,
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:26.760]  Communist Chinese, have come out and said
[2:34:26.760 --> 2:34:27.960]  they're going to contest the election.
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:29.960]  They know that Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:32.680]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause
[2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:36.160]  is going to further destroy the markets and the economy.
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:38.960]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove
[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:41.360]  that he's won the election, the Democrats have said
[2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:45.960]  they're going to break away politically and culturally
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:48.000]  into the blue states and blue cities
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:51.680]  and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:52.800]  the Republic even more.
[2:34:52.800 --> 2:34:56.360]  So until this cancer is rooted out,
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:34:59.160]  until these criminals that work with foreign governments
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:01.440]  that are trying to basically destroy the country
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:03.360]  are punished and removed, it's just
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:05.360]  going to continue to happen.
[2:35:05.360 --> 2:35:07.400]  And so that's the big problem here,
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:10.760]  is that we have systemic dug-in corruption by people
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:14.640]  that hate the country's very existence.
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:16.440]  Last week, Tucker Carlson came out
[2:35:16.440 --> 2:35:19.720]  and said America is becoming the Soviet Union.
[2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:22.520]  In many ways, we're worse than the Soviet Union.
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:24.720]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do,
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:27.120]  surveilling and censoring us.
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:29.320]  And we're going to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:31.040]  when it comes to force inoculations
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:32.920]  and the medical tyranny being rolled out
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:36.160]  by the United Nations now in control of what you can
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:37.800]  and can't say online.
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:39.080]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:41.400]  America is fighting for its life.
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:43.720]  And the enemy's number one mission
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:46.040]  is to get Trump out of office, and number two
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:49.080]  is to silence info wars, because we understand just
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:51.720]  how diabolical they are, just how evil they are.
[2:35:51.720 --> 2:35:53.440]  And we won't miss words.
[2:35:53.440 --> 2:35:55.920]  We know who the global star, we've got their number
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:35:57.080]  and we know how to beat them.
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:36:00.480]  And we cover it seven days a week live at info wars.
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:02.720]  And it's only because of your support.
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:04.800]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us,
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:07.000]  and take advantage of the sales and get great products
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:08.840]  at infowarstore.com now.
[2:36:08.840 --> 2:36:12.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.360]  It is now confirmed.
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:21.720]  Every organization affiliated with President Trump
[2:36:21.720 --> 2:36:25.880]  and his campaign is being attacked out of communist China
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:28.600]  in the biggest coordinated cyber attacks
[2:36:28.600 --> 2:36:30.520]  the planet has ever seen.
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:32.520]  Joe Biden has openly said China should run
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:34.160]  every facet of our lives.
[2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:36.440]  Speaker of the House Pelosi has said
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:38.960]  that China wants Joe Biden.
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:42.240]  Info wars is under dozens of different types
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:43.960]  of cyber attack a day.
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:49.040]  Info wars.com, news wars.com, prisonplanet.com,
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:52.600]  infowarstore.com, and they're not even hiding
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:36:56.760]  that it's coming directly out of communist China.
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:36:59.520]  America is fighting for its life.
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:01.280]  Everyone that votes for Joe Biden
[2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:04.520]  is a stooge of communist China and an idiot trying
[2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:07.920]  to destroy not just their future, but our future.
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:10.440]  But no matter what happens to this election,
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:13.280]  the awakening and the chain reaction has begun
[2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:14.880]  and cannot be reversed.
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:20.400]  The party was not going to go on forever.
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:23.480]  All the welfare, all the entertainment, all the decadence
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:27.960]  was only designed to get people domesticated, dumbed down,
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:31.920]  selfish, and most importantly, isolated.
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:35.720]  And now that most of the population is selfish, isolated,
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:37.880]  and very, very dumb, dumb and ignorant,
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:40.640]  the New World Order is facing its move.
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:43.360]  And they are now going to weaponize the giant masses
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:46.800]  of foolish followers who believe they just follow orders.
[2:37:46.800 --> 2:37:49.320]  They'll get another little piece of green,
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:51.480]  like when the chicken pecks at the lever,
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:52.560]  that all that they're really going to get
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:55.280]  is the news type around their foolish neck.
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:57.400]  Those of us that are aware and informed
[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:00.120]  can laugh at the mass of slaves, but remember,
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:03.480]  they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats,
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:06.320]  and so we've got to save them to save ourselves.
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:08.680]  And to do that, we've got to expose the globalists.
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:10.200]  We've got to take it to them politically
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:12.880]  and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:15.680]  that they've actually committed, expose the enemy now.
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:27.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:29.200]  Welcome back.
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:33.200]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, on the September 22nd Transmission.
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:36.680]  We've got the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the Liberty Movement here with us.
[2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:38.800]  And I should have mentioned this, the red pill
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:40.800]  out of the box, the one that's been in the air
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:42.800]  for a long time, the one that's been in the air
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:45.760]  for this, and I should have mentioned this, the red pill
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:47.120]  expo.org.
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:48.840]  I'm glad you're putting an expo on.
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:50.640]  Where is that G. Edward Griffin?
[2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:51.480]  How do people find it?
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:52.320]  How do people get involved?
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:53.840]  How do they go?
[2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:56.720]  Well, yeah, you're going to love where it is.
[2:38:56.720 --> 2:38:58.320]  It's on Jekyll Island, of course.
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:02.880]  Anybody that knows where the Federal Reserve was created
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:06.040]  and conceived in secret, they know it was Jekyll Island.
[2:39:06.040 --> 2:39:07.760]  That's the reason my book is called The Creature
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:09.080]  from Jekyll Island.
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:09.920]  So that's where it is.
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:12.800]  We're going to hold it right there in the convention center.
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:15.440]  And we debated long and hard, you will people come?
[2:39:15.440 --> 2:39:16.480]  We'll be there, afraid?
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:19.280]  Will they want to hide in their basements
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:20.400]  and put their masks on?
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:22.360]  Anyway, we said, nuts with that.
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:23.160]  We're tired with that.
[2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:24.200]  We're through with that.
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:25.040]  We're tired with that.
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:26.440]  When is it again?
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:29.800]  It's October 10 and 11, coming right up in about two weeks.
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:31.000]  You think I should come?
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  Two days.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:32.720]  Pardon?
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:34.840]  You think I should come?
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:36.160]  Well, I think you should come.
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:38.720]  If you don't come, I'll be very, very upset.
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:39.880]  You want me to come speak?
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:41.040]  I heard about this just the other day.
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:42.800]  That's why I wanted to get you on a few weeks ago.
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:43.400]  You want me to come?
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:45.360]  Well, I didn't know that you were available.
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:46.560]  Alex, let me check and see.
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:49.160]  We're loaded, but maybe we can move some time around.
[2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:50.400]  I think that would be wonderful.
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:50.960]  Well, I don't want to.
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:51.960]  I don't need to speak anything.
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:54.480]  I just, yeah, I don't want to cause a big stir there
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:55.520]  for no reason, though.
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:57.560]  But I'd love to be it, because you wrote the book,
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:39:59.320]  The Creature from Jekyll Island, explain that
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:01.280]  to folks that don't know.
[2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:03.400]  Well, yeah, The Creature from Jekyll Island
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:06.360]  is a second look, as I called it, at the Federal Reserve
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:07.200]  System.
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:10.040]  And as you already know, the Federal Reserve
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:12.200]  was created on Jekyll Island, which
[2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:14.440]  was off the coast of Georgia.
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:17.280]  Back in 1910, it was privately owned
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:20.880]  by these very bankers that we're talking about,
[2:40:20.880 --> 2:40:24.800]  the ones that created the Federal Reserve System, agents
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:27.440]  of the Rockefellers and the Morgans.
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:29.680]  And they had connections over with the Rothschilds
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:32.880]  and the Warburg overseas in Germany and England and France
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:35.800]  and so forth, international banking cartel, really.
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:38.840]  And so this is the story of how that came about.
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:42.360]  And I saw it not as a story about money and banking,
[2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:45.280]  but it was a story of a crime, one of the biggest crimes ever
[2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:48.040]  committed in history, is the capture of the world
[2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:49.920]  through the monetary system.
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:53.960]  People say, gee, should we nationalize the banks?
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:55.960]  Well, folks, I'm here to tell you that years ago,
[2:40:55.960 --> 2:40:59.000]  the banks privatized the governments.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.120]  No, the government's not going to nationalize the banks,
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:03.080]  because the banks already run the government.
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:05.640]  And this is the story of how that came to be.
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:08.360]  So that's where we're going, and it's kind of symbolic.
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:10.240]  We're not going there to revere these guys,
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:13.600]  but to kind of wiggle our fingers and our noses at them
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:14.880]  and say, we're back, and we're going
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:17.200]  to take back our country and our world.
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:18.560]  So anyway, that's where it's going to be.
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:21.400]  And it's all about red pills, red pills, red pills.
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:23.440]  Our lives are filled with illusions,
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:26.120]  and it seems like the most important aspects of our lives
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:27.560]  have the biggest illusions.
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:28.640]  So that's what it's all about.
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:30.800]  And I urge people to come to our website.
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:33.320]  It's redpilexpo.org.
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:35.920]  If you can't make it in person, which I hope you can,
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:39.840]  you too, Alex, especially you, if you can't make it,
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:43.800]  of course, it's a live stream available.
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:45.920]  So it's under preparation right now.
[2:41:45.920 --> 2:41:47.320]  The orders are coming in.
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:48.880]  I'm looking at the corner of my computer,
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:50.760]  and bing, bing, bing, bing, they're coming in.
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:52.680]  So people are standing up, and they
[2:41:52.680 --> 2:41:56.280]  want to come stand tall as human beings and let the world be,
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:41:57.880]  and they're not going to wear any masks.
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:41:59.000]  I can assure you of that.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:00.880]  And they're not going to accept any vaccines.
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:02.440]  Yeah, no, I just like the idea.
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:03.720]  I don't do a lot of events myself.
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:04.640]  I just like the idea.
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:07.440]  I knew you were doing this, but here it's in Jekyll Island.
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:08.920]  Here it's going to the convention center.
[2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:10.600]  That is very, very exciting.
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:12.360]  So I definitely want to promote that.
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:13.360]  Everybody should go there.
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:15.760]  So does it run one day, two days?
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:18.080]  What's coming up with it?
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:19.160]  Well, it's two days.
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:19.800]  It's two days.
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:24.600]  And the third day, the Monday that follows it,
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:25.760]  is kind of a drifting day.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:27.960]  A lot of people are staying over because they want
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:28.960]  to do some sightseeing.
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:31.280]  That Jekyll Island is quite an interesting place.
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:33.240]  And it's also a hangout day for those of us
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:35.400]  that like to meet new people and form
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:38.920]  coalitions and form strategies.
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:41.120]  Well, everybody should go in defiance of COVID
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:42.600]  but to meet G.R.W. Griffin as well.
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:43.840]  So I knew that was going on.
[2:42:43.840 --> 2:42:45.040]  I forgot it was happening.
[2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:46.680]  I'm glad that I asked you about the website
[2:42:46.680 --> 2:42:47.880]  because you're such a gentleman.
[2:42:47.880 --> 2:42:50.480]  You would have never even plugged that this event is coming up.
[2:42:50.480 --> 2:42:52.440]  RedPillExpo.org.
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:54.840]  OK, let's keep, let's start getting back into it now.
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:42:57.120]  We've only got 50 minutes to the next hour.
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:42:58.560]  OK, 50 minutes.
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:01.160]  Well, we should have 15 days to talk about this.
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:02.600]  Well, 15 minutes to the next hour.
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:04.840]  So we've got about 20-something minutes, but go ahead.
[2:43:04.840 --> 2:43:07.040]  Oh, OK, well, that's helped a little bit.
[2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:08.840]  I guess where we were going with that
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:11.320]  is the fact that controlled opposition
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:15.080]  is one of the classic strategies of our opponents.
[2:43:15.080 --> 2:43:17.680]  And once we get a handle on that,
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:20.960]  we realize that it's not just the left versus the right
[2:43:20.960 --> 2:43:23.600]  because actually there's very little difference of you.
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:25.400]  I mean, the extreme left and the extreme right
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:27.320]  are the same, frankly.
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:29.760]  What's the difference between communism and Nazism?
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:32.520]  There's no difference except one has a hammer and sickle
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:35.320]  on the flag and the other one has a swastika.
[2:43:35.320 --> 2:43:38.480]  Once you get past that and the language that they speak, maybe,
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:42.120]  but you read their books and their theories, their ideology,
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:44.120]  they all believe the same thing.
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:46.240]  And they fight with each other like dickens,
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:47.880]  mainly not over what they believe,
[2:43:47.880 --> 2:43:50.160]  but because they want to see who's going to be boss.
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:52.600]  They're fighting for dominance in this world system
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:53.680]  that they want to create.
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:56.600]  So once you understand that and internalize on it,
[2:43:56.600 --> 2:43:59.240]  then you look at, now you can turn on your TV sets
[2:43:59.240 --> 2:44:00.680]  and say, what's going on here?
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:03.000]  Well, we see all these horrible things on the street
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.440]  and everybody hates them and look, they're good.
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:06.880]  Oh my gosh, we can't have that.
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:09.920]  Anybody would be better than these people, right?
[2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:12.600]  Wrong, it could be the same.
[2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:15.600]  You can't just judge a person on the basis of
[2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:18.360]  who they don't like or who they speak against.
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:21.320]  You've got to understand what their principles are,
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:23.680]  what they believe in and what have they done
[2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:24.880]  and what will they do.
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:27.640]  It's just not who they hate, but who are they?
[2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:29.080]  So this is an important lesson
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:33.080]  and I'm afraid I see Americans getting so upset
[2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:36.080]  with what is happening on the so-called leftists.
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:37.360]  It's not really the leftists.
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:39.320]  These people are professionals.
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:41.760]  They're not out there because of what they believe in.
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:43.600]  They're out there because they're receiving a paycheck
[2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:44.880]  from Mr. Soros.
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:46.880]  Now, if the White House or anybody else wants
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:48.120]  to do something about this,
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:51.360]  what the heck are they doing about Mr. Soros?
[2:44:51.360 --> 2:44:54.320]  Nothing, and that's the clue right there, you see.
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:57.320]  They could stop this immediately if they really wanted to,
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:44:59.520]  but no, the orders are, stand down.
[2:44:59.520 --> 2:45:01.800]  Stand down, the police don't go out, they don't return.
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:05.200]  They want the violence, they want the destruction.
[2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:07.840]  They want blood in the streets, they want hatred.
[2:45:07.840 --> 2:45:08.680]  Why?
[2:45:08.680 --> 2:45:11.760]  Because then people will say, please, Mr. President,
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:15.640]  give us martial law and that's the end game.
[2:45:15.640 --> 2:45:17.520]  It's so clear, it's so clear,
[2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:18.520]  so we have to be careful.
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:21.840]  Let's pull back, there clearly is a good versus evil angle.
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:23.600]  And if you look at what the left funds,
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:26.320]  they want pedophilia, they want destruction of the family,
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:29.000]  they want to dump people down, they want to poison people.
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:31.480]  A, is that accurate from your research and why?
[2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:34.920]  It really seems there's a real Satanism underbelly to this.
[2:45:34.920 --> 2:45:36.960]  There is, there's no question about it.
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:38.480]  I mean, there's no defense of,
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:43.200]  and then take a good read of Mein Kampf,
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:44.520]  Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[2:45:44.520 --> 2:45:46.760]  He also was a Satanist, he also was an occultist.
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:48.720]  He also wanted to destroy the family.
[2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:51.400]  All the things that we don't like about communism
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:53.520]  is in the extreme right, the Nazis,
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:55.800]  the Nazis and the fascists believe the same thing,
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:45:56.920]  that's my point.
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:58.440]  We get so focused at one group,
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:01.840]  we forget that, hey, evil is universal.
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:03.640]  It's not just in one group.
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:05.760]  Any of these, these violent groups
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:08.280]  and ideologically collectivist groups
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:09.960]  have the same belief system.
[2:46:09.960 --> 2:46:11.440]  So we have to look deeper than that.
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:12.280]  That's my only point.
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:13.120]  Yes, I agree with you.
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:15.560]  That's right, anything that has authoritarian power
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:17.960]  can be hijacked and used for evil.
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:22.040]  Exactly, and will be, it always will be.
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:23.960]  So that's my message here.
[2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:27.640]  And so when we come to the big, hard questions,
[2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:29.680]  well, what do we do about that today?
[2:46:29.680 --> 2:46:31.520]  Do we have any friends?
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:32.840]  And it's a good question.
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:35.360]  I don't, I know how to ask the questions.
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:37.320]  I don't always know how to answer them.
[2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:41.000]  I don't know what we can do about it, except be clear.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:43.440]  In our own minds, what we believe in
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:45.080]  and not just follow the leader,
[2:46:45.080 --> 2:46:45.920]  that's the only thing I can say.
[2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:47.640]  No, I agree that Trump's saying,
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:48.880]  hey, we got a vaccine,
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:50.520]  Trump does things I don't like,
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:52.240]  but he's also getting peace deals.
[2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:54.040]  I know they legitimately don't like him,
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:46:55.680]  but I'm also not naive.
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:46:58.080]  I don't think Trump himself is a deceiver,
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:00.280]  but obviously they're powerful forces.
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:02.120]  Like CNN first thought he'd be a good candidate
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:03.360]  for Hillary to be.
[2:47:03.360 --> 2:47:06.800]  So there's a lot of weird designs out there.
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:08.000]  Yeah, you got it.
[2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:10.440]  I couldn't agree with you more, Alex.
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:12.960]  And everybody, and especially politicians
[2:47:12.960 --> 2:47:15.040]  that have been around for a while,
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:20.040]  I would imagine that most of these big, well-known figures
[2:47:20.040 --> 2:47:23.760]  have something in their past that could be held over them
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:25.400]  to keep them in line.
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:28.840]  And that's what Epstein was all about, right?
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:33.400]  That was Epstein's job, was to compromise leaders.
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:36.960]  And we know that Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were very close.
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:39.040]  So is it possible that there's something there
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:41.600]  that they're holding over Mr. Trump to keep him in line?
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:44.080]  I don't know, I'm just asking the questions.
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:46.400]  I do know that this is the kind of thing
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:48.480]  that goes on all the time.
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:50.280]  So I wouldn't take it off the list,
[2:47:50.280 --> 2:47:51.440]  I wouldn't take it off the table,
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:53.760]  but it might be part of the explanation
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:56.840]  of why Mr. Trump is unable to do all of the things,
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:00.600]  actually do all of the things that he says he wants to do.
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:01.920]  Maybe he's not free to act.
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:04.400]  But we certainly know the Clintons were on the airplanes,
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:05.640]  they are compromised.
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:08.360]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:09.520]  I mean, if you look at the list,
[2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:12.280]  I mean, when you get to the royalty of England,
[2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:15.000]  Prince Charles and so forth, I mean, is there anything left?
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:16.680]  I mean, one thing we have to find now
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:18.320]  is just to photograph of the Queen.
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:19.160]  That would be something.
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:22.840]  Exactly, we're going all the way up the little monkey pole here.
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:26.880]  I mean, that's a great, great way to say it.
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:29.640]  G. Edward Griffin's our guest, redpilluniversity.org,
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:31.480]  we're going to break into two more segments with him.
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:33.200]  I want to invite him back up next week.
[2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:34.880]  I'm not trying to crash events.
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:37.280]  He invited me years ago, like 10 years ago to a event,
[2:48:37.280 --> 2:48:38.360]  Chuck O'Lile and I couldn't go,
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:41.120]  but this couple of things got me spoiling to travel
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:41.960]  because we're not supposed to.
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:44.240]  Who knows, I might show up at that.
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:45.600]  But I don't really care about speaking,
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:48.400]  but I might just fly out there and meet G. Edward Griffin.
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:50.200]  But seriously, don't forget, folks,
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:51.960]  we have the high-quality, swarble food right now
[2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:53.480]  that everybody should order.
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:55.360]  We've got a week to two weeks for delivery.
[2:48:55.360 --> 2:48:56.280]  We've got it in stock.
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:48:57.400]  Everybody else doesn't.
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:48:58.480]  They'll lie to you.
[2:48:58.480 --> 2:49:01.560]  And it's a key website we've got up on InfoWars.
[2:49:01.560 --> 2:49:03.040]  Store.com that you can find right now.
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:05.200]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[2:49:05.200 --> 2:49:08.600]  I've come to you many times and asked for your support.
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:10.400]  And you've always come through.
[2:49:10.400 --> 2:49:12.200]  And InfoWars has come through.
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:14.320]  We've never sold out, we've never backed down.
[2:49:14.320 --> 2:49:15.960]  We've always told the truth.
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:17.680]  We've made mistakes.
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:21.040]  But 98% of the time or so, we're dead on.
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:22.600]  And the enemy knows that.
[2:49:22.600 --> 2:49:24.640]  InfoWars is a thought leader,
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:26.400]  not just here, but around the world.
[2:49:26.400 --> 2:49:28.680]  And that's why the Chai Coms, Hollywood,
[2:49:28.680 --> 2:49:30.920]  the globalist want us off the air.
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:33.600]  Because their global plan of total tyranny
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:35.360]  and a post-human world will not succeed
[2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:37.160]  if we stay on air.
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:39.480]  If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now,
[2:49:39.480 --> 2:49:41.120]  they're going to shut InfoWars down
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:43.240]  and shut everybody else down as well.
[2:49:43.240 --> 2:49:44.080]  You already know that.
[2:49:44.080 --> 2:49:44.920]  It's out of the open.
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:47.960]  So, again, count the cost, focus,
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:50.160]  and realize how critical you are
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:51.720]  with your word of mouth, spreading the word
[2:49:51.720 --> 2:49:52.960]  that overrides the sensors,
[2:49:52.960 --> 2:49:54.440]  your financial support, getting the products
[2:49:54.440 --> 2:49:56.760]  at InfoWars.com, and your prayer.
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:49:57.600]  I'm praying for you.
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:49:58.600]  Please pray for us.
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:49:59.960]  Let's do this together.
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:00.800]  We're going to win.
[2:50:00.800 --> 2:50:02.480]  We are winning, but it's not going to be easy.
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:04.040]  The enemy's trying to take it all from us.
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:05.280]  Let's not let them succeed.
[2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:13.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:29.360]  InfoWars has been banned, arrested,
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:35.360]  attacked, and threatened because we are effective.
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:37.240]  The Great Awakening is here.
[2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:43.600]  Go to banned.video, download the videos, and share.
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:50.920]  Support the Information War at infowarstore.com
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:52.720]  and never give up the fight.
[2:50:52.720 --> 2:51:01.960]  InfoWars.com
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:29.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:31.160]  Well, do you ever griffin' does?
[2:51:31.160 --> 2:51:32.160]  He's here.
[2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:34.000]  He knows about history in science books.
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:35.640]  And so do I.
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:37.920]  And the globalist want to make you think science and history
[2:51:37.920 --> 2:51:39.160]  is some elitist thing.
[2:51:39.160 --> 2:51:41.360]  Once you get science and history, then you
[2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:42.560]  start tying it to everything else,
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:46.320]  then you put it into function, and then you're more successful.
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:49.080]  Most valuable thing is knowing how history operates,
[2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:50.440]  so you're not doomed to repeat it.
[2:51:50.440 --> 2:51:52.880]  Do you ever griffin' short segment now,
[2:51:52.880 --> 2:51:54.280]  long segment coming up?
[2:51:54.280 --> 2:51:55.760]  What else do you want to impart to the viewers
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:52:01.240]  and listeners about where we are on this planet right now?
[2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:03.600]  Well, that's another great, profound question.
[2:52:03.600 --> 2:52:05.960]  Where are we on this planet right now?
[2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:09.080]  I think, I haven't given this any thought,
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:12.280]  but I think we're at a spot that I'm glad I'm here.
[2:52:12.280 --> 2:52:14.560]  I can't think of any time in previous history
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:17.840]  that has been more important, where
[2:52:17.840 --> 2:52:22.440]  changes and efforts and conflicts being resolved
[2:52:22.440 --> 2:52:25.000]  going to make a bigger difference in the future of mankind
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:29.200]  than right now in this era and this decade in which we live.
[2:52:29.200 --> 2:52:30.360]  It's scary.
[2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:32.560]  There are a lot of things that could go wrong, probably
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:34.400]  a lot of things that will go wrong,
[2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:37.000]  but we have an opportunity here to make a difference
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:39.960]  in the long view of history and for the future development
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:40.800]  of mankind.
[2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:44.160]  We're coming up to a crossroads, as you know, Alex.
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:47.720]  They're trying to convert humans into robots or transhumans,
[2:52:47.720 --> 2:52:50.640]  whether half robot and half flesh.
[2:52:50.640 --> 2:52:52.520]  And all the reason they want to do that
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:55.280]  is because they know that that way they can control
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:52:58.240]  the neurological command center of the creature,
[2:52:58.240 --> 2:53:01.920]  they can control how humans will think or form humans,
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:04.840]  how they will think, how they will act,
[2:53:04.840 --> 2:53:06.760]  and that they'll have two classes.
[2:53:06.760 --> 2:53:09.840]  You know this, you've probably talked a lot about it,
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:11.440]  two classes of humans.
[2:53:11.440 --> 2:53:14.160]  They're the old style ones that are pretty much like we are
[2:53:14.160 --> 2:53:15.800]  today, but they will have this hybrid
[2:53:15.800 --> 2:53:18.400]  that they're working to develop, the transhumans,
[2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:20.880]  and they'll be all the slaves and the little robots
[2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:23.640]  that will do exactly what they're told.
[2:53:23.640 --> 2:53:27.120]  And so, and then the elite can live even without
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:31.440]  any fear of revolution or revolt on the part of the masses.
[2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:36.440]  And yeah, look at this, this is exactly what they want to see.
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:38.800]  So we have to stop that.
[2:53:38.800 --> 2:53:41.680]  I think it's our responsibility and our opportunity
[2:53:41.680 --> 2:53:44.080]  to put an end to that and to put in place
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:45.320]  the reasons for it.
[2:53:45.320 --> 2:53:47.520]  People get so issue oriented.
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:49.240]  They say, let me throw a reason out.
[2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:51.520]  I'm all for technology except it always has
[2:53:51.520 --> 2:53:53.120]  a Trojan horse built into it.
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:55.400]  It always is dehumanizing me.
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:53:57.240]  I love it if there was some, you know,
[2:53:57.240 --> 2:53:58.800]  beneficent group up there that was doing it,
[2:53:58.800 --> 2:54:01.680]  but no, they always give us stuff at a detriment.
[2:54:01.680 --> 2:54:04.600]  They never give us something that empowers us.
[2:54:04.600 --> 2:54:07.440]  Well, of course, you know, that's part of human nature too,
[2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:09.560]  because if they see, it's kind of like a dog.
[2:54:09.560 --> 2:54:11.200]  I mean, I hate to say this,
[2:54:11.200 --> 2:54:13.040]  and probably gonna get a lot of criticism for it,
[2:54:13.040 --> 2:54:15.320]  but I think that, you know, everybody has a dog,
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:16.880]  you know, the dogs are untrustworthy,
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:19.840]  no matter how loyal they are, if they're not looking
[2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:22.080]  and you put a piece of meat out on the floor
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:24.320]  and you say, no, no, dog, don't eat that meat.
[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:25.520]  It'll sit there and won't eat it.
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:27.240]  But you go out that door,
[2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:28.960]  and if you're gone more than 10 minutes,
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:30.920]  you come back, that meat is gone.
[2:54:30.920 --> 2:54:31.760]  And that's what's-
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:32.880]  That's the great allegory of Big Tech.
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:35.240]  They've been caught lying, abusing their trust,
[2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:37.040]  and now they're completely arrogant,
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:39.080]  and Congress doesn't know what's going on,
[2:54:39.080 --> 2:54:41.480]  and they've just run away with the future.
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:43.840]  Yeah, so people are like that.
[2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:45.440]  They leave them alone,
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:47.280]  and you put something very tempting in front of them
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:50.800]  that they really want, really want sooner or later,
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:53.520]  as long as you allow that temptation to exist,
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:55.760]  sooner or later, most of them are going to give in
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:54:56.600]  to the temptation.
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:54:57.880]  Let's say your buddy's got a super hot wife,
[2:54:57.880 --> 2:55:00.400]  and she's promiscuous, maybe the first three or four times,
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:01.720]  but he just leaves for a month,
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:03.840]  and says, hey, maybe stay at his house.
[2:55:03.840 --> 2:55:06.640]  You're gonna probably end up in the sack pretty quick.
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:11.080]  Well, I guess that fits in the category,
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:12.040]  what I'm talking about.
[2:55:12.040 --> 2:55:14.320]  What's that meat on the table, buddy?
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:17.000]  Humans can't be trusted, and we have to know that.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:19.880]  So when we build political systems and social systems,
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:20.720]  we have to-
[2:55:20.720 --> 2:55:21.640]  We've gotta put checks in to control it.
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:23.120]  You've gotta put checks in it,
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:24.640]  and make everything transparent,
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:26.720]  so it makes it easier for the human
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:27.840]  to do what he knows-
[2:55:27.840 --> 2:55:31.160]  To reward goodness, not badness.
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:32.960]  Yes, that's it, exactly.
[2:55:32.960 --> 2:55:34.600]  So back to the question.
[2:55:34.600 --> 2:55:37.600]  This is a time in history where we have a chance
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:39.880]  to bring all of these hidden elements,
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:42.040]  these ideas to the surface.
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:44.160]  It's not just about whether we should do this
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:45.000]  or whether we should do that,
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:46.720]  but we have to talk about why.
[2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:47.560]  Big picture.
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:49.680]  Don't talk about what's happening right now,
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:51.200]  and just the pieces, but the big picture.
[2:55:51.200 --> 2:55:53.960]  Let's talk about that with G. Edward Griffin,
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:56.480]  about the why of the universe, and the big picture,
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:55:58.440]  and how to get that 35,000-foot view,
[2:55:58.440 --> 2:56:00.240]  so you see the different players,
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:01.800]  and not just being one of the players,
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:03.360]  but understanding the whole game.
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:05.040]  How do you transcend the game,
[2:56:05.040 --> 2:56:06.960]  and not play the game, to stop the game?
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:08.480]  We'll be right back with G. Edward Griffin.
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:09.320]  Stay with us.
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:14.320]  He has the new website, we'll tell you about in a moment.
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:43.560]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place,
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:46.840]  they are on record that they will bring in force inoculations
[2:56:46.840 --> 2:56:49.760]  that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:53.200]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations
[2:56:53.200 --> 2:56:57.040]  actually give people polio and actually give people cancer.
[2:56:57.040 --> 2:56:59.000]  Most cancer is viral.
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:02.920]  That's a big secret, but the secret is beginning to come out.
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:05.520]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:09.360]  Remember, all of these banned videos and reports
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:10.760]  are banned on video,
[2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:13.880]  but only you can share them and save humanity.
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:25.120]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:27.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:31.400]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:33.400]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:35.400]  Is your city too safe?
[2:57:37.400 --> 2:57:39.400]  Well, not anymore.
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:41.400]  Introducing Democrats.
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:43.400]  Politicians so incompetent,
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:45.400]  they'll fill your neighborhood with riots,
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:50.400]  looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:52.400]  The secret is a special blend of corruption
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:54.400]  and good ol' crime.
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:59.400]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good ol' fashion stupidity.
[2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:01.400]  No more pesky law and order.
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:05.400]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[2:58:05.400 --> 2:58:07.400]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back,
[2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:10.400]  and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[2:58:10.400 --> 2:58:13.400]  But wait, vote for Democrats now,
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:15.400]  and they'll include rolling blackouts,
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:17.400]  election fraud, cancel culture,
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:20.400]  taxes, and more taxes.
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:24.400]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:26.400]  My idea with Griffin is our guest,
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:28.400]  and he was talking during the break,
[2:58:28.400 --> 2:58:30.400]  he would like me to come out to his red pill expo,
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:32.400]  and I just called my wife during the break,
[2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:34.400]  and that is the 11th and 12th in Jekyll Highland, Georgia,
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:36.400]  and we're tentatively gonna go.
[2:58:36.400 --> 2:58:38.400]  But regardless, you should go because it'll sell out quick.
[2:58:38.400 --> 2:58:41.400]  You have the website redpillexpo.org.
[2:58:41.400 --> 2:58:43.400]  We didn't even tend to fully plug this today,
[2:58:43.400 --> 2:58:45.400]  but it just came up, and so here we are.
[2:58:45.400 --> 2:58:46.400]  I wanted to go to some of the other events
[2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:48.400]  he's had at Jekyll Highland was never able to.
[2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:50.400]  But getting back to the final segment we had,
[2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:51.400]  we really appreciate you joining us,
[2:58:51.400 --> 2:58:52.400]  and obviously you gotta come on again
[2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:56.400]  before the expo regardless.
[2:58:56.400 --> 2:58:58.400]  I know we can get into the dialectic
[2:58:58.400 --> 2:59:00.400]  and how the globalists try to control both sides,
[2:59:00.400 --> 2:59:02.400]  but I know I'm not controlled.
[2:59:02.400 --> 2:59:04.400]  I know they're legitimately have tried to buy me off
[2:59:04.400 --> 2:59:05.400]  and tried to shut me up,
[2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:09.400]  and I know that they're not on me present.
[2:59:09.400 --> 2:59:13.400]  I agree, we've gotta watch out about amassing authoritarian power
[2:59:13.400 --> 2:59:14.400]  in the name of countering them
[2:59:14.400 --> 2:59:16.400]  because that ends up destroying us,
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:17.400]  and that any power will be abused.
[2:59:17.400 --> 2:59:19.400]  That's why you don't want to amass it,
[2:59:19.400 --> 2:59:22.400]  but overall just gut level and at every other perspective,
[2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:24.400]  I think Trump means well.
[2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:26.400]  He hasn't gotten some of what he once done.
[2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:27.400]  I'm concerned about him saying,
[2:59:27.400 --> 2:59:28.400]  oh, we've got a better vaccine,
[2:59:28.400 --> 2:59:29.400]  but then Gates gets mad about it
[2:59:29.400 --> 2:59:32.400]  and doesn't want that because he wants to control it.
[2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:33.400]  What is your view?
[2:59:33.400 --> 2:59:35.400]  Your real honesty, we won't hurt our feelings.
[2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:36.400]  We respect you.
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:38.400]  As long before Donald Trump came along,
[2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:39.400]  you were fighting the tyrants.
[2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:43.400]  Long before Q came along, you were there.
[2:59:43.400 --> 2:59:46.400]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[2:59:46.400 --> 2:59:50.400]  Well, yeah, I almost wish you hadn't asked me that question
[2:59:50.400 --> 2:59:52.400]  because I have a bad habit of,
[2:59:52.400 --> 2:59:55.400]  once I'm asked that question, I have to answer it.
[2:59:55.400 --> 2:59:57.400]  But before I do it, I want to make sure...
[2:59:57.400 --> 2:59:58.400]  But we're not censored.
[2:59:58.400 --> 2:59:59.400]  We're not in the Donald Trump cult, brother.
[2:59:59.400 --> 3:00:00.400]  We respect you.
[3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:02.400]  I know, and I understand all of that.
[3:00:02.400 --> 3:00:04.400]  Let me emphasize though, the moment ago you said
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:06.400]  our event was the 11th and 12th.
[3:00:06.400 --> 3:00:08.400]  It's actually the 10th and the 11th.
[3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:09.400]  All right.
[3:00:09.400 --> 3:00:10.400]  So we'll get rid of that.
[3:00:10.400 --> 3:00:11.400]  Teleprompter free.
[3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:12.400]  Don't worry.
[3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:16.400]  I think Mr. Trump is a politician,
[3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:18.400]  and that is neither good nor bad.
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:21.400]  I mean, we have politicians.
[3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:23.400]  But once we understand a man,
[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:25.400]  I don't care whether this is Mr. Trump
[3:00:25.400 --> 3:00:27.400]  or whether it was Barry Goldwater,
[3:00:27.400 --> 3:00:29.400]  or I don't care if it was George Washington
[3:00:29.400 --> 3:00:31.400]  or Thomas Jefferson.
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:33.400]  Once they are in politics in the modern world,
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:36.400]  the way our governments and systems are set up,
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:38.400]  they are not their own man.
[3:00:38.400 --> 3:00:40.400]  They have supporters.
[3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:41.400]  They have funders.
[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:42.400]  They have handlers.
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:44.400]  They have people that control the information they get.
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:46.400]  Giant complex bureaucracies.
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:47.400]  Yeah.
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:50.400]  And they even, I think, have people they fear.
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:54.400]  I think if I, if one of the reasons I decided years ago,
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:58.400]  if it ever became my opportunity to run for political office,
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:00.400]  I said, nope, nope, I'm not going to do it.
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:04.400]  And one of the reasons was that I know that the globalists,
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:06.400]  let's call them that at the moment,
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:10.400]  have ways of intimidating their candidates.
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:11.400]  And I don't think...
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:13.400]  Well, yeah, no, I mean, they go after your family.
[3:01:13.400 --> 3:01:14.400]  They go after everything.
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:15.400]  They go after your family, yeah.
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:17.400]  And if there's anything in your closet
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:19.400]  that you don't want to have brought out there,
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:21.400]  they're going to find it and all that.
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:23.400]  And if it's not there, they'll create it.
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:24.400]  They'll...
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:26.400]  I was about to say that the New York Times,
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:29.400]  BuzzFeed, all of them literally had the last four years,
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:31.400]  dozens of private detectives, groups,
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:33.400]  and there was nothing there because I just,
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:34.400]  I go to work at whatever, you know,
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:36.400]  I drink too much sometimes, that's about it.
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:38.400]  And they literally just think like,
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:40.400]  I just work all the time, there's nothing there.
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:42.400]  And they can't even get people to lie about me for money,
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:44.400]  so I've been blessed.
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:45.400]  Yeah.
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:48.400]  Well, I think, you know,
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:51.400]  if this cabal, let's call it that now for a moment,
[3:01:51.400 --> 3:01:53.400]  if they can assassinate the president
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:55.400]  in front of the whole world,
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:57.400]  they can certainly get rid of any president
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:00.400]  or any secondary figure with no problem,
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:03.400]  even with means that are not so obvious as assassination.
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:06.400]  There are ways of making people very, very sick,
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:08.400]  and you have no idea where that...
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:09.400]  I totally agree.
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:10.400]  So let me ask you this.
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:12.400]  The COVID thing is obviously a world government,
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:15.400]  UN power grab to put a mask over our face
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:16.400]  to make us take shots.
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:19.400]  This was always their big medical charity gamble.
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:21.400]  I mean, they were always building,
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:22.400]  is this their power grab?
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:26.400]  Did the global awakening precipitate this to come early?
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:29.400]  Or were they already planning this right on time?
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:31.400]  Well, I don't know about that one.
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:34.400]  I think it's been in the works much longer
[3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:36.400]  than I was aware of it.
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:39.400]  This is where, you know, I have so much to learn.
[3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  The idea of technocracy didn't really sink
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:44.400]  into my consciousness until about,
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:47.400]  oh, I'm going to guess about five or six years ago.
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:51.400]  But our opponents had the idea of turning our systems
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:53.400]  into administrative governments
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:54.400]  instead of elective governments.
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:56.400]  Administration by people.
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:02:57.400]  They don't even know who they are.
[3:02:57.400 --> 3:02:59.400]  It's an administration, it's a bureaucracy.
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:00.400]  Now, it's a computer.
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:01.400]  It's a machine.
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:03.400]  It's science, you know.
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:06.400]  It's the things beyond human control
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:10.400]  that makes it even harder to oppose in the mind of men.
[3:03:10.400 --> 3:03:12.400]  There's a false environment they're building.
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:13.400]  Absolutely.
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:14.400]  Yeah.
[3:03:14.400 --> 3:03:16.400]  So I don't know about whether they're on time or not,
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:18.400]  but they're very flexible.
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:19.400]  They'll do whatever.
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:21.400]  They'll postpone as long as they don't.
[3:03:21.400 --> 3:03:22.400]  They'll never give up.
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:23.400]  What is there in game?
[3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:26.400]  If they have total power that accelerate their plan
[3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:30.400]  30 years in the future, what is it they really want?
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:32.400]  Well, they just want total power.
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:36.400]  With that mean, I think the best way to envision it,
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:39.400]  in my mind at least, anybody that's in the military
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:40.400]  will understand it.
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:45.400]  When you go into the military, you no longer have freedom.
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:46.400]  You're taken care of.
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:47.400]  You don't have to worry about your food,
[3:03:47.400 --> 3:03:50.400]  your shelter, your healthcare, or anything like that.
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:54.400]  You're given housing and clothing and psychological counseling.
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:57.400]  Anything you want, entertainment, it's all taken care of for you.
[3:03:57.400 --> 3:03:59.400]  All you have to do is follow orders.
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:03.400]  And as long as you follow orders and without asking questions
[3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:07.400]  or objecting or showing any resistance at all,
[3:04:07.400 --> 3:04:09.400]  you will move up to the top.
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:13.400]  You will probably be a high-ranking officer
[3:04:13.400 --> 3:04:15.400]  and possibly even a general.
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:17.400]  But the minute you start asking questions,
[3:04:17.400 --> 3:04:20.400]  well, now you're a troublemaker and if you resist too much,
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:21.400]  you'll be demoted.
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:24.400]  You'll be given jobs, assignments that you don't like.
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:27.400]  And if you really are a bad boy or girl
[3:04:27.400 --> 3:04:29.400]  and you resist orders, you'll get shot.
[3:04:29.400 --> 3:04:32.400]  This is how I think that the world will look
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:36.400]  if these people have a chance to achieve their goals.
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:37.400]  It would be a military structure.
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:40.400]  There would be no need for money because you're in the military.
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:41.400]  You've got your food.
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:42.400]  You've got your clothing.
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:44.400]  You've got a nice house if you're an officer.
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:47.400]  If you're a high NCO, if you're a sergeant,
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:48.400]  you've got a nice house too.
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:50.400]  If you're private or something,
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:52.400]  you're probably living in the barracks.
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:54.400]  But you've got to put brain chips in your children.
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:55.400]  You've got to cut your son's testicles off.
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:56.400]  You've got to do exactly what you're told.
[3:04:56.400 --> 3:04:58.400]  And as long as that you do what you're told
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:00.400]  and you obey orders and you don't question...
[3:05:00.400 --> 3:05:01.400]  And for the family,
[3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:02.400]  we all agree and talk to the eight-year-old.
[3:05:02.400 --> 3:05:04.400]  He agrees to have his balls chopped off.
[3:05:04.400 --> 3:05:06.400]  It's the end of humanity.
[3:05:06.400 --> 3:05:07.400]  They're going to get us in the straight jacket
[3:05:07.400 --> 3:05:09.400]  and then make us give our humanity up
[3:05:09.400 --> 3:05:10.400]  because that's what this is.
[3:05:10.400 --> 3:05:12.400]  Yep, that's it.
[3:05:12.400 --> 3:05:14.400]  It's as simple as that.
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:17.400]  Because total power is destroying the human system forever.
[3:05:17.400 --> 3:05:19.400]  It's making us bow and give up our natural order.
[3:05:19.400 --> 3:05:21.400]  That's the final revolution.
[3:05:21.400 --> 3:05:23.400]  It's not even allowing normal human systems.
[3:05:23.400 --> 3:05:25.400]  That's how you win the war against humanity.
[3:05:25.400 --> 3:05:27.400]  And the funny thing about that,
[3:05:27.400 --> 3:05:29.400]  or the ironic thing,
[3:05:29.400 --> 3:05:32.400]  is that it'll still be controlled by real, genuine humans.
[3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:35.400]  People just like you and me.
[3:05:35.400 --> 3:05:37.400]  But they will be the elites.
[3:05:37.400 --> 3:05:39.400]  They'll be the ones that have the ability
[3:05:39.400 --> 3:05:42.400]  to direct the activities of all of the subhuman characters
[3:05:42.400 --> 3:05:44.400]  that they have created,
[3:05:44.400 --> 3:05:47.400]  the transhuman creatures that will outnumber them by far.
[3:05:47.400 --> 3:05:49.400]  But they will be totally subservient
[3:05:49.400 --> 3:05:51.400]  because they can be turned off
[3:05:51.400 --> 3:05:53.400]  by simply throwing the switch.
[3:05:53.400 --> 3:05:55.400]  It's that image of five years ago of Zuckerberg
[3:05:55.400 --> 3:05:57.400]  with thousands of his employees,
[3:05:57.400 --> 3:05:59.400]  VR goggles, hunched over,
[3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:01.400]  and he's walking bipedally,
[3:06:01.400 --> 3:06:03.400]  and they're like subhumans in his false reality.
[3:06:03.400 --> 3:06:05.400]  You're absolutely right.
[3:06:05.400 --> 3:06:07.400]  That's what this is, is they retain their humanity.
[3:06:07.400 --> 3:06:09.400]  We give ours up. That's their religion.
[3:06:09.400 --> 3:06:11.400]  That's it.
[3:06:11.400 --> 3:06:13.400]  I don't know.
[3:06:13.400 --> 3:06:15.400]  Do you have a very powerful interview?
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:17.400]  Thirty seconds. Go ahead and finish up.
[3:06:17.400 --> 3:06:19.400]  Well, my final conclusion
[3:06:19.400 --> 3:06:21.400]  is that I hope I'm wrong.
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:23.400]  I think I'm not,
[3:06:23.400 --> 3:06:25.400]  and it's bad news,
[3:06:25.400 --> 3:06:27.400]  but the good news is that it doesn't have to go that way.
[3:06:27.400 --> 3:06:29.400]  There's still time,
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:31.400]  and we have strengthened numbers,
[3:06:31.400 --> 3:06:33.400]  but we have to stand up like human beings
[3:06:33.400 --> 3:06:35.400]  while we can
[3:06:35.400 --> 3:06:37.400]  and quit following these insane orders
[3:06:37.400 --> 3:06:39.400]  to obey
[3:06:39.400 --> 3:06:41.400]  and open up our sleeves
[3:06:41.400 --> 3:06:43.400]  and let them inject stuff into our brains
[3:06:43.400 --> 3:06:45.400]  and into our veins.
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:47.400]  Oh, but we become immortal.
[3:06:47.400 --> 3:06:49.400]  Everything the Communist Satanists offer
[3:06:49.400 --> 3:06:51.400]  is a lie.
[3:06:51.400 --> 3:06:53.400]  I'll give it a 90% chance.
[3:06:53.400 --> 3:06:55.400]  I'll let you know in the next few days
[3:06:55.400 --> 3:06:57.400]  that I'm going to be there at your event, okay?
[3:06:57.400 --> 3:06:59.400]  All right. I'm going to announce it.
[3:06:59.400 --> 3:07:01.400]  90%.
[3:07:01.400 --> 3:07:03.400]  I'll let you know in the next few days.
[3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:05.400]  I'm probably going to come.
[3:07:05.400 --> 3:07:07.400]  That's wonderful, Alex.
[3:07:07.400 --> 3:07:09.400]  I would have gotten,
[3:07:09.400 --> 3:07:11.400]  invited you earlier, but I didn't know how to reach you.
[3:07:11.400 --> 3:07:13.400]  We love you, brother.
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:15.400]  The planets have aligned globally.
[3:07:15.400 --> 3:07:17.400]  They've aligned nationally.
[3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:19.400]  They've aligned financially, culturally,
[3:07:19.400 --> 3:07:21.400]  but most importantly, spiritually.
[3:07:21.400 --> 3:07:23.400]  We are living
[3:07:23.400 --> 3:07:25.400]  at a point in human development
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:27.400]  that will decide
[3:07:27.400 --> 3:07:29.400]  the entire future destiny of our species.
[3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:31.400]  So that's why big tech control
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:33.400]  by the very dark forces of the globalist
[3:07:33.400 --> 3:07:35.400]  is trying to dumb us down,
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:37.400]  isolate us, make us depressed,
[3:07:37.400 --> 3:07:39.400]  make us alone,
[3:07:39.400 --> 3:07:41.400]  and traffic control every aspect of our lives,
[3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:43.400]  literally grainwashing us
[3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:45.400]  with the stimuli that they look forward
[3:07:45.400 --> 3:07:47.400]  to us to take our birthright,
[3:07:47.400 --> 3:07:49.400]  not just of Americana,
[3:07:49.400 --> 3:07:51.400]  but of true Christendom
[3:07:51.400 --> 3:07:53.400]  and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[3:07:53.400 --> 3:07:55.400]  They are trying to create the new Dark Age
[3:07:55.400 --> 3:07:57.400]  where they have all the high technology
[3:07:57.400 --> 3:07:59.400]  and life extension,
[3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:01.400]  and we are walled off in a technocracy
[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:03.400]  that controls us through carbon credits
[3:08:03.400 --> 3:08:05.400]  and through a social credit score.
[3:08:05.400 --> 3:08:07.400]  This is their plan.
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:09.400]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance
[3:08:09.400 --> 3:08:11.400]  and say no.
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:13.400]  We must embrace God.
[3:08:13.400 --> 3:08:15.400]  You notice that over and over again
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:17.400]  the United Nations are supposed
[3:08:17.400 --> 3:08:19.400]  controllers and bosses,
[3:08:19.400 --> 3:08:21.400]  the great arbiter of truth
[3:08:21.400 --> 3:08:23.400]  that no one's allowed to disagree with
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:25.400]  has come out and said,
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:27.400]  nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:29.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[3:08:29.400 --> 3:08:31.400]  You get a lot of sunlight, it's on record,
[3:08:31.400 --> 3:08:33.400]  to produce a ton of vitamin D3
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:35.400]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:37.400]  when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3
[3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:39.400]  if you have zinc and vitamin C as well.
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:41.400]  That's why people get the flus
[3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:43.400]  because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:45.400]  Now, I've pointed this out
[3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:47.400]  and the media has called me a scammer
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:49.400]  for saying that there's hope
[3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:51.400]  that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[3:08:51.400 --> 3:08:53.400]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out
[3:08:53.400 --> 3:08:55.400]  and admit that you need vitamin D3
[3:08:55.400 --> 3:08:57.400]  and C, he should have also added zinc.
[3:08:57.400 --> 3:08:59.400]  Because the NIH website says
[3:08:59.400 --> 3:09:01.400]  you die without zinc.
[3:09:01.400 --> 3:09:03.400]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:05.400]  to admit the reality because so many doctors
[3:09:05.400 --> 3:09:07.400]  and nurses and experts in nutrition
[3:09:07.400 --> 3:09:09.400]  have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:11.400]  the public to get their vitamins.
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:19.400]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:09:31.400 --> 3:09:33.400]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:09:33.400 --> 3:09:37.400]  I'm your fill-in guest host for the last hour.
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:39.400]  My name is Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com.
[3:09:39.400 --> 3:09:43.400]  I cover geopolitics, espionage, Hollywood, film,
[3:09:43.400 --> 3:09:45.400]  and I do a lot of debates.
[3:09:45.400 --> 3:09:47.400]  So you can go check out my material.
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:49.400]  But today I want to talk about
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:51.400]  religious infiltration and corruption.
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:53.400]  This is a problem that's not unique
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:56.400]  to any specific group or denomination.
[3:09:56.400 --> 3:09:58.400]  It's a problem that has actually happened
[3:09:58.400 --> 3:10:02.400]  since the time of the primeval world, right?
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:04.400]  I mean, you go all the way back to Plato.
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:06.400]  You go all the way back to ancient Egypt.
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:09.400]  And big dynasties, big power structures
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:13.400]  try to co-opt religion for their own needs and ends.
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:15.400]  Plato himself, for example, talked about
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:18.400]  the need to create a noble lie, right?
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:22.400]  A fake religion that would prop up the state and its power.
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:25.400]  And ever since the advent of Christianity,
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:28.400]  the church has had a long struggle with this same problem.
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:31.400]  In the Middle Ages, there was the investiture controversy,
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:33.400]  the problems of simony, these kinds of things,
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:10:37.400]  where the state would often try to buy off the church,
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:40.400]  put bishops or put ministers in control
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:42.400]  that would do the bidding of the state.
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:44.400]  So it's always been a problem and it's not, again,
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:47.400]  unique to any specific group,
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:50.400]  be it Catholic, be it Orthodox, be it Protestant.
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:53.400]  So what I want to talk about today is the 20th century
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:10:56.400]  and in particular how the Roman Catholic Church
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:10:58.400]  was infiltrated and corrupted.
[3:10:58.400 --> 3:11:01.400]  My purpose is not to attack Catholics.
[3:11:01.400 --> 3:11:03.400]  I have a lot of Catholic friends.
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:05.400]  Some of my best friends are actually traditional Catholics.
[3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:08.400]  My point, rather, is to illustrate that
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:10.400]  because the Roman Catholic Church is the numerically
[3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:13.400]  largest institution in terms of Christianity,
[3:11:13.400 --> 3:11:16.400]  it was seen by the global elite as one of the key things
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:19.400]  to try to target and take over,
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:23.400]  not to necessarily totally destroy, but actually to co-opt.
[3:11:23.400 --> 3:11:27.400]  There was a famous sort of secret society document
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:29.400]  that came out about 100 years ago,
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:31.400]  and it's called the Altavendita,
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:34.400]  and this was a series of Masonic lodges in Europe
[3:11:34.400 --> 3:11:38.400]  that wanted to try to not destroy the Roman Catholic Church,
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:40.400]  but they said, you know what we need to do
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:44.400]  is actually co-opt and turn the office of the papacy
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  into an engine of globalism and revolution.
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:51.400]  And so I would recommend reading that document
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:53.400]  because it is very relevant to today's discussion,
[3:11:53.400 --> 3:11:55.400]  but one thing I want to point out is that
[3:11:55.400 --> 3:11:58.400]  just as you heard with G. Edward Griffin earlier,
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:01.400]  the difficulty and complexity of the situation
[3:12:01.400 --> 3:12:04.400]  is not just as simple as saying,
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:08.400]  well, there was a Masonic or a communist attempt
[3:12:08.400 --> 3:12:10.400]  to destroy the Catholic Church.
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:12.400]  It goes a lot deeper than that,
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:15.400]  and a lot of good historians and even Catholic historians
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:18.400]  and lawyers themselves in the last few years
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:21.400]  have actually dug up and written some really important works
[3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:24.400]  that detail how this infiltration happened.
[3:12:24.400 --> 3:12:26.400]  And the reason I want to talk to you about it
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:28.400]  is because it's the same for all of us.
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:31.400]  So whether you're in some other denomination
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:34.400]  or some other group, whether you're Orthodox Christian
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:37.400]  or whatever, it's the same pattern and plan
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:39.400]  that each of these powerful entities will use
[3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:42.400]  to buy off and control the religions.
[3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:46.400]  Now, if we think back to the last century,
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:49.400]  you know that I've covered in many of the global elite talks
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:51.400]  that I do, the writings of the most powerful,
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:53.400]  wealthy people on the planet.
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:56.400]  You know, Dr. Griffin talked about the Rockefellers
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:12:59.400]  and different power structures that funded movements
[3:12:59.400 --> 3:13:03.400]  that seemed to be antithetical to their own ideas, right?
[3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:06.400]  Why would a zillionaire capitalist fund
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:09.400]  something that would seem to go contrary to wealth
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:11.400]  and the attainment of wealth, individual liberties,
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:13.400]  markets, et cetera?
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:16.400]  The answer is that when you go and look at the reasoning,
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:20.400]  the methodology, it's because it's a weapon, right?
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:23.400]  You could actually use these ideologies as a weapon
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:26.400]  to destroy other countries.
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:28.400]  Remember Anthony Sutton, he wrote a famous book,
[3:13:28.400 --> 3:13:30.400]  actually I have it right here.
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:32.400]  He wrote a book called The Wall Street
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:34.400]  in the Bolshevik Revolution.
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:37.400]  And this is roughly what G. Edgar Griffin was talking about
[3:13:37.400 --> 3:13:40.400]  earlier when he was talking about how the Bolsheviks
[3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:43.400]  had funding from the West, from very wealthy families
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:45.400]  and bankers in the West.
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:48.400]  And this was done as a way to create a revolution
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:51.400]  to destroy the existing Christian culture.
[3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:55.400]  Now we're seeing this here with the similarities
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:58.400]  to the color revolution models, right?
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:01.400]  I made a video months ago talking about
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:04.400]  how the color revolution model was what we're now seeing
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:07.400]  in the US when we started seeing these sort of
[3:14:07.400 --> 3:14:09.400]  so-called protests, more like riots, right?
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:11.400]  And the destruction, burning of cities.
[3:14:11.400 --> 3:14:13.400]  Now they're openly saying we're going to burn the cities
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:15.400]  down to the ground. Where does this come from?
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:17.400]  It's not out of nowhere.
[3:14:17.400 --> 3:14:21.400]  Right? That if you look at the money that the State Department
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:25.400]  put into the Soros to putting into the color revolutions
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:28.400]  in the Soviet satellite states, right?
[3:14:28.400 --> 3:14:32.400]  These color revolutions were a model of destabilization.
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:37.400]  And that model utilized a lot of liberal, Marxist,
[3:14:37.400 --> 3:14:40.400]  democratic, you could say, ideologies.
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:44.400]  You can morph it to fit the culture that you're trying to target.
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:48.400]  And it would do that by then destabilizing the society
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:50.400]  and bringing to power, you know,
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:52.400]  something under the guise of freedom,
[3:14:52.400 --> 3:14:54.400]  under the guise of human rights.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:57.400]  And they would utilize these NGOs, these think tanks,
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:15:01.400]  as the means of subversion in these countries, right?
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:04.400]  Ottpor, you saw that revolution of the fist, Ottpor.
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:08.400]  That was the first successful model of this in Serbia,
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:11.400]  if I recall the Rose Revolution, I think it was.
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:15.400]  And that was the same fist that you'll see this used in Black Lives Matter, right?
[3:15:15.400 --> 3:15:19.400]  It's they just copy and paste the same symbolism over to these different groups.
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:22.400]  Now, who or what is this color revolution model?
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:27.400]  It's a model that is a CIA funded thing that goes back to the Cold War, right?
[3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:30.400]  So the auspices of the Cold War is what I want you to keep in mind.
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:33.400]  This threat, oh, we've got to do what we've got to do
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:36.400]  because of communism, because of the Reds, right?
[3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:40.400]  And I'm not saying that there's not a problem with communist Marxist ideology.
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:45.400]  There is. It's a heinous, anti-human, terrible ideology.
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:52.400]  But the solution that the elite want is sometimes even worse than what they're fighting against, right?
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:15:55.400]  The propped up enemy, right? We think of propped up enemies.
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:15:59.400]  We think of a bin Laden, we think of these different so-called dictators
[3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:03.400]  that America has to go in and take over and destroy and whatever.
[3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:08.400]  These are oftentimes not the real reasons that we're going into those countries.
[3:16:08.400 --> 3:16:13.400]  And I think a lot of people have become aware of this with the weapons of mass destruction, this kind of stuff, right?
[3:16:13.400 --> 3:16:18.400]  So you see these kinds of guys that are propped up by these bigger level institutions.
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:21.400]  The reason I say all that is because it's not going to be any different
[3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:24.400]  when we come to the religious institutions.
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:30.400]  They're bought off, they're co-opted in the exact same pattern, model, and way.
[3:16:30.400 --> 3:16:32.400]  How do I know that? How can I prove that to you?
[3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:35.400]  I'm going to prove it to you. I've got the documents, folks.
[3:16:35.400 --> 3:16:40.400]  I've got the documents right here. The Rockefellers, an American dynasty, collared in Horowitz.
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:42.400]  Now, this is not a conspiracy book, right?
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:49.400]  This is a mainline authorized biography of the Rockefellers from their own archives, right?
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:54.400]  So just like Carol Quigley wrote the history of the 20th century from the CFR archives,
[3:16:54.400 --> 3:16:57.400]  so they're writing it from the Rockefeller archives.
[3:16:57.400 --> 3:17:05.400]  And there's an important chapter that starts on about page 135 or 6.
[3:17:05.400 --> 3:17:11.400]  And it's about the funding of religious change movements.
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:15.400]  You probably know this as the ecumenist movement or ecumenism.
[3:17:15.400 --> 3:17:19.400]  Now, on the surface, it sounds good, right? It sounds like a nice idea.
[3:17:19.400 --> 3:17:22.400]  Why don't we all get together and have some meetings?
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:28.400]  There's all these different groups and sects and dividing arguments between religious groups.
[3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:32.400]  Why don't we get together and talk it out, and then maybe we can come to some resolution?
[3:17:32.400 --> 3:17:35.400]  And I would say, in theory, that's fine. It sounds great.
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:37.400]  There's nothing inherently wrong with doing that.
[3:17:37.400 --> 3:17:42.400]  We should do that. We should have dialogue that's profitable to understand where we're all coming from.
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:46.400]  However, that's not what happened in the ecumenist movement.
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:52.400]  In fact, the Rockefeller's will put dozens of millions of dollars into the ecumenist movement
[3:17:52.400 --> 3:17:57.400]  to steer it and control it when it was new into a certain direction.
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:01.400]  When we come back from the break, I'm going to explain now and show you what their goal was,
[3:18:01.400 --> 3:18:05.400]  a one-world religion from their own statements and writings.
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:09.400]  This is Jay Dyer. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:12.400]  Last week, Tucker Carlson came out and said,
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:17.400]  America is becoming the Soviet Union. In many ways, we're worse than the Soviet Union.
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:22.400]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what Big Tech could do, surveilling and censoring us.
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:26.400]  And we're going to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to forced inoculations
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:33.400]  and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what you can and can't say online.
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:36.400]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting for its life.
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:42.400]  And the enemy's number one mission is to get Trump out of office and number two is to silence info wars
[3:18:42.400 --> 3:18:47.400]  because we understand just how diabolical they are, just how evil they are.
[3:18:47.400 --> 3:18:50.400]  And we want men's words. We know who the globalists are.
[3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:52.400]  We've got their number and we know how to beat them.
[3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:58.400]  And we cover it seven days a week live at info wars and it's only because of your support.
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:01.400]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us and take advantage of the sales

[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:07.400]  The globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:42.400]  But now, boy, as this brain degenerates, we are seeing walking public dementia
[3:19:42.400 --> 3:19:46.400]  on the biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election.
[3:19:46.400 --> 3:19:49.400]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[3:19:49.400 --> 3:19:54.400]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population
[3:19:54.400 --> 3:19:57.400]  when not even one tenth of 1% have actually died.
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:02.400]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damaged statements out
[3:20:02.400 --> 3:20:05.400]  is emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[3:20:05.400 --> 3:20:10.400]  How is anyone even putting up with this? It is beyond bizarre.
[3:20:10.400 --> 3:20:14.400]  I've got some bad news for you, and I've got some really bad news, and I've got some good news.
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:19.400]  The bad news is, even if Trump gets reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at
[3:20:19.400 --> 3:20:23.400]  martial law, medical lockdowns, race riots, and a depression.
[3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:26.400]  That's the globalists. They're trying to bring America to our knees.
[3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:30.400]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees
[3:20:30.400 --> 3:20:34.400]  and really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression,
[3:20:34.400 --> 3:20:38.400]  total control, and like Australia is already doing, rounding up and arresting people
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:41.400]  that criticize what the left are doing.
[3:20:41.400 --> 3:20:45.400]  That's the really bad news. The good news is, this has triggered people out of their sleep
[3:20:45.400 --> 3:20:49.400]  all over the world, and the resistance is mounting, and the globalists are panicking.
[3:20:49.400 --> 3:20:53.400]  So, bottom line, we're in the fight. We're starting to win, but it's serious.
[3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:56.400]  So, pray to God for a global awakening.

[3:21:30.400 --> 3:21:34.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on your guest host, Jay Dyer.

[3:21:39.400 --> 3:21:44.400]  There's a lot of good stuff there that will definitely keep you guarded against the craziness
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:52.400]  that we're going into in the present era of all this madness, all the attacks on our country.
[3:21:52.400 --> 3:21:56.400]  So, one of the key attacks on our country came through the religious realm,
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:22:01.400]  and I wanted to point out that the Rockefeller authorized biography
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:09.400]  has an entire chapter on the creation, funding, and steering of the ecumenical One World Religion movement.
[3:22:09.400 --> 3:22:14.400]  And if you doubt that it was always intended by the time they bought it off to be a One World Religion movement,
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:18.400]  then let me read you the quote of Junior Rockefeller himself, who said,
[3:22:18.400 --> 3:22:22.400]  that it was time to set aside all the denominational emphases.
[3:22:22.400 --> 3:22:28.400]  Instead, it's time for cooperation. In the large cities, I see great religious centers,
[3:22:28.400 --> 3:22:33.400]  small places instead of a dozen little dying churches competing with one another.
[3:22:33.400 --> 3:22:37.400]  I see strong churches uniting the Christian life of the town.
[3:22:37.400 --> 3:22:41.400]  I see the church molding the thought of the world as it had never done before,
[3:22:41.400 --> 3:22:47.400]  leading a great movement and literally establishing the kingdom of God on earth.
[3:22:47.400 --> 3:22:52.400]  Right after this, Junior Rockefeller gave a total, get this,
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:23:02.400]  in the 1920s and 30s of $75 million to global inter-church, interdenominational ecumenist movements.
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:07.400]  Now, that social gospel that he's funding here, right,
[3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:12.400]  that is not a gospel about, you know, what we think of the Bible, you know,
[3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:17.400]  talking about Jesus dying and rising from the dead, this kind of stuff.
[3:23:17.400 --> 3:23:22.400]  It's a religion with the demythilized, demythilized miraculous,
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:26.400]  or the removal of the miraculous, that kind of stuff to turn it into a social religion,
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:30.400]  social gospel, or sometimes called liberation theology,
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:34.400]  that's funded by Junior Rockefeller.
[3:23:34.400 --> 3:23:38.400]  And he says, the New World, in the next page, page 153,
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:42.400]  the New World needs a new internationalist gospel.
[3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:45.400]  And in fact, it is Junior Rockefeller, according to Colin Horowitz,
[3:23:45.400 --> 3:23:52.400]  who would become the most important financier of liberal Protestantism in the 20th, 20th century.
[3:23:52.400 --> 3:23:58.400]  It's even wilder than that because after that, they go on the Rockefellers to build a giant cathedral
[3:23:58.400 --> 3:24:03.400]  that would be their own ecumenical cathedrals known as Riverside Church.
[3:24:03.400 --> 3:24:10.400]  And in this Gothic edifice, they erected statues to Confucius, Moses,
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:15.400]  Hegel, Dante, Muhammad, and Darwin.
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:20.400]  You could not get a better example of an original world religion church
[3:24:20.400 --> 3:24:23.400]  than what Junior Rockefeller had built.
[3:24:23.400 --> 3:24:29.400]  And he said, this would be the key capstone in his mind for the coming world religion
[3:24:29.400 --> 3:24:34.400]  that would not be interested in, you know, Jesus as the way the truth of life
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:35.400]  or something like that, right?
[3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:39.400]  It's a new type of religion that would go along with, right,
[3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:42.400]  the previous chapter in the Rockefeller biography, chapter eight,
[3:24:42.400 --> 3:24:47.400]  is all about the CFR, the creation of the CFR in 1921,
[3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:53.400]  which would steer the U.S. into a interventionist policy,
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:24:57.400]  into a global affairs world empire, right?
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:24:59.400]  This is literally what they say they wanted to do.
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:03.400]  And this was with the aid of J.P. Morgan, Woodrow, Wilson,
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:06.400]  Colonel Edwin Mandelhouse, all that kind of stuff that you probably heard of.
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:11.400]  All of that was in concert with the Rockefeller setting up the CFR in 1921
[3:25:11.400 --> 3:25:18.400]  at the same time as they're basically funding and steering the entire ecumenist movement,
[3:25:18.400 --> 3:25:23.400]  even to the point of eventually creating what you know as the World Council of Churches
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:25.400]  or the National Council of Churches.
[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:29.400]  So a lot of times we think of those institutions as Marxist institutions,
[3:25:29.400 --> 3:25:34.400]  but what people are misunderstanding is that, just like Edwin Griffin pointed out,
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:38.400]  Marxism and this liberal social gospel work together
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:44.400]  and are fostered and funded at the higher levels by these really wealthy, powerful people.
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:47.400]  So there's a kind of a staged fight, if you will.
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:50.400]  I'm not saying everything the Cold War was fake.
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:52.400]  There was obviously, my uncle was a Cold War.
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:54.400]  He was involved in some of these operations, right?
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:58.400]  So it wasn't fake when he was surveilling stuff.
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:02.400]  But the higher level of the high level people that we're talking about here,
[3:26:02.400 --> 3:26:06.400]  they're above the conflicts that are nation states.
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:09.400]  They were internationalists a long time ago, you see,
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:11.400]  because they had the money, the power, the wealth
[3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:15.400]  to avoid the laws of specific areas in nation states.
[3:26:15.400 --> 3:26:16.400]  So they could just move around.
[3:26:16.400 --> 3:26:18.400]  They could just fly anywhere they wanted to, you see.
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:23.400]  So they were very interested in fostering these systems like communism in China.
[3:26:23.400 --> 3:26:26.400]  That was all set up at the behest of the OSS.
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:31.400]  It was Bill Donovan that trained Mao's guerrillas to basically create the spy networks
[3:26:31.400 --> 3:26:36.400]  and set up the intelligence apparatus of communist China.
[3:26:36.400 --> 3:26:40.400]  It was the, as we saw from Sutton, it was the wealthy elites that funded
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:46.400]  and put Bolshevism in place in Russia in 1917, right?
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:50.400]  So the Cold War functions, again, maybe at a mid-level, you could say,
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:53.400]  where you've got the espionage and the spying going on.
[3:26:53.400 --> 3:26:58.400]  If you watch that famous Fox series, The Americans, it's a really well-done series.
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:02.400]  It's more realistic than most television shows about this kind of stuff.
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:07.400]  You'll notice a lot of what I'm talking about was going on at their level of the fight during the Cold War.
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:12.400]  And some of that was based on real Soviet operations in the U.S.,
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:14.400]  the illegals program as it's called.
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:17.400]  But at the higher level is what I'm talking about, right?
[3:27:17.400 --> 3:27:19.400]  This would be people like Robert Maxwell, right?
[3:27:19.400 --> 3:27:21.400]  The father of Gislaine Maxwell.
[3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:23.400]  This would be people like Victor Rothschild, right?
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:26.400]  Who was a famous double agent during the Cold War.
[3:27:26.400 --> 3:27:29.400]  It would be people like the Rockefellers, right?
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:37.400]  David Rockefeller flew over to communist China and set up the first bank in communist China, Chase Bank, in that wild.
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:43.400]  But again, you think of it as counterintuitive, but if you think at this higher level, right, above the spy craft,
[3:27:43.400 --> 3:27:48.400]  which was really happening, there were really spies being played off against each other in the Cold War, very real.
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:50.400]  You know, people get killed.
[3:27:50.400 --> 3:27:55.400]  People went into, you know, conflicts, people, there was the real cloak and dad or stuff.
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:27:58.400]  But at this higher level, it was for a long-term game plan.
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:28:01.400]  Now, how can I demonstrate that from these guys?
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:04.400]  Well, you've probably heard of Old Zbigniew, right?
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:09.400]  Old Zbigniew, he wrote that famous book between two ages back in the 70s, early 70s,
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:13.400]  which mentioned all kinds of crazy things like weather warfare.
[3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:18.400]  It mentions, you know, harp controlling the atmosphere and this kind of stuff.
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:22.400]  But this whole book is about how we transition into technocracy.
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:26.400]  Way ahead of its time, one of the key books is it was this book, in fact,
[3:28:26.400 --> 3:28:32.400]  that God, David Rockefeller, to say that guy needs to be in charge of the trilateral commission.
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:39.400]  So he called up Henry Kissinger and said, yes, Mr. Rockefeller, we will place Zbigniew in just the right position.
[3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:45.400]  And David Rockefeller said, Zbigniew is perfect. I want him in charge of the trilateral commission.
[3:28:45.400 --> 3:28:50.400]  And then Zbigniew came into the office and he creates Al Qaeda.
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:54.400]  He's the one who goes and creates Al Qaeda.
[3:28:54.400 --> 3:28:58.400]  That's what we're dealing with here. These are the Geo strategists, right?
[3:28:58.400 --> 3:29:03.400]  And yes, it's true that Zbigniew played a key role in the Cold War, right?
[3:29:03.400 --> 3:29:05.400]  He's the one who invented that arc of crisis model.
[3:29:05.400 --> 3:29:11.400]  He's the one who utilized and created essentially the Al Qaeda-Mujahideen networks
[3:29:11.400 --> 3:29:13.400]  to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
[3:29:13.400 --> 3:29:17.400]  But again, if we want to draw this back to the religious realm, remember,
[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:22.400]  there's a whole section in Brzezinski on the Roman Catholic Church
[3:29:22.400 --> 3:29:27.400]  and how it could be used and what the effects of the acumenist movement were.
[3:29:27.400 --> 3:29:33.400]  So in about page 87 here in my copy, he starts talking about
[3:29:33.400 --> 3:29:39.400]  the fact that the acumenist dialogue that was happening wasn't just between religions and denominations.
[3:29:39.400 --> 3:29:44.400]  He says that once the Roman Catholic Church started dialoguing with the Marxists,
[3:29:44.400 --> 3:29:51.400]  he says this had a profound effect on the relativizing of truth in the minds of Roman Catholics.
[3:29:51.400 --> 3:30:00.400]  So remember, there was supposed to be a usage of the church in the Cold War by the CIA to combat Marxism.
[3:30:00.400 --> 3:30:05.400]  And then it starts to flip and they start saying, now you need to start dialoguing with the Marxists,
[3:30:05.400 --> 3:30:08.400]  all you Roman Catholics, all you prelates, popes.
[3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:14.400]  And so once they started doing this, particularly around the time of John XXIII, who called Vatican II,
[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:19.400]  it's a big new note that this really started breaking down in the minds of Catholics
[3:30:19.400 --> 3:30:21.400]  the idea that there was objective truth.
[3:30:21.400 --> 3:30:25.400]  Because now supposedly these enemies that we're fighting in this Cold War,
[3:30:25.400 --> 3:30:30.400]  now we can have these acumenical dialogues and come to some kind of common ground,
[3:30:30.400 --> 3:30:34.400]  some kind of synthesis, thesis, antithesis, synthesis.
[3:30:34.400 --> 3:30:39.400]  That Hegelian principle was adopted by Marxism.
[3:30:39.400 --> 3:30:47.400]  Marxist utilized the Hegelian principle of thesis, antithesis, synthesis to bring about what they call praxis,
[3:30:47.400 --> 3:30:52.400]  or the outcome that's a moving of the overton window type of thing.
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:59.400]  So that's a method, a practice that Marxists engage in to further their cause.
[3:30:59.400 --> 3:31:04.400]  And that's exactly what the big new thesis happened to the Roman Catholic Church by design.
[3:31:04.400 --> 3:31:06.400]  So when we get back, I'm going to go into more of that.
[3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:09.400]  Listen to the Alex Jones show and I'm Jay Dyer.
[3:31:09.400 --> 3:31:12.400]  Real power comes from the grassroots.
[3:31:12.400 --> 3:31:14.400]  And real power comes from experience.
[3:31:14.400 --> 3:31:17.400]  And I've been in the fight more than 26 years against the globalist.
[3:31:17.400 --> 3:31:20.400]  So it's important for listeners and viewers to understand.
[3:31:20.400 --> 3:31:22.400]  When you support info wars that keep us on the air,
[3:31:22.400 --> 3:31:25.400]  you're not supporting a news outlet that has sources
[3:31:25.400 --> 3:31:29.400]  and so we're able to always tell you what's coming when others can't.
[3:31:29.400 --> 3:31:33.400]  It's because we are studying the enemy and doing the original analysis
[3:31:33.400 --> 3:31:37.400]  that gets picked up by Trump intelligence agencies and major corporations
[3:31:37.400 --> 3:31:41.400]  that are part of the resistance, that are part of the resistance to the overarching globalist system.
[3:31:41.400 --> 3:31:43.400]  So I have to tell you how the hierarchy works.
[3:31:43.400 --> 3:31:46.400]  In many cases, info wars is at the head.
[3:31:46.400 --> 3:31:48.400]  We're not the tail.
[3:31:48.400 --> 3:31:52.400]  That means you're at the head and that's why your support of us is so critical.
[3:31:52.400 --> 3:31:55.400]  Biden and his constellation of criminals have told us and many others
[3:31:55.400 --> 3:31:58.400]  that if they get elected, they're not just going to shut down info wars.
[3:31:58.400 --> 3:32:02.400]  They're going to shut you down with a long depression, forced inoculations and more.
[3:32:02.400 --> 3:32:19.400]  So now more than ever, keep info wars on the air with high quality products at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:33.400 --> 3:32:39.400]  Very, very detailed, extremely specific that are now coming true at a frightening rate.
[3:32:39.400 --> 3:32:45.400]  Frightened because so many people are still living under the control of God of this world.
[3:32:45.400 --> 3:32:50.400]  Satan did not realize that their immortal souls are in grave danger.
[3:32:50.400 --> 3:32:53.400]  Do not fear he who can kill the body.
[3:32:53.400 --> 3:32:57.400]  Fear he who can kill the soul as the good book warns us.
[3:32:57.400 --> 3:33:01.400]  I'm Alex Jones and I'm very honored to be on air still during this time.
[3:33:01.400 --> 3:33:03.400]  Every day we're still on air as a blessing.
[3:33:03.400 --> 3:33:07.400]  So please pray for info wars, pray for yourself, pray for the children, pray for the world.
[3:33:07.400 --> 3:33:09.400]  God bless you all.
[3:33:09.400 --> 3:33:11.400]  Dependency.
[3:33:11.400 --> 3:33:13.400]  Domestication.
[3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:17.400]  In the real world, ignorance is not bliss.
[3:33:17.400 --> 3:33:19.400]  It's enslavement and it's death.
[3:33:19.400 --> 3:33:23.400]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential.
[3:33:23.400 --> 3:33:28.400]  With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't power humanity but makes us obsolete.
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:29.400]  But we're not obsolete.
[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:30.400]  We don't have to listen to them.
[3:33:30.400 --> 3:33:34.400]  We can farm again, we can garden, we can become self-sufficient.
[3:33:34.400 --> 3:33:39.400]  But first we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves and we need to become self-sufficient.
[3:33:39.400 --> 3:33:48.400]  That begins with water filtration to take control of that from the globalists and their fluoride and their dumbing down agenda and with storable food.
[3:33:48.400 --> 3:33:53.400]  And we have it all the highest quality, the highest rated at the lowest prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:33:53.400 --> 3:33:55.400]  Take action now.
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:33:58.400]  You cannot lose unless you do not take action.
[3:33:58.400 --> 3:34:03.400]  We have the best water filtration, the best storeable food, and it funds the info war.
[3:34:03.400 --> 3:34:05.400]  Take action now while you still can.
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:06.400]  Become prepared.
[3:34:06.400 --> 3:34:10.400]  Become self-sufficient now at infowarstore.com.
[3:34:10.400 --> 3:34:13.400]  The planets have aligned globally.
[3:34:13.400 --> 3:34:14.400]  They've aligned nationally.
[3:34:14.400 --> 3:34:19.400]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly spiritually.
[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:26.400]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species.
[3:34:26.400 --> 3:34:36.400]  And that's why big tech control of the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone,
[3:34:36.400 --> 3:34:44.400]  and track and control every aspect of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright,
[3:34:44.400 --> 3:34:50.400]  not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:55.400]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension.
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:35:02.400]  And we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score.
[3:35:02.400 --> 3:35:04.400]  This is their plan.
[3:35:04.400 --> 3:35:30.400]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no. We must embrace God.
[3:35:30.400 --> 3:35:34.400]  Welcome back to The Outro Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:40.400]  If you're looking for a couple interesting books to read, you can go get my books at my website, Jay's Analysis.com.
[3:35:40.400 --> 3:35:50.400]  I have Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, where I break down the biggest films and what all of that weird symbolism and messaging was all about.
[3:35:50.400 --> 3:35:55.400]  Everything from Kubrick all the way up to Bond and the new latest Marvel films.
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:58.400]  You can all find a dissection of those in my books.
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:05.400]  Now, we were talking about Brzezinski and what he said about the Roman Catholic Church back in the 70s and how he could be basically steered.
[3:36:05.400 --> 3:36:12.400]  And he says there's one guy that we really need to note, and that's this Jesuit by the name of Tayhard Deschardin.
[3:36:12.400 --> 3:36:17.400]  Now, Tayhard is famous because a long time ago he was actually censured by the Vatican.
[3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:23.400]  He was told that he can't teach and can't talk about stuff because he had such weird radical views.
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:32.400]  And that weird radical view that he had was not just Darwinian evolution, but actually the apotheosis of man through evolutionary progress, namely transhumanism.
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:39.400]  Yes, Tayhard Deschardin, the famous Jesuit, was one of the most famous early transhumanists.
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:48.400]  Now, Brzezinski says, Tayhard is a key figure because if we can kind of get that kind of a guy propped up within Catholicism, right?
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:58.400]  If he can now be the model of what a Catholic is, then that will really contribute to the steering of this religion into something amenable to the globalist goals, right?
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:07.400]  And remember, even though Brzezinski was working to defeat the Soviets on the behest of the American Empire and the CFR and all that, it wasn't really about America.
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:11.400]  Eventually, Brzezinski wrote essays saying it's time for America to go away.
[3:37:11.400 --> 3:37:13.400]  America needs to die. It's done.
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:19.400]  All the stuff you're hearing the globalists nowadays say, right? They're saying it's time. It's done. It's a dead thing.
[3:37:19.400 --> 3:37:25.400]  It's time to shed the skin and move into the full-on United Nations-style globalism.
[3:37:25.400 --> 3:37:32.400]  Brzezinski, before he died, wrote, I think it was an op-ed or a piece in the New York Times essentially saying that.
[3:37:32.400 --> 3:37:38.400]  But if you could prop up somebody like a Tayhard Deschardin who himself kind of admitted that he was a Luciferian, right?
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:47.400]  He wasn't so much interested in the biblical ideas of Jesus. It was more like all this stuff is just symbols for you or man in general, the elites,
[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:56.400]  aka the elites, right? Attaining this eventual deification of themselves, apotheosis, man becoming God by technology.
[3:37:56.400 --> 3:38:05.400]  And so he wrote these weird treatises about the newosphere and matter eventually evolving into becoming spirit and everything becoming one,
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:10.400]  and all this kind of New Age-e gibberish. But it propped up, that's what I'm trying to say.
[3:38:10.400 --> 3:38:16.400]  He was intentionally propped up by the global elite as a model kind of Catholic and eventually more or less rehabilitated.
[3:38:16.400 --> 3:38:23.400]  So even though the Vatican a long time ago had kind of censured him, he eventually gets rehabilitated and he becomes kind of a model.
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:32.400]  There's another book that I want to point your attention to, and it's a book by a Catholic himself, a traditionally-minded Catholic by the name of David Wim Hof.
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:40.400]  And you wrote this big book called, John Courtney Murray, Time Alive Magazine and the American Proposition,
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:44.400]  How the CIA's Doctrinal Warfare Program Changed the Catholic Church.
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:48.400]  Now, again, I'm not saying this to attack Catholics because he is a Catholic.
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:55.400]  I'm just pointing out that even Catholics have realized the pattern and model of buying off the denominations, different groups,
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:38:58.400]  what you just saw from the Rockefeller's biography, right?
[3:38:58.400 --> 3:39:03.400]  David Wim Hof is writing about how it happened to the Catholic Church, right?
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:08.400]  So Collier and Horowitz are discussing how it was done to the Protestant churches by the Rockefellers.
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:16.400]  Guess what? It's the same power structure that's going to buy off the Catholic seminaries, the Catholic academic institutions.
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:19.400]  And it's not just with money, it's also compromised.
[3:39:19.400 --> 3:39:27.400]  In fact, Wim Hof has a whole chapter about how some of the really key prelates back in the 60s were compromised by different intelligence agencies.
[3:39:27.400 --> 3:39:37.400]  Perhaps even Cardinal Spellman himself, famous American Cardinal, was compromised because there was a noticeable change in some of these prelates,
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:44.400]  where they begin to really adopt this sort of liberal, globalized, one-world religion version of Catholicism.
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:46.400]  And they begin to promote it.
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:54.400]  And this is what, according to Wim Hof, really achieves its, the full force of Vatican II is achieved, in other words,
[3:39:54.400 --> 3:40:02.400]  by these compromised prelates and people like the Jesuits such as John Courtney Murray.
[3:40:02.400 --> 3:40:10.400]  So John Courtney Murray was this really liberal minded Jesuit who basically wanted to see the Roman Catholic Church co-opted into being an institution
[3:40:10.400 --> 3:40:17.400]  that could kind of, just like Brzezinski said, spread a kind of new type of religion, a new Christianity, right?
[3:40:17.400 --> 3:40:29.400]  A new kind of open religion to the rest of the world. And it didn't have to be some kind of rigid old thing that was stuck in dogmas and medieval stuff.
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:31.400]  It needed to be updated.
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:32.400]  Yeah, so there you go.
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:34.400]  You know, notice Time Magazine, right?
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:35.400]  How did this come about?
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:47.400]  Well, Henry Luce, himself famous Skull and Bones member who was running Time Magazine at that time and was getting all of this globalist money from the Rockefellers, millions of dollars from other entities as well.
[3:40:47.400 --> 3:40:51.400]  Well, he propped up John Courtney Murray as the greatest Jesuit, right?
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:55.400]  The greatest theologian that, you know, America had produced and all this stuff.
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:02.400]  And so this helps aid in the establishment of and the co-opting of the Catholic Church.
[3:41:02.400 --> 3:41:06.400]  Now, how, what was the excuse and the basis for doing this?
[3:41:06.400 --> 3:41:18.400]  Remember, it's the exact same thing that John, that's a G. Edward Griffin explained in the last segment where he said that they use the threat of communism as the excuse to basically do anything like this, right?
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:19.400]  To do all of this.
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:27.400]  There's a great book by an intelligence analyst named Gordon Thomas, and he wrote a book about intelligence operations.
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:33.400]  I think it says one on the Mossad, it's not a, it's not an attack piece, it's just a history of different intelligence agencies.
[3:41:33.400 --> 3:41:36.400]  He's wrote a book on M. K. Alcher, for example.
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:42.400]  In that book, he discusses the history of the CIA meeting with John Paul II during the Cold War.
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:44.400]  There's another book.
[3:41:44.400 --> 3:41:47.400]  There's a book by Malachi Martin, another famous ex Jesuit.
[3:41:47.400 --> 3:41:55.400]  And in this book, he describes meetings with the CIA and the Jesuits in terms of ending the Cold War with Bush at Malta, right?
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:42:07.400]  So there were these big high power meetings between John Paul II, international intelligence agencies, and they would go and they would kind of figure out ways to settle the big geopolitical issues.
[3:42:07.400 --> 3:42:22.400]  But what happened was, is that this shows very clearly that the Roman Catholic institution a long time ago, back during the period of the Cold War, the time of Vatican II, that's when it was really being co-opted and steered into this direction of globalism.
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:30.400]  And it's very evident when you read these big kind of high level, white paper, geopolitical tones, they're all very candid about it.
[3:42:30.400 --> 3:42:31.400]  Malachi Martin was very candid about it.
[3:42:31.400 --> 3:42:34.400]  He said, and I mean, I'm not propping up Malachi Martin.
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:41.400]  I think he was a dubious character, but you can tease out of what he writes, you know, being right there at the right hand of a lot of these popes.
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:44.400]  He was the, really close to Paul VI, for example.
[3:42:44.400 --> 3:42:49.400]  So he knew the inner workings of the Vatican and he said very clearly that this has all been co-opted.
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:43:04.400]  It's been taken over by a counter-revolutionary force, or excuse me, by revolutionary force within the Church, to turn the papacy into an institution for global New Age, one-world religion type of stuff.
[3:43:04.400 --> 3:43:12.400]  And John Paul II was a great example of that because you'll notice when he was having these geopolitical meetings, what was he then doing?
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:17.400]  Well, in the mid-80s, he had this meeting that's really well known called the Assisi gatherings.
[3:43:17.400 --> 3:43:25.400]  And this is where all of the different world religions, in a big parliament of world religions, came to the cathedral in Assisi.
[3:43:25.400 --> 3:43:30.400]  They literally all prayed together, holding plants, and you know, we're kind of, I don't know what they're doing.
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:33.400]  They put a statue of the Buddha in the church there.
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:35.400]  It's very famous gathering.
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:40.400]  And so this was a beginning, a new opening up of the threshold, so to speak, of a one-world religion.
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:43.400]  It's called the 1986 Assisi gathering.
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:52.400]  And you might have thought that was revolutionary, and it was in 1986, but really John Paul II was just doing the type of thing that the people above him,
[3:43:52.400 --> 3:43:58.400]  who had for a long time co-opted and controlled this institution, had been wanting to steer it into.
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:02.400]  So he's just doing basically the bidding of what his masters wanted him to do.
[3:44:02.400 --> 3:44:07.400]  And he was already, as I'm saying, co-opted by the CIA, and that goes all the way back.
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:12.400]  The liberal elements of the CIA are going all the way back to the 1960s.
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:14.400]  Especially at the time of Vatican II.
[3:44:14.400 --> 3:44:17.400]  And Wim Hof proves that in about 800 pages, right?
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:20.400]  So there you go, you see the Assisi gathering, all the world religions there.
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:24.400]  This is the beginning of what would be the new world religion, right?
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:28.400]  No longer about Jesus, but the very dream of the Rockefellers themselves, right?
[3:44:28.400 --> 3:44:31.400]  To have this global New Age cult.
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:33.400]  We fast forward to now.
[3:44:33.400 --> 3:44:41.400]  This has really been, I mean, even France, I mean, John Paul couldn't have even dreamt of the radical elements that Pope Francis has done in this regard.
[3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:45.400]  In fact, he most recently had this Amazon Synod, right?
[3:44:45.400 --> 3:44:47.400]  Right before all the COVID stuff.
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:54.400]  There was the Amazon Synod where Pope Francis got all the Indigenous groups in the Amazon region.
[3:44:54.400 --> 3:45:01.400]  And he wanted to sign this new document that would promote the symbol of this idol called Pachamama.
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:07.400]  Now Pachamama is an image or a goddess related to human sacrifice.
[3:45:07.400 --> 3:45:14.400]  And then what does Francis do? He offers a Vatican prayer service in front of this Pachamama idol, right?
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:18.400]  Showing another example of this world religion that they want to bring in.
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:20.400]  And it gets even crazier than that.
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:23.400]  I mean, if you read the document, right, it sounds like something AOC.
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:25.400]  There he is, blessing the idol.
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:32.400]  If you read the Amazon Synod document, it sounds like something AOC would write where we have to confess our sins.
[3:45:32.400 --> 3:45:38.400]  And then most recently, he said it's time for a new council based on humanism.
[3:45:38.400 --> 3:45:47.400]  Yes, last year, I think it was last year, Francis said it's time to call a council that will be based around secular humanism for all the religions to unite around.
[3:45:47.400 --> 3:45:56.400]  So all I'm saying is that even within the traditional Catholic world itself, people are realized this was a bigger elite plan to steer these religions.
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:46:02.400]  I'm Jay Dyer from Jay's Analysis.
