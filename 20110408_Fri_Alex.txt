[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:43.080]  Texas Alex Jones it is Friday the eighth day of April 2011 I'm Alex Jones your
[00:43.080 --> 00:48.600]  host we're gonna be live here for at least the next three hours today and
[00:48.600 --> 00:54.120]  obviously the news and information is only accelerating and intensifying and
[00:54.120 --> 01:00.800]  getting more and more frantic as the global financial system is purposely
[01:00.800 --> 01:06.240]  imploded so that the private banking parasitical cartels can establish even
[01:06.240 --> 01:11.720]  greater hegemonic control over the once free people's of planet Earth Bruce
[01:11.720 --> 01:19.960]  Fine the lawyer who is hailed by Ron Paul and others as a great patriot has
[01:19.960 --> 01:25.320]  been circulating on Capitol Hill to the House and Senate articles of
[01:25.320 --> 01:32.360]  impeachment proving clear impeachable offenses against Barry Saturo aka
[01:32.360 --> 01:38.680]  Barack Obama and a lot of presidents have engaged in impeachable offenses
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.360]  next and step down before it was fully carried out Clinton was impeached in the
[01:43.360 --> 01:48.520]  House but it was dropped in the trial in the Senate but there's no doubt that
[01:48.520 --> 01:52.800]  we need to impeach Barry Saturo and we're gonna be breaking that down with
[01:52.800 --> 01:58.080]  Bruce Fine joining us coming up in the next hour and then of course our once a
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.040]  week visit with Bob Chapman will have open phones for that in the third hour
[02:02.040 --> 02:08.680]  today headline GOP lawyer drafts Obama impeachment circulating it on the Hill
[02:08.680 --> 02:12.760]  you saw that the news a few days ago we have him joining us coming up very
[02:12.760 --> 02:17.000]  excited about that good job the producers for getting him on in such a
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.400]  timely fashion today obviously we have the US and world politics issues the
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.080]  health issues the incredible police state news we're gonna be breaking down
[02:28.080 --> 02:32.640]  today the latest in the Middle East we have the government shut down that I'm
[02:32.640 --> 02:38.080]  gonna talk some about today set to take place now today it's just more
[02:38.080 --> 02:44.200]  political theater and of course there's all the tapes circulating of
[02:44.200 --> 02:47.720]  Democrats saying hey we're gonna have a shut down we're gonna blame on the
[02:47.720 --> 02:50.360]  Republicans
[02:51.800 --> 02:57.720]  clearly we do have to cut the size of government the nation is bankrupt my
[02:57.720 --> 03:03.560]  issue is though the Republicans are predictably except for Ron Paul Rand Paul
[03:03.560 --> 03:10.440]  and a few others trying to rearrange deck chairs on the deck of the Titanic
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.720]  because the types of cuts they're talking about do not change this structure
[03:15.720 --> 03:21.960]  itself of the private Federal Reserve and the debt black hole of exponential
[03:21.960 --> 03:27.560]  fractional reserve banking debt that cannot be escaped when a fractional
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.400]  reserve banking Ponzi scheme is initiated it always ends and the people
[03:32.400 --> 03:37.480]  that designed it build it this way with more debt being created than there is
[03:37.480 --> 03:44.600]  actual wealth simply put for a dollar to be created debt is created that's
[03:44.600 --> 03:52.640]  monetarism that's debt slavery instead of the currency being a symbol of energy
[03:52.640 --> 03:59.720]  that is simply exchanged amongst the citizenry and businesses as a symbol of
[03:59.720 --> 04:09.480]  energy for commerce to to simply try to make commerce easier and then credit is
[04:09.480 --> 04:14.720]  used as an engine to empower the individual and to empower development
[04:14.720 --> 04:21.680]  and competition this system is a crony capitalist anti-free market insider
[04:21.680 --> 04:25.880]  system and when we come back I want to get into the fact that I often on for
[04:25.880 --> 04:31.440]  two hours listen to Bloomberg radio this morning on XM I normally listen about
[04:31.440 --> 04:34.880]  20 minutes in the morning when I have time and skip around on other AM and FM
[04:34.880 --> 04:41.080]  channels and other XM channels but today I listened off and on for two hours
[04:41.080 --> 04:48.400]  because they're somewhere very special they're at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.200]  with George Soros and they were talking about the world government they're
[04:52.200 --> 04:57.000]  setting up and they had a train of guest coming through the studio and I want to
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.520]  talk about that when we come back it's the only reportage I've seen on it this
[05:00.520 --> 05:04.040]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:04.040 --> 05:08.000]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.240]  triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[05:12.240 --> 05:16.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.880 --> 05:24.960]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.960 --> 05:29.520]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.640 --> 05:37.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.640 --> 05:41.440]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.440 --> 05:44.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:44.160 --> 05:49.120]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my

[07:11.120 --> 07:14.720]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've determined its
[07:14.720 --> 07:19.760]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[07:19.760 --> 07:25.120]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[07:25.120 --> 07:30.040]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[07:30.040 --> 07:34.400]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[07:34.400 --> 07:38.120]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[07:38.120 --> 07:42.080]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[07:42.080 --> 07:47.640]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[07:47.640 --> 07:53.320]  the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[08:02.120 --> 08:07.200]  his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war
[08:07.200 --> 08:13.560]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:13.560 --> 08:26.720]  thank you for joining us it is Friday the 8th day of April 2011 we have
[08:26.720 --> 08:32.200]  constitutional lawyer Bruce Fine joining us he's the lawyer who comes highly
[08:32.200 --> 08:37.240]  recommended by Congressman Ron Paul and he is circulating the impeachment
[08:37.240 --> 08:41.800]  articles on Capitol Hill and we're gonna go over some of the constitutional
[08:41.800 --> 08:48.720]  evidence to impeach Barry Satorow aka Barack Obama also we're seeing Donald
[08:48.720 --> 08:53.200]  Trump now in many polls in New Hampshire and other key states with the
[08:53.200 --> 09:00.480]  Republican primary coming up here in the medium future they start these
[09:00.480 --> 09:05.960]  campaigns earlier and earlier now being number two Ron Paul in many polls is
[09:05.960 --> 09:10.240]  number two or number one but Donald Trump I think is doing all this for
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.080]  publicity stunt for his show the apprentice and he says he'll announce
[09:14.080 --> 09:19.520]  one way or the other right after the finale of the season and I personally
[09:19.520 --> 09:22.640]  don't think that Donald Trump is going to run I think this is a publicity stunt
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.440]  and the Ron Paul obviously is a million times better than Donald Trump but
[09:26.440 --> 09:31.000]  Donald Trump is not stupid and he knows which way the wind's blowing and you
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.440]  notice his numbers have spiked since he started talking about Obama not showing
[09:35.440 --> 09:42.640]  his birth certificate I don't know if Obama was born in Hawaii or Kenya they
[09:42.640 --> 09:45.440]  certainly are trying to cover something up in Kenya and arresting people
[09:45.440 --> 09:50.160]  detaining people like Dr. Jerome Corsi when he goes there to investigate but I
[09:50.160 --> 09:54.320]  do know he gave up a citizenship to become an Indonesian citizen and change
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.840]  his name to Barry Satorow and I do know that no other president has sealed their
[09:58.840 --> 10:03.360]  records like Obama has Hillary tried to keep her records sealed when they finally
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.680]  came out two years ago it had her thesis for a PhD calling for Marxism and
[10:09.680 --> 10:13.640]  Marxism is a bad thing ladies and gentlemen these are very violent dangerous
[10:13.640 --> 10:20.080]  people obviously she's not the garden variety Marxist the useful idiot she's
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.440]  the type that understands that the big banking cartels financed Marxism as a
[10:24.440 --> 10:28.240]  way to rob the middle-class transfer the wealth to government that then
[10:28.240 --> 10:34.760]  transfers it offshore to the globalist speaking of violence one of the main
[10:34.760 --> 10:37.760]  socialist leaders in the U.S. and I'm gonna get to this later in the third
[10:37.760 --> 10:42.040]  hour with Bob Chapman has put out a video talking about how great violence
[10:42.040 --> 10:46.600]  is against the government and you notice MSNBC and others tried to blame
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.840]  myself Ron Paul and others with a Giffords shooting for a man dressed up in
[10:51.840 --> 10:57.440]  a G-string shaving all the hair off his body running around with a gun who was
[10:57.440 --> 11:01.840]  taking hallucinogens every day and who'd been a big Democrat previously but
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.960]  we got the blame for that and there's just constant violence out of what you'd
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.880]  call liberals but these people are not liberals they are basically just the
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.240]  cannon fodder for the banksters and they're too stupid to understand that
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.240]  it's like a few months ago when they had Democratic Party operatives publicly
[11:23.240 --> 11:30.680]  financed by Soros and others go in and protest and take over a Bank of America
[11:30.680 --> 11:36.240]  via a union that has to do total support for Obama that was also involved and
[11:36.240 --> 11:44.440]  they demanded not that the bankers take a haircut not that we write off the
[11:44.440 --> 11:50.000]  thousand-plus trillion in derivatives not that we get Glass-Steagall back not
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.640]  that we restore the Republic not that we get rid of fractional reserve banking
[11:53.640 --> 11:59.600]  but that we raise taxes I've seen the numbers even the Washington Post reported
[11:59.600 --> 12:05.080]  on these if you took all the money of the wealthy in the United States who
[12:05.080 --> 12:11.760]  aren't offshore it's only about a trillion one hundred billion and that
[12:11.760 --> 12:17.600]  wouldn't pay off again a fraction of the thousand-plus trillion the Washington
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.480]  Post says it's six hundred and forty something trillion Webster Tarpley says
[12:21.480 --> 12:24.800]  it's one point five quadrillion that was a year ago other big economists say
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.760]  over one thousand trillion whatever six hundred and forty something one point
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.360]  five quadrillion whether it's one thousand five hundred trillion or six
[12:33.360 --> 12:37.360]  hundred and something trillion it doesn't matter and that's the big issue
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.560]  here and what I want to get into now before I get into the government shut
[12:42.560 --> 12:51.880]  down in a really creepy article here in the news today IRS awards four point five
[12:51.880 --> 12:57.880]  million to a whistleblower who reported to the IRS that their employer was not
[12:57.880 --> 13:04.120]  paying income taxes or was cheating them ladies and gentlemen the IRS has
[13:04.120 --> 13:11.640]  announced it's now beginning to hand out cash awards for employees spying on
[13:11.640 --> 13:17.840]  their employers and this is the pure Stasi society now when Wachovia and
[13:17.840 --> 13:24.080]  Wells Fargo get caught in a two-year period laundering three hundred and
[13:24.080 --> 13:29.760]  seventy plus billion dollars in drug money out of Mexico and Wachovia the
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.320]  subsidiary of Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo said they admit they weren't doing
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.520]  proper oversight and they're sorry and they didn't get any trouble and neither
[13:39.520 --> 13:43.720]  did Wachovia they just had to pay a hundred million dollar it was a hundred
[13:43.720 --> 13:46.560]  million and change I think it was 101 million dollars you can pull up those
[13:46.560 --> 13:53.280]  articles London Guardian Bloomberg AP of all first Bloomberg three months ago now
[13:53.280 --> 14:00.240]  it last week it's been in a few other newspapers but the issue here is that
[14:00.240 --> 14:04.000]  three hundred and seventy plus what was it three hundred and seventy six billion
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.360]  laundered a 100 million dollar fine that's a pretty good deal you make hundreds
[14:09.360 --> 14:13.400]  of billions and then you pay a tiny fraction of it what is a hundred and
[14:13.400 --> 14:21.280]  one million out of 376 billion do we have a calculator can one of you divide
[14:21.280 --> 14:32.920]  that out and see what that comes to 101 million what percentage of 376 billion
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.920]  is that I'd be like if I robbed a bank and I was running out with a wheelbarrow
[14:37.920 --> 14:43.680]  with a million dollars in it and the cops walked over and said listen you could
[14:43.680 --> 14:49.120]  pay me a thousand dollar fine right now on that million year stealing and we're
[14:49.120 --> 14:54.080]  gonna let you go well then I would rob banks every day if I was immoral because
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.600]  I'd go in I'd steep steal the million at gunpoint hypothetically I'd come out
[14:58.600 --> 15:02.800]  with the wheelbarrow of a million be loading it and in wheelbarrows in the
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.720]  back of a van the cops pull up they walk over and they say mr. Jones and you've
[15:07.720 --> 15:13.120]  been really bad I want that thousand dollars that's about the equivalent of a
[15:13.120 --> 15:23.200]  101 million dollar it's point oh three percent so it's point oh three percent
[15:23.200 --> 15:30.680]  they paid a fine of point what was it point oh three percent point oh three
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.280]  percent let's see if my dead reckoning was right what's a thousand out of a
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.080]  million let's see if that's similar to that you know my analogy is you rob a
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.280]  bank for a million dollars you come out you're loading the back of the van the
[15:42.280 --> 15:47.400]  cops pull up we need to have you pay a thousand dollar fine for this point one
[15:47.400 --> 15:54.360]  percent so my my my dead reckoning was a little off but same thing so I rob a
[15:54.360 --> 15:59.480]  million dollars and the police pull up and they say mr. Jones we need three
[15:59.480 --> 16:03.120]  thousand dollars you need to pay a three thousand dollar fine for the million
[16:03.120 --> 16:12.320]  you just stole the question is would I start robbing more banks absolutely now
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.080]  the only reason they got away with this is an average bank robber does not
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.280]  finance the politicians and the regulatory boards that then control the
[16:21.280 --> 16:27.160]  police but JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs Wells Fargo
[16:27.160 --> 16:33.160]  Wachovia all Federal Reserve shareholders in the private Federal Reserve they are
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.320]  above the law and when they get caught in an embarrassing situation because
[16:38.320 --> 16:42.400]  whistleblowers do come out and the information goes public then they have
[16:42.400 --> 16:47.160]  to give them a slap on the wrist I don't know is a 101 million dollar fine out
[16:47.160 --> 16:54.880]  of 376 billion is that even a slap on the wrist I don't even think it
[16:54.880 --> 17:03.320]  constitutes that and you know I got off into this discussion basically drawing a
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.400]  parallel IRS awards 4.5 million to whistleblower and then I just pointed
[17:08.400 --> 17:11.080]  out that it was whistleblowers that exposed what these banks were doing so
[17:11.080 --> 17:16.560]  they got a slap on the wrist so which way is it well you know the the issue here
[17:16.560 --> 17:24.120]  is the government these whistleblowers for years it came out warned the British
[17:24.120 --> 17:27.840]  and US government about this money laundering they tried to stop it they
[17:27.840 --> 17:33.440]  got in trouble for it with Bernie Madoff for 11 years multiple whistleblowers
[17:33.440 --> 17:38.360]  delivered dossiers with every bit of fraud chronicled in it but he was the
[17:38.360 --> 17:42.400]  founder of the Nasdaq and a big insider so they covered up for him see that's
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.040]  the difference is when the big boys are engaged in total fraud and corruption
[17:46.040 --> 17:50.960]  they don't even get a slap on the wrist they get maybe a thump on the wrist if
[17:50.960 --> 17:58.560]  even that and then when the IRS is going after the general public they
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.080]  advertise on radio on TV I've seen the TV ads I've heard the radio ads I've
[18:03.080 --> 18:11.960]  seen them in print about employees spy on your bosses find them cheating on
[18:11.960 --> 18:16.680]  their taxes well how many times have informants lied and sent cops to the
[18:16.680 --> 18:20.240]  wrong house just to get money how many times have they put convicted felons on
[18:20.240 --> 18:24.920]  stand in federal and state cases and it turns out they're professional
[18:24.920 --> 18:30.760]  witnesses that just go around the country lying that's why the feds have a
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.360]  96 to 98 depending on which year you look at conviction rate because you
[18:35.360 --> 18:39.160]  don't get a fair trial in almost every case so that's the issue they're
[18:39.160 --> 18:44.360]  advertising this and and then with the complexity of the tax code even money
[18:44.360 --> 18:48.200]  magazine years ago Forbes has done the same thing they've gone out and hired
[18:48.200 --> 18:51.640]  ten or twenty or thirty and different tests they've done you've seen in the
[18:51.640 --> 19:02.120]  news different CPAs and the CPAs all come back with wildly different amounts
[19:02.120 --> 19:07.120]  you're supposed to pay and so now it turns your employees into these spies
[19:07.120 --> 19:12.720]  looking for anything you've done that's even a mistake so they can then go get
[19:12.720 --> 19:19.160]  their big IRS cash reward 4.5 million to whistleblower an in-house accountant
[19:19.160 --> 19:25.240]  who raised a red flag about tax lapse that his employer then ignored leading

[19:29.320 --> 19:35.840]  award that accountants tip netted IRS 20 million so so you hire an accountant and

[19:45.680 --> 19:49.400]  gonna happen where they don't properly pay it and then burn them of course

[21:07.600 --> 21:10.920]  relies on the treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[21:10.920 --> 21:15.920]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of us
[21:15.920 --> 21:20.840]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by
[21:20.840 --> 21:24.520]  calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying
[21:24.520 --> 21:29.520]  about 70% of us treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of us treasuries our
[21:29.520 --> 21:33.280]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[21:33.280 --> 21:36.920]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their

[24:57.400 --> 25:03.680]  Barry Saturo so that is coming up in the next hour middle of the next hour
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.120]  he'll be joining us I'm gonna go over some more news and then I'm gonna open
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.440]  the phones up until he joins us on any news item or issue you wish you discuss
[25:11.440 --> 25:18.200]  but what do you think about IRS awards 4.5 million to an accountant an in-house
[25:18.200 --> 25:27.400]  accountant of a company that ratted out their employer for quote having tax
[25:27.400 --> 25:34.720]  problems and so we're gonna be going over that coming up more but again the
[25:34.720 --> 25:39.720]  issue here is when you've got the ATF ordered to help ship guns into Mexico
[25:39.720 --> 25:43.680]  for two years under Obama so they could trace them back here and then call to
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.280]  restrict our second amendment that's a false flag terror attack there they're
[25:48.280 --> 25:51.680]  endangering people these guns are being used to murder people including a
[25:51.680 --> 25:54.760]  border patrol agent that was killed with one of these guns and then they
[25:54.760 --> 25:58.320]  grandstand and say we've got to take your second amendment we've got to
[25:58.320 --> 26:04.280]  restrict it because of what's happening in Mexico nobody gets in trouble when
[26:04.280 --> 26:10.640]  big banks steal trillions of dollars and sell their customers derivatives that
[26:10.640 --> 26:14.960]  they know are worthless and they pay insurance companies to certify them who
[26:14.960 --> 26:19.520]  know they're worthless they don't get in trouble they get giant quote bailouts
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.800]  which they then hoard for themselves and the bankers then rotate into government
[26:24.800 --> 26:28.680]  positions of regulatory power and then in the next administration rotate back
[26:28.680 --> 26:33.240]  out into the private sector in a revolving door and it is the Federal
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.640]  Reserve in 1913 that got rid of US senators being elected by the
[26:37.640 --> 26:42.000]  legislatures that we elect so they were creatures of the state really wounding
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.240]  the 10th amendment and 9th amendment it was the same year we got the income tax
[26:46.240 --> 26:48.960]  that we got the Federal Reserve all three of those things get rid of the
[26:48.960 --> 26:54.520]  state power get the private central bank and get its graduated income tax
[26:54.520 --> 26:59.280]  which is in the communist manifesto financed by the Bank of England through
[26:59.280 --> 27:05.040]  marks and angles and if you do the research that's on record see graduated
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.200]  income taxes are to shut down the middle class in competition you got these big
[27:09.200 --> 27:12.880]  trees in the forest that are the big mega banks they don't want new trees
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.520]  growing up to challenge them so basically communism and an income tax is a
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.720]  shredder they drag behind a tractor a big giant lawnmower you ever driven a
[27:22.720 --> 27:25.560]  shredder you can just run over even medium-sized trees with them with a
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.240]  tractor just they'll say we hadn't shredded that field six years Alex get
[27:31.240 --> 27:35.200]  out there was a I was like 11 they put me on the tractor and send me out there
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.840]  pretty crazy at grandma's house and I'd go out there and just run over sapling
[27:39.840 --> 27:45.120]  trees some of them might have been you know 10 feet tall with that shredder and
[27:45.120 --> 27:49.800]  run over them or back into them and just knock those trees down with that big
[27:49.800 --> 27:54.560]  old with that big old shredder on the back and that's what this is it's a big
[27:54.560 --> 28:01.760]  old shredder and they got it in power in 1913 but promised it only be 1% tax on
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.320]  the top 2% and of course they wrote loopholes with a mega rich were exempt
[28:06.320 --> 28:13.400]  just like GE and Google pay 0 to 2.4% tax they don't pay tax but if you're
[28:13.400 --> 28:18.280]  making $100,000 a year you they say you pay 35 you really pay about 40% when
[28:18.280 --> 28:21.560]  it's all done they've gotten rid of the write-offs most of them so you're
[28:21.560 --> 28:28.400]  really paying about 44% as my accountant explains it to me and the IRS a few
[28:28.400 --> 28:32.000]  years ago what three years ago changed their regulations where they now say
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  that CPAs if they don't like how the taxes are done or they change the rules
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.760]  retroactively they the CPAs are now libel and have to pay fines themselves so
[28:44.760 --> 28:50.040]  now CPAs and if you don't hire reputable CPAs you get audited immediately so if
[28:50.040 --> 28:53.720]  you don't hire a big CPA firm they come after you when you do hire the CPA firms
[28:53.720 --> 28:56.880]  because I've gone around to a few of them they basically just say well here's
[28:56.880 --> 29:00.120]  your money you could use this to hire people and expand your operation but
[29:00.120 --> 29:03.920]  sorry we're just going to give most of it to the government and I'm like but
[29:03.920 --> 29:07.000]  look at all these write-offs well would you just go somewhere else if you want
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.360]  those but I'm doing the math here this is way more than 35% yeah that's the way
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.840]  it is I know it's horrible this country's got the highest taxes in the world Mr.
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.160]  Jones go try somebody else so I go get another CPA at a big firm another one
[29:22.160 --> 29:26.720]  same thing it's just basically now just all your money is given to the
[29:26.720 --> 29:31.560]  government to the Federal Reserve excuse me like I keep remembering it's not
[29:31.560 --> 29:35.800]  public it's private even I've known that forever but I have to get my mind around
[29:35.800 --> 29:38.800]  that like when it came out in the news a few weeks ago that hundreds of billions
[29:38.800 --> 29:42.840]  of dollars of taxpayer money were paid to media or propaganda I kept saying the
[29:42.840 --> 29:46.920]  government know was the Federal Reserve did that so the media headlines were
[29:46.920 --> 29:50.120]  government and Obama paying off media but when you read it's the Federal Reserve
[29:50.120 --> 29:57.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[34:48.480 --> 34:54.040]  the award represents 22% cut of the taxes recovered the program designed to
[34:54.040 --> 34:59.280]  encourage tips in large-scale cases mandates awards of 15 to 30% of the
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.560]  account recoup you ought to encourage a lot of people to squeal senator Charles
[35:04.560 --> 35:08.400]  Grassley told the Associated Press the Iowa Republican helped get the IRS
[35:08.400 --> 35:15.960]  whistleblower office authorized and the IRS mailed the accountants lawyer 3.24
[35:15.960 --> 35:20.960]  million check that with taxes out of it that arrived in suburban Philadelphia by
[35:20.960 --> 35:24.720]  first-class mail Thursday because the accountant can't be trusted to pay the
[35:24.720 --> 35:30.640]  Federal Reserve their cutback the sum represents the award minus 28% tax hit
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.600]  and it goes on it's a win-win for both the government taxpayers these dollars
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.640]  that are there being returned to the Treasury that otherwise wouldn't be said
[35:39.640 --> 35:45.200]  his lawyer now what's happening here what's happening this ties into the
[35:45.200 --> 35:49.080]  government shutdown and I want to get to something that's sophisticated but the
[35:49.080 --> 35:55.480]  same time very simple but an idea that if we can get it across to Republicans
[35:55.480 --> 36:00.640]  and Democrats people still caught in the controlled paradigm can really unlock
[36:00.640 --> 36:06.680]  minds you see notice what the banker owned and run and financed in many cases
[36:06.680 --> 36:11.680]  directly by the Federal Reserve NSNBC CNN local newspapers it's all come out
[36:11.680 --> 36:14.840]  they're being secretly paid by the Federal Reserve your tax money totally
[36:14.840 --> 36:20.720]  illegal Congress ruled that in 2006 when Bush was doing it through subsidiaries
[36:20.720 --> 36:27.240]  that it was illegal headlines fake news world illegal by CBO investigation
[36:27.240 --> 36:37.400]  what's happening here the globalist are masters at creating crises that enrich
[36:37.400 --> 36:45.280]  them and expand their power on the front end and then when their actions wreck
[36:45.280 --> 36:51.840]  and damage society and destabilize society and make people poor they then
[36:51.840 --> 36:57.840]  pose as the saviors very simple problem reaction solution Hougalian dialectic
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.680]  create a crisis then have their media say what are we going to do about it
[37:01.680 --> 37:05.680]  what's the solution they bring on their panel of experts on every channel for
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.000]  months to tell you this is the answer then the public says well then do
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.240]  something about it then sometimes they'll even have establishment people who
[37:14.240 --> 37:17.880]  financed it to begin with act like they're against it please don't throw me
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.400]  in the briar patch just like in 1913 it came out that many of the big papers
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.200]  owned by the private banks here in the US had bank heads against the Federal
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.080]  Reserve act saying no don't do it we're against it it turned out of course a
[37:32.080 --> 37:38.560]  year before they had secretly met at Jekyll Island Georgia and they now brag
[37:38.560 --> 37:41.840]  about this and write books about it and they had a meeting earlier this year for
[37:41.840 --> 37:49.080]  the 100th anniversary and they of the first group of meetings and Greenspan
[37:49.080 --> 37:52.520]  got up there and bragged about how great it was and how good it was now they
[37:52.520 --> 37:58.160]  established their hegemony through the system and so I said I'd make this
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.760]  simple but I'm there's so many points that go into it to recap my beginning
[38:02.760 --> 38:09.360]  they create the crisis then they offer the solution and many times then they
[38:09.360 --> 38:13.600]  even come out and attack the solution that the solution they've traded that
[38:13.600 --> 38:17.120]  gives them more power knowing that people are sophisticated but not
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.760]  sophisticated enough to realize that they're actually the authors of the
[38:20.760 --> 38:24.480]  very program that they're now saying they're against because they know you
[38:24.480 --> 38:30.360]  at least are aware enough to understand that they're the bad guys okay so it is
[38:30.360 --> 38:41.080]  a multifaceted deception a con a good cop bad cop system squared a tissue of
[38:41.080 --> 38:46.320]  manipulation where they give you false choices within a system that's already
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.440]  been basically geared towards their aims of hegemonic consolidation of power
[38:52.440 --> 39:00.080]  so that said what's happening with this government shutdown same thing that
[39:00.080 --> 39:06.400]  happened back in the mid 90s the republicans love their upwards of $2
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.000]  trillion a year on and off budget for military welfare military industrial
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.840]  complex Eisenhower warned you about it but if you say we're spending too much
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.080]  we're in trouble they call you a communist and to cry you and I guess they
[39:21.080 --> 39:30.480]  call Eisenhower that then president Eisenhower Dwight D Eisenhower so the
[39:30.480 --> 39:34.160]  republicans love that welfare the republicans have been trained and the
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.840]  republican minions have been trained that corporations can do no wrong they're
[39:38.840 --> 39:42.920]  good governments bad they don't understand that the mega corporations are
[39:42.920 --> 39:46.520]  different than local corporations or businesses and are using government and
[39:46.520 --> 39:49.840]  regulations to shut down their competition and getting the lion's share of
[39:49.840 --> 39:54.920]  corporate welfare not just the upwards it's like 1.9 trillion a year with this
[39:54.920 --> 39:59.920]  new Libyan war they're talking about it at the end of it being a cool 2 trillion
[39:59.920 --> 40:06.040]  along with some other new military operations and expansions and you've
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.160]  got the other corporate welfare operations where they write the loopholes
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.440]  where they can move offshore but still be based here and Google can pay 2.4
[40:15.440 --> 40:21.600]  percent tax general electric pays zero tax if you look at most of the big
[40:21.600 --> 40:26.240]  fortune 100 on average they're paying very little tax sure their employees are
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.080]  paying tax some of their CEOs are paying tax but overall most of it's been
[40:31.080 --> 40:34.720]  moved to the Cayman Islands to Switzerland and for every dollar they're
[40:34.720 --> 40:40.320]  paying there's hundreds of dollars being hidden and that's not debated and then
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.680]  they'll say oh we've got to do something about that we've got to have global
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.200]  regulation to stop the tax havens that the the tax shelters and then they go
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.080]  and raid million dollar tax shelters and $10 million and $20 million tax
[40:53.080 --> 40:59.920]  shelters in Switzerland not the billion and 50 billion and 125 billion secret
[40:59.920 --> 41:05.280]  bank accounts they just put on a show kind of like the 376 billion launder by
[41:05.280 --> 41:11.680]  Wacovia and Wells Fargo in two-year period out of Mexico actually running
[41:11.680 --> 41:15.520]  the aircraft running the operations they get a hundred and one million dollar
[41:15.520 --> 41:21.680]  slap on the wrist zero point three percent which I liken to I come out of a
[41:21.680 --> 41:24.400]  bank I've robbed a million dollars I'm loading in the back of a van the cops
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.240]  pull up and they say mr. Jones we want point three percent that'll be three
[41:28.240 --> 41:37.160]  thousand dollars that's how this works and I said I would again go through the
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.000]  sophisticated model of their disinfo but I'm just I'm just setting the table
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.600]  here before I go to your calls to getting to the crux of the matter just as
[41:46.600 --> 41:49.880]  the banksters engineered the Federal Reserve Act takeover and the income
[41:49.880 --> 41:55.480]  tax just as the banksters engineered the implosion of the economy and when it
[41:55.480 --> 41:58.800]  didn't fall fast enough they came and said we're gonna have a depression unless
[41:58.800 --> 42:03.200]  you give us unlimited trillions in October of 2008 then they have a
[42:03.200 --> 42:06.960]  stimulus bill which is another bailout to themselves and the word bailout is a
[42:06.960 --> 42:13.880]  lie it's a pure cash transfer of interest free money to themselves to then loan
[42:13.880 --> 42:20.400]  out to the public some credit cards are now at sixty nine percent that pull up
[42:20.400 --> 42:24.880]  that CNN headline some annual credit card interest sixty nine percent I want to
[42:24.880 --> 42:28.960]  I want to put that on screen for folks that's a on average about double what
[42:28.960 --> 42:35.360]  loan sharking is considered so all of that is happening they also create
[42:35.360 --> 42:40.680]  subsidiaries that they then put the losses in and the profits go offshore
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.840]  that they bankrupt those or taxpayer money then comes in and bells it out so
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.840]  it's just fraud on top of fraud on top of fraud so so here we are looking at the
[42:51.840 --> 43:00.240]  government shutdown where oh my gosh the girl scouts that want to go to the
[43:00.240 --> 43:04.560]  national monument they can't because it's closed and you're now seeing that
[43:04.560 --> 43:08.640]  they're starting to hype that or the poor military they're not going to get
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.560]  their pay for a few months if this happens and then they'll have to be
[43:13.560 --> 43:18.720]  retroactively paid and their children will go without food and they sell this
[43:18.720 --> 43:24.840]  entire idea of you need the government it makes the grass grow it makes the
[43:24.840 --> 43:30.120]  sunshine we've got to do something we've got to raise taxes we've got to get some
[43:30.120 --> 43:35.400]  more revenue we don't have money when if we weren't in this fractional reserve
[43:35.400 --> 43:40.200]  system and if we hadn't been signed on globally not just us citizens but every
[43:40.200 --> 43:46.800]  other major industrialized nation to the 1,500 trillion and growing in fraudulent
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.480]  derivatives that the bankers used when they were issuing them and selling them
[43:50.480 --> 43:55.520]  to consolidate even more power and wealth hundreds of times all the real
[43:55.520 --> 44:00.640]  wealth in the world see that's why they want population reduction they just
[44:00.640 --> 44:07.280]  want us out of the way they don't even need us anymore that's the big secret
[44:07.280 --> 44:12.040]  they see this planet is theirs they got it through fraud they they they they
[44:12.040 --> 44:16.640]  protect their stolen wealth through the military and corrupt police who
[44:16.640 --> 44:20.480]  themselves are compartmentalized and on average are good people but are given a
[44:20.480 --> 44:24.840]  false psychological view of the world to follow a false template to carry out
[44:24.840 --> 44:30.000]  tyranny an IRS agent taking some family's $100,000 home and kicking them
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.160]  out on the street where they got to move in with their in-laws feels good and
[44:34.160 --> 44:37.760]  then righteous why you got behind on your taxes and they're like well I
[44:37.760 --> 44:41.760]  couldn't pay them and well you got to pay this 20% interest for the last three
[44:41.760 --> 44:47.360]  years so you owe us $400,000 and dad says well I only make 60,000 a year my
[44:47.360 --> 44:52.240]  wife 20,000 a year I can't physically pay this off gas costs too much the
[44:52.240 --> 44:56.360]  economy's falling apart I got kids in school I got to buy insurance for them
[44:56.360 --> 45:02.080]  they go sorry buddy boy and they take your house and if you don't pay your
[45:02.080 --> 45:08.600]  your rent on your on your hovel to the to the king your feudal rent of the
[45:08.600 --> 45:12.680]  property tax they come with armed men if you don't leave and they throw you out
[45:12.680 --> 45:20.200]  on the street and the IRS agents or the sheriff's deputies doing this they
[45:20.200 --> 45:24.320]  feel good I've seen the countless videos online of them throwing families out the
[45:24.320 --> 45:30.720]  kids crying they feel good and I was incorrect I said 69% my mind couldn't
[45:30.720 --> 45:38.280]  get around this number I apologize the credit card has 7d9.9 so it was 10
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.480]  points 10% higher than what my see my mind people think I exaggerate generally
[45:43.480 --> 45:48.240]  if I go from memory my mind tends to water it down because I can't believe it
[45:48.240 --> 45:55.080]  myself so I'm sorry put it back on screen CNN credit cards now 79.9% on
[45:55.080 --> 46:00.000]  average people are paying around 30% that's the credit card reform
[46:00.000 --> 46:08.320]  legislation Obama passed a year and a half ago to help you just like a top
[46:08.320 --> 46:11.920]  general yesterday said yeah they're getting ready to put ground troops into
[46:11.920 --> 46:14.760]  Libya because they would never put ground troops in that means they are
[46:14.760 --> 46:19.800]  going to put ground troops in and they're already ground troops and CIA advising
[46:19.800 --> 46:26.480]  oh we're gonna cut your credit card rate it's gonna go from 25 to 79.9 now
[46:26.480 --> 46:31.960]  how's that sound see it's just a completely Orwellian system but here's
[46:31.960 --> 46:37.320]  the issue that I want to get across and we're gonna put that back on screen for
[46:37.320 --> 46:40.200]  prisonplanet.tv viewers we're gonna leave that up there for a few minutes I
[46:40.200 --> 46:44.520]  think it's so important people to see that number 79.9% they're just getting
[46:44.520 --> 46:53.080]  started you know I said I would quantify a sophisticated attack by the
[46:53.080 --> 46:56.720]  globalist for the left and the right if people want to get out of their rhetoric
[46:56.720 --> 47:03.960]  and their raw raw football team type mindset of where it's fun to hate
[47:03.960 --> 47:07.520]  Democrats and it's fun to hate Republicans and we've been trained from
[47:07.520 --> 47:12.400]  cradle to grave how to in fight with each other and how to follow disinformation
[47:12.400 --> 47:23.400]  or limited paradigms of information it's a national pastime to be a chump to be
[47:23.400 --> 47:29.560]  an idiot to be conned to be a sucker to be manipulated but if you want to
[47:29.560 --> 47:33.720]  understand in a nutshell what's happening through the example of this
[47:33.720 --> 47:40.360]  shutdown the banksters come in they hold the country hostage they get us into
[47:40.360 --> 47:49.920]  even more fraudulent debt to them out of the private fiat tsunami of fraudulent
[47:49.920 --> 47:55.880]  financial instruments that they've made and then once they're done with that they
[47:55.880 --> 48:01.200]  then say we've got to set up a new system we've got to raise new taxes we've
[48:01.200 --> 48:07.120]  got to have boxes in your cars that'll track you by the mile we've got to raise
[48:07.120 --> 48:16.040]  all these other fines and fees on you because America's bankrupt and then
[48:16.040 --> 48:20.120]  they scapegoat the unions and the welfare moms a lot of them that are
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.000]  entitled and do have attitude problems that are anti-gun but they're just
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.800]  kept brainwashed people and that's an overgeneralization many of the union
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.640]  people know what's going on they don't like having to pay their dues into the
[48:33.640 --> 48:39.880]  Socialistic Democratic Party so I've set some of the background here and and
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.440]  and and there's just thousands of trees in this forest to understand it you've
[48:44.440 --> 48:48.520]  got to really research it and walk through it for yourself but looking
[48:48.520 --> 48:55.320]  generally at the lay of the land itself this morning I listened off and on for
[48:55.320 --> 49:00.400]  about two hours to Bloomberg financial news I don't normally listen that much
[49:00.400 --> 49:06.000]  to it I'll pop in to check what they're doing and I tuned in for a long period
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.880]  this morning because they are at Bretton Woods New Hampshire with George
[49:09.880 --> 49:15.440]  Soros and several hundred top academics and central bankers trying to iron out
[49:15.440 --> 49:21.600]  they say a new economic order because quote capitalism isn't working well
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.920]  yes the system of robbery they've created the system of derivatives they've
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.000]  created the system of fraud they've created the system were there above the
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.720]  law and then can and can engage in any type of crime they want drug money
[49:34.720 --> 49:40.440]  laundering shelling fraudulent derivatives yes that system is broken not
[49:40.440 --> 49:43.320]  for them they're all making record profits three years in a row and
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.120]  consolidating and buying almost everything up and the middle class is
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.520]  disappearing and becoming debt slaves but that's what their masters of the very
[49:52.520 --> 49:57.560]  bankers that engineered this are now going to the government employees and
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.920]  the military and to the corporations to get government contracts and they're
[50:02.920 --> 50:10.080]  saying see how dependent on us you really are see how much you need government
[50:10.080 --> 50:16.360]  look at how it just makes my headache look at how without the government
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.560]  everything shuts down so this is just like Paulson holding Congress hostage
[50:21.560 --> 50:25.200]  saying you won't give us unlimited money in the banker takeover known as the
[50:25.200 --> 50:28.640]  banker bailout we'll go out on TV and say we're gonna have a depression and the
[50:28.640 --> 50:32.400]  markets gonna fall by almost a thousand points and then we'll see how you vote
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.320]  and they got themselves together bowed down and licked his boots and so the
[50:38.320 --> 50:44.320]  bankers engineer the crisis and then they go out and scapegoat the low level
[50:44.320 --> 50:49.880]  welfare that was just to domesticate people and cause a fight between the
[50:49.880 --> 50:53.120]  American people who are on the government dole are getting a government
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.080]  paycheck with those of us that aren't so that we're busy fighting with each
[50:57.080 --> 51:00.360]  other instead of going wait a minute it's the banksters that they're the
[51:00.360 --> 51:03.680]  we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most

[52:02.240 --> 52:06.120]  earthquake tsunami and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese
[52:06.120 --> 52:09.840]  citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by
[52:09.840 --> 52:13.920]  hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions
[52:13.920 --> 52:18.280]  of Americans becoming homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while the
[52:18.280 --> 52:21.880]  mainstream media continues to ignore inflation our friends the National
[52:21.880 --> 52:25.520]  Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates
[52:25.520 --> 52:29.440]  Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation I urge you
[52:29.440 --> 52:35.000]  to sign up at the NIA free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.360]  not only survive but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis silver
[52:39.360 --> 52:42.840]  has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment
[52:42.840 --> 52:47.760]  for the next decade on inflation.us the NIA's team of expert economists are
[52:47.760 --> 52:52.240]  happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation debt currencies
[52:52.240 --> 52:56.840]  real estate precious metals and commodities visit inflation.us to
[52:56.840 --> 53:00.720]  learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores hi this is
[53:00.720 --> 53:04.640]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[53:04.640 --> 53:08.160]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[53:08.160 --> 53:12.200]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[53:12.200 --> 53:15.360]  true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[53:15.360 --> 53:19.120]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from
[53:19.120 --> 53:23.680]  Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[53:23.680 --> 53:28.560]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[53:28.560 --> 53:32.120]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[53:32.120 --> 53:35.960]  genetically modified in any way you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[53:35.960 --> 53:41.120]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that
[53:41.120 --> 53:51.400]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[53:51.400 --> 53:57.000]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.200]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:03.800 --> 54:07.920]  hi LaCracia and others I'm going to your calls soon at least 30 minutes of the
[54:07.920 --> 54:13.440]  next hour will be nothing but calls but but getting back to Bretton Woods too
[54:13.440 --> 54:17.640]  with George Soros haunchoing it up in New Hampshire listening to this and
[54:17.640 --> 54:21.680]  listening to the buzzwords and the creepiness of all these economists and
[54:21.680 --> 54:25.920]  central bankers who they had coming through every 10 minutes segment on
[54:25.920 --> 54:32.880]  there I was just just basically depressed by it they're snake like voices
[54:32.880 --> 54:37.900]  they're disinformation but this is more towards a high-brow business audience
[54:37.900 --> 54:41.160]  so they were admitting the global economies in a depression there's this
[54:41.160 --> 54:47.920]  total crisis things are disintegrating there's the problems of derivatives and
[54:47.920 --> 54:53.280]  their answer is a global regulatory body for global standardized control and
[54:53.280 --> 54:59.920]  taxation and they're going to save us from the problems that they are the
[54:59.920 --> 55:04.360]  authors of on record and they're not going to save us from the problems
[55:04.360 --> 55:08.440]  because the problems are the solutions for them they just know that the public
[55:08.440 --> 55:13.560]  is feeling the pain and they know even more pains coming and so they're just
[55:13.560 --> 55:16.760]  going to play the French people off against each other the Irish the
[55:16.760 --> 55:20.200]  American people and every other country they're robbing with the exact same
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.360]  system they're going to play us off against each other cut the paychecks of
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.720]  the government workers and the corporate welfare that most businesses are
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.080]  dependent on now and then get everybody fighting with each other over table
[55:33.080 --> 55:38.720]  scraps over a few trillion while they have got the thousand plus trillion and
[55:38.720 --> 55:45.640]  it's really that simple but to hear them sitting up there talking about how
[55:45.640 --> 55:51.640]  lucky they are that we have them there trying to fix the problem was disgusting
[55:51.640 --> 55:57.720]  and to know how ignorant most of these Union spokespeople are and to hear the
[55:57.720 --> 56:02.560]  mainline Republicans how ignorant they are it's all about we got to fix America
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.880]  we got to cut the budget by a hundred billion or 200 billion or 300 billion or
[56:06.880 --> 56:13.480]  400 billion or 500 billion that isn't going to do it because when you talk
[56:13.480 --> 56:17.760]  about budgets of a trillion here a trillion there when you talk about
[56:17.760 --> 56:23.280]  deficits of a trillion that's nothing compared to the overhang of the debt
[56:23.280 --> 56:28.360]  black hole of the thousand plus trillion and you're not hearing any
[56:28.360 --> 56:32.920]  discussion about that it's all about the diversion of how do we fix America well
[56:32.920 --> 56:37.520]  let's play the American people off against each other and to have to hear
[56:37.520 --> 56:41.240]  the Republicans talk about the Democrats and because they'll have Michael
[56:41.240 --> 56:44.720]  Moore come out and attack the central banks but he'll attack it because
[56:44.720 --> 56:48.400]  there's some wealthy people making money he doesn't attack the fractional
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.440]  reserve banking system he doesn't attack the private Federal Reserve no the
[56:53.440 --> 56:57.560]  problem is there's not enough taxes but then when you actually read with the
[56:57.560 --> 57:01.840]  council on farm relations is putting out what the OECD is putting out what the
[57:01.840 --> 57:06.360]  IMF and World Bank and UN are putting out they're all calling for increased
[57:06.360 --> 57:12.800]  taxes on the wealthy because the mega rich are in a war against the wealthy
[57:12.800 --> 57:19.240]  and the middle class that's historical going back to even Greek times and the
[57:19.240 --> 57:24.520]  ultra rich are the people who control the regulators and write all the loopholes
[57:24.520 --> 57:30.320]  but they don't even need loopholes now they just do whatever they want you
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.960]  understand that and so that's why this is only to get worse and worse because
[57:34.960 --> 57:39.320]  as it gets worse and worse for us it gets better and better for them so
[57:39.320 --> 57:43.560]  they're saying let's get the rich people and for somebody making $40,000 a
[57:43.560 --> 57:48.560]  year $30,000 a year at some union job and they see somebody making a half
[57:48.560 --> 57:52.480]  million dollars a year to them that's Donald Trump and they're like yeah take
[57:52.480 --> 58:00.280]  their money the ultra rich own huge combines of corporations their debt is
[58:00.280 --> 58:05.160]  hidden it's offshore you don't even see that in the financial actuaries that are
[58:05.160 --> 58:13.360]  put out there and so pressure from below and above the globalist are sickening
[58:13.360 --> 58:18.360]  the American people who are having their standard of living cut their dollar
[58:18.360 --> 58:23.240]  devalued their government paychecks cut they're going to sick them on each other
[58:23.240 --> 58:28.000]  in a big brawl so we're busy fighting with each other all the globalist openly
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.400]  established world government and have their financed mainstream news media
[58:31.400 --> 58:36.080]  put them up there on a pedestal and hail the new world government and debt
[58:36.080 --> 58:41.840]  servitude as the solution that's what's going on at Bretton Woods to
[58:41.840 --> 58:52.400]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network you've heard Alex
[58:52.400 --> 58:56.080]  explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[58:56.080 --> 58:59.960]  yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[58:59.960 --> 59:03.080]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[59:03.080 --> 59:07.840]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[59:07.840 --> 59:12.440]  Sepholi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[59:12.440 --> 59:16.560]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it
[59:16.560 --> 59:20.400]  also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to
[59:20.400 --> 59:25.280]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the
[59:25.280 --> 59:31.880]  eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[59:31.880 --> 59:36.280]  be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at
[59:36.280 --> 59:43.240]  www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works as well

[59:53.040 --> 01:00:00.600]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:28.920]  Alex Jones we are now into our number two I've only scratched the surface of
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.640]  the news South Koreans wear masks out of fear of radiation from Japan just from
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.800]  the back wash they're getting from it our government says don't even worry
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.960]  about it and is raising the safe radiation levels 25,000 times what they
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.520]  were previously oh they just change an accounting number and everything's fine
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.320]  we'll get more into the government shutdown more into Britain Woods too
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:57.520]  going on we do have Bruce Fine joining us the constitutional lawyer on Capitol
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.640]  Hill circulating articles of impeachment against Barry Saturo aka Barack
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.880]  Obama also we've got one of the big socialist leaders in the US basically
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.760]  endorsing armed rebellion if the government doesn't redistribute the
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.800]  middle class is wealth fast enough and of course the bankers are openly
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.880]  financing all these groups it's totally sick let's go to Lucretia in Oregon who
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.160]  disagrees then Joe Don Fred Sean and others Lucretia you're on the air thank
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.000]  you Alex so listen you know I love all you do I've passed out over 800 of your
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.720]  CDs and got you on the local radio but I have really two really three
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.600]  disagreements with you in the first one I've got Dr. Stan Stan Monteith Dr.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.000]  Russell Blalock Dr. Fletcher Dr. Miller Dr. Brownstein even Dr. Mercola is
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.480]  coming around and that's regarding something I called you about before and
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.280]  I have a big stake in this I not only had my womb cut out of my body but
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.600]  terrible fibroids and men need to listen all the info worry men need to listen
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.000]  up to because all the prostate problems are being caused by this too and I'm
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.360]  a nutritionist and I went back to my book that my nutrition book in 1974 that
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.720]  had started having this didn't this info in it and and taking this
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.040]  information man you say you disagree what do you disagree with me I don't
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.760]  know what's your issue tell me no I had to preface it like that what I
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.360]  disagree on is the fact that we've got to get out that it's not just potassium
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.560]  iodide we need the potassium iodide and all the potassium iodide is what the
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.400]  breast use 90% of the women now have fibroids in their breasts they're twice
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.640]  as likely to get breast cancer the prostate problems the parts of the body
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.360]  use iodide some use both iodine and iodine but everybody should be taking
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.280]  this because we're going to see breast cancer ovarian cancer prostate man man
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.720]  I'm totally confused Lucretia and I'm glad you called but we normally have
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.440]  people go to the heaven line who disagree who really do disagree I've had
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.600]  medical doctors on I've had nutritionist pharmacist on saying that iodine is key
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.280]  to the whole body and that most Americans have iodine also vitamin D
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.920]  deficiency and you're absolutely right that it is mineral and other
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.320]  deficiencies are one of the biggest issues in this country I totally agree
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.400]  with you I don't know what you're talking about the RDA is a hundred times
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.760]  less than what the Japanese to 400 times less and everybody needs to start
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.960]  eating like a good 4 to 12 sheets of Noria day that's how much seaweed they'd
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.160]  have to eat now it's so polluted forget that but the like the Iodoral the
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.760]  Lugos it has both the potassium iodine and potassium iodide and you don't need
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:42.640]  to take the 130 milligrams you know something like 12 milligrams is what
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.400]  Dr. Russell Blalock and Dr. Stan Monty Dr. Miller Dr. Fletcher all recommend and
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.360]  people need to start getting on that so that's my disagreement now the second
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.000]  thing if I may oh and if you would Alex I mean we only got about a minute we
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.160]  only got a minute she would get doctors the Dr. Miller Dr. Blalock on to talk
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.600]  about this and also Dr. Mark Starr who talks about the thyroid because now we've
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.640]  had we've had Dr. Blalock on a lot I want to get Dr. Blalock back on about
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.400]  government-run healthcare so let's get him on in the next few weeks that that's
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.560]  a good idea we've had most these people on ma'am I really appreciate your call
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.160]  you got about 20 seconds left okay second thing is that you know about the
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:27.480]  heave weapon in Bernard Eastland's patent yes okay because that can raise up
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.880]  the gravitational field of the earth and let it back down like an atom bomb and
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.640]  if you look at before all these earthquakes we are seeing a 2.5
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:41.080]  frequency and then they cut it off and they're seeing these in Chile in Japan
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.880]  these big lights right before it happens which is associated with the harp
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.080]  weapon system look my gut tells me heart could be involved in this but I can't
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.560]  prove it but the patents say it can do it the former Secretary of Defense admits
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.880]  it but I mean I can't come out and say it's harp without total proof but
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:03.440]  something stinks this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.720]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.760]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.280]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.920]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.320]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:15.040]  on the GCN radio network it is Friday the 8th of day of April 2011 I'll be back
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.160]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. here we're gonna go back to your phone calls here in just a
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:25.240]  moment we do have coming up at about 30 minutes Bruce Fine joining us he's the
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.800]  constitutional lawyer who comes highly recommended by Ron Paul up on Capitol
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.360]  Hill circulating articles of impeachment against Barack Obama clearly he
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.480]  should be impeached for a whole host of issues he's violated the Constitution
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.760]  Bill of Rights he became the UN head of the Security Council violating Article
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.040]  1 section 9 but there's a lot of other reasons and it needs to happen if the
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.080]  Republicans were real and there was a real system change happening they would
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:59.920]  go after him for these crimes the problem is the Republican leadership has
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.600]  signed off on most of this and been enthusiastic on a lot of it and that's
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:09.560]  why Kim Starr went after Bill Clinton for lying about having sex with Monica
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:15.800]  Lewinsky I did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky how dare you how
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:21.600]  dare you not 11 an inside job how dare you yeah how dare us how dare us
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.960]  Clinton because they couldn't go after him on the missile secrets to China the
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.600]  corruption the bid rigging all of the classical fraud going on because the
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.000]  Republican leadership was up to their eyeballs in it that's why they'll
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.280]  normally go after somebody on a sexual scandal or on their private taxes or
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.480]  lying to Congress something little that's only about them so I'm gonna
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.720]  bring all this up with our guest coming up this should be very interesting to
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.600]  have a wider discussion in fact guys I know he's circulating that I saw a
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:56.480]  copy online but or is that already in my folder the articles of impeachment he's
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:03.160]  circulating okay good yeah okay I do have a list of them good when he joins
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.960]  us I'm gonna talk more about the government shutdown it is a complete
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.280]  hologram a distraction I don't like a lot of out of control unions who are for
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.560]  NAFTA and GATT and basically just take their members money to give it to the
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.440]  Democrats to push gun control and that's one of their big you know big pet
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:25.880]  projects I don't like all the welfare moms and all the rest of it or that most
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.360]  of the illegal alien anchor babies are getting full welfare for their families
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.520]  as the states go bankrupt that's part of the plan to bankrupt 43 states now in
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.920]  bankruptcy technically and then have the feds themselves who are bankrupt take
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.440]  them into receivership then we go into receivership to the private central
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.240]  banks who will just make up more fiat money to pay the debts for us as long
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:52.440]  as they get to own the assets but that's all a limited symptom of globalism and
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.920]  you could get rid of all that welfare today and it wouldn't pay for a fraction
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.040]  of the thousand plus quadrillion dollars in derivatives that we've been forced to
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.240]  sign on to you think a trillion and a half dollar yearly deficit is a big deal
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.480]  that's nothing compared to our real problems that we've signed on to this
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:16.520]  debt so the Democrats are calling for more taxes more regulation more
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.160]  welfare more government jobs because that's their job is to create a
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:27.280]  dependent population so that we will be bankrupt and beholden to the system the
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.160]  Republicans they're busy pushing all their corporate welfare and their tax
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.360]  exempt status for offshore corporations and all the rest of it as well and
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.000]  they're not pushing to get rid of the repeal of Glass-Steagall to bring back
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.840]  real banking regulations so that the mega banks can't create all this
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.720]  counterfeit currency and counterfeit financial instruments they're not
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.880]  calling to make Wall Street who created all these gambling debts take a haircut
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:59.200]  in the free market no they're going into QE2 QE3 they're continuing QE2 and I
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.880]  heard them on Bloomberg this morning at Bretton Woods to saying QE3 is going to
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.000]  be needed but if we give the bankers total control over our lives they'll
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.240]  fix the problem they created which is making themselves emperors of the
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:16.640]  planet oh that's a big problem for them no this is their stated goal we got a
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.520]  lot of radiation news as well but let's try to go through your calls quickly
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:28.360]  callers let's talk to Joe in Illinois Joe thanks for holding hi Alex thank you
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.480]  it's my it's an honor for sure I'm gonna tell you get this out as quick as I
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.920]  can in reference to what you're saying about Americans being turned against
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.920]  each other let me put this into context what you say about the 98%
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:51.200]  conviction rate the feds have in criminal court is absolutely right I'm
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.360]  glad to hear somebody finally say that in public I would like to say that the
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:02.320]  government is big on talking about conspiracy theories but yet they convict
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:08.800]  people of conspiracy several times a day I'm one of them so I'm speaking you
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:14.120]  know from they tell us with big government and big corporations nobody
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.320]  ever gets in back rooms and makes deals that are illegal that's a conspiracy a
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.240]  criminal conspiracy if I conspire with my buddies to go on a fishing trip that
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.920]  means we just organize something that's just not a criminal conspiracy that's a
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:32.200]  conspiracy of enjoyment and leisure if I'm gonna go camping that's a conspiracy
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.680]  of leisure but when they get together and get rid of Glass-Steagall so they can
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:40.800]  then take over the planet through financial fraud that's a conspiracy but
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.600]  they've convinced us that there's hundreds of thousands of convictions I've
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.240]  seen a year it's in the hundreds of thousands of state local and federal
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.520]  conspiracy charges oh but that's that we can believe you know some guys can
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.720]  conspire in a cave to attack us on 9-11 but the big corporations that run the
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.920]  planet they never conspire Joe and that and I'd like to just say that in
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.920]  reference to your point about how you know people will be turned against each
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.920]  other and what I'm saying it ties in with the court system is that what I
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:21.680]  would love to see you do on the show is have an expert on the jury selection in
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.840]  federal court I don't know if you're aware of this but the jury pool in
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.440]  federal court unlike state court where the jury pool where they choose if a
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.800]  juror is not chose for jury duty they're dismissed in federal court in federal
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.200]  criminal court those jurors stay in a pool and and what happens then is they
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.520]  get to know the judge and the prosecutors very well no that's right
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.000]  it's a hand-picked group that will convict you 98 it's 96 and 98 depending
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.800]  on which year on average it's about 97 of you average the two together so 97
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.760]  percent last year it was 98 percent the year before it was 96 percent and it's
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.720]  growing soon it'll be a hundred percent because you're right how many Americans
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:11.240]  know it's a kept jury of little minions usually little government totes the few
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.360]  that don't play ball over the years are removed and they would send a ham
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.560]  sandwich to the electric chair if they were ordered to do so that's why the
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.920]  Liberty dollar 13 years operating just a silver coin openly denouncing the
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.920]  Federal Reserve you got all these states moving what now nine states moving for
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.880]  their own currency and the feds told the jury to convict Bernard von Notals and
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.680]  he's going to prison great points I appreciate your call oh yeah it's scary
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.440]  folks it is really scary I mean did the Nazis have a 98 percent conviction rate
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.600]  do you really think 98 percent of people that the government in Dites the
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.840]  federal government are guilty I'll tell you who that 2% was they've now what
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.960]  brought him into two trials former federal treasury officer who heard a
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:09.000]  radio show in California now 14 years ago 13 years ago Joe Bannister he heard
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.440]  him break down the Federal Reserve that the income taxes is a fraud wasn't
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.680]  properly ratified he spent two years researching it didn't believe it because
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.520]  he was gonna come out against the talk show hosts you know on air he wasn't
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.920]  gonna try to go after him politically and he found it was all true and brought
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.880]  it to his superiors and they said shut up about this basically yeah we all know
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:34.080]  this welcome to the club and years later they indicted him for for you know
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.360]  claiming he was involved in fraud and stuff for speaking publicly about this
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:42.840]  he went to federal court and beat him then they came after him again they beat
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:48.600]  him again I mean it because he's so upright and he has the facts but they're
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:52.600]  just gonna keep coming after him folks they want to get him they want folks we
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:59.440]  didn't have a Federal Reserve till 1913 until 1951 less than 1% of Americans
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.520]  paid income tax go look it up okay we built the stinking country with over a
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:10.360]  10% growth rate per year on average with zero inflation for the first I don't
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:16.920]  know 1789 until 1913 you look up the history of it for that multi hundred
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:23.920]  year period of time 160 years whatever it is zero inflation 10% growth rate on
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.720]  average now do you like the economy we got now under these bankers sitting on
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.160]  top of us and Joe Bannister starts traveling the country speaking out
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:37.560]  against them so they trump stuff up and clap him in irons these people are
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:44.400]  crooks sick of it Fred in Illinois no no Don Texas is first Don in Texas sorry
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.440]  go ahead well I'm scared for sure but I stumbled across a company that it seems
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:57.880]  to be the government is outsourced to their completely unsupervised and
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.240]  unlimited funds and I'm scared to even say their name because that's what they
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.000]  do for the NSA is record all phone calls will they try and transmissions well
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.800]  sir you need to get past that fairy talk about the Israeli company no sir it's
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:19.200]  American company what will say the name it is called science applications
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:24.320]  international I know that company they're hired by the FBI to skin all
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:31.360]  banking records they place all wiretaps they have all personal records they're
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:38.080]  hired by the EPA to write the regulations for radioactive waste and then
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:43.160]  they're hired by the NRC to dispose of that waste under their guidelines that
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.600]  they were paid hundreds of millions of dollars to write well now the government
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.360]  I know a little bit about that company but not all that information now the
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.920]  government's just raising radiation levels 25,000 times what they
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.280]  previously said was safe so now just like in Japan they publicly are burying
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.280]  the rods that were shot a mile away with bulldozers that was in the New York
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:09.120]  Times two days ago what's wrong with that I mean if they say radiation is good
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.520]  then you ought to put it on your children's cereal company in the 80s was
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.120]  given a contract to dispose of nuclear waste they made it into steel they put
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.920]  it in the gold for jewelry they put it in silver for jewelry in the 80s up
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:30.440]  until 1992 when people were dying they stopped it I remember hearing about that
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.400]  but but that specifically what's the name of that corporation again science
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:43.520]  science applications international it is nothing I believe they probably tell the
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.160]  builder group what to do well I have I have read about that group I know they're
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.160]  involved in a lot of the planning and organizing of things and infrastructure
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:57.640]  what did you work for them I stumbled upon this during research or stock

[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:06.320]  patreon.com hi this is Alex Jones the real US unemployment rate is now 22% and
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:10.440]  not 9 like what we are told by the mainstream media the primary instinct of
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.280]  unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education but all
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.120]  across America students are graduating with hundreds of thousands of dollars

[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.500]  got an army of corrupt juries at the federal level that convict 98% of the
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.020]  time we've got the biggest prison population in the world the government
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.860]  publicly ships the narcotics and the banks publicly launder the money and
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:41.060]  they're going to destroy everything they like what they're doing people better
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:44.580]  grow up you know you're not hearing this information on any other talk radio
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:48.740]  out there we put out so much truth that a lot of people like Beck and others are
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:53.500]  forced to cover a fraction of it and that's a step in the right direction but
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:57.020]  I'm risking my life to bring you this information because I studied history and
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:01.380]  I know how dangerous this is we're gonna go to Fred and Sean and David and
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:06.300]  others here in a moment we'll continue with calls into the next hour with Bob
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.740]  Chapman we have a constitutional law expert joining us who circulated articles
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:15.500]  of impeachment on Capitol Hill big news on that front for Barry Sataro aka
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:21.540]  Barack Obama what happened is we bought from one of the biggest suppliers in the
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:26.020]  country because they couldn't handle the orders they said please take it from us
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:32.180]  we can't they're here in Texas and they sold out we sold out of it and then we
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:36.380]  had so many orders I held back quite a lot of it to make sure that they got
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:40.540]  broken or damaged or lost that we'd have enough to ship out to people we had a
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:45.060]  limited amount last week this is the absolute end of it now we've shipped
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:49.180]  everything out if you order it you will get it a lot of places you order it
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:52.740]  from can't handle the amount of volume or they don't have it and they're just
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.580]  hoping to get it later and then ship it to you no we have it in stock and it
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:00.580]  will all ship out by Monday or Tuesday of next week because the amount we have
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:05.460]  is so small I can guarantee it's going to get shipped out very very quickly if you
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:10.900]  want the potassium iodate that's enough for 10 doses for 20 adults so that can
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.980]  treat 20 people if you end up needing it it's perfect to have it every matter
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:20.860]  a medicine cabinet potassium iodine available at info wars.com we also
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:26.420]  have a little rad sticker radiation detectors that are only $5 a piece so we
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:31.820]  have those as well available at info wars.com but this is it a lot of
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:34.980]  companies are going to have more in about a month or so but we're we're
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:38.780]  basically I don't know we might add it there at that time but I'm certainly not
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.380]  going to be pushing it but this all started whenever I went out and tried to
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:47.140]  find potassium iodate for my family because the stuff I had was expired I
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:51.660]  had the pill form that expires this is the raw form it does not expire if you
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:56.900]  keep it dry and in a cool place basically it's like honey it lasts
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.700]  indefinitely and it's got all the fact sheets on it and before you use it
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.100]  contact a physician or health care provider but again we've got a limited
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.980]  amount of potassium iodine available right now at info wars.com when it's
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:13.260]  gone it's gone that's it info wars.com we can't take phone call orders
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.300]  it is we only have two people to answer in phones and they can't do it that way
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:20.980]  because it just overflows the phone system so order online info wars.com
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:25.220]  first come first serve we are limiting how many you can get I wish we didn't
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:31.100]  have to let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Illinois Fred you're on the air
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:36.620]  hello Alex pleasure to talk to you good talk to you sir hey it's funny first time
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:41.460]  caller long-time listener and I'm also probably like a seven-year info warrior
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:46.420]  hand your stuff out and other people stuff out heard you talking about mowing
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.820]  brush with a woods mower do that all the time here in Illinois prairie
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:55.780]  restoration just wanted to make some quick points here first of all I want
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:59.780]  to get a call out to all the info warriors out there to get out there and
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:04.780]  hand this stuff up and you know form tea party parties and you know just
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:11.820]  interact with the community because it's it's very it's very fulfilling second
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:17.260]  point I want somebody out there to kind of design a t-shirt and maybe a logo
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:23.940]  describing the founding tea party members I think the date is probably
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:29.980]  December 16th 2007 if you correct me if I'm wrong but I participated that day
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:35.260]  and I'm very proud Ron Paul founded it Ron Paul grassroots founded it and then
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:42.100]  the Republicans in 2009 started taking it over it's right yeah so when I go on
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:46.420]  talk to people a lot of times I get negative reactions that I think are
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:52.300]  unfounded because you know I stand for the real tea party so if somebody could
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:56.100]  design a shirt maybe on the back describe the date and the fact that it's
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:29:00.460]  done it's done that's a genius point I'll get with my designers we'll have
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:04.700]  maybe a block of you know text maybe three four lines on the back saying the
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:08.540]  real tea party was founded by by constitutionalist for the Ron Paul
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:13.180]  campaign in 2007 we're against war we're against the private fellow reserve
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.460]  we're not neocon republicans or communist democrats we are the resistance
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:22.860]  to true tyranny and then on the front I think we should have Ron Paul and say
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:28.180]  and say real tea party and then founder Ron Paul in the front on the back say
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:32.300]  we're in the Fed we're in the wars we're control the borders we're the true
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:37.540]  patriots that is a genius idea and I wish I could continue to talk to you

[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.940]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.300]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:16.580]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:20.940]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:25.020]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:29.580]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:33.700]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:37.660]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:41.500]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:44.220]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:49.460]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:53.940]  backup com that's my solar backup com remember the government doesn't own the
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:33:12.060]  sun so go to my solar backup com or call 1-877-327-0365 well I won't back down
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:17.540]  you know in my film for the Republic back down one of the many things we
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:21.660]  break down is that president Obama has brazenly violated article one section
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:25.860]  nine of the U.S. Constitution by seating himself at the head of the U.N.
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:30.340]  Security Council thus becoming the first U.S. president to chair the world body
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:36.100]  and I remember we watched it live when it happened when he took the month-long
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:41.340]  rotation on it there at the UN Kissinger was there and Rapture all these
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:44.940]  other globalist they went on TV after and said this is a great day for the new
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:51.500]  world order a great day for globalism that a president has now been in a
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:57.020]  dual capacity for a foreign quasi government power and they said three
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:01.340]  weeks ago this is a great day with the UN resolution and now three weeks in a
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:08.260]  day ago and within 36 hours Obama had taken UN orders and launched an attack
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:13.180]  with it without even consulting Congress I mean before it was a declaration of
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:18.140]  war then it was the authorization of force which is a token and unconstitutional
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:23.020]  impeachable from my research now it's just who needs a stink in Congress when
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:30.140]  you can have an emperor who takes orders from the UN itself now Bruce Fine if I
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:34.220]  go over his bio it take hours but he's a lawyer specializing in constitutional
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:39.980]  international law graduated from Harvard and 72 Bruce Fine served as associate
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.260]  deputy attorney general from 81 to 82 as the general counsel to the Federal

[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.580]  Justice Department official Reagan administration a fine has written
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:54.340]  numerous articles for the Washington Times slayed the New York Times he's
[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:57.020]  also worked for the American Enterprise Institute Heritage Foundation
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:01.260]  analyst commentator American Empire before the fall published by campaign for
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:05.580]  liberty June of last year other books constitutional peril the life and death
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:11.860]  struggle of our constitutional republic Ron Paul constitution and democracy Ron
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:18.740]  Paul is among the most notable consistent proponents of Mr. Fine's
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:22.540]  political commentary is quoted on the cover of constitutional peril saying
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:27.300]  Bruce Fine is one of the most important legal minds of our time constitutional
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:30.700]  peril is a must read for American liberty so when he talks we need to
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:34.420]  listen and of course Politico and countless other publications have gone
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:39.700]  with his report GOP lawyer drafts Obama impeachment and he's been
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:44.060]  circulating it in the halls of Congress this week hope he's got his life
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.220]  insurance up he has a lot of courage certainly there's a lot of reasons to
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:52.780]  impeach him but a lot of Republican leadership is involved in the treacherous
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:56.300]  constitutional malfeasance as well that's why they went after Clinton for a
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:00.220]  sexual escapade because that was limited to just that event they don't want to
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:03.660]  get into missile secrets to the Chinese or things like that because
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:08.580]  Republicans were involved as well but Bruce is really going after him on
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:11.620]  this and we'll talk about the reasons he's moving for impeachment as a top
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:15.020]  legal mind and then I've got a few other questions about other areas that I see
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:19.660]  that are impeachable but Mr. Fine thank you for joining us well thank you for
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:23.020]  inviting me well you've got the floor tell us about your impeachment move
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:26.780]  while what it breaks down where folks can read the text of it and where we go
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:31.420]  from here well they can read the text of it it's printed now on the political
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:35.860]  website and some other website but that's the easiest way to find it it's got
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:41.740]  over 8,000 hits already and just a lot about a day and but let me let me go
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:45.340]  back to the founding you know what we're going to do to honor the Republic I'm
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:50.180]  I'm speaking a little bit like James Otis and and Sam Adams at the 1765
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:54.380]  Stamp Act protest that said Americans were not going to reduce themselves to
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:58.180]  vassalists the King George III that we the people are sovereign and that we're
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:01.980]  going to chart our own destiny we're not going to have one individual or group of
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:05.420]  individuals tell us what's good for us what's in the national interest and
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.820]  flout the rule of law and that's basically the precipice we're standing on
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:15.980]  today it's not 1765 in the Stamp Act it is Barack Obama stating that he can
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:21.300]  utilize our military offensively anytime he believes in his viewpoint it
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.460]  advances the national interest whatever he thinks that he is in Libya he says
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:29.980]  it's a humanitarian interest all I can say is if that level of oppression
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:33.820]  justifies war unilaterally we've got about 80 countries standing right
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:39.660]  behind Libya dark things about them Bobway China Chetna Burma you know you
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:44.180]  name it Mexico you'll be a war forever and we'll be spending ourselves in the
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:47.620]  further bankruptcy which we can't afford it'll mean secrecy it'll mean
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:52.500]  suspending habeas corpus will be put in the tensions without trials military
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:57.100]  commissions instead of civilian commissions will have the the greatest
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:01.180]  amount of invasion of privacy in the history of the United States the the
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.780]  transportation security administration you know will be they'll be looking up
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.380]  every single crevice we've got at the president's decree anyway the the
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:13.380]  fundamental rule of law that they care and the reason is the founding fathers
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:17.540]  were as explicit as they were in any other provision the Constitution and
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.300]  writing in the Declaration of War clause which is assigned exclusively to
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:25.380]  Congress over and over again at the Constitutional Convention the ratification
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:29.260]  debate the federalist papers explaining the Constitution only Congress can
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:33.220]  authorize offensive use of warfare because the entire history of mankind the
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:37.300]  entire history of Europe is known to the founding fathers with a history of
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:41.380]  executives running off and undertaking needless wars to aggrandize
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:45.220]  themselves Julius Caesar politically Julius this is Caesar crossing the
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:49.300]  Rubicon and marching on Rome that is exactly right so we have as great a
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:53.860]  clarity in the meaning of the war clause as we do in freedom of speech in the
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:57.540]  requirement that Congress tax and Congress spend the president can't do
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:02.180]  that unilaterally and yet despite that clarity the president has gone on and
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:07.060]  said not only Libya any other place that I think is that the national interest I
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:11.940]  will use war moreover it was quite alarming yesterday his office of legal
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:15.820]  counsel the Department of Justice issued a paper that purported to justify
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:20.740]  constitutionally what he had done and the paper says that the president has
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:25.740]  power to go to war offensively unilaterally to quote support the
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:30.260]  United Nations Security Council's credibility and effectiveness right not
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:34.300]  the Constitution the United Nations Security Council the Supreme Court has
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:39.940]  held for over 50 years a treaty a treaty cannot supersede constitutional
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:44.460]  requirements and stipulations like only war can be authorized by Congress but
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:48.060]  doesn't matter what the UN Security Council says the president can't do
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:52.980]  anything with regard to war or regard to taxes or regard to spending unless
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:57.460]  Congress has authorized it so we basically have losing on the horizon
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:02.820]  and Emperor exactly as you said unlimited power to whatever freedoms and
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:06.540]  liberties we enjoy they are the sufferings of the president he can revoke
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:10.380]  them at any time he wishes you let me go to the UN Security Council I'll get a
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:14.020]  resolution that says we have to suppress free speech in all countries of the
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:17.740]  world because it's dangerous to incumbents anything like that of course
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:21.940]  these hypothetical themes a little bit strained now because our political
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.500]  culture wouldn't tolerate that but the president and nevertheless will lie
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:29.500]  around like a loaded weapon it's not going to go away in one day or two weeks
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:34.340]  or whatever maybe Obama won't might be so raising and utilizing the absolute
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:37.860]  power of this way but what about a successor what about our own collegial
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:42.100]  rather than the Roman collegial they're gonna come but they're already sir
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:46.980]  you're absolutely on target here as a top constitutional law scholar they know
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:51.060]  what they're doing but I saw that yesterday at White House dot gov reading
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:56.660]  that paper where they say the credibility of the UN not the Constitution not the
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:41:02.540]  law not the war powers the UN but but that's double-sided this then is a direct
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:07.060]  assault on the power of Congress and hence the the power of the American
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:12.700]  people and our system of checks and balances so to making the UN credible
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:18.420]  that then if this precedent is allowed to be set through you know this new
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:25.340]  international model of governance then practice they believe you know via the
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:29.540]  international common law will bring it in setting the precedent that now the
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:33.860]  Congress is basically ceremonial that's right it's an adornment if you will it's
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:37.920]  an adornment it's ornamentation on the wall but otherwise president doesn't
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:41.180]  think he can get it through Congress okay just go to the UN Security Council
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:45.140]  trade off his veto and where he bargains with China and Russia and all
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:48.380]  these other great countries that means China and Russia and others have more
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:53.460]  authority than our Congress and remember this even in regards to Libya Obama
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:58.060]  consulted more with the air bleed than he did with our US Congress now as the
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:02.340]  air bleed ever dot paid a single tax to the United States ever done anything for
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:06.700]  it and he consults with the air bleed that shows you how zany and dangerous
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:10.900]  this is it's the end of constitutional government as a matter of principle
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:16.180]  unbelievable Bruce fine I should ask you is there a website that's the best
[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:21.580]  place to read your writings and find out about your books well the campaign for
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:26.260]  liberty has a lot of them on there but it's probably the easiest because I'm
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:30.460]  in the middle of building a new website now if you just Google Bruce fine at the
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:34.460]  IN all you get thousands of things and that's that's a pretty good point you've
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:39.580]  laid out the clear-cut 100% case they know under international administrative
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:43.820]  law they're just practicing this possession is nine-tenths of the law
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:50.140]  they are trampling the Republic this I said this three weeks ago this is Julius
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:54.220]  Caesar crossing the Rubicon I use the exact same analogy because that's what's
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:58.780]  happening we see the French under UN pouring into the Ivory Coast but backing
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:03.180]  rebels slaughtering innocence with machetes I mean clearly the global
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:07.940]  Empire is setting the precedent where they finance rebels who rebel then this
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:15.020]  global Empire invades its vassals supply Hessian mercs as Obama has supplied us
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:20.140]  what response are you getting in Congress as you walk the halls because
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:24.740]  Republicans might try to impeach him over health care or something but a lot
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:28.660]  of these Republicans they like war they've been you know the the the military
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:33.420]  industrial complex loves to fill their coffers well I think there's a
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:38.700]  there's a concern and I would say it's more visceral than cerebral about what
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:42.700]  the president has done and you're right but there there are a fair number of
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:46.460]  freshmen who haven't quite got you know intellectually corrupted by those who
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.940]  have been in town so long that they see power in Congress or the executive
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.140]  branch always good because they can become lobbyists afterward and make huge
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:59.500]  sums you know helping clients navigate their way through through big
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:03.620]  government but there's certainly a receptivity there's a recognition yeah
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:08.260]  it's it's wrong but really what should we do about it and it's not all that
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:11.740]  different from Watergate where I was around it is it took a while for the
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:17.700]  public support and and opposition to the idea of the president does it it's
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:21.700]  automatically equal to push Congress to have Watergate hearings and ultimately
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:26.340]  the impeachment hearings leading to Nixon's resignation and that's what's
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:30.540]  going to happen in this case the members get it but unless the populist
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:33.940]  writes in email says we've got to get rid of these guys we need to have
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:38.780]  impeachment hearings make them come up and explain on television before the
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:43.980]  entire public yeah we can go to war to support the credibility of the UN
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:47.860]  Security Council but not the United Nations non-native based Constitution
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:52.980]  make them do that but that's only going to come if the population of voters get
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:58.540]  aroused we cannot expect honor to be prevailing in the Congress you know
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:02.860]  principle that herons to the Constitution fear fear is what will move
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:07.060]  them in fear of not getting elected and being criticized by their voters that's
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:12.340]  what will get them to move on mr. fine constitutional lawyers circulating
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:16.540]  articles of impeachment in the US Congress hopefully getting some traction
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:20.420]  on this because this is the gauntlet being thrown down do you agree with me
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:26.220]  or with your legal gravitas correct me if I'm wrong but article one section
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:32.020]  nine dealing with the president swearing foreign oaths serving foreign
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:38.460]  powers foreign groups clearly that is a big impeachable offense if not then he
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:44.380]  could go be you know vice president or premier prime minister of Russia or
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:51.380]  Bangladesh for that matter and they were shaking with pleasure when Obama became
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:55.060]  the head of the Security Council on that one-month rotation never before had
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:00.380]  been done is that not an impeachable offense as well well it comes close
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:04.380]  because what you're pointing out is the worry that the founding fathers had
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:10.820]  about divided loyalty you know they they they had seen that problem chronic in
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:15.460]  European countries and people would be bribed and and and be serving two
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:19.980]  masters at the same time and that's what that prohibition was about you've
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.020]  got to be loyal only to the United States you know they had Benedict Arnold you
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:27.500]  know they they had their traitors and they had great loyalists like Nathan
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:32.940]  Hale as well and it is very problematic at any time anyone who's serving in the
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:38.260]  United States government especially the president has any official tie to any
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:43.500]  institution that is somehow unanchored to the United States Constitution and
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:48.260]  what you pointed out is there's only one oath that the president takes it's
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:52.620]  the support and defend the Constitution of the United States period he has no
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:57.380]  loyalty to anything else and that's right in article two and then we start to
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:02.780]  assume offices or authorities that suggest that he's loyal to a tree or to
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:06.820]  some other institution the United Nations or anything else that is a very
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:11.660]  very very serious problem and they know what they're doing I mean that was a
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:17.900]  test a trial balloon now he has violated his oath brazenly and and I think
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:21.580]  you're right this is the this is the issue to go after him on because it's
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:25.900]  so naked can you just briefly when you get five ten minutes with the
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:29.820]  congressman spending days down there trying to educate them or when you go
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:34.780]  to lunch with a group of congressmen and women if you're talking you know to a
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:37.900]  congressman right now and some of them do listen to this show we've had them on
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:40.900]  his guests and they've told us if congressmen are listening right now or
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:45.340]  state legislatures are listening they can put pressure citizens can put
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:49.780]  pressure on Congress people if you had two minutes to address Congress right
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:56.020]  now what would you say I would say your war power is every bit as much in trying
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:01.020]  in the text of the Constitution exclusively as your power to tax and your
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:05.580]  power to spend if you forfeit this power you need to render it to the present
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.060]  let him go to where it will you're basically setting a precedent that
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:13.460]  enabled him to steal equally your power to tax and your power to spend more
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:18.020]  over the war powers perhaps most dangerous because it inescapably
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:22.660]  concentrates all power in the executive because of the natural patriotism of the
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:27.340]  people the secrecy the taxes you'll bankrupt the entire country and that is
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:31.340]  what the founding fathers worried more about than anything else indeed they
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:37.780]  said the most important provision in the entire Constitution for enthrining a
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:42.700]  republic was the requirement that only Congress could change us from a state of
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:47.220]  peace to a state of war you could not have freedom in the state of constant
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:52.300]  warfare and this is no time for summer soldiers and sunshine patriots in the
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:57.220]  United States the law is king the king is not law and if we ever forget that
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.220]  the Republic will have surrendered to an empire and we will all be reduced to
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:07.020]  battle absolutely very well said total veritas and why not just make George
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:11.620]  Washington a king it was offered to him why not just have a king I mean why
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:17.180]  don't we now have you know King George the 25th right now you know his his
[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:21.300]  great great great great great great great you know progeny why not if we're
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:24.180]  going to have this and you've got this coterie of bureaucrats and
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:28.940]  internationalist and UN people now running the presidency if this goes
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:33.780]  through it is certainly the major signpost that our republic has fallen
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:38.220]  to the new world order that is absolutely correct and it's part of it
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:42.300]  you know maybe you could have some platonic guardian some great enlightened
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:46.780]  leader your homer Abbey who will do great good but there was one precept upon
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:50.380]  which this republic was founded there's a dignity and thrill that comes from
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:54.940]  charting your own destiny we may make air but we struggle with it ourselves we
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:59.220]  are reduced to dwarf if we are giving responsibility for our own lives and
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:02.940]  destiny to somebody else it's a collective endeavor but we would rather
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:08.100]  be free and mature and accountable for our own conduct than being some kind of
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:13.860]  surf to some all-knowing omniscient wise man no we don't want that we don't want
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:17.100]  to be a slave we don't want to be a master either well it's simple
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:22.140]  maybe that philosophy that is lost from this country you know we need we want
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:26.100]  and must decide for ourselves you don't tell us mr. Obama what's good for the
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:30.180]  nation we are the nation we will decide through our Congress whether we want to
[01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:35.540]  go to war you don't tell us okay I think I'm in love right now I gotta have you
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:39.620]  back on a routine basis because this guy is just when you talk to somebody who's
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:44.340]  done the same research you have times 10 it is just so wonderful because folks
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:50.220]  the truth will set us free when we are put in the position of slaves we begin
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:54.340]  to take on the manner of slaves we need the responsibility of running our
[01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:58.300]  republic not a bunch of crooks at the UN stay there sir let's come back and

[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:50.260]  so this is how liberty dies with thunderous applause there you go from
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:56.500]  revenge of the Sith playing on Julius Caesar Bruce Fine continuing I mean
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:00.500]  this is the gauntlet this is crossing the ribbon con this is full UN
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:06.180]  domination of the executive this is treason is it not well treason is
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:10.180]  defined in the Constitution is is consisting of levying war against the
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:14.020]  United States though it's not strictly the crime of treason but it's treason
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:17.740]  is to the constitutional philosophy and that's good enough to make it an
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:21.540]  impeachable offense well isn't he aren't they levying war against the
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:26.140]  Constitution and the due authority of Congress and the republic itself if the
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:31.860]  republic is not these laws and these codes and these cannons I mean this is
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:36.660]  war well it's certainly war in the figurative sense I'm just maybe I'm
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:40.660]  being a little bit a fast it is about the Constitution language it means
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:45.220]  levying war against the United States of America I agree with you it's it's war
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:48.860]  it's an attack on the United States Constitution it's an impeachable offense
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:53.380]  because the founding fathers initially had limited those crimes to treason and
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:58.060]  bribery and then they said no we need to prohibit efforts to subvert the
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:02.540]  Constitution subvert the Constitution that's exactly what this is it's just
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:05.980]  like a glove the definition of a high crime and misdemeanor that needs to be
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:11.100]  impeachable and removing the incumbent from off well the good news is
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:14.900]  monitoring libertarian and conservative radio a lot of them most of them are
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:19.260]  bulking at this war and I don't hear the military calling in going rah rah war
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:23.340]  war the American people are certainly upset and it's up to them to put the
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:30.260]  pressure on Congress the real government that levies war and what can we do to
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:33.420]  ensure that this impeachment rolls forward and do you think you're gonna
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:37.460]  see a movement now it might help with congressman Ron Paul comes back out on
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:40.180]  the floor and basically reads a statement that you've written or that
[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:43.620]  he's written we need to get you go ahead and throw the gauntlet right back
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:47.500]  down at him well that that is correct and so that would mean all your listeners
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:51.900]  email or write in tell them that you've seen the impeachment article I've
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:56.340]  drafted that they need to support that they that you are totally opposed to
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:00.100]  any idea that a president unilaterally can take us the war to defend the
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:03.940]  credibility of the United Nations Security Council that you're interested
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:09.860]  in charting your own trajectory and this is a step short of Caesar and in
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:13.940]  their own and it's intolerable and that they're gonna lose their vote unless
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:18.860]  there's some action taken on this score and it's that kind of writing that kind
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:23.900]  of communication that mean it can even mean going to a state legislative body
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:29.380]  and urging the state legislators do that or resolutions and that in schools or in
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:35.580]  the Rotary Club any kind of organization any kind of a vocal demonstration
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:39.780]  that this is simply not acceptable to the American people they do not want to
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:44.540]  be an empire they want the military use to defend American well American
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:49.580]  interests here at home and that is got to be communicated and Congress will
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:54.260]  will operate accordingly and I will be up there every single day trying through
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:58.580]  the educational process and really on underscoring they basically are
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:02.780]  committing a perjury if they took an oath to support the Constitution and
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:07.060]  having it stolen right out from under their eyes do nothing well what was
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:11.260]  their own money it changed office in the US Congress to support one document
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:15.820]  the Constitution and the war power being is most important they don't have the
[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:20.780]  discretion to just shut their eyes and I think you bet it doesn't take time no
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:25.660]  we can't expect these kinds of swelling of congressional sentiment and the
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:29.780]  public to occur overnight we know we've got distractions elsewhere and we become
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:33.500]  accustomed too much to believe in an empire I mean Cleveland's doing the same
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:38.060]  thing and Bosnia her to be stay there sir whatever back in one minute let's
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:43.020]  continue along that important line five more minutes with our guest you are

[01:59:52.260 --> 02:00:00.780]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:12.820]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:20.340]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:27.220]  Alex Jones constitutional lawyer a man Ron Paul said Bruce Fine is one of the
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:31.220]  most important legal minds in our time constitutional perils a must-read for
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:34.820]  American lovers of liberty he's up there working hard all this week on Capitol
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:40.180]  Hill bringing forward the evidence of impeachable offense high crime misdemeanor
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:46.220]  violating the war clause of Congress something that the founders were
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:49.740]  completely obsessed with because look at third-world countries look what we see
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:55.740]  in Latin America and Asia it's always the military or some hunt out of their
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:00.940]  legislature taking over I mean this is what Eisenhower warned about this
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:06.660]  farewell address in 1961 it's happening not with a bang with with a whimper and
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:09.660]  we're not going to beat this overnight but we need to put out the challenge now
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:13.700]  put out the facts build the movement against it because now this power grab
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:16.700]  has happened and they're going to accelerate it you better believe it
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:19.940]  what are some other areas that you see that Obama's engaged in that are
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:23.180]  impeachable sir well the two greatest ones are
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:27.500]  authority asserting authority to place Americans on the fascination list and
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.740]  just kill them because he says they're an imminent threat to the United States
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:34.380]  there's no due process there's no judicial warrant no finding of probable
[02:01:34.380 --> 02:01:38.740]  cause having committed a crime just sticking on a fascination list I mean
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:41.940]  Nixon had his enemies list but they weren't set out for killing you know
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:46.140]  maybe he had an IRS audit or something like that this is these are the things
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:50.820]  that tyrants do an assassination list even the concept is that foreign to any
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:55.620]  nation that cherishes due process of law we have ways in which we punish capture
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:59.060]  punished people consistent with the law they can get death sentence who'd like
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:02.940]  them in McVeigh but we just don't stick them on a fascination list and kill them
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:06.900]  the second thing he's done there he's basically suspended you know they'd be
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:11.940]  right up trial in Guantanamo Bay for American sentences he can identify your
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:16.540]  me as an enemy combat that is in some way we're affiliated with al-Qaeda those
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:20.940]  involved in 9-11 we're affiliated and then we don't get a trial we don't get
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:25.780]  accused of anything we just get to fit in a lot in the tension for life because
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:29.060]  we're supposed to stay there until the end of the war against international
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:33.780]  terrorism and now we're hearing betray us set me the new CI director saying
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:37.300]  don't do things even if it's free speech that hurt the war effort and I hear
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:41.700]  conservative hosts saying yeah maybe we should arrest Quran burners no folks if
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:45.340]  we don't have the right to do that we have no right we have no free speech and
[02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:50.940]  enclosing looking at this with the TSA and the hands down the pants all the
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:54.780]  things they're doing is there any doubt in your mind mr. fine that the system
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:03:00.140]  across the board is trying to break our will and set the precedent that all 10
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:04.940]  of the first amendments the Bill of Rights are dead yes it's trying to set
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:09.220]  the precedent that the whole purpose of government is in its government's view
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:14.260]  to make us risk free and since we all have a capability of being evil then we
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:18.500]  all get to be detained sir pounded and everything else because maybe we could do
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:23.060]  something evil since we're not saying it's trying to reduce the country to a
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:27.340]  de facto police state where the presumption is you could do something
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:31.700]  bad we have to stop you rather than the presumption being liberty the founding
[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:36.500]  father and the default position if there's any equivocation and the evidence
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:40.780]  and experience is liberty freedom the default is not government power and
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:44.860]  that's where we've turned the entire republican enterprise on its head
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:48.460]  I've only got a minute left I wanted to bring up the other point that when they
[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:52.700]  passed the Patriot Act in October of 2001 they said it was only for foreign
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:56.940]  terrorists but I read Section 802 and others it basically said anything that
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:04:01.180]  endangers human life it's a violation of federal or state law and looking at that
[02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:06.220]  now I see the headlines where per state prosecutors are using the Patriot Act at
[02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:10.860]  the state level in quote thousands of cases a year including marijuana marital
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:14.940]  violence I mean there's no doubt this is being used against us absolutely it's
[02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:19.460]  being used against us and again this is at a time when even the attorney general
[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:23.140]  was saying you know even if we had the Patriot Act we still had had 9-11 so
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:27.340]  it's just power for the sake of power there's no attempt to try to demonstrate
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:30.860]  any connection between these new government authorities and actual
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:36.180]  ability to stop crime and that's what's so dangerous because it's the
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:40.940]  presumption every if it's conceivable in a thousand years that this authority
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:44.780]  might be useful all right then we'll do it even if the result is five million
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:49.620]  innocent people get harassed detained improperly screwed it's guilty until
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:54.180]  proven innocent it's Napoleonic law Bruce fine I look forward to speaking to you
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:57.340]  again in the future God bless you with the impeachment let me say bye to you

[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:11.580]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:14.380]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:19.300]  I've turned an endless influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:23.900]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:28.260]  citizens to pay attention fall the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:33.540]  nation the criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:37.860]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:41.340]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:46.580]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:52.580]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at

[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:21.820]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:26.180]  it just went live up on info wars dot com we've been covering it all this week
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:31.940]  with the articles of impeachment the article of impeachment for high crimes
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:36.580]  and misdemeanors a very saturo the imposter a.k.a. Morocco bomb them or
[02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:40.340]  openly now putting out a new letter saying yes he launched the war without
[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:46.700]  congressional approval on record because they had to expand the credibility of the
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:51.860]  UN they don't even say it's about humanitarian as they carpet bomb Libya
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:55.740]  with depleted uranium weapons and bomb the rebels and don't even apologize and
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:09:00.020]  blow up a bunch of their tanks the al-qaeda heroes that our media tells us
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:03.500]  they are again I'm an American because I don't like al-qaeda I'm sorry if you
[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:07.420]  don't like it fine I will not say al-qaeda is good I'm sorry I can't
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:09.780]  believe I have to get to the point in this country to say that but yes it is
[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:14.420]  al-qaeda running the operations there under US and British command and the
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:18.740]  article of impeachment is up there imagine the UN gives the order Congress
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:22.740]  isn't even consulted top constitutional law scholar Ron Paul calls him the top
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:28.420]  guy Bruce Fine circulating this on Congress getting some serious traction
[02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:34.060]  it's up on info wars.com Bruce Fine articles of impeachment for Tyrant
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:42.540]  Obama so important to get that out to everyone you know and point out what's
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:46.460]  really happening here now with us for the next 51 minutes and your phone calls
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:52.980]  is Bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com and before we get into
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:57.260]  the financial news Bretton Woods to happening with that hard creature George
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:10:02.540]  Soros and the propaganda I am hearing on a Bloomberg financial how the globalists
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:06.340]  are going to save us with the world government it's now official your take
[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:11.460]  on the precedent three weeks ago when Obama said I'm following the orders of
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:16.140]  the UN Congress has no authority I'm not even approaching them this is about
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:20.660]  building the credibility of the United Nations up this is Caesar crossing the
[02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:27.540]  Rubicon there's no doubt this is treason absolutely no question whatsoever
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:33.820]  and it's being done deliberately to test the American public to see what
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:38.860]  they're going to say about it and of course this move for impeachment probably
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:42.820]  couldn't have couldn't have come at a better time although it would have been
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:48.980]  better if it came a lot earlier I heard the end of what mr. Fine had to say
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:56.100]  yourself and another mission and let's try to knock this guy out of the box so
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:11:06.180]  to speak and as far as the the United Nations operation is concerned they've
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:11.500]  been pulling this for years although previously they've gotten approval most
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:16.220]  of the time from Congress especially early on but now they just by passing
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:22.380]  everything they're trying to meld us into a dictatorial government which will be
[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:29.140]  melded with others and you know when I speak about this I can't help but think
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:36.340]  about the Germans withdrawing their troops from the NATO operation and
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:46.140]  voting in abstention in the UN Security Council when they were voting
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:54.180]  in regard to the no flies and I think that that has to be an extremely
[02:11:54.180 --> 02:12:01.980]  important event and that of course was coming at approximately the same time
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:08.380]  that Mrs. Merkel at the G20 meeting said no we don't want to vote for another
[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:13.540]  trillion dollars of course I called it in euros and we've already got a
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:20.020]  trillion in fact the trillion that these solvent members have said that they
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:24.580]  would commit to the bailout of these six countries that are in trouble we'd
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:32.340]  like to cut that by 300 billion this goes right in the face both events of what
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:38.820]  the internationalists want to do and have you discussed this on the program
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:44.820]  before Alex what specifically you laid out a few issues there the fact that the
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:51.460]  the last two Germany's non-participation in this NATO operation and
[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:58.220]  their abstention plus the fact Mrs. Merkel came up the same time and said no
[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:02.660]  more money and we want to cut back what were you yeah I think we yeah we talked
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:06.460]  about it last Friday some in that interview with you Bob and we have
[02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:11.860]  discussed it but but it does signify the major cracks in the euro and now it's
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:14.460]  not just Bob Chapman saying that four or five years ago predicting it with
[02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:18.420]  collapse now all over the news as I know you track as a newshound they're
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:23.820]  saying the euro could collapse you predicted at least a year before the
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:30.100]  2008 engineered financial terrorism implosion of October that the euro would
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:36.980]  go down starting with Greece Ireland Portugal then Spain then England and
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:40.500]  then you said after that I'm not sure the order it could be the US then
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:44.620]  Germany last and that you predicted even that Germany would start bulking
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:47.980]  because it's the engine of Europe and basically bankrolling everything and
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:51.740]  there's only so much the German workhorses can carry I mean sure they you
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:55.140]  know they they love to work and they're smart but you know there's only so much
[02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:58.900]  they are the Japanese can carry in this whole global assistance both very
[02:13:58.900 --> 02:14:02.740]  hard-working smart groups of people so yes we've talked about that but now the
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:06.220]  chickens are coming home to roots and that was the next issue this morning I
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:12.220]  normally tune into WAI 590 I tune into TV while I'm sitting there printing
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:16.380]  news and you know reading stories and I am in the crew because I work from home
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:20.580]  in the morning guest ideas and you know talking to them but I have Bloomberg on
[02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:24.540]  my XM in my house and in my car so I listened off and on the house then I
[02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:27.980]  got in the car drove to work listening to it and the reason I listened off and
[02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:31.980]  on for two hours I normally monitor at 10 minutes is they're at Bretton Woods
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:35.260]  and there's almost no other media coverage of this as you know other than
[02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:39.900]  American Free Press and info wars.com alternative media is covering it that
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:46.100]  it convened last night officially off today and Bloomberg financial has solid
[02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:49.060]  coverage with their talk show host during the news breaks they cover other
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:54.860]  issues but they're parading central bank heads through their their parading top
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:59.580]  economists through and hearing them they they're admitting yes we're basically in
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:04.060]  a depression things are getting worse but we're gonna save you with a new
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:07.820]  international banking order we're gonna run everything when they're the people
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:12.260]  that engineered this but they all sounded tremulous and shaking and were
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:17.540]  stuttering I don't normally hear these people stuttering and bumbling and they
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:20.940]  were set up outside and some of them were complaining it was cold but the
[02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:26.700]  point is is they sounded like a bunch of slime ball rats listening to them but
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:31.900]  so Bretton Woods is going on but you can really see them packaging the crisis
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:35.260]  they've created that they're gonna give us the solution so you're taking what's
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:39.260]  happening at Bretton Woods and then let's expand into what you were just
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:45.900]  getting into with Germany bulking militarily and financially well I think
[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:51.660]  if they try to use the SDR it's gonna be a non-starter they tried it in the late
[02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:58.020]  60s it was a disaster and in fact they tried for about four or five years to
[02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:02.660]  stick it down everybody's throat and what happened eventually goals started
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:07.820]  going up strongly and then they started selling gold into the market and they
[02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:13.260]  couldn't constrain it they did while the goal was to sale and all of a sudden
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:18.180]  there wasn't a sale anymore and then gold took off it was a disaster for them
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:25.020]  but if they prayed the SDR it's not going to work for them if they go to five
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:30.780]  or ten major currencies it could work but they've got to be backed by gold and
[02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:37.220]  anything that they do and if it's not backed by gold in relation to a
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:42.540]  international currency or a group of country currencies in an index that
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:50.260]  represent a a world reserve currency it's just not going to work and people
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:54.020]  not going to accept it and who are the first ones who are not going to accept
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:17:00.980]  it China Russia Brazil Iran and in as many countries that don't want that
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:05.780]  they've seen what's happened and you know even though the United States in
[02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:11.900]  Europe and England are in a terrible mess potentially and economically many of
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:16.500]  the countries in the world are not in that position I mean just in our neighbors
[02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:22.980]  and in Canada and Mexico their economies are growing at about four to four and a
[02:17:22.980 --> 02:17:28.680]  half percent unemployment's down the balance of trade is excellent the
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:34.460]  currencies are gaining against the dollar the Canadian dollar was 106
[02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:41.140]  yesterday the Mexican pesos just gained four pennies on the dollar these are
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:45.060]  unheard of things so if they're going to come up with a package it's going to
[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:50.820]  work it's got to be backed by gold and it's got to be reasonable so it'll be
[02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:54.420]  interesting to see what they come up with I don't have any idea what they are
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:59.260]  going to come up with because there's been no intelligence whatsoever is to
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:05.300]  what the plan is all I know is they're parading not only these dignitaries
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:10.060]  from other countries it's a very big place because I've been in there a
[02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:16.500]  couple of times before and I used to go to camp up and in that area where I was
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:23.020]  a kid so that was one of the important places to to be at any given time and
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:31.220]  but we're gonna have to see what they come up with and and then we'll be it'll
[02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:36.940]  be easier to make a decision on whether the thing could work or not all right
[02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:39.740]  Bob I've got a lot of questions for you when we come back from breakfast we're
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:44.300]  going to take calls I want to get into golden silvers meteoric rise that you
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:48.340]  again predicted months ago and you've also predicted they'll try to drive it
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:52.820]  down again what you see happening will they be successful driving it down or
[02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:58.620]  will it just continue on up the fact that the reportedly Max Kaiser says the
[02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:02.420]  comics almost defaulted last month a do you agree with that analysis do you think
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:06.180]  that could be coming up soon or where they just try to block it with paper or
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:11.660]  will they fail but also I'm hearing suddenly on financial news but also
[02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:18.340]  mainstream radio and TV ads for investing in new international currency
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:23.420]  system and I'm getting buzz from this from wealthy people I know and so it
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:28.540]  appears that the establishment to try to back up some new global currency is
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:34.380]  is trying to get suckers into it as some new derivative model because I've gone
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:38.180]  and researched some of these companies and some of them are big but they're not
[02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:42.460]  really even explaining what it is they're selling you know is it just
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:47.700]  buying into a stock or a company that's manipulating currencies and playing
[02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:51.180]  currencies I mean I'm just seeing a lot of hype pushing that I want to see if
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:56.420]  you've picked up anything on your radar screen on that front Bob Chapman of the
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:02.660]  international forecaster comms our guest I'm Alex Jones hi this is Alex Jones
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:06.580]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:09.980]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:13.780]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:16.940]  seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:20.860]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:24.980]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:30.300]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for
[02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:33.420]  you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:37.500]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:42.460]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's
[02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:52.700]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[02:20:52.700 --> 02:20:58.300]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:02.500]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:08.220]  Alex Jones here with key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:11.540]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:16.860]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:21.940]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:26.260]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70% of
[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:30.780]  US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends at
[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:34.300]  the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon
[02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:38.020]  become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes
[02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:43.100]  and savings destroyed I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the

[02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:12.700]  gone for selling out the last remnants we haven't sold any over a week of the
[02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:17.460]  potassium iodine that's vital to be in any medicine cabinet especially with the
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:22.620]  government now saying that 25,000 times safe levels of radiation will now be
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:26.420]  considered safe in the United States we covered that yesterday those are
[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:32.620]  available at info wars.com but they won't be there long okay Bob getting into
[02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:37.140]  gold and silver break down the technicals of what we've seen just happen
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:41.940]  with this record explosion the price of silver and gold this week and what you
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:49.220]  expect the system to do. I think gold is going to 16 to 1650 and I made this
[02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:54.140]  prediction months ago and possibly before the end of the year we could see
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:25:01.460]  2,000 or more. Secondly silver is a very unique situation I notice Max Kaiser
[02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:07.060]  had said problems are going to arise at $48 an ounce could very well be right
[02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:15.460]  I've been talking in terms of 55 to 60 not far away same concept and I think
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:23.940]  that my look on it was they'll want to test 50 the old high those who are long
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:32.140]  and any attack that's going to come will come at 50 but a 50 is broken and I
[02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:38.820]  think it will be because of the dreadful situation that JPM and HSBC are in I
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:45.340]  think they're going to default and that means to me that they'll probably stop
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:52.980]  trading on the futures exchange on comics as well as the LBMA in London that
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:59.100]  means gold and silver options will not be tradable the whole market will be
[02:25:59.100 --> 02:26:03.620]  upside down the derivatives ago haywire and it's going to have a devastating
[02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:10.180]  effect on the exchange traded funds which are GLD and SLV GLD being gold and
[02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:18.420]  SLV being silver it's my guess that they both have probably approximately 25
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:22.980]  percent of one-third in physical that they're holding and there's no way of
[02:26:22.980 --> 02:26:28.820]  knowing this you have to back in and the rest of its paper which is what I've
[02:26:28.820 --> 02:26:33.580]  just mentioned options futures and derivatives well Bob I remember I remember
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:37.980]  2345 years ago over and over again you're saying for inflation gold to be
[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:42.100]  above 2000 and when gold was 600 bucks people thought that was nuts when it
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:50.020]  was 800 a thousand they thought it was nuts now at 1400 and in rising 2000
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:53.740]  doesn't sound so crazy and here's the other news US Airlines attempt to raise
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:59.700]  fares for 10th time food gas prices on the rise an average for a gallon of gas
[02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:05.260]  just the cheap stuff three dollars and 76 cents talk of 150 to 200 dollar a
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:08.740]  barrel oil not just from Lindsay Williams six months ago but now all over the
[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:18.220]  news oil jumps another two percent in a day to above 112.5 Brent crude well
[02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:23.180]  above 123 I mean this is clearly inflation the head of Walmart says
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:26.100]  inflation is going to be serious your take on that
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:35.580]  you said it would be a over 10% that was a missed assignment I believe yes what
[02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:41.660]  what's going to happen here let me go back two years and just say there's a
[02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:46.980]  bit of war going on between gold and the dollar and other currencies each year
[02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:55.820]  for the last 11 years both gold and silver versus nine major currencies
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:28:03.340]  each have appreciated over 20% a year on average so this is nothing new secondly
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:08.500]  over the last two years the war between the the dollar read the reserve
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:14.980]  currency and the price of gold and silver in particular was won by gold and
[02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:23.140]  silver but particularly by gold and the world is this has decided in part that
[02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:28.180]  gold and silver are more important than the dollar and other currencies and so
[02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:35.620]  that's why we've been going up it's just lately that news has come about not on
[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:42.860]  this program but mainstream will call it that we were going to see higher
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:47.540]  inflation and now that's starting to get built into it and that's giving gold and
[02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:54.980]  silver a shove upward that wasn't there before and of course the president's
[02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:58.780]  working group on financial markets is in the market every day trying to knock them
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:03.580]  down and you know I stopped watching three or four in the morning and I got a
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:07.860]  good feel I used to be a tape reader when I was a broker the most people don't
[02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:12.260]  even know what that is anymore but anyway you there's a rhythm to the market
[02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:16.700]  and you watch it and you you you know what's going on you know who the buyers
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:21.740]  are and and that's what's going on in that market they're trying desperately
[02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:28.780]  to hold it down and the reason they're doing that is that golden silver of the
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:33.740]  antithesis of paper currencies particularly at ones and it's gonna
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:37.940]  keep right on yeah they call the paper currencies and other derivatives bluff
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:41.460]  we're gonna come back Bob I'm briefly getting into my question and we didn't
[02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:45.580]  get to yet all this hype these investments in the new international
[02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:49.580]  currency and it just looks like a bunch of companies out there setting up some
[02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:56.540]  new derivatives we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:56.540 --> 02:30:03.540]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:07.980]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:30:07.980 --> 02:30:12.020]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:15.420]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:19.940]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:24.500]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:28.540]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:32.340]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:35.940]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:40.300]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:30:40.300 --> 02:30:43.460]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:47.100]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:51.900]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[02:30:51.900 --> 02:30:56.180]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[02:31:03.820 --> 02:31:09.220]  2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he
[02:31:09.220 --> 02:31:13.260]  says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest

[02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:19.820]  family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:24.580]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:31:24.580 --> 02:31:27.860]  Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest small owner general growth
[02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:33.020]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created
[02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:36.460]  a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:40.580]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this enough
[02:31:40.580 --> 02:31:44.340]  you should at least watch this free video online today he explains everything
[02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:47.780]  you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself you

[02:33:31.940 --> 02:33:35.620]  guest for a decade routinely you notice his phone line doesn't live in the US
[02:33:35.620 --> 02:33:40.500]  is a IP phone so breaking up a bit I apologize we're gonna try to fix that
[02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:45.260]  soon or I will have to mail Bob a satellite phone I'm joking friend to be
[02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:48.780]  on the show but his knowledge is invaluable so we can put up with it
[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:52.260]  here Bob but you're killing us we love you though we got a bunch of phone calls
[02:33:52.260 --> 02:33:57.660]  here Al who disagrees goes to have a line David Jack another Al Sean and
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:07.620]  others toll-free number to join us 800 259 92 31 I notice in the last month a
[02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:12.180]  lot of different radio TV ads print ads about invest in the new global financial
[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:17.020]  order invest in the new global currency and I've gone to a few of the websites
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:21.060]  some of the companies are big some are small and then it's not even really
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:24.380]  clear what the investments are they say just call them have you noticed this big
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:28.820]  uptick and is this tie-in to George Soros and as Bretton Woods to hyping up
[02:34:28.820 --> 02:34:34.420]  that America's bad that capitalism failed we the very bankers that did this to
[02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:40.780]  us to now take over everything what's going on well all I've heard is that the
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:45.620]  ads exist and I don't know anybody that's called and so I don't actually
[02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:49.940]  know what they're up to and whether it has any connection to saw person is
[02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:55.660]  meeting and this new currency that I like that they'd like to put together I
[02:34:55.660 --> 02:35:00.420]  don't know I would have to look into it yeah I've got to do some more looking
[02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:07.060]  as well I want to go to the phone calls now but before I do that Bob I've been
[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:10.420]  asking the questions are there any other points or issues that you think are
[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:15.940]  important that people should be made aware of well I think the the situation
[02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:22.420]  in Libya becomes clearer you've got the four aquifires under the country you've
[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:28.020]  got good source of oil you have a independent center bank that just
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:35.220]  happens to have 143.8 tons of gold in it and you have as you pointed out over
[02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:42.340]  and over al Qaeda manning the guns for the rebels the rebel leader was living
[02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:49.660]  for the last 20 years in Virginia and works for the CIA and one of the things
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:57.100]  that I think is pertinent here that Paul Craig Roberts talked about which I
[02:35:57.100 --> 02:36:08.020]  didn't address is the cutoff of oil with China and it is significant and I wish
[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:13.740]  I had thought of it but I didn't and I think that is important aspect because
[02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:24.220]  as Paul Craig Roberts explains that this is an important event and he also
[02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:31.660]  brings in the fact that Russia is being surrounded by NATO and I think it's
[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:37.060]  significant if we are going to have a third world war and and and also he
[02:36:37.060 --> 02:36:45.340]  brings out the fact that Africa was put together by France as well as the
[02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:53.300]  United States and Mr. Gaddafi refused to join it so there's several reasons why
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:37:03.220]  the US and others want to get rid of Mr. Gaddafi but now we see the head
[02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:07.020]  general US general over the operation we all know that the US is really running
[02:37:07.020 --> 02:37:10.980]  the NATO operation they claim NATO's in command saying yes we'll probably have
[02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:16.300]  to invade and we see the UN saying well we may invade but that will only be an
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:21.420]  advisory force well there been US and British and special forces and CIA and
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:26.300]  MI6 in there before it happened I mean it's all on record and more and more
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:29.700]  conservatives are finally waking up to the fact that al Qaeda's globalist run
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:34.300]  the fact that they admit it al Qaeda is the core of the rebels the Wall Street
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:38.220]  Journal even admits that but they spend and say well maybe that's the good al
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:47.180]  Qaeda I mean it's so in your face it's so ridiculous Bob it's obnoxious to a
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:51.620]  thinking person because anybody keeps what they're doing and that's part of
[02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:55.100]  that arrogance they don't care what we think anymore are they going for the
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:59.300]  whole bag of marbles and they know they have to and they know what's going to
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:04.180]  happen if they lose they're gonna end up in court in jail and some of them might
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:08.620]  get hung I mean that's where this thing is headed they they've got to go for
[02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:15.540]  broke they have there's no way back for them well I think that's in the final
[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:18.820]  equation the big issue is that the globalist are living on every front the
[02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:22.540]  French have gone into the ivory cusp to back the rebels slaughtering people the
[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:25.580]  globalist are trying to overthrow countries all over the world by backing
[02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:30.860]  rebels I mean the New World Order is now starting simultaneous wars all over the
[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:36.220]  planet not just the four they already had going Pakistan Afghanistan Iraq now
[02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:42.100]  Libya you've got troops in over a hundred countries thousands of bases and
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:45.980]  this is what the rand corporation three years ago wrote about Paul Watson then
[02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:49.220]  wrote a story about it they got a lot of attention where they said to get out of
[02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:52.100]  this global depression and get our new world order we got to have something a
[02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:55.140]  lot bigger than Iraq and Afghanistan we've got to have wars all over the
[02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:59.180]  place war is the health of the state as they say and that's what's happening
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:04.900]  right now Alan Ohio you're on the air with Bob Chapman go ahead well I've been
[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:08.900]  listening to you guys talk about the Constitution and I'm just as big a fan
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:14.140]  of the Constitution as anyone else we've got a problem though people don't
[02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:23.780]  seem to understand let me give you a Senate report 9 3-5 4 9 this was done
[02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:30.220]  and submitted in November 1973 I'm gonna read you just a small section of it
[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:34.060]  okay are you about to tell me the treaty superseded the Congress because they
[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:39.140]  don't in the federal courts have ruled that no no I could tell you that okay
[02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:43.060]  well go ahead ma'am what do you disagree with I agree I disagree with the fact
[02:39:43.060 --> 02:39:47.740]  when they gave the president of the United States in 1933 the war and
[02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:52.580]  emergency powers they never took it back yeah but I know we're in an emergency
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:57.180]  but that's still illegitimate that's a bit of legalese we're reclaiming the
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:02.340]  Republic just like in 76 1776 they said we got red blood we're not your slaves
[02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:06.700]  we reclaim it so much of this is not just their legalese or Bill Clinton
[02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:11.340]  saying depends on what the word is is is it is an imperium it is a dictatorship
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:15.620]  of the executive to have Obama doing this and if the Congress has the will
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:19.860]  do impeaching they can do it sorry go ahead I know I don't disagree with you
[02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:24.460]  Alex I do agree with you but Congress they don't even think would have to go
[02:40:24.460 --> 02:40:29.620]  that far they can start by taking away his war and emergency powers act which
[02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:35.020]  is what he uses to do all of this stuff making himself a dick but he didn't he
[02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:39.900]  didn't say he was using that he said for the credibility of the UN they're not
[02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:44.340]  even mincing words but have you noticed that all of these guys have kept us
[02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:49.580]  either in a war or a state of national emergency there have been no exceptions
[02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:54.900]  since 1933 no no one time I was watching c-span live a decade ago or so and the
[02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:59.460]  sergeant of arms marches in with the with the messenger of the president I
[02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:03.700]  have a message and then they use some grain crisis or whatever it was at the
[02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:07.900]  time to redeclare the emergency for the year and we've had constitutional law
[02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:11.780]  scholars on that break this down and now they've expanded it under the cog
[02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:17.340]  FEMA system in the name of security what we're saying is that itself is
[02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:23.980]  unconstitutional and illegitimate and so if we begin to impeach Obama our laws
[02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:28.060]  trump their confetti laws bob Chapman do you agree or do you have comments on
[02:41:28.060 --> 02:41:33.020]  this no comments and I agree with you and I think that's the way to go on it
[02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:38.540]  it gets right to the heart of the matter I mean there's some I mean what
[02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:41.900]  about torture what about saying they're allowed to kill US citizens and
[02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:45.620]  assassinations the war powers act doesn't give them that power even under
[02:41:45.620 --> 02:41:49.100]  wartime law you're not allowed to assassinate citizens without trial but
[02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:53.940]  but I understand your names Al or did Al hand the phone to you from Ohio no I'm
[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:59.900]  out we could we could add that to what you guys are talking about solutions get
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:05.340]  rid of his ability to do that because he can do things without the man so much
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:08.740]  of you I appreciate your call and I see we're coming from it's well taken but
[02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:13.940]  look so much of life is simply saying I'm not your slave I mean did did black
[02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:18.940]  slaves 200 years ago that ran away from their slave masters did it was that
[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:23.180]  lawful know the law at the time said it was illegal forget that law they're
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:28.860]  not slaves and this is written into our law that that if somebody tries to pass
[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:32.900]  a law that violates the bill rights and Constitution it's null and void what is
[02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:37.940]  that Marbury versus Madison and so many other rulings I mean if a cop comes to
[02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:41.500]  my door it says come out here and mow my lawn I don't have to it's just common
[02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:47.100]  sense so yeah Obama puts out a resolution Obama says the UN says I don't
[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:51.060]  care what they say and again it's that attitude of you're a fraud you're a
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:55.300]  scam you're a liar the Federal Reserve is illegitimate just 10 years ago five
[02:42:55.300 --> 02:42:57.940]  years ago people said you can never beat the Federal Reserve no one even knows
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:02.220]  their private now in polls over 80% know it's private want to abolish it the
[02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:06.620]  bankers Brzezinski give speeches saying we're in trouble the the people now see
[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:12.940]  us they're looking past our facades of politicians look so much of a war is
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:16.700]  morale and knowing you're in the right in the moral high ground we outnumber
[02:43:16.700 --> 02:43:23.740]  them ten thousand to one let's kick their hind ends Bob comments why you you
[02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:29.420]  covered it very well absolutely and bringing the word to the people is
[02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:34.820]  twist-killing the enemy and you cited Brzezinski Brzezinski which we talked
[02:43:34.820 --> 02:43:40.540]  about numerous times before they're in trouble they've got a goal for everything
[02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:46.380]  there's no way out for them and we've got them on the run that's right and it's
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:51.820]  because of programs in talk radio and what's on the internet we're reaching
[02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:56.460]  all over the world I mean I know you've done this before but three four times a
[02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:01.060]  month on on foreign radio stations they come to me like they do to you and say
[02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:05.020]  would you be on and talk about such and such to so-and-so we're reaching all
[02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:10.580]  over the world is the point that's right and we have history we have the
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:14.740]  Constitution Bill O'Ride's Declaration of Independence on our side and if the
[02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:17.780]  globalists try to start shutting the web down or talk radio that's not gonna
[02:44:17.780 --> 02:44:21.820]  work the genies out of the bottle and the globalists are fleeing forward they're
[02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:25.780]  desperate they're threatening and going in all directions because they're
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:33.860]  floundering they can't hold gold and silver down they're failing and that
[02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:38.700]  is the truth they are failing no matter how much they try they can't keep it
[02:44:38.700 --> 02:44:43.300]  down anymore let's go to David in Texas David you're on the air hello Alex yes
[02:44:43.300 --> 02:44:48.780]  sir yeah great show by the way I agree with everything you guys are talking
[02:44:48.780 --> 02:44:53.420]  about this is kind of off topic but it's so much thought that you might want to
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:59.420]  be aware no it's open phones we're all over the map go ahead okay I you know I
[02:44:59.420 --> 02:45:04.540]  follow YouTube and I go around looking for grim milk gorilla media like I that's
[02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:09.500]  what I like to call it it's basically you know just people posting opinions and
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:16.500]  things I found something from a YouTube poster called just call me kit anyway
[02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:23.060]  she posted a link to fed biz ops dot gov where they're looking for armed
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:27.740]  professional security officer services if you want the solicitation number I
[02:45:27.740 --> 02:45:34.220]  can go I've got the solicitation numbers for internment center workers here in
[02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:37.940]  the US it's in the Wall Street Journal it's in the Houston Chronicle so yes I've
[02:45:37.940 --> 02:45:42.100]  seen that the government is arming every different agency they can they are
[02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:46.900]  trying to hire tattletale squads professionals to be tattletales they're
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:50.500]  gearing up for a total criminal takeover because they know we're in a
[02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:55.020]  depression they engineered it that way to get total power I mean how ridiculous
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:58.340]  is it Bob when they tell us that the recessions over when every indicator
[02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:03.700]  is inflation's kicking up and we're in a depression and employment really isn't
[02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:10.260]  improving they use that u3 and knock it down from percent to 8.8 over six months
[02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:15.300]  period they could but they could only get u6 down which is the combination of
[02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:25.380]  the first five from 17.1 to 15.9 and and and therein lies the secret that in the
[02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:30.100]  unemployment numbers are over 22% and there's no career no recovery when you
[02:46:30.100 --> 02:46:35.660]  have those kind of numbers and how many people are being forced 10 million or so
[02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:43.380]  to be working part-time 30 34.3 hours a week Bob let me ask you this so David I
[02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:46.460]  appreciate your call interesting point does send that to me I'm sorry Bob go
[02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:51.980]  ahead yeah and and so there is no recovery well even if you believe the
[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:56.180]  baloney that this is a jobless recovery another Orwellian term the war isn't a
[02:46:56.180 --> 02:47:02.340]  war it's a kinetic action ground troops aren't ground troops they're there now
[02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:07.740]  telling us that the economy's wonderful while oil prices explode that affects
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:11.700]  every part of the economy what are these single moms with three kids gonna do
[02:47:11.700 --> 02:47:16.180]  what are blue-collar workers gonna do when gas is in many areas the country
[02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:23.220]  four dollars a gallon we guess they're not gonna travel very much well it's
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:27.180]  gonna kill every level of the economy and that's gonna be and that's gonna be
[02:47:27.180 --> 02:47:32.940]  money that people can't spend on clothes housing education medicine and I've
[02:47:32.940 --> 02:47:36.300]  seen financial experts on the news saying well if they spend the money one
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:39.180]  place it's still as good as the other because that's profits for corporations
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:43.620]  those are offshore corporations they use that in acquisition of big big items
[02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:48.780]  other companies they're not spending the money here and that's the paradox Bob
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:52.620]  there's so much money the central banks have been dumping out in the world but
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:56.020]  they're freezing it getting to the people and putting giant interest rates on
[02:47:56.020 --> 02:48:02.460]  it for those that can get it well I call it sterilization and in US
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:08.020]  corporations in the United States in cash right now the figures about two
[02:48:08.020 --> 02:48:11.700]  trillion but there's another figure out there
[02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:17.300]  transnational conglomerates because they don't pay taxes of her in America for
[02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:20.620]  the money that they make out of the outside of the country so their money
[02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:25.060]  is over in the Cayman Islands and that's two trillion more dollars that they
[02:48:25.060 --> 02:48:31.500]  want to bring back paying very very little tax upon it and so you're right
[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:36.660]  there's piles of money available but they're not putting it to work in the
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:41.220]  economy and right-wing talk show host will love to scapegoat some limousine
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:46.260]  liberal or some welfare queen or some you know out of control communist union
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:49.860]  and sure a lot of them are obnoxious even if all those people were sent to the
[02:48:49.860 --> 02:48:54.780]  moon it would have no effect on what the banksters have done and these neocon
[02:48:54.780 --> 02:48:59.100]  talk show host will not talk about the elephant in the room they will not talk
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:04.500]  about the real issue that G doesn't pay taxes Google pays 2.4 I'm paying 40 plus
[02:49:04.500 --> 02:49:08.700]  percent ladies and gentlemen okay the tax brackets way above 35 get that
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:13.180]  straight and now I'm sure you saw the article Bob about the four point five
[02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:16.540]  million dollar payment to somebody that ratted out their employer for making
[02:49:16.540 --> 02:49:23.500]  tax mistakes that the the IRS spies and that goes along with what you were
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:29.700]  talking about just a little while ago in relation to infiltrating businesses of
[02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:35.980]  all kinds and using people as spies it's the same concept land of the free home
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:39.020]  of the brave has a hollow ring to it Jack in Illinois you're on the air with
[02:49:39.020 --> 02:49:42.940]  Bob Chapman hi Alex I have a comment and a quick

[02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:58.260]  actually Jesse Ventura had it on the conspiracy theory program with a
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:03.220]  military officer April Gallup yes I've interviewed her before and I am aware of
[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:07.780]  that and I'm getting a lot of phone calls about it so yes we're aware of it

[02:54:27.180 --> 02:54:32.760]  weeks ago he played a edited tapes of me and then got into a whole bunch of
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:37.620]  really pornographic weird stuff about sexual practices that I can't even say
[02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:43.220]  on the air it was beyond bizarre I've started monitoring the show more he
[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:48.340]  gibbers and makes satanic jokes basically non-stop that I don't think his
[02:54:48.340 --> 02:54:51.140]  audience even hears the more I study him I think I might have to make a film
[02:54:51.140 --> 02:54:56.340]  about the guy just because last year at a press dinner he wore a Cumberbund with
[02:54:56.340 --> 02:54:59.860]  his tuxedo we're going back to Bobby here in a moment with a big skull and
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:05.300]  crossbones on it skull and bones and then it turns out on his show earlier this
[02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:08.420]  week and Aaron confirmed it and found the video this is going up on info wars
[02:55:08.420 --> 02:55:13.460]  dot com the next 10 minutes and prison planet dot com Glenback wears free
[02:55:13.460 --> 02:55:20.660]  masonic patch on his show and it's the skull and crossbones in the compass and
[02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:27.260]  says 1682 and it's just all part of him throwing things in people's face and I'm
[02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:31.140]  really sick of it and he's there to lead the liberty movement down a rat hole and
[02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:36.380]  they they tried to discredit the movement with him it didn't work so now
[02:55:36.380 --> 02:55:42.260]  he's off Fox and now he's saying he wants info warrior activist he wants his
[02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:45.260]  listeners to be his activists on the street trying to totally imitate what
[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:48.700]  we've done which would be great if he was a good guy the problem is he's shown
[02:55:48.700 --> 02:55:53.220]  himself to be a duplicitous person now before we go back to Bob and we're gonna
[02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:58.340]  do five minutes the next hour so we can get to Alan Al Sean George Joe cramming
[02:55:58.340 --> 02:56:05.940]  as many as I can I'm not gonna belabor this but Ted is with his family today

[03:00:45.580 --> 03:00:48.780]  you again my friend thanks for everything you're doing you've taught me
[03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:53.860]  more than I ever wanted to know a couple of questions here you know we talk
[03:00:53.860 --> 03:00:57.940]  about Obama and his religion his birth to get everything like that do you think
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:03.100]  that they started to hide his information about 20 years ago when they found out
[03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:08.660]  that he was actually not an American citizen and they started to set him up
[03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:12.900]  because look once you've got a criminal how many times does the government take
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:18.420]  criminals and turn them into partners no that's exactly Obama is totally black
[03:01:18.420 --> 03:01:23.860]  maleable and we know that's what's going on Bob Chapman yeah I agree with that and
[03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:30.180]  I do believe this is a been in the works for a long time it goes back to the
[03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:35.980]  commentary about his being trained and bring brought along and the comments by
[03:01:35.980 --> 03:01:42.980]  people who were in Soviet counterintelligence prior to the breakup of
[03:01:42.980 --> 03:01:48.820]  the country speaking to that and they were saying that the next president's
[03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:53.740]  going to be black this is who it is and so yes I think this goes back a long way
[03:01:53.740 --> 03:01:58.860]  these people have lots of long-term planning I mean look at what the
[03:01:58.860 --> 03:02:03.620]  situation we're in today deliberately created where did it start Bretton Woods
[03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:10.060]  what do you think Soros is at Bretton Woods it's gonna be a recapture of
[03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:16.940]  previous events these people are really into this stuff and also the throw in
[03:02:16.940 --> 03:02:23.340]  your face as well good points anything else Al well you know I've always said
[03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:29.620]  since the beginning that Obama is a patsy of radical Islam he hates America he
[03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:34.460]  hates Britain this is understood the other question I had was about the
[03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:39.580]  golden-silver issues is it true that these mines that there are no more
[03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:43.860]  silver mines on the freaking planet well they're running out supplies are low
[03:02:43.860 --> 03:02:48.540]  it's harder to get it it gets more expensive Bob I think that's a
[03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:55.420]  encapsulation the coming year this year and next year production will probably
[03:02:55.420 --> 03:03:01.700]  increase because of money that was invested previously but in both gold and
[03:03:01.700 --> 03:03:07.420]  silver in another metals as well the low-lying fruit so to speak has been
[03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:13.260]  picked over pretty well it's not going to be easy to find new pure silver mines
[03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:19.380]  and even today and for some years 70% of silver production has come as a
[03:03:19.380 --> 03:03:24.700]  byproduct of lead zinc and sometimes copper yeah and silvers and so many
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:28.740]  electronics that's another big issue it truly is an industrial metal one last
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:33.340]  call or sorry to the others and get back with a Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Sean in New
[03:03:33.340 --> 03:03:38.340]  York you're on the air go ahead you be our tail gunner hi Alex thanks for having
[03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:45.460]  me on the show you know I appreciated hearing all the stuff about right I've
[03:03:45.460 --> 03:03:51.500]  actually been involved with family court cps and family law for about 11 years
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:56.420]  and a lot of what you're talking about they're ignoring the Constitution they're
[03:03:56.420 --> 03:04:01.260]  ignoring rights I see that all the time in family court and it just seems that
[03:04:01.260 --> 03:04:06.540]  they really don't even care what you think or whatever and she had they just
[03:04:06.540 --> 03:04:10.060]  basically say well what are you gonna family courts aren't constitutional
[03:04:10.060 --> 03:04:14.420]  courts they were set up in the 1910 or so a little earlier than that in England
[03:04:14.420 --> 03:04:18.780]  as eugenics courts for sterilization courts they're not real courts and they
[03:04:18.780 --> 03:04:24.420]  need to be abolished Bob Chapman final comments on that I agree with you and
[03:04:24.420 --> 03:04:29.140]  but it's just like everything else is a gentleman's thing they don't care what
[03:04:29.140 --> 03:04:33.980]  we think we're gonna take and change things by chevon and right down their
[03:04:33.980 --> 03:04:38.780]  throat it's the only way we got to keep after them and keep after them and
[03:04:38.780 --> 03:04:43.500]  until this thing comes and glued and getting rid of the president would be a
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:47.900]  big step in that direction yeah let's impeach him it's up there on info wars
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:52.300]  calm and prison planet calm the crafted article of impeachment over his
[03:04:52.300 --> 03:04:55.900]  treason with the UN taking us to war as a tyrant Bob God bless you we'll see
[03:04:55.900 --> 03:04:59.420]  about back live next week we got that constitutional lawyer coming up and
[03:04:59.420 --> 03:05:05.420]  retransmission on the impeachment stay with us
