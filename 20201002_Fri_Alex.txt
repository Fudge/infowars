[00:00.000 --> 00:21.400]  It's Friday, October 2nd. The year is 2020. We are 32 days out from the election that
[00:21.400 --> 00:26.280]  the deep state Democrats have said they will contest and they will try to drive the country
[00:26.280 --> 00:31.880]  into civil war, balkanization, and even secession. And right on time we learn that President
[00:31.880 --> 00:39.600]  Trump has tested positive for COVID-19 and so has his wife Melania.
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.560]  Now let's talk about this. Many times I have said that one scenario would be the president
[00:44.560 --> 00:50.120]  getting COVID-19 near the election date and they could use that to try to put him under
[00:50.120 --> 00:55.880]  house arrest. How can the president again be put under quarantine and made to stay in
[00:55.880 --> 01:01.400]  one spot for 14 days? It's simply outrageous and it's part of the parallelization of our
[01:01.400 --> 01:05.960]  economy where one person has COVID-19 in a meat packing plant or a warehouse and they
[01:05.960 --> 01:12.960]  shut the whole thing down when the facts are 100% clear. COVID-19 has a lower death rate
[01:12.960 --> 01:18.920]  than the flu by many magnitudes when you take out the co-morbidities of 94% of the people
[01:18.920 --> 01:23.240]  that died of COVID-19 really died of something else. But that's the facts and they don't
[01:23.240 --> 01:28.840]  want the facts to get in the way all over Fox CNN. Oh we told you so. Those of you that
[01:28.840 --> 01:34.520]  say COVID-19 is a hoax, well you see that Trump and Melania have it. So it's always
[01:34.520 --> 01:39.480]  about there being more cases, not there being more death, but now that fall is here and
[01:39.480 --> 01:44.240]  now that winter is coming and people are indoors not getting vitamin D3 from the sun, you're
[01:44.240 --> 01:49.080]  going to see the regular flu deaths, the pneumonia deaths, the cold deaths of old people that
[01:49.080 --> 01:53.640]  will be put in the COVID-19 column. But here's the big takeaway and here's some of the articles
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.760]  there at infowars.com. We'll break down more in the next segment. No one else asked this
[01:58.760 --> 02:02.760]  question as of us publishing this about an hour ago. No one. I searched it. I got up at
[02:02.760 --> 02:08.120]  4.30 this morning. My phone was ringing off the hook. I'd gone to sleep last night, had
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.440]  missed Trump's tweet at like 11.55 that he and Melania had tested positive supposedly
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.280]  for COVID-19. I wake up at 4.30, my phone is loaded with text messages and calls saying
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.560]  President Trump and Melania have COVID-19. No, they've tested positive for it. So I
[02:22.560 --> 02:28.960]  searched, hey, is it a false positive? No one even asked that question until Paul Joseph
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.640]  Watson and I put this article out at infowars.com, which is scary because remember, you'd hear
[02:33.640 --> 02:37.840]  whole football teams had it and it was all false positives. Remember that? Or you'd hear
[02:37.840 --> 02:40.880]  a whole school had it and turn out they were all false positives even the New York Times
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.680]  had to admit that upwards of 90% of the tests are false positives. Simply incredible. So
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.480]  here's the headline. Could Trump's coronavirus test be a false positive? And it goes over
[02:50.480 --> 02:55.400]  the history and the evidence of it. What an important article will cover more next segment.
[02:55.400 --> 03:02.200]  Meanwhile, you knew this was coming. Let's just claim Trump faked his Corona virus infection.
[03:02.200 --> 03:05.880]  And I think it's fine to always question things. Does he have a motive? Does he want to be
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.420]  locked down for 14 days? The deep state and Democrats have used COVID-19 to keep things
[03:10.420 --> 03:14.960]  locked down and the economy and try to stop Trump rallies, but their BLM rallies and other
[03:14.960 --> 03:20.280]  rallies are supposedly okay. Trump does not have a motive to say yes, COVID-19. I'll talk
[03:20.280 --> 03:25.280]  about what I believe has probably happened more in the next segment, but Democrats are
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.560]  certainly welcome. And I think it's reasonable to question any government official, any agency,
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.960]  any corporation, any big group or any individual and say there's a history of lying. There's
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.680]  a history of people stazing that they've been attacked or that they're sick. And so it's
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.420]  totally reasonable with all the fake folks that say they have cancer, that do go fund
[03:44.420 --> 03:49.080]  me's, and all the babies and incubators being killed by Saddam that didn't exist, and all
[03:49.080 --> 03:56.120]  the just small lets and all the bubble wallaces. And all of that going on to say, did Trump
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.640]  stage this to get sympathy, to make himself look human, to counter strike against all
[04:01.640 --> 04:06.520]  those that say he's the guy that ignored COVID. So he made it worse than it was. But now that
[04:06.520 --> 04:10.960]  he's got it, he's one of us. I've looked at the calculus and I don't believe that that's
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.520]  what happened. This hurts Trump. It doesn't help Trump. Plus, I know how Trump operates.
[04:15.520 --> 04:22.000]  He is neurotically pragmatic and by the book. I mean, just extremely, almost to an autistic
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.600]  level in a good way. And Trump knows he can't trust people around him. Even if he was corrupt,
[04:26.600 --> 04:30.720]  he's not going to pull some fake thing like this and have others in on it when they're
[04:30.720 --> 04:36.000]  leaking information and it would surely come out. No, this man is an island. If any man
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.680]  ever was, and he knows that, but someone else has been faking test, and we'll cover it all
[04:40.680 --> 04:43.800]  on the other side. You're not going to get information like this anywhere else. It's
[04:43.800 --> 04:47.080]  critical this information get out. So please, whether you're listening on local station
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.080]  or watching TV or watching us on the internet, share those links, share the word. That's
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.080]  how we override the globalist. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones, and this is the info word
[04:55.080 --> 05:03.680]  info words.com forward slash show. And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his
[05:03.680 --> 05:11.400]  way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it's
[05:11.400 --> 05:18.560]  estimated that 200 million people have died 200 million people have died. Probably by
[05:18.560 --> 05:24.880]  the time I finish this talk, right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60%
[05:24.880 --> 05:29.680]  of America has died from COVID-19. When it's not even 200,000 reality, he would want to
[05:29.680 --> 05:34.520]  say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage. It's all made up. But you know, we
[05:34.520 --> 05:38.960]  got it, the mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that. They said
[05:38.960 --> 05:46.800]  that 4% of America would be dead already. Of course, it's 0.000000 and then add a number
[05:46.800 --> 05:51.680]  because the numbers vary. It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning
[05:51.680 --> 06:12.000]  is real. But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and his mind control.
[06:12.000 --> 06:21.840]  It's Friday, October 2nd, 2020. We're 32 days out from the election. And we've got exclusive
[06:21.840 --> 06:30.480]  beyond bombshell game changing, world event defining, chill up and down the back of your
[06:30.480 --> 06:37.480]  spine level information if people will just listen to me. And if we can just get Tucker
[06:37.480 --> 06:44.080]  Carlson to talk about this in Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and Senator
[06:44.080 --> 06:51.080]  Cruz and Senator Paul, especially a medical doctor, we can save America and the world.
[06:51.080 --> 06:57.080]  You knew there'd be a dirty trick 30-something days out from the election. And I'm on record.
[06:57.080 --> 07:01.280]  The crew's digging it up. We'll have it later in the broadcast here on this Friday edition,
[07:01.280 --> 07:06.440]  where I said they could use a false positive COVID test in the president to lock him down
[07:06.440 --> 07:11.440]  and that I predicted they'd do it in and around the election. Also, so they could give him
[07:11.440 --> 07:16.240]  a weaponized strain. When I came in this morning, the crew reminded me of that and again, they're
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.560]  digging it out. But look, that's just a scenario. That's just analysis of a probability, of
[07:21.560 --> 07:32.360]  a possibility knowing the MO. Doesn't matter. Listen to me very, very, very, very carefully.
[07:32.360 --> 07:36.040]  Not only do we have proof that this is almost certainly a false positive and I'll present
[07:36.040 --> 07:41.680]  it in a moment, but then if we don't get Trump to understand that and if he goes the Boris
[07:41.680 --> 07:47.280]  Johnson victim round and plays along with it, it will only help intensify the lockdown
[07:47.280 --> 07:51.960]  and let the deep state blame Trump for the COVID-19 deaths, which are really China's fault
[07:51.960 --> 07:56.280]  that they've already been hyping. So let me break down this political calculus, this
[07:56.280 --> 08:03.320]  political trigonometry if you want to win. Now let's get into it right now. These articles
[08:03.320 --> 08:06.480]  are on infowars.com. They've got all the links proving it. Then I'll go over the actual
[08:06.480 --> 08:12.440]  original articles for you right after that. Could Trump's coronavirus test be a false
[08:12.440 --> 08:19.000]  positive? Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones, infowars.com. As of six o'clock in the morning
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.160]  when we got this article out, no one else had asked the question, even though it came
[08:23.160 --> 08:29.400]  out last night. It's not about us being cutting edge. That's scary. Whole football teams,
[08:29.400 --> 08:33.560]  I'll show you the articles and whole groups of sports teams would test positive and then
[08:33.560 --> 08:38.640]  they go get tested again and they'd all be negative, but they can get two more tests
[08:38.640 --> 08:43.920]  to prove it, three in a row, some teams four in a row, five in a row. I'll show you the
[08:43.920 --> 08:50.360]  articles, but you remember that. So they now admit 90% of the average test are false positive.
[08:50.360 --> 08:54.160]  The new rapid reaction test that Trump got convinced to put out that the White House
[08:54.160 --> 09:01.760]  uses, they're saying they may be like 98% false positive. So think about that. This
[09:01.760 --> 09:08.040]  is all hidden in plain view that almost everyone is false positive, but on this test, we don't
[09:08.040 --> 09:11.760]  even hear, let's get a second opinion. That's the first thing you do. They tell you have
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.720]  cancer or you've got something else or you've got a venereal disease. You go get a second
[09:15.720 --> 09:19.120]  opinion. They're telling the most important person in the world, the leader of the free
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.720]  world that he's got something and he's got to just go away for 14 days in the home stretch
[09:23.720 --> 09:30.280]  of a campaign and kill his ground game. This helps America's enemies and China is laughing
[09:30.280 --> 09:35.920]  at us saying, oh, look, it's our fault, but Democrats are calling it the Trump virus and
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.600]  no one in his own campaign is getting other doctors in or doing other tests. And they're
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.120]  telling us it was the rapid reaction test when Hope Hicks had a cough. So they went
[09:47.120 --> 09:50.400]  and tested it and said, oh, you're positive. So Melania and Trump got tested and now they
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.960]  have it. This is incredible, ladies and gentlemen. So we're going to try to figure out exactly
[09:55.960 --> 10:00.480]  what's going on here, but here's the next headline also in fours.com. Let this claim
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.800]  Trump faked his Corona virus infection. Well, how did he fake it if they went and tested
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.920]  him? But there's a kernel of truth there because if almost all these tests are false positive,
[10:11.920 --> 10:16.240]  if nine or 10 times they're false positive, well, then you'd be reasonable to say it's
[10:16.240 --> 10:22.400]  a fake test. 90% chance, conservatively, it is a false positive, but asking that question
[10:22.400 --> 10:27.400]  is evil and horrible. And the media spends it, well, Jones is saying COVID-19 is a hoax.
[10:27.400 --> 10:32.880]  No, it's not. It's a manmade virus, gain of function, Fauci, Bill Gates, mainstream news,
[10:32.880 --> 10:36.920]  Newsweek, AP report it. So they can own it and patent and control it. And there are worse
[10:36.920 --> 10:40.920]  strains out there, but compared to many other flus and things, it's not that deadly, but
[10:40.920 --> 10:46.000]  it does spread so people get tested positive so they can then be identified and be told
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.120]  they've got to be contact traced, got to have apps on your phone, got to have a social
[10:49.120 --> 10:53.560]  credit score, got to shut society down, got to bring in the carbon tax, got to have the
[10:53.560 --> 10:59.800]  great reset. The Davos group is openly talking about. So do I think Trump staged this? No,
[10:59.800 --> 11:04.600]  this hurts Trump. This hurts the recovery. This hurts America. This helps shut him down
[11:04.600 --> 11:10.680]  with just 32 days left. Now let's go into those articles that I just mentioned. These
[11:10.680 --> 11:18.480]  are all mainstream news. Up to 90% of those who tested positive for COVID-19 wrongly diagnosed.
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.000]  And even Lancet Medical Journal is saying that. Trump administration's new rapid coronavirus
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.640]  test plagued by confusion and lack of planning. Washington Post, and it says most of them
[11:29.640 --> 11:35.320]  are false positives. Here's the New York Times. Your coronavirus test is positive. Maybe
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.800]  it shouldn't be. When they say in here upwards of 90% or more are false positives. Chinese
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.640]  state media gloats about Trump catching coronavirus, but really what he did is he got tested with
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.680]  something that let's say if nine times out of 10, you won the lottery, you didn't really
[11:51.680 --> 11:56.200]  win. Would them announcing you won the lottery mean you won? If nine times out of 10, it
[11:56.200 --> 12:00.840]  turned out it wasn't a win. See, you'd be like, oh no, they've got a 10% chance of winning
[12:00.840 --> 12:05.880]  the lottery. It's the same thing here. It's total fraud, ladies and gentlemen. 90% chances
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.560]  of false positive, but where's the talk of more test? It's the president. We want more
[12:10.560 --> 12:17.360]  test. We want a blood test. We want it now. Continuing Connecticut state lab finds 90%
[12:17.360 --> 12:21.480]  false positives out of 144 coronavirus tests administered in mid June. I just have dozens
[12:21.480 --> 12:31.400]  of articles. NFL has 77 apparently false positive COVID-19 test from the lab. Thousands of Swedes
[12:31.400 --> 12:39.320]  got false COVID-19 results to the test kit fault. California will soon be paying $1,050
[12:39.320 --> 12:43.920]  to people who test positive for coronavirus. That just incentivizes this whole damn thing.
[12:43.920 --> 12:49.160]  Rhode Island received 113 false positive COVID-19 test results from private lab. I mean, these
[12:49.160 --> 12:54.680]  are just the articles I printed before we went live here. This is nothing. This is nothing.
[12:54.680 --> 12:59.600]  There's articles where hundreds of labs in Florida all said 100% positive. Turn out they
[12:59.600 --> 13:04.920]  didn't even test the people. Former FDA commission says coronavirus antibody tests are returning
[13:04.920 --> 13:16.560]  tons of false positives. Musk urges COVID-19 results to ridiculous number of false positives.
[13:16.560 --> 13:22.400]  Three titans players, five personal test pods for COVID-19, suspend in-person activities.
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.920]  And then of course it turned out they didn't really have COVID-19. And it goes on and on
[13:28.920 --> 13:34.640]  and on and on. And people are getting upset about this. People are getting mad about this.
[13:34.640 --> 13:40.360]  America is in a war for its very survival. And now our president battling against the
[13:40.360 --> 13:46.360]  communist Chinese, the globalists and others in an open worldwide economic war is being
[13:46.360 --> 13:53.560]  told he's got to stay locked up for 14 days legitimizing this entire giant fraud. What
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.280]  we know is 90% of the tests are false positive conservatively. What we know is there are
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.560]  people inside the White House that want to lock the president down. There have been all
[14:02.560 --> 14:07.200]  these coup plans by people in the White House. You had Matt is trying to organize a coup.
[14:07.200 --> 14:12.040]  And I said all along one way to do it with this COVID-19 is to give him a false positive
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.800]  test. They can then poison his diet coke or something. He gets really sick and they said
[14:16.800 --> 14:23.120]  it's COVID-19. So I would also advise a secret service to be extra diligent about what the
[14:23.120 --> 14:30.320]  president ingest because they can now use COVID as the cover to kill the president. If
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.120]  you simply look at this from a Machiavellian view and start studying the different angles
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.040]  historically it's very, very serious. Another reason COVID-19 is so important and it's not
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.400]  a hoax and that it does kill people is that it's a classic chimera five species virus
[14:44.400 --> 14:48.680]  manmade all the top scientists the discoverer of HIV Nobel Prize winners they've all come
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.320]  out it's confirmed. And the media tries to censor that because it's true. It was developed
[14:53.320 --> 15:01.120]  as a whole group of viruses that you can then manipulate and weaponize at any time. So it
[15:01.120 --> 15:05.640]  has incredible gain of function HIV delivery system doesn't give you HIV but as the delivery
[15:05.640 --> 15:10.680]  system you get through your mucous membranes. And so it's a very dangerous weaponized virus
[15:10.680 --> 15:14.320]  in that it has incredible gain of function. But imagine it is the missile that carries
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.920]  the payload. Most the strains are not very dangerous not very bad if you have your zinc
[15:18.920 --> 15:24.560]  your vitamin D3 and of course your vitamin C as Fauci's been forced to say. Those are
[15:24.560 --> 15:28.600]  the upfront therapeutics people need. We're going to come back in the next segment and
[15:28.600 --> 15:32.800]  break down the next shoot a drop. I'm Alex Jones. Spread the word info wars.com
[15:58.960 --> 16:03.960]  billionaires in the big banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman.
[16:03.960 --> 16:07.520]  They believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when
[16:07.520 --> 16:12.160]  they want to go to a mountaintop or a national park they have to look at us the common people
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.720]  they have to look at the proletariat that look at the scum. That's why they love the
[16:16.720 --> 16:20.880]  lockdown putting muscles on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we can
[16:20.880 --> 16:26.800]  go what we can do bankrupting Main Street bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.280]  integration consolidation so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender which
[16:32.280 --> 16:38.080]  is taking sterilant vaccines day one. Ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.880]  times over they used all the entertainment garbage to put us into a trance and now the
[16:42.880 --> 16:48.160]  spiders moving in for the kill. You know this I know this it's all out in the open the question
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.000]  is what are we going to do about it. Well the first thing is identify the enemy identify
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.720]  the enemy identify the enemy identify your enemy now. I've come to you many times and
[16:58.720 --> 17:03.920]  ask for your support and you've always come through and Info Wars has come through we've
[17:03.920 --> 17:08.240]  never sold out we've never backed down we've always told the truth we've made mistakes
[17:08.240 --> 17:16.240]  98% of the time or so we're dead on and the enemy knows that Info Wars is a thought leader
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.240]  not just here but around the world and that's why the Chai comms Hollywood the globalist
[17:21.240 --> 17:26.240]  want us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny and a post human world will
[17:26.240 --> 17:31.280]  not succeed if we stay on air. If you don't support us ladies and gentlemen now they're
[17:31.280 --> 17:35.840]  going to shut Info Wars down and shut everybody else down as well. You already know that it's
[17:35.840 --> 17:42.160]  out the open so again count the cost focus and realize how critical you are with your
[17:42.160 --> 17:45.640]  word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors your financial support getting
[17:45.640 --> 17:49.800]  the products at infowarstore.com and your prayer. I'm praying for you please pray for
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.080]  us let's do this together we're going to win we are winning but it's not going to be easy
[17:54.080 --> 18:00.240]  the enemy is trying to take it all from us let's not let them succeed.
[18:00.240 --> 18:21.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:21.080 --> 18:26.320]  Welcome back I am your host Alex Jones I'll be back in studio coming up a little bit later
[18:26.320 --> 18:30.960]  but David Knight is really extremely well researched he's an engineer and to all the
[18:30.960 --> 18:35.960]  COVID-19 fraud all the different scams the exaggerations the dead people put on list
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.280]  is dying of COVID-19 the gain of function the test being false positive he's going
[18:40.280 --> 18:46.160]  to be in studio with Owen Schreuer coming up and then Owen's going to continue into
[18:46.160 --> 18:51.040]  the second hour then we have a medical doctor coming on a great lady who's been exposing
[18:51.040 --> 18:55.600]  the COVID-19 power grab she's going to be joining us on air as well but let me show
[18:55.600 --> 19:00.520]  you one more story before I get into the election itself remember all the meat packing plants
[19:00.520 --> 19:05.520]  and other shipping facilities warehouses where you have two thousand employees three thousand
[19:05.520 --> 19:10.040]  employees four thousand employees and they would test them all and in some cases half
[19:10.040 --> 19:15.040]  of them would test positive but none of them were sick and they were asymptomatic well
[19:15.040 --> 19:18.720]  some of them had COVID-19 but it didn't make them sick because they had had their vitamins
[19:18.720 --> 19:22.760]  and minerals and nutrients but the others it turned out were false positives ladies and
[19:22.760 --> 19:27.640]  gentlemen in fact the vast majority yet again remember all of that but what does this do
[19:27.640 --> 19:33.200]  it shuts down our industry makes our economy collapse when we collapse the third world
[19:33.200 --> 19:38.520]  dies so it's not it's not heroic to sit there and say oh I'm going to wear my mask oh I'm
[19:38.520 --> 19:42.440]  not going to go out oh I'm going to stay home oh I'm going to live on welfare because that
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.680]  is going to bring us into an unending depression which is what the Davos group the top banks
[19:46.680 --> 19:51.120]  want to make us dependent on them they want a post industrial world they don't want yourself
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.560]  sufficient they don't want to be able to take care of yourself they want a guaranteed universal
[19:55.560 --> 20:01.280]  income so they can dictate to you how you live your life what your politics are and
[20:01.280 --> 20:06.600]  what you can and can't do that's why major cycling stars that just say yeah I like Trump
[20:06.600 --> 20:11.880]  get fired off their team you're not even allowed in America to say you like Trump imagine this
[20:11.880 --> 20:14.920]  into the future well you're a Christian sorry you can't have a bank account can't have a
[20:14.920 --> 20:18.880]  job oh you're a gunstore owner you can't have a bank account can't have a job it's already
[20:18.880 --> 20:23.920]  here that's Trump's greatest failing is not standing up against the censorship and the
[20:23.920 --> 20:29.120]  harassment of Christians and conservatives in America and patriots that has not been
[20:29.120 --> 20:35.360]  seen since the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany I mean in Nazi Germany under Lenin they targeted
[20:35.360 --> 20:40.000]  Christians under Hitler they targeted Jews and others and they would shut down their
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.840]  bank accounts their businesses and their lives to then impoverish them and then finally kill
[20:43.840 --> 20:50.520]  them well here it is Americans increasingly believe violence is justified give the other
[20:50.520 --> 20:54.840]  side wins well that's what the Democrats have been preparing but they can't be this politically
[20:54.840 --> 21:00.320]  so they want to beat us by having a civil war and a lot of states like Michigan and
[21:00.320 --> 21:04.320]  Pennsylvania have had rulings that they can just keep the election open indefinitely bring
[21:04.320 --> 21:07.920]  in the 20th amendment and have Nancy Pelosi in the House representatives elect who the
[21:07.920 --> 21:12.280]  president is but we've had some victories two huge court rulings and GOP main blocks
[21:12.280 --> 21:18.440]  illegal Democrat ballot harvesting Texas blocks straight party ballot option so all
[21:18.440 --> 21:23.680]  of that is happening as well and what are they trying to cover up with America sucks
[21:23.680 --> 21:27.720]  in America's behind COVID-19 and communist China's cheerleading and saying Trump's the
[21:27.720 --> 21:34.560]  bad guy news like this story huge US Marshall service announces rescue more than 1,300 missing
[21:34.560 --> 21:40.400]  children including vet victims of sex trafficking Trump has doubled the number of rescues just
[21:40.400 --> 21:46.240]  in the last year and that's what Hunter Biden and that's what John Podesta and that's what
[21:46.240 --> 21:51.520]  Hillary Clinton and Laura Sillsby and all these people are so concerned about because
[21:51.520 --> 21:58.600]  they know the brothman sex cult the nexium devil cult all of it John of God Oprah Winfrey
[21:58.600 --> 22:04.760]  Bill Gates involved with Jeffrey Epstein they know it's all coming down but to recap this
[22:04.760 --> 22:07.840]  if the vast majority of the tests are false positive with the four types of tests there
[22:07.840 --> 22:13.520]  are and we've learned this that's why the death rate is in high but the testing positive
[22:13.520 --> 22:17.200]  rate is high it's not about getting sick now it's about oh you have it and oh you don't
[22:17.200 --> 22:22.880]  want to get it and so again Trump must be multiple tested he must have independent outside groups
[22:22.880 --> 22:27.440]  do it I don't trust the people in the White House they've proven to be double agents we've
[22:27.440 --> 22:31.560]  got to get the message out of the president he needs to be tested again and that he shouldn't
[22:31.560 --> 22:37.240]  be locked down during this campaign this is siege this is manipulation this is the shutdown
[22:37.240 --> 22:41.880]  of the campaign of the president of everyone and now it's got them saying Trump said it
[22:41.880 --> 22:47.320]  was a hoax he never said it was a hoax he said the hoax was saying 2.5 million would
[22:47.320 --> 22:51.960]  die the hoax was saying that the hospitals were all going to be filled and we had to
[22:51.960 --> 22:55.880]  shut the economy completely down the hoax was them saying that Trump didn't shut down
[22:55.880 --> 23:01.200]  flights from China when they were the ones saying don't shut down the flights from China
[23:01.200 --> 23:06.800]  in closing before Owen shroyer and David Knight takeover with the critical proof and analysis

[24:42.440 --> 24:47.160]  time because we need capital to fund ourselves in the next year and things are so bad and
[24:47.160 --> 24:51.400]  supply chains are breaking down that the storeable foods and the supplements and the t-shirts
[24:51.400 --> 24:55.920]  and the things we have in stock may be the last run that's why a lot of great sellers
[24:55.920 --> 25:00.160]  we've had aren't coming back because the companies have shut down or the supply chains have
[25:00.160 --> 25:04.040]  broke down and it's coming out in the news that food prices are going up in scarcity
[25:04.040 --> 25:07.840]  the third world already two million starved to death they were saying 135 million might
[25:07.840 --> 25:12.960]  die now the U.N. says 200 plus million I mean folks this is dire this is the new world order
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.280]  this is the global shutdown this is the great reset and we're the tip of the spear and the
[25:17.280 --> 25:22.520]  enemy wants us shut down so tell folks about those local AM and FM stations tell folks
[25:22.520 --> 25:26.480]  about the local TV stations and spread the word about those affiliates and spread the
[25:26.480 --> 25:32.320]  word about infowars.com forward slash show and get the links to the articles and the
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.040]  videos and all of it come out to everybody you know we're doing a special 24 hour broadcast
[25:36.040 --> 25:41.880]  also the kicks off next Wednesday I'll tell you more about that but we are just in such
[25:41.880 --> 25:46.680]  a historic position America is fighting for its life and if we just identify who's attacking
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.680]  America and who the players are we can turn this around and stop it but if people don't
[25:52.680 --> 25:56.840]  realize this is happening and are too scared to admit the truth then you really better
[25:56.840 --> 26:03.080]  be scared because the evil will be able to take over admitting all of this is happening
[26:03.080 --> 26:09.200]  is what enables us to say no to it and to stop it and so we're coming down to the end here
[26:09.200 --> 26:12.480]  if Trump doesn't win and if things go crazy and the civil war and the internet kill switch
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.440]  goes in they're going to implement on the day of the election to selectively shut down
[26:16.440 --> 26:21.280]  conservatives and patriots worldwide not just here in the US I may never get to talk to

[27:04.200 --> 27:10.200]  magazine documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain as day communist
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.960]  Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United
[27:14.960 --> 27:20.520]  States as well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look
[27:20.520 --> 27:26.320]  like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year then the UN put out standardized
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.600]  rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months this
[27:31.600 --> 27:39.680]  is the greatest strategic ever this is 21st century warfare being carried out psychological
[27:39.680 --> 27:45.720]  means for the ultimate style Paul Joseph Watson has written about it info wars dot com myself
[27:45.720 --> 27:49.840]  Alex Jones David I know and shroyer covering this heavily this is the way to bring down
[27:49.840 --> 27:55.800]  the globalist is exposing how communist China the UN were behind the hysteria are you sick

[28:18.760 --> 28:25.720]  blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity no more pesky lawn order when Democrats

[28:32.240 --> 28:38.440]  burn to the ground but wait vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts
[28:38.440 --> 28:46.240]  election fraud cancel culture taxes and more taxes Democrats bringing chaos right to your
[28:46.240 --> 28:59.600]  front door it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would
[28:59.600 --> 29:05.880]  track your GPS location I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because
[29:05.880 --> 29:11.520]  that was on American now the media admits that almost every app and every company that
[29:11.520 --> 29:16.760]  are on Apple and on droids don't just track your location but your surfing history where
[29:16.760 --> 29:22.440]  you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share the data with each other
[29:22.440 --> 29:27.680]  of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're
[29:27.680 --> 29:33.800]  saying just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything
[29:33.800 --> 29:38.960]  you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.480]  are generating secret surveillance scores based on information this is the global Chinese
[29:43.480 --> 29:49.520]  communist social credit score get your protection privacy pockets at info or short com and cut
[29:49.520 --> 29:59.480]  big brother off dead in his filthy tracks info or store dot com you're listening to the Alex
[29:59.480 --> 30:23.000]  Jones show you founded the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show
[30:23.000 --> 30:32.080]  and David Knight in studio here on the Alex Jones show and ladies and gentlemen obviously
[30:32.080 --> 30:38.640]  everybody is talking about president Trump and the first lady testing positive for covid
[30:38.640 --> 30:46.480]  19 of course the questions are amassing is it a false positive was the president set
[30:46.480 --> 30:53.240]  up during the debates what is a two week quarantine going to mean for the president conveniently
[30:53.240 --> 30:57.400]  even if he did two weeks he would still be available the night of the debates this is
[30:57.400 --> 31:01.600]  all going on right now Joe Biden and Jill Biden have just announced that they tested
[31:01.600 --> 31:06.880]  negatively for covid 19 so maybe Joe who just announced he's going to have a ground game
[31:06.880 --> 31:11.040]  yesterday is going to start campaigning while they try to sideline the president is there
[31:11.040 --> 31:16.840]  something nefarious going on but aside from the president of the United States David everybody
[31:16.840 --> 31:23.520]  is talking about this right now but we had college football teams we had CDC releasing
[31:23.520 --> 31:28.960]  numbers that then they had to change the percentages of how fatal it was all the false positives
[31:28.960 --> 31:33.880]  I mean just just all of the nonsense but it's just all the president tested positive even
[31:33.880 --> 31:37.920]  though he's been campaigning shown no signs shown no symptoms as far as we can tell he's
[31:37.920 --> 31:42.520]  on the public view every day oh he has to be shut down oh my gosh covid is really deadly
[31:42.520 --> 31:47.480]  they're telling you this on CNN see we told you Trump supporters but no questions of is
[31:47.480 --> 31:52.560]  it fake and no no you know talks about well it's not even that fatal well you know as
[31:52.560 --> 31:56.280]  you point out football teams and so we're going to have to we're not going to do we
[31:56.280 --> 31:59.080]  because we had several people test positive in a football team so we're going to shut
[31:59.080 --> 32:05.600]  this down you've had schools one school doing 10,000 tests and we had a lot of students
[32:05.600 --> 32:09.600]  that have tested positive nobody's going to the hospital so you know what do we do about
[32:09.600 --> 32:13.880]  this is they've changed the goalpost first it's going to be we got a flat decay right
[32:13.880 --> 32:19.080]  that was about a death toll and it was about presumed deaths because they didn't have the
[32:19.080 --> 32:24.480]  test there was a big aha moment I call it because it was American Hospital Association
[32:24.480 --> 32:29.160]  they came back about a month ago they said wait a minute we're getting these notifications
[32:29.160 --> 32:35.080]  from Medicare saying they're not going to pay us the covid bonus because we haven't produced
[32:35.080 --> 32:41.600]  the test to verify this we've just done clinical diagnosis and they said you told us that first
[32:41.600 --> 32:45.640]  of all you didn't have enough tests secondly they weren't reliable and you told us to do
[32:45.640 --> 32:50.960]  clinical diagnosis of this okay so that was the basis on which we had the massive numbers
[32:50.960 --> 32:56.560]  of deaths and now it's about anybody that gets a positive and even the Washington Post
[32:56.560 --> 33:01.400]  going back to Monday talks about the Trump administration's new rapid coronavirus test
[33:01.400 --> 33:08.120]  this is the one that was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization August
[33:08.120 --> 33:14.400]  the 23rd and immediately the Trump administration spent $750 million to buy 150 million of these
[33:14.400 --> 33:20.840]  test kits they cost $5 and unlike the PCR kits where they do that that long swab that
[33:20.840 --> 33:25.320]  goes up under your nose and then they send that off to a lab and you get the result back
[33:25.320 --> 33:31.920]  and you know I guess days this happens in 15 minutes it's credit card size five bucks
[33:31.920 --> 33:35.680]  and they want to get a lot of these things put around they said well this is a game changer
[33:35.680 --> 33:40.520]  well the whole gist of this article from the Washington Post on Monday was to talk about
[33:40.520 --> 33:44.600]  how there were all these complaints about false positives now if the Trump administration
[33:44.600 --> 33:49.400]  has just jumped into this with both feet and we've got the testings are an admiral and
[33:49.400 --> 33:53.600]  by the way these people who are running the vaccine program who are running this covid
[33:53.600 --> 33:58.480]  response it's mostly military people if that doesn't raise a red flag with you nothing
[33:58.480 --> 34:03.880]  will but anyway this this testings are is now saying you know we know with every test
[34:03.880 --> 34:07.200]  is going to be false positives don't worry about the false positives and the whole thing
[34:07.200 --> 34:11.680]  is about false positives health administration officials knew the test could be less reliable
[34:11.680 --> 34:16.800]  they've encountered more false positives than expected and so there's a lot of information
[34:16.800 --> 34:23.440]  that makes us believe this is a false positive the New York Times story that said 90% of those
[34:23.440 --> 34:30.360]  who tested positive out of three states were they were false positives but their response
[34:30.360 --> 34:35.640]  to the New York Times was well therefore we need to test more people you know this is
[34:35.640 --> 34:40.120]  the definition of insanity you got a test that's only 10% right so they say well let's
[34:40.120 --> 34:43.920]  do more of these but they need those numbers that's that's what it's all about it's about
[34:43.920 --> 34:47.840]  the numbers and it's more important than shutting down a university or shutting down a football
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.400]  team or an NFL season when they get at the beginning of this they said well we got some
[34:53.400 --> 34:57.200]  body who tested positive at a meat packing plant let's shut down the entire meat packing
[34:57.200 --> 35:01.560]  plant that's how we got the shortages of beef of pork of other things like that because
[35:01.560 --> 35:06.680]  we have such a centralized now that there's there's so few places where they actually
[35:06.680 --> 35:11.480]  do meat packing that if you shut something down like that because you got a false positive
[35:11.480 --> 35:16.680]  or because you just got a case and they're getting positives off of people who don't
[35:16.680 --> 35:20.960]  have symptoms who aren't sick and then they're shutting down universities they shut down
[35:20.960 --> 35:25.940]  the University of North Carolina when we were there five people they had tests out of tens
[35:25.940 --> 35:30.360]  of thousands I think on campus but they they shut down the entire university system and
[35:30.360 --> 35:34.760]  if they shut down your food supply based on this we got real big problems but I don't
[35:34.760 --> 35:41.040]  know that that Trump is positive when we look at all of this but I do know that these rapid
[35:41.040 --> 35:48.920]  tests are very dangerous nose under the tent from the camel because along with this rapid
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.840]  response test the the key selling point with them is that they have the ability to create
[35:54.840 --> 36:01.480]  a health pass a digital health pass so you get tested they give you a free app and then
[36:01.480 --> 36:07.520]  on your phone it's free for iPhone or Android on your phone it says when you were tested
[36:07.520 --> 36:11.800]  what the results were so that you can show that to people and we've got the airlines
[36:11.800 --> 36:18.960]  begging for rapid tests so they have to quarantine people begging to add this to the queue at
[36:18.960 --> 36:26.280]  the TSA lines and this is all going to be used to condition people for the vaccine immunity
[36:26.280 --> 36:30.960]  passport which is really what this this end game is coming to and also after you have
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.560]  queued up I mean there's only 15 minutes right 15 minutes is a long time to sit and
[36:35.560 --> 36:41.320]  wait for something assuming that there's not a DMV type of line to get tested in addition
[36:41.320 --> 36:45.880]  to that you could sit there for maybe a couple of hours for this rapid test and after you've
[36:45.880 --> 36:50.200]  done this a few times they're going to condition people say wait a minute if you take the vaccine
[36:50.200 --> 36:56.120]  this all goes away and you just you know shine the little digital thing that that gates developed
[36:56.120 --> 37:01.120]  last year with MIT so we can see you've been vaccinated you got your little invisible tattoo
[37:01.120 --> 37:04.840]  we can do the same thing with that that we do with the immunity passport well and of
[37:04.840 --> 37:11.280]  course and by the way this story came out to you mentioned the nasal test a woman leaks
[37:11.280 --> 37:17.880]  cerebro spinal fluid from her nose after a nasal swab COVID-19 test so well I didn't
[37:17.880 --> 37:20.960]  even I joked about that today I said yeah you don't have to hit it up there and hit
[37:20.960 --> 37:27.600]  your your well you see how they do it I mean yeah I know it goes so so David here's what
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.760]  they've done I think this is the most general consensus and it's not you know accurate and
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.640]  it's and it's you know if you want to bear down but I mean they've rebranded the flu
[37:36.640 --> 37:41.320]  is what they've done yeah they've rebranded the flu and they've used this to to strike
[37:41.320 --> 37:44.880]  fear into people they've used this to get people to want a vaccine they've used this
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.880]  to completely control the economy all commerce all all flows of traffic at least that's what
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.000]  they want and they keep moving the goalpost like you said so in the beginning it was oh
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.440]  this is so deadly 15 days to slow the spread okay well now we tested everybody and their
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.960]  mom and we know that it's a 99% survival rate and who really knows about a spread maybe
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.000]  there's a spread we've never done a I mean it's like a world health organization test
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.320]  of let's see how a virus really spreads now they're not being honest about that but that's
[38:13.320 --> 38:16.080]  really what this is we could do this for flu you could do this for herpes you could do
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.720]  this for anything you can get probably worse numbers that's right but they've they've already
[38:19.720 --> 38:24.880]  made it a fear factor with COVID so everybody thinks oh it's legitimate that we change the
[38:24.880 --> 38:30.080]  face of the earth and civilization over this COVID and they just like the masks it's it's
[38:30.080 --> 38:34.400]  social conditioning it allows them to have a justification to do what they want to do
[38:34.400 --> 38:37.880]  anyway with the mask your mask don't protect you they protect other people that's what
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.240]  they were telling us about the MMR vaccine a year ago when they start mandating it in
[38:42.240 --> 38:45.080]  the schools and when Trump said you just got to get the vaccine that's all there is to
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.880]  it and we've seen this game before you talking about how they've escalated the flu we've seen
[38:49.880 --> 38:54.840]  the same game before every year as a matter of fact for several years now we've seen this
[38:54.840 --> 39:00.480]  from the CDC talking about how many flu cases there are and so forth and we've had I've had
[39:00.480 --> 39:08.080]  on my show del big tree and others who have shown the documents where the CDC sent information
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.200]  out to doctors and said look don't send us a test we don't have enough tests we're overwhelmed
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.680]  we can't do it if it looks like the flu it is the flu just count it and that's where
[39:17.680 --> 39:20.400]  they get their numbers that's why I didn't believe this stuff from the very beginning
[39:20.400 --> 39:25.080]  and it's getting even more absurd but they're using the massive rollout of tests we're talking
[39:25.080 --> 39:29.600]  about 150 million tests to start with now the Democrats as part of their stimulus bill
[39:29.600 --> 39:36.400]  are talking about 75 billion with a B 75 billion dollars for testing and contact tracing I'm
[39:36.400 --> 39:40.280]  assuming that's not going to be the PCR test that's going to be the rapid test that means
[39:40.280 --> 39:47.520]  at $5 a pop that they could get 15 billion tests that's 45 tests for every man woman
[39:47.520 --> 39:50.600]  and child that means they're going to run this thing out for a long time and they're
[39:50.600 --> 39:57.400]  going to do a lot of control the way the psychological warfare operation works is very very simple
[39:57.400 --> 40:03.040]  they give up freedoms by increments always promising as long you'll be a short period
[40:03.040 --> 40:09.320]  of time and then the restrictions will be released but they're not that for a significant
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.720]  amount of time always four or five times longer than what they said they will then slightly
[40:13.720 --> 40:18.920]  release it a little bit only tighten it down even more later this is called successive
[40:18.920 --> 40:25.040]  approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect this is the most common way that the
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.560]  salatarians take over but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up under the
[40:30.560 --> 40:34.800]  incrementalism he starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp
[40:34.800 --> 40:39.480]  down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days weeks or months than you
[40:39.480 --> 40:44.880]  saw in the previous 10 years and that's the period we're in globally right now a world
[40:44.880 --> 40:50.600]  government shy combat globalist corporate takeover of the planet that once you pour
[40:50.600 --> 40:56.760]  in absolutely sick under their thumb forever the globalists are very very honest about
[40:56.760 --> 41:05.280]  their planetary goals they want private corporate governance above nation states above religious
[41:05.280 --> 41:11.840]  institutions above the family they want total corporate power there was a great film back
[41:11.840 --> 41:18.320]  in the early 1970s called rollerball with James Kahn it's based on a novel set in the
[41:18.320 --> 41:25.160]  year 2020 and in the book you have megacorporates that control the planet and there are no longer
[41:25.160 --> 41:32.200]  nation states there are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations if you actually
[41:32.200 --> 41:38.240]  read what the most group of the CFR trial commission say in the year 2020 that is their
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.920]  in game that is their goal so we're talking about hunger games type scenario here run
[41:43.920 --> 41:49.480]  by very very very ruthless people see us as shadow they're using covid-19 as their takeover
[41:49.480 --> 41:57.120]  strategy communist China as their model we must reject it now the Renaissance the great
[41:57.120 --> 42:04.760]  enlightenment it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny that's
[42:04.760 --> 42:13.000]  establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are above the law the
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.280]  public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow that humans are seen as garbage it's
[42:19.280 --> 42:25.920]  going to be taken out and removed that is the post human extremist plan that is the
[42:25.920 --> 42:31.600]  public ideology of the globalist and everything they've built with this high-tech grid is
[42:31.600 --> 42:39.160]  to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any future generations
[42:39.160 --> 42:44.640]  that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans
[42:44.640 --> 42:52.320]  once were this is the sick tannic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation
[42:52.320 --> 42:57.880]  humanity this is the essence of evil if you look at the top tech billionaires in the big
[42:57.880 --> 43:02.680]  banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many
[43:02.680 --> 43:06.840]  people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain top
[43:06.840 --> 43:11.400]  or a national park they have to look at us the common people they have to look at the
[43:11.400 --> 43:15.600]  proletariat they have to look at the scum that's why they love the lockdown putting
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.160]  muscles on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go what we can do
[43:20.160 --> 43:25.440]  bankrupting main street bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical integration
[43:25.440 --> 43:30.720]  consolidation so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender which is taking
[43:30.720 --> 43:37.440]  sterling vaccines day one ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they
[43:37.440 --> 43:41.600]  used all the entertainment garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders living
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.600]  in for the kill you know this I know this it's all out in the open the question is what
[43:46.600 --> 43:51.000]  are we gonna do about it well the first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy identify
[43:51.000 --> 44:03.880]  the enemy identify your enemy now you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:03.880 --> 44:22.400]  all right we're not making life people are very sick but this whole thing is just pathetic
[44:22.400 --> 44:27.880]  and david and I were talking in the breakout presidents been playing ball with this but
[44:27.880 --> 44:32.440]  he has the chance to change the rules now that he has the bully pulpit and you know what
[44:32.440 --> 44:38.080]  I got all this news with how the vaccines are causing worse side effects than covid eventually
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.120]  I mean really the vaccine is gonna be more deadly than covid they won't tell you that
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.840]  twitter and all the rest censoring the truth about covid that's continuing to go on massive
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.360]  facial acne is breaking out across the nation right now I wonder why cuz a mask and you
[44:52.360 --> 44:57.440]  know funny funny you know I stock and clear a cell yeah yeah that's it there you go there's
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.160]  your advice for the day right there yeah your advice for the day right there on the stock
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.360]  market but but here's what I'm trying to figure out david cuz I was thinking about this day
[45:07.360 --> 45:12.600]  and then you brought up some of the other oddities about this test the antigen test or so but
[45:12.600 --> 45:16.800]  I'm seeing this too I'm seeing this theme is well the test you know you could have trace
[45:16.800 --> 45:22.080]  amounts of covid or small amounts of covid and you know it's still a pause of test well
[45:22.080 --> 45:27.920]  in comparison to what because this is a virus a virus is not alive so what so so I'm just
[45:27.920 --> 45:32.320]  I'm confused because I've never heard anybody explain this to me I'm not a doctor so I mean
[45:32.320 --> 45:38.360]  I'm I'm led to believe that there's this virus that's not alive that can somehow I guess procreate
[45:38.360 --> 45:42.080]  or expand and now it's floating in the air and it can fly and now I may have a million
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.720]  covid's I may have one covid it still says positive for covid if I have a million covid's
[45:45.720 --> 45:49.160]  I'm really sick if I have one covid I'm not sick at all and none of it makes any sense
[45:49.160 --> 45:53.320]  nobody's explained any of this to us we just look at the TV we see the numbers go up oh
[45:53.320 --> 45:58.200]  my gosh they say oh it's deadly oh it's not deadly oh look at all the cases well you could
[45:58.200 --> 46:01.880]  have a little in you but how could you even have a lot in you so none of it makes any
[46:01.880 --> 46:05.760]  sense at all David nobody's even using basic logic to question this well you know John
[46:05.760 --> 46:09.160]  Rappaport questioned this at the very beginning and he said look they've tried to use a PCR
[46:09.160 --> 46:12.520]  test many times for a lot of other things and it doesn't work the guy who invented it who
[46:12.520 --> 46:17.640]  got a Nobel Prize for it said you can't use it for this why because it doesn't do a quantitative
[46:17.640 --> 46:24.240]  analysis it can flag somebody without them having a sufficient viral load to be sick
[46:24.240 --> 46:30.000]  or most importantly to pass it on and so that's why the guy who invented it said you can't
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.840]  use it for this now a lot of people are saying that now and I'm surprised that it's not being
[46:34.840 --> 46:38.960]  reported more widely and John was the only one saying that six months ago but now a lot
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.560]  of people are aware of that and talking about it but this test the antigen test the Abbott
[46:43.560 --> 46:52.240]  lab rapid test is even worse because it doesn't even look for a DNA fragment at any level
[46:52.240 --> 46:57.640]  instead what it looks for the antigens is looking for proteins that are associated with a virus
[46:57.640 --> 47:01.880]  it's not even looking for the virus is looking for proteins associated with it now the problem
[47:01.880 --> 47:06.680]  that we have besides the quantitative the lack of any quantitative information which
[47:06.680 --> 47:10.960]  would tell you that you know President Trump is not sick but he's tested positive right
[47:10.960 --> 47:17.760]  he doesn't have a viral load but beyond that it's the qualitative issue as well because
[47:17.760 --> 47:23.880]  it's not able to distinguish one coronavirus from another and there's gazillion coronaviruses
[47:23.880 --> 47:27.280]  out there all the cold and flu variants that we have out there because you know your body
[47:27.280 --> 47:31.360]  is constantly replicating this RNA and you're getting copying errors and so you're getting
[47:31.360 --> 47:37.080]  a lot of different strains of this and it can't distinguish one from the other so it's qualitatively
[47:37.080 --> 47:45.000]  BS it's quantitatively BS but it's fast and we're going to use it as a as a passport to
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.680]  everything and that's what's really troubling about this a good example is this Monday story
[47:48.680 --> 47:52.240]  again from the Washington Post and they're going into this in detail because this is
[47:52.240 --> 47:56.520]  an opportunity for them to attack President Trump because he jumped into this and he deserves
[47:56.520 --> 48:03.600]  to be attacked for jumping into this because it's bad it's bullish it's BS okay and they
[48:03.600 --> 48:11.120]  talk about a particular example in Manchester Vermont they did a test some patients in one
[48:11.120 --> 48:17.960]  study they had 65 patients that tested positive there were actually on second and longer tests
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.600]  they found that only four of them had it so we're talking about 93% false positive this
[48:22.600 --> 48:25.800]  is why everybody's talking about wait you got a lot of problems with fault if you've
[48:25.800 --> 48:33.280]  got something where 93% of the people get a false positive it's back up to the PCR level
[48:33.280 --> 48:38.080]  or worse but they're going to be rolling this out for everybody and this is part of the
[48:38.080 --> 48:42.280]  programming aspect in terms of talking about how this could be a good thing if President
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.520]  Trump shows that he is in charge he's going to have to do that or they're going to use
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.160]  a 25th amendment or something to replace him but if he does that if he gets well like Louis
[48:51.160 --> 48:57.120]  Gohmert did and we've been down this whole road before remember the panic with see CPAC
[48:57.120 --> 49:04.960]  was going to die you had a couple of people tested positive I don't think that anybody
[49:04.960 --> 49:09.160]  even got sick I mean a lot of people quarantine but I don't think anybody got sick and then
[49:09.160 --> 49:15.960]  you had Rand Paul who got sick but he was treated you had Bolsonaro the left was applauding
[49:15.960 --> 49:21.000]  the fact that Bolsonaro was sick but he recovered you had Boris Johnson in the UK he got sick
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.480]  he actually went to the hospital he was very sick with that probably didn't have any H.C.Q.
[49:25.480 --> 49:31.640]  but he recovered as well you got a 99.9% chance to recover and so the good news about this
[49:31.640 --> 49:39.600]  is that everybody watches President Trump and if he uses H.C.Q. if he uses hydroxychloroquine
[49:39.600 --> 49:46.240]  azithromycin zinc and like Louis Gohmert he said I used all three of those plus we did
[49:46.240 --> 49:51.120]  the asthma inhaler the over the counter asthma inhaler which is a steroid and he said I feel
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.080]  better than I ever felt nobody paid any attention to that remember everybody celebrating when
[49:55.080 --> 50:01.720]  Louis Gohmert was diagnosed as positive and yet they completely ignored it when he recovered
[50:01.720 --> 50:06.800]  yeah and I think that what the president needs to do is he needs to prove hey there's nothing
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.920]  to be afraid of here that's right I tested positive maybe I have it maybe I don't I'll
[50:10.920 --> 50:16.720]  test again every day whatever but I'm okay I'm not I'm not dying the fear has to be
[50:16.720 --> 50:20.840]  so yeah I'm not dying you know what if you want to get a vaccine fine it's just like
[50:20.840 --> 50:24.360]  the flu but you don't need to get a vaccine most people are going to survive this and
[50:24.360 --> 50:29.240]  he can he can change the rules of the whole COVID thing overnight with if he wants to
[50:29.240 --> 50:33.440]  with this test and if he wants to we'll see what happens and obviously there's going to
[50:33.440 --> 50:38.520]  be people trying to steer him in each direction but you know I can't help it I can't help
[50:38.520 --> 50:42.680]  but get my mind out of the gutter on this one David nobody's ever really explained
[50:42.680 --> 50:46.720]  any of this to me and so I'm sitting here like a layman seeing this whole COVID thing
[50:46.720 --> 50:51.160]  change the world and society as I know it but none of it makes any sense okay so you
[50:51.160 --> 50:55.560]  have a virus which is not alive it can't procreate it can't it can't remake itself
[50:55.560 --> 51:00.440]  I mean I've never heard of a virus like that but yet okay how then how does it go like
[51:00.440 --> 51:04.360]  how does it get everywhere how does your viral load change how is one person sicker than
[51:04.360 --> 51:09.960]  it doesn't make any sense we've been lied to the very outset of this a virus is something
[51:09.960 --> 51:16.280]  that attaches itself to your cells your cells bring it in and they replicate it reproduce
[51:16.280 --> 51:20.280]  it because you know the the RNA DNA code is just like a computer code so it's got a code
[51:20.280 --> 51:24.440]  so it's reproduces and they destroy themselves and so it becomes very destructive but your
[51:24.440 --> 51:28.600]  body actually manufactures that that's why it's so concerning when you look at this
[51:28.600 --> 51:35.520]  mRNA approach because what they're doing is telling you giving you an RNA sequence to
[51:35.520 --> 51:42.560]  get your body to replicate something that is an antigen and there is a correlation between
[51:42.560 --> 51:48.240]  several different types of cancer and viruses why because when you start modifying and and
[51:48.240 --> 51:54.160]  tricking human cells into replicating something that is foreign or should not be in that place
[51:54.160 --> 51:58.640]  you know you get a particularly kidney cancer or something your body starts replicating
[51:58.640 --> 52:03.680]  kidney cells and in various places and and it turns out to be fatal that's basically
[52:03.680 --> 52:08.840]  how how cancer works and so you have certain cancers that are known to come from certain
[52:08.840 --> 52:14.080]  viruses this is why it is so dangerous to be doing this type of approach and they've
[52:14.080 --> 52:18.600]  never done it you mentioned the severe side effects one of the persons said I was I had
[52:18.600 --> 52:24.640]  chills so bad that I cracked a tooth chattering I mean they've got some severe side effects
[52:24.640 --> 52:29.560]  and all of these early vaccine candidates all of them have been selected for operational
[52:29.560 --> 52:34.000]  warp speed why because they were fast we don't care if it's safe we don't care if it's effective
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.880]  we don't care how much it costs we want it fast because that's our ticket to get out
[52:37.880 --> 52:41.880]  of here and that's the most dangerous thing about this is that President Trump has accepted
[52:41.880 --> 52:47.720]  this as the end game to get out of the lockdown the lockdown is what has destroyed the economy
[52:47.720 --> 52:53.280]  the lockdown is what has screwed up the elections the lockdown is the lockdown stupid really
[52:53.280 --> 52:57.640]  is this time and that's not the way to get out of it with a vaccine and people are weakening
[52:57.640 --> 53:02.120]  their immune systems yeah when they when they wear the mask and when they quarantine but
[53:02.120 --> 53:07.360]  see but that's what scares me David they can take they can take the science of this and
[53:07.360 --> 53:13.200]  then sell you an RNA modifying vaccine as a good thing like oh you'll never have to worry
[53:13.200 --> 53:17.680]  about a virus again forget about the the people that took the vaccine and died don't worry
[53:17.680 --> 53:21.960]  about them you'll never see their names in quarter on TV no this is going to be good
[53:21.960 --> 53:26.080]  it's going to reprogram yourselves to defeat any virus you'll have supercells now and then
[53:26.080 --> 53:29.400]  of course that'll create some other mutation that'll kill you dead in a hammer but it doesn't
[53:29.400 --> 53:33.320]  matter twelve billion dollars was the last number I saw twelve billion dollars on the
[53:33.320 --> 53:39.720]  table for who gets the first vaccine out oh oh that's nice we pay for it we keep them
[53:39.720 --> 53:43.960]  immune from any damage charges to anybody because Fauci took care of that first thing
[53:43.960 --> 53:48.840]  when he went to the well-trained yeah and then and then we have the military deliver
[53:48.840 --> 53:52.400]  it and perhaps even injected to people I don't know how they're going to roll this thing
[53:52.400 --> 53:57.800]  out but you've already got a guy from Bill Gates vaccine organization Gavi saying well
[53:57.800 --> 54:01.200]  you know we're going to have to do mass vaccines everybody's going to be lined up it's not
[54:01.200 --> 54:03.560]  going to be a doctor that's going to be doing this it's just going to be you're going to
[54:03.560 --> 54:09.880]  go to a shed or whatever I've got people sending me plans of buildings that they're being
[54:09.880 --> 54:15.800]  paid to build that are you know just a basic shed they said do it fast fifty thousand dollars
[54:15.800 --> 54:21.440]  we don't care about anything except electrical code and it says for immunization and for
[54:21.440 --> 54:24.680]  phlebotomy you know blood drawing and so forth so they said we're just going to be doing
[54:24.680 --> 54:28.280]  this everywhere so we're going to have to have some way that we can identify who got
[54:28.280 --> 54:32.800]  the first shot and who got the follow-up second shot so we need to have a central database
[54:32.800 --> 54:38.200]  which means we've got to have the ID ID 2020 we need tyranny that's all it's a tyranny
[54:38.200 --> 54:41.840]  is what we need that's what they tell you every time you need to be a slave it's the
[54:41.840 --> 54:48.800]  only way to free you you notice that over and over again the united nations are supposed
[54:48.800 --> 54:52.800]  controllers and bosses the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with
[54:52.800 --> 54:58.920]  has come out and said nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19 ladies and gentlemen that's
[54:58.920 --> 55:04.480]  a total lie you get a lot of sunlight it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3 and
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.080]  it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3 if
[55:09.080 --> 55:13.160]  you have zinc and vitamin C as well that's why people get the flus and these colds in
[55:13.160 --> 55:17.960]  the winter because that's a vitamin D levels plunge now I've pointed this out and the media
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.960]  has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins
[55:22.960 --> 55:27.400]  and their minerals well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin
[55:27.400 --> 55:33.200]  D3 and see he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die without
[55:33.200 --> 55:37.880]  zinc but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.920]  and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning
[55:41.920 --> 55:49.400]  the public to get their vitamins remember the global lockdowns are witnessing the black
[55:49.400 --> 55:55.440]  lives matter antiferriots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by
[55:55.440 --> 56:02.400]  a handful of top billionaires led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course Tim
[56:02.400 --> 56:08.800]  Cook and others they set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their
[56:08.800 --> 56:13.440]  companies and there are hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against
[56:13.440 --> 56:19.600]  us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government and police and the
[56:19.600 --> 56:24.360]  mayors are again they're playing their political game try to trigger the complete breakdown
[56:24.360 --> 56:28.760]  of the United States and Western Europe show these billionaires can come in and buy it
[56:28.760 --> 56:32.920]  all up for billions on the dollar that's why I'm so angry at these globalists because
[56:32.920 --> 56:36.960]  when you're looking at them they're the ones that sit in their councils and have decided
[56:36.960 --> 56:42.680]  to run these plans against us they are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with it's us
[56:42.680 --> 56:59.600]  or them period you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[56:59.600 --> 57:06.800]  yeah the virus of the deep state is much worse than covid it's chris ray it's jena haspel
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.560]  it's fauci these are the real viruses right here now final segment with david night i
[57:12.560 --> 57:15.640]  was going to make this comparison and it's perfect this comes right across my desk right
[57:15.640 --> 57:23.680]  now you've got thousands of central american migrants attempting to come into the u.s illegally
[57:23.680 --> 57:30.160]  it's another migrant caravan and i see these biden handlers coming out and saying biden
[57:30.160 --> 57:34.400]  is being very safe very conservative we all need to be very safe with this virus very
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.000]  conservative protect yourself but then the border is wide open and they carry in disease
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.200]  and they carry in viruses and guns and rapists and murders but oh david we need to take every
[57:44.200 --> 57:48.560]  precaution in every measure to make sure you're masking gloves and you know just don't even
[57:48.560 --> 57:53.480]  leave the house and you know get tested every day but hey down at the border oh it's a free
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.480]  for all down there don't worry about anything david yeah and of course that was the card
[57:57.480 --> 58:00.440]  that played with the trump at the beginning we said all right we're going to limit travel
[58:00.440 --> 58:05.000]  coming in they called him xenophobic they complained about that as well here's the bottom
[58:05.000 --> 58:10.680]  line oh and they will complain about whatever he can't please them so he needs to do the
[58:10.680 --> 58:15.440]  right thing and he put all of his trust in terms of ending the lockdown the lockdown
[58:15.440 --> 58:21.360]  is the key the lockdown is destroying the economy the lockdown is the basis for which
[58:21.360 --> 58:25.840]  they are rigging this election you know with all the valid harvesting and all this other
[58:25.840 --> 58:30.960]  stuff and so the lockdown itself has to end but for other reasons other than just the
[58:30.960 --> 58:35.280]  election and for other reasons then trump is going to make everything right we've got
[58:35.280 --> 58:40.240]  to start building things from the ground up and I was really happy to see that shelly
[58:40.240 --> 58:45.400]  luther the hair salon owner she got into a race with a candidate that was supported
[58:45.400 --> 58:52.520]  by Abbott who had been a four term representative here in the house in Texas and it was a dead
[58:52.520 --> 58:57.800]  heat for senate in a special election and she did that at the last minute she got into
[58:57.800 --> 59:02.760]  that we have to start taking back from the community level to the state level and then
[59:02.760 --> 59:06.720]  eventually maybe the federal level but we got to cut these people off they're cutting
[59:06.720 --> 59:11.240]  us off hundred thousand businesses shut down with this lockdown and all the people that
[59:11.240 --> 59:17.760]  they that they employed and so president trump has to enforce our individual liberties he
[59:17.760 --> 59:21.800]  has to stand up for that he has to stand up for the constitution the bill of rights he
[59:21.800 --> 59:26.680]  has to stop this when it's being done by governors and a lot of this is being done by republican
[59:26.680 --> 59:32.440]  governors like Abbott like little like ivy and alabama just extending the mask mandates
[59:32.440 --> 59:39.920]  and so forth this is happening all over the country get out of this partisan blinder situation
[59:39.920 --> 59:45.240]  and understand who's doing what and then respond accordingly don't support these people if
[59:45.240 --> 59:49.040]  they're going to keep doing this but president trump put all of his hope in the vaccine thing
[59:49.040 --> 59:53.000]  and now all these vaccine guys are going to give him a fast vaccine and he gave him twelve
[59:53.000 --> 59:56.400]  billion dollars now they're all saying now you can't have it we're going to keep this
[59:56.400 --> 1:00:00.160]  thing going and they know they're going to keep it going they've already been saying
[1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:05.280]  for several months that they're going to extend this at least into next summer probably twenty
[1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:10.560]  twenty two or but never it'll never stop you always need a new one just like the flu shot
[1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:16.320]  you'll always say it's just a few months away which Gavin Newsom went on a news story
[1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:20.640]  this morning he got his vaccine david you got to get your vaccine and it's good and
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:25.160]  he has a psychopath smile but see here's what I wish I mean because we live in the clown
[1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:29.440]  world we can debate vaccines and all we can debate things all day long but it when there's
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:34.360]  no logic when logic is dead when reasoning is dead and the average american can't look
[1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:39.840]  at how this covid hoax is destroying our economy destroying the world economy just tearing apart
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:44.240]  our way of life forcing people living fear but hey again orders wide open people are
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:48.480]  becoming poured in by the thousands bringing disease murderers rapists hey oh not all bad
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:53.720]  not all bad whatever it's it's it's the paradigm of how come we don't have the same treatment
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:59.720]  of our border which is safety general safety and any precautions and conservatives but
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:04.680]  oh but you know you need to be it's all political it's all political the master political everything
[1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:09.440]  is political like people are now starting to understand us talk to eric peter the eric
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:14.520]  peter's this morning he said yeah I see as I go around places all of these signs everywhere
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:17.520]  gotta wear the mask gotta wear the mask I don't wear the mask and now people are not
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.480]  even saying anything to me about it I had the same experience when we went back to north
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:25.320]  carolina signs everywhere there and in Tennessee and you go in and people got the mask under
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:29.240]  their nose they don't care they don't even look at you twice about this we all know
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:32.980]  it's a fraud why do we know it's a fraud because we've got some churches that have been holding
[1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:37.440]  church since march and they've got thousands of people and they're not sick we've got the
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:43.280]  church in an LA that the LA people are coming after because they've got seven thousand people
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:47.840]  packed into a church no social distancing no mass singing nobody's getting sick we know
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:58.680]  it's a fraud live your life remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:06.720]  of independent people all over the world the globalist have a plan for total vertical integration
[1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:16.400]  absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices of their control
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:22.800]  but that is only a means to an end once they have the electronic straightjacket in place
[1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:27.080]  they are on record that they will bring in force inoculations that sterilize you and
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:32.800]  your family and worse many of the vaccines being pushed by the united nations actually
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:39.240]  give people polio and actually give people cancer most cancer is viral that's a big secret
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:46.040]  but the secret is beginning to come out it's even in the associated press remember all
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:52.080]  of these banned videos and reports are banned on video but only you can share them and save
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:03:03.920]  humanity
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:30.260]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:03:30.260 --> 1:03:32.940]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:03:32.940 --> 1:03:46.660]  Well, set in the Clark National Emergency, and the subadline at infowars.com is the fact
[1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:51.380]  that the deep state wants to assassinate Trump and blame it on coronavirus.
[1:03:51.380 --> 1:03:57.940]  Oh, make no mistake, the ether has been swimming with that for about a week here at the office,
[1:03:57.940 --> 1:04:06.560]  and I wasn't ready to go to it until Wednesday, and then I came up here last night to shoot
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:10.680]  a video on it, and I didn't get it done because I was dealing with other stuff, there's a
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:17.800]  lot going on, but I will talk about that at the start of the next segment.
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:23.020]  But can we pull up on infowars.com, the main feed of the show?
[1:04:23.020 --> 1:04:28.740]  If you just go to infowars.com or newswars.com, and you'll see the live feed of the show
[1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:39.820]  right there, and it says Trump set to declare an actual emergency, left us targeting 45
[1:04:39.820 --> 1:04:42.220]  for assassination, we blamed on coronavirus.
[1:04:42.220 --> 1:04:44.380]  Well, that's quite a claim.
[1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:50.560]  It's like the claim we said six weeks ago that they're going to, that the virus comes
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:54.280]  back and like HIV over and over again, and you can't get rid of it.
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:05:07.560]  Oh, that's now Reuters, AP, everything today, treat this, the globalist problem is their
[1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:11.760]  science, so they can use science for evil, but there are other institutions and universities
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:16.400]  of people that aren't evil, they go and they look and they tell us this, and they're like,
[1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:21.340]  shut up, it's not true, shut up, University of Wisconsin, shut up, University of New
[1:05:21.340 --> 1:05:30.160]  Delhi, shut up, University in Switzerland, we're like, hey, this thing has HIV delivery
[1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:39.200]  system, oh, shut up, and like, oh yeah, HIV, drugs treat it, and people are like, well,
[1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:45.520]  that was said six weeks ago, and again, it's not that we're that smart, we understand how
[1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:50.640]  stuff works, that everyone's not evil, everyone's not involved in conspiracy, that's the globalist
[1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:54.680]  problem is there's all these professional classes and all these smart people that are
[1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:58.040]  out there that actually have studied things and they know what they're seeing, and they're
[1:05:58.040 --> 1:06:02.920]  going, hey, this is manufactured, and they're like, shut up, shut up, your funding's cut,
[1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:07.200]  they're like, whoa, well the university says I'm fired if I don't withdraw my paper and
[1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:12.280]  say it's wrong, but I'm not going to withdraw my paper and say it's wrong, I'll just withdraw
[1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:20.120]  my paper, and then three more universities come out and say, yeah, not only is this artificial,
[1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:28.320]  it's been weaponized, and that's really the big story is that it's mutating and it's the
[1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:37.400]  perfect cover for an off-the-shelf bio weapon that you can go and tweak parts of it and
[1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:41.680]  then release it on a certain group as race specific or even on an individual, and then
[1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:48.680]  it mutates and becomes harmless right after it, it has a very quick half-life.
[1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:55.080]  Think about that, the left is trying to parlay that the patriot president of Brazil has it
[1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:59.400]  and the Trump has it, the Brazilian president has tested negative, the media is running
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:03.160]  with the fact that he has it, they're not talking about quarantining Trump, we're moving
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:09.120]  in from power, they can release a designer bio weapon on the president and said the coronavirus
[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:12.360]  did it, that's something I'll cover at the bottom of the hour, I said I'll get into it
[1:07:12.360 --> 1:07:14.440]  earlier but I got sidetracked.
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:21.600]  I wonder if that's going to be a precursor into maybe postponing election along with
[1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:28.160]  their posting pictures of Trump with these leaders who are supposedly positive with
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:29.160]  coronavirus.
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:33.280]  Oh, there are a lot of people who didn't get ready to say Trump has coronavirus, then
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:40.200]  Kelly must say it killed him, or the 25th amendment which he's disabled and can't wrap
[1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:45.120]  in a country and then bring pillory into on a broker convention.
[1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:50.960]  Notice they said that Brazil's Balacerno says he's tested negative but he's really
[1:07:50.960 --> 1:07:54.720]  got the virus and Trump's got it.
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:00.760]  So they can hit him with a bio weapon or whatever and say oh Trump died from coronavirus.
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:07.320]  And most people that Trump's come in contact with has had this virus but I just find it
[1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:12.280]  funny that none of the Democrats have it and at least if they do I've not seen it come
[1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:18.240]  out yet but I support the president, I'm actually worried about him, I know he's doing his best,
[1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:25.840]  he's 73 and I just don't know what's going to happen with him or this country, but this
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:31.640]  is a spiritual battle, it's all these celebrities and the famous people, right?
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:36.240]  So I'm a little worried about Trump like the other colors are saying, I think that this
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:37.240]  is just-
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:40.600]  That's what the whole office like a week ago and then I was like oh whatever, then two
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:44.800]  days ago it was like everybody's like no, it's an excuse to kill Trump and say it's
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:45.800]  a bio weapon.
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:52.040]  And that's what it's like, he's got it, he's got it, take him out, he didn't, he created
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:55.680]  it, he did it and Trump's got it.
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:59.720]  Exactly and I think because of his age and they say that he's McDonald's and all that
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:04.480]  they're just going to use it as an excuse to see that he was not healthy enough to fight
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:05.480]  it and-
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:10.360]  Well I know there's a group collective, the Oracle of the People is saying they're trying
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:14.520]  to poison Trump and give him the coronavirus.
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:16.680]  They're hyping it up massively.
[1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:21.600]  So that's what they're actually saying now, yesterday I'm like well they blamed him for
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:25.000]  corona and say he's got it, now they're actually saying it.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.640]  There's the Alex Jones show back in March of this year ladies and gentlemen and it's
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:36.480]  all getting a little too real but you know I've got a bunch of news and I'm going to
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:40.800]  come back and cover it.
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:45.080]  Here's my setback for today, here's my mental block for today because I mean it's like one
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:49.800]  of the biggest news days ever, I mean we're sitting here in limbo now over, the president
[1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:55.440]  has COVID but see you know, I know, the crew knows, David Knight knows, Alex Jones knows,
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:10:00.320]  anybody with the brain knows, this is just a distraction.
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:05.640]  This is just a shiny object distracting us from whatever is really going on.
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:16.480]  Don't test positive for COVID, who cares, he's fine, COVID is 99.9% survival.
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:22.200]  So it's a big nothing burger but it's not a nothing burger in that uh-oh that you see
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:24.280]  the left cheering for Trump's death.
[1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:31.280]  You see Nancy Pelosi going on national news, talking about how she could become the president
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:35.240]  because of the way the Constitution is written all of a sudden she cares about the Constitution.
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:41.560]  You see the vaccines getting pushed and then pushed back, we see the shutdown continuing,
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:50.440]  we see the fear mongering continuing but yet whoa, now we're all kind of paused, okay
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:54.400]  Trump has COVID, so now what?
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:11:00.960]  So when Trump comes out of this, harm free, then what, do we continue the fake panic,
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:06.800]  do we continue the illegal shutdown, do we continue the fear mongering, do we continue
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:13.720]  the push for the vaccine, president, old man just got it, didn't even have a symptom.
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:16.400]  What's all the fear about?
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:21.560]  And you know honestly, I think that, and this is just the current time space, who knows
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:28.160]  what could happen in a week, two weeks, three weeks, 31 days left of the election or 31
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:31.160]  day selection day.
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:43.320]  This is now the greatest opportunity President Trump has ever had in his presidency to do
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:45.840]  what we all know needs to be done.
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:55.200]  All right, he's quarantined, he's at the office, he can't leave, he can't campaign, he needs
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:02.240]  to dig in deep to get all the Russian collusion hoax documents released, and if that means
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:05.480]  getting rid of Gina Haspel, then so be it.
[1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:10.400]  He needs to make sure that the Democrat terror squads, whether it's people masquerading as
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:18.920]  Antifa or BLM or anything else in between, are shut down and treated like domestic terrorists.
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:26.200]  But more than anything, he needs to come out about the truth about COVID and say how the
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:31.800]  economic shutdown is not worth it, there's no point wearing a mask, and it's time to
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:34.080]  end this whole charade.
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:38.280]  And he could do all of it in this golden opportunity with the bully pulpit and all the attention
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:40.160]  on him.
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:45.400]  And you know, if he doesn't use this next two weeks to really come out and defeat these
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:51.000]  lies and this, this cage of lies we're living in, people are going to be really upset, really
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  missed opportunity.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:58.880]  The future isn't coming, it's here, and in the future, keeping your humanity, saving
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:04.040]  your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:07.640]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:13.280]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:18.880]  and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:24.320]  into total and complete dehumanization.
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:30.160]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:31.160]  2050.
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:34.000]  This is their stated goal.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.840]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:43.840]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy, we turn this around.
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:48.800]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:49.800]  with it.
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:51.840]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.

[1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:17.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, you know, I got to tell you, I'm just kind of at a cross
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:21.400]  road right now about what to do here for the rest of this hour.
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:23.800]  I've got a bunch of news and I've got some videos.
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:28.720]  We've got a great guest coming up, by the way, Dr. Carrie Medej, who's been calling
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:31.960]  out the COVID hoax and the real agenda behind it for a while now.
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:34.040]  She's going to be joining us.
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:36.840]  And Alex may be back in studio for that.
[1:15:36.840 --> 1:15:41.080]  We've got Satanists on Twitter celebrating Trump's COVID positive test.
[1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:43.440]  We're going to have a story at infowars.com on that.
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:44.440]  It's just crazy stuff.
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:46.800]  You've never even seen it before.
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:50.640]  You've got, I can get in all this news.
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:55.200]  I want to play the clip where they leak the Melania phone calls, which just makes me like
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:57.680]  head over heels in love with Melania hearing that phone call.
[1:15:57.680 --> 1:15:59.240]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:00.400]  They think that makes her look bad.
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:03.320]  It makes her look better than she's ever looked ever.
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:05.960]  And she's always looking good.
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:09.120]  But man, I mean, part of me just wants to open up the phone lines because folks, this
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:10.120]  is all a distraction.
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:11.640]  This is all a big distraction.
[1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:12.800]  What is it a distraction from?
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:14.000]  What is actually going on?
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.920]  Do they have Trump?
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:19.040]  Has Trump been caught in a trap?
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:22.640]  Or is he setting a trap?
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:25.560]  Because that's really what this comes down here.
[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:33.280]  Either Trump is caught in a trap and this is going to go bad or Trump is setting a trap.
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:37.080]  Because if Trump is just going to say, oh, okay, well, we've tested positive for COVID.
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:40.880]  We're going to quarantine and then it comes out of an interest like, yep, okay, pandemic
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:41.880]  still going.
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:42.880]  We still need mass and everything.
[1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:45.320]  Well, then what the hell is going on here?
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:46.720]  What is the president doing at this point?
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.440]  Why is Chris Ray still running the FBI?
[1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:50.440]  Why is Gina Haspel still running the CIA?
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:52.480]  They're covering up for Democrat crimes.
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:55.400]  They're covering up for the crimes of Obama.
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:58.240]  They're covering up for the Democrat terrorists on the streets.
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:01.160]  They're covering up for George Soros.
[1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:03.120]  That's what's going on.
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:06.160]  And now we, the American people, are going to sit here and let Trump go into quarantine
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:09.680]  for two weeks of a virus that doesn't even make him sick, where he's fine.
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:12.120]  Mark Meadows was just on TV saying, the president's fine.
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:13.120]  He's energetic.
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:14.120]  He's working.
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:15.120]  He's in high spirits.
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:16.120]  Yeah, we just saw him.
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:17.120]  He works every damn day.
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:25.560]  Hell, half the people that are completely healthy don't work as much as Trump with COVID
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:29.880]  if it's even a real test result.
[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:31.480]  If it's not a false positive.
[1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:35.880]  So I mean, I'm tempted to get to the, you know what, but I can do both.
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:37.000]  What do you think is going on?
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.760]  We can take calls for at least two segments before the doctor comes on and then Alex rejoins
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:41.760]  us as well.
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:42.760]  877-789-2539.
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:47.800]  I can get you on two minutes max.
[1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:49.360]  Try to get it out in 90 seconds.
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:51.000]  What do you think is really going on?
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.880]  Has Trump been caught in a trap?
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:55.320]  Is Trump caught in the COVID trap?
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:56.400]  Will he fight his way out of it?
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:18:02.960]  Is Trump setting a trap using this distraction to build momentum for something bigger or
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:07.160]  has Trump just really numb or ignorant to it all?
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:09.680]  And he's just going along with the whole thing and it's just, oh, this is just normal
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:10.680]  life now.
[1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:14.560]  We just all pretend like COVID is the biggest story in the world.
[1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:19.240]  So I'm going to do calls for two segments before the good doctor joins us.
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:20.240]  Two minutes max.
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:21.240]  Try to get it out in 90 seconds.
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:27.560]  So I can take as many as possible 877-789-2539 because this is just, because it's weird.
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:28.920]  Like this is such a story.
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:30.240]  You see everybody freaking out.
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:31.560]  It's not even impacting me at all.
[1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:36.240]  I'm wondering what's really going on.
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:38.040]  What is really going on?
[1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:39.720]  Has Trump been caught in a trap?
[1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:41.680]  Is Trump setting a trap?
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:45.680]  Or is this just Trump accepting the new normal, which is COVID just dictates our lives?
[1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:52.200]  Now, in the meantime, let me do these news, in fact, let's go to the Melania Trump leaked
[1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:53.200]  phone call.
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:54.200]  Oh my gosh.
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:57.320]  Think about all these people that spy on Trump and go into his records in Melania and
[1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:01.600]  all these people and they leak all this crap and they have nothing.
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:03.320]  They have nothing.
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:04.320]  Listen to a phone call.
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:06.360]  They leak of Melania Trump that they think makes her look bad.
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:11.320]  She's never been more personable in her life than this phone call being leaked.
[1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:14.320]  They say I'm more uncomplicated.
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:17.320]  I'm the same like him.
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:18.320]  I support him.
[1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:19.320]  I don't say enough.
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:20.320]  I don't do enough.
[1:19:20.320 --> 1:19:21.320]  No.
[1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:25.320]  Where I am, I'm working like a, ask my ass.
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:26.320]  I know.
[1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:31.700]  That Christmas stuff that, you know, who gives a about Christmas stuff and decoration, but
[1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:33.400]  I need to do it.
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:34.400]  Right.
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:35.560]  But 100%, you have no choice.
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:36.560]  And okay.
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:42.120]  And then I do it and I say that I'm working on Christmas, planning for the Christmas.
[1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:46.440]  And they said, Oh, what about the children that they were separated?
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:48.080]  Give me a break.
[1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:50.680]  Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?
[1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:51.680]  I know.
[1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:52.760]  I cannot go.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:57.760]  I was trying to get the kid reunited with the mom.
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.760]  I didn't have a chance.
[1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:02.760]  He needs to go through the process and through the law.
[1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:03.760]  But here's my thing.
[1:20:03.760 --> 1:20:11.760]  Here you just said, but instead of that, if you're just, you're messaging, you were so loved.
[1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:13.760]  They would not do the story.
[1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:14.760]  We put it out.
[1:20:14.760 --> 1:20:17.760]  They would not do the story.
[1:20:17.760 --> 1:20:18.760]  I'm telling you.
[1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:19.760]  They would not believe it.
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:21.760]  They would not do the story.
[1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:23.760]  Because they are not.
[1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:30.760]  They would not do the story because they're against us because they're liberal media.
[1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:32.760]  Yeah, if I go to Fox, they will do the story.
[1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:34.760]  I don't want to go to Fox.
[1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:37.760]  Maybe Melania Trump should be the press secretary.
[1:20:37.760 --> 1:20:40.760]  Give them a tongue lashing every day.
[1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:43.760]  And they think that makes Melania Trump look bad?
[1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:46.760]  No, that's going to make her more popular than ever.
[1:20:46.760 --> 1:20:47.760]  And it already has.
[1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:49.760]  But look at the fake news media.
[1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:51.760]  Look at these dirtbags.
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:53.760]  Look at Jim Acosta.
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:54.760]  What a scumbag.
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:20:58.760]  Even Chris Wallace has asked Trump three times now if he disavows white supremacists.
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:02.760]  And every time Trump has, and then Wallace says he still hasn't done it.
[1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:04.760]  What a dirtbag.
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:06.760]  Jim Acosta tweets this out.
[1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:10.760]  Trump has finally condemned white supremacists on Hannity.
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:11.760]  That was last night.
[1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:18.760]  Except it was Jim Acosta in 2017 that tweeted out Trump condemns KKK and white supremacists.
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:26.760]  Jim! Jim!
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:28.760]  These people are so fake.
[1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:29.760]  Here's another example.
[1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:37.760]  CNN contributor Asha Rang Papa tweets out a response to Melania Trump.
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:41.760]  And she's like, I can't stop focusing on why she's standing sideways.
[1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:44.760]  Folks, her Twitter picture is her standing sideways.
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:46.760]  You can't make this crap up.
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:53.760]  It's like she tried to mimic the stance of Melania Trump in her picture and then she did it for her picture.
[1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:56.760]  And then she says, I can't believe Melania Trump stands sideways when she takes pictures.
[1:21:56.760 --> 1:21:58.760]  And then she's doing the same thing.
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:03.760]  These people are going mad.
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:08.760]  We'll get into more of this COVID news when the doctor comes on.
[1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:14.760]  Yeah, Trump has condemned white supremacy more than any president in modern history.
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:16.760]  It's such a joke, man.
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:17.760]  It's such a joke.
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:20.760]  But you don't have to condemn Planned Parenthood that murders babies.
[1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:24.760]  You don't have to condemn Antifa or Black Lives Matter that's engaged in terrorism in the streets.
[1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:26.760]  No, no, no, no.
[1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:28.760]  Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:31.760]  But now you have to condemn QAnon.
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:36.760]  And this is actually being debated in the halls of Congress today.
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:46.760]  House resolution 1154 condemning QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theories it promotes.
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:49.760]  Of course, Democrat proposes this legislation.
[1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:51.760]  We must condemn QAnon.
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:55.760]  We must condemn free speech.
[1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:57.760]  Boy, oh boy.
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:09.760]  Meanwhile, North Carolina Democrat Senate candidate sexed messages with veterans wife have just been leaked out on national file.
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:11.760]  No one's going to condemn that.
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:14.760]  But you've got to condemn the Proud Boys.
[1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:19.760]  And then when one Republican has a spine and says, no, I don't condemn the Proud Boys.
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:22.760]  Defends them as patriotic Maskey Linus.
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:27.760]  And that's Lauren Witzke. So they hate Lauren Witzke because she has a spine. She's courageous.
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:29.760]  She tells the truth.
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:36.760]  But then Lindsey Graham, a maggot, a maggot comes out and says, we must condemn QAnon.
[1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:39.760]  Lindsey Graham, you are a maggot.
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:49.760]  And Lauren Witzke has more balls than Lindsey Graham has on his best day watered down.
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:53.760]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack.
[1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:55.760]  And I'm really bummed out about that.
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:00.760]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:03.760]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:11.760]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:20.760]  This is the highest end AMPM pack system you're going to find where you take half the pills in the morning, half the capitals and pills and cell caps at night.
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.760]  It's amazing. I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it.
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:29.760]  And that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:32.760]  So it's your last chance to get a power stack at InfoWareStore.com.

[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:22.760]  And of course in England they are now saying when I told you, you will not be allowed to travel.
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:26.760]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:28.760]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill.
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:36.760]  Gates, your owner, your master, says you will have to take 4-5 COVID shots a year for adults,
[1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:44.760]  2 for baby, baby much more manageable just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:49.760]  I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:53.760]  Introducing InfoWare's life pure turmeric extract.
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:56.760]  This is taken under the tongue.
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:25:58.760]  It is pure turmeric.
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:07.760]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:13.760]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:16.760]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:21.760]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews.
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:23.760]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:25.760]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  Some like bodies better.
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:32.760]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the InfoWare.

[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:20.760]  Has Trump laid a trap? Has Trump been set in a trap?
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:23.760]  Or is Trump accepting the new normal that COVID runs our lives?
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:26.760]  Let's begin with DeCarlo in DC.
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:28.760]  DeCarlo, go ahead.
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:30.760]  Hey, man, how you doing, man?
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:34.760]  I love the show. I love Alex Jones, man.
[1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:37.760]  I'm black too, man. I'm a real Trump supporter, man.
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:41.760]  I've been supporting Trump before 2016.
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:46.760]  I come from the messed up Democrat cities, Baltimore, DC.
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:48.760]  I've been living in California.
[1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:54.760]  I went to prison under Kamala Harris being an attorney general there.
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:59.760]  This whole thing, man, this COVID thing, it's like a little game, man.
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:02.760]  I think Trump, he knows what he's doing, man.
[1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:04.760]  We just got this trust in him.
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:06.760]  He knows what he's doing, man.
[1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:09.760]  He's really draining his swamp.
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:13.760]  I think going on here with the COVID thing, you know what I'm saying?
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:15.760]  He's draining his swamp, man.
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:19.760]  So you think Trump is going to use this massive gravity towards him
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:24.760]  and anything he says right now to use it for good and drain the swamp?
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:29.760]  Right. But the thing about it is we need to make sure that
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:33.760]  they didn't try to do anything to him because he was around
[1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:39.760]  buying for that when they did that little debate.
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:42.760]  So it's like, you know, we got to be real, real careful
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:45.760]  because these are some evil motherfuckers, man.
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:46.760]  They be doing something.
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:48.760]  Hey, DeCarlo, man, I'd love to talk to you more.
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:51.760]  We can't curse on air, though, so I got to dump that.
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:52.760]  But, you know, that's interesting.
[1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:54.760]  A guy who was put in jail by Kamala Harris.
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:56.760]  I bet we could open up the phone lines and get a bunch of them to call in.
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:28:57.760]  I bet they all support Trump, too.
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:28:59.760]  DeCarlo, thank you for that call.
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.760]  Let's go to Max in Minnesota, Max, go ahead.
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:05.760]  Hey, how's it going, bro?
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:07.760]  Good, thanks.
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:12.760]  Hey, I think Trump's just reorganizing his, you know,
[1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:17.760]  creating some more plans to defeat those, you know, idiots.
[1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:25.760]  But last time when I went to his rally, you know, he was pretty energized,
[1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:30.760]  but, you know, you can see him tired, but, you know,
[1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:36.760]  it's a good time for him to organize, create some more plans to defeat all those,
[1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:38.760]  you know, swamp people.
[1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:44.760]  And then, me myself, you know, I'm a Russian, big, you know, huge supporter of Trump.
[1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:49.760]  I'm actually became a citizen just because of the Trump, you know,
[1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:52.760]  I've lived here for 19 years.
[1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:58.760]  And this was, you know, I became like, you know, super patriot of this country.
[1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:00.760]  And I love it.
[1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:05.760]  But I think he's creating some more plans to defeat those guys.
[1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:06.760]  Well, I hope so.
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.760]  That's what he needs to be doing right now.
[1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:10.760]  Max, thank you so much for the call.
[1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:12.760]  By the way, when Trump was in Minnesota, I guess it was two nights ago,
[1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:14.760]  he was throwing out hats and stuff to the crowd.
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:16.760]  So they'll probably use that against him, say he spread COVID,
[1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:18.760]  put him in jail or something.
[1:30:18.760 --> 1:30:21.760]  David in Arizona, go ahead.
[1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:23.760]  Hi, Owen.
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:28.760]  Basically, what I think is going on is Trump's just using this as a play action fake.
[1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:32.760]  In other words, he might use this to show that hydroxychloroquine works
[1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:36.760]  and that we actually don't need a Gates vaccine.
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:39.760]  Or a lockdown or a mask or anything.
[1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:40.760]  Exactly.
[1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:42.760]  So I'm hoping that's what it is.
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:47.760]  But worst case scenario, you know, hopefully he's not, you know, defending the swamp.
[1:30:47.760 --> 1:30:49.760]  But, you know, of course, nobody wants to think that.
[1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:53.760]  So, you know, hopefully it's just a play action fake in its political theater,
[1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:56.760]  you know, in order to shut down this vaccine.
[1:30:56.760 --> 1:30:58.760]  All right, David, thanks for the call.
[1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:02.760]  Miguel in Indiana. Miguel, what do you think?
[1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:04.760]  Owen, can you hear me?
[1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:05.760]  Yep.
[1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:14.760]  Owen, what business I'm pretty sure Trump wants to beef up security detail
[1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:18.760]  with healthcare looking people.
[1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:21.760]  This is just a fake from coming from Trump.
[1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:30.760]  He wants to beef up security detail with more, more bodyguards looking like nurses and doctors.
[1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:34.760]  Because I'm pretty sure he got a massive threat from the left.
[1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:39.760]  I used to work for the beef state and spend some time in jail because of that.
[1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:41.760]  That's all I can say now.
[1:31:41.760 --> 1:31:42.760]  Thank you.
[1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:44.760]  Thank you for taking my call, Owen.
[1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:46.760]  And God bless you all.
[1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:47.760]  Very interesting.
[1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:48.760]  Thank you, Miguel.
[1:31:48.760 --> 1:31:50.760]  Let's go to Kevin in Alabama.
[1:31:50.760 --> 1:31:52.760]  Kevin, what do you think?
[1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:57.760]  Hey, Owen, retired Air Force F-16 crew chief here.
[1:31:57.760 --> 1:32:00.760]  Here's what I think, man.
[1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:06.760]  I think President Trump is just playing the ultimate checkmate.
[1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:13.760]  I think that maybe it's possible that he may wait about two weeks from now
[1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:21.760]  and resign and all the Russian collusion, all the Hillary, all the Pelosi crap goes away.
[1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:29.760]  Pence is put on the ballot and negates all the other ballots that have been messed with Trump's name on them.
[1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:31.760]  They all go away.
[1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:34.760]  Everybody's watching Elon Omar right now.
[1:32:34.760 --> 1:32:36.760]  They got too much light on them.
[1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.760]  They won't have time to cheat.
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:41.760]  And Pence wins in the landslides.
[1:32:41.760 --> 1:32:43.760]  We give what we want.
[1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:44.760]  The last gets what they want.
[1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:45.760]  Trump's gone.
[1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:47.760]  The man can live his life in peace.
[1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:50.760]  We can get back to some kind of normal existence.
[1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:52.760]  That's what I think.
[1:32:52.760 --> 1:32:53.760]  All right, Kevin.
[1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:54.760]  Thank you for the call.
[1:32:54.760 --> 1:32:56.760]  Let's go to Stephen in Florida.
[1:32:56.760 --> 1:32:58.760]  Stephen, go ahead.
[1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:00.760]  Yeah, here's my take.
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:01.760]  A couple things.
[1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:06.760]  First of all, I would love it if Greg Reese or John Bound or whoever,
[1:33:06.760 --> 1:33:14.760]  one of your great researchers would research to find out who is responsible for having Trump tested.
[1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:23.760]  I can almost guarantee you're going to find a connection between that to Biden and the Democrats or even Gates and Fauci.
[1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:32.760]  Now, that being said, Trump has been handed a golden opportunity here to diffuse this whole coronavirus scam.
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:38.760]  Because if he does his research and gets his ducks in line, he can come out and say,
[1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:47.760]  I've got credible evidence proving that this whole thing is a hoax as far as the way it's being presented to the American public.
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:50.760]  Now, let me also say this.
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:55.760]  Here's what Trump really needs to get across with this election campaign.
[1:33:55.760 --> 1:34:00.760]  This is a statement I wrote out and I'd really love to hear him say something like this.
[1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:06.760]  I have come to this point in time, this juncture in the history of our nation and the world,
[1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:10.760]  to say that as Mr. Biden and I face off in this election,
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:15.760]  let it be known that each one of us embodies what we stand for and what we represent.
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:20.760]  The battle of good versus evil, right versus wrong, truth versus lies.
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:29.760]  I therefore stand here today stating unequivocally and absolutely my wholehearted support of what the founders of America envisioned.
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:34.760]  And it's basically whatever Trump does next is going to receive so much momentum, so much attention,
[1:34:34.760 --> 1:34:36.760]  he has to knock it out of the park.
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:37.760]  Exactly.
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:40.760]  JD in Missouri, go ahead.
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:42.760]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:44.760]  Quick shout out to the crew for how hours you're working.
[1:34:44.760 --> 1:34:48.760]  I'm really hoping that Trump's setting up a trap.
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:56.760]  Hopefully he'll take another test and try and try to spoil it on the false positives and maybe hopefully get Fauci out of there.
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:34:58.760]  Because think about what that does.
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:04.760]  If Trump takes another test and shows negative and then it comes out it was a negative or a bad result, a false positive,
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:06.760]  then it just destroys everything.
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:07.760]  It just destroys everything.
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:11.760]  Now the kicker of that is it won't matter because everything's already been destroyed and yet we're still here.
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:17.760]  But if the president does it in that light with that attention, with the momentum, maybe it makes a different impact.
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:18.760]  Right.
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:23.760]  And a quick note, I think we should start spelling Fauci's name with an X instead of a C.
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:29.760]  It'll be FAUXI because he's not very good doctor, is my opinion.
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:34.760]  But hopefully he uses this to take out some of the deep state.
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:35.760]  I don't know.
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:36.760]  He might be getting set up.
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:38.760]  It might be a bit of both.
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:39.760]  I don't know.
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:46.760]  But it's just hard to believe that it's just a coincidental or a happenstance or just a normal thing with 31 days to the election.
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:49.760]  And this is just such a game changing thing or has a potential to be.
[1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:53.760]  All right, let's squeeze in one last call Joey in California real quick.
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:55.760]  Hey Owen, how's it going?
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:56.760]  Good.
[1:35:56.760 --> 1:36:04.760]  So it's possible that he's proving that the human body knows how to take care of something like this.
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:09.760]  I have a kidney transplant, so I take immunosuppressive drugs.
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:22.760]  And the doctors strictly born against taking Chinese medicine because it boosts the immune system and they want to keep my body from attacking my transplant.
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:26.760]  What is that telling you in a verse that they know that these things work?
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:28.760]  Not only, I mean, I take.
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:30.760]  Yeah, they know they work.
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:33.760]  Fauci's prescribed people hydroxychloroquine.
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:34.760]  He's written about it.
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:35.760]  Obama was on hydroxychloroquine.
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:36.760]  Absolutely.
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:37.760]  Thank you for the call, Joey.
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:38.760]  Wow.
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:40.760]  We have nine calls to that segment, folks.
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:41.760]  Nine calls.
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:45.760]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us back in studio in a very short amount of time.
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:49.760]  Don't go anywhere.
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:55.760]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with everybody.
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:01.760]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers, Communist Chinese, have come out and said they're going to contest the election.
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:03.760]  They know that Trump's going to win a landslide.
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:09.760]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets and the economy.
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:13.760]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election,
[1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:21.760]  the Democrats have said they're going to break away politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:26.760]  and basically use that as a pretext to sabotage the Republic even more.
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:34.760]  So until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that work with foreign governments that are trying to basically destroy the country
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:38.760]  are punished and removed, it's just going to continue to happen.
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:40.760]  And so that's the big problem here.
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:47.760]  That is that we have systemic dug-in corruption by people that hate the country's very existence.
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:38:00.760]  It's the evening of September 26, 2020, and I just got done watching the horrible footage of thousands of riot police with trojans
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:09.760]  beating thousands of peaceful people in Trafalgar Square, protesting the COVID martial law lockdown.
[1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:17.760]  An iron curtain is descending over the world from the United Nations, even more evil than the old Soviet Union.
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:19.760]  And this model is communist China.
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:27.760]  We're not facing incremental tyranny, we're facing absolute 100% commitment to evil
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:31.760]  because the system thinks we're weak and thinks we're stupid and is making us move.
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:36.760]  And whether it's Australia, the UK or the US, Black Lives Matter funded by Soros can run around and kill cops
[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:40.760]  and burn things down in their heroes. And oh, nobody's worried about the COVID BS,
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:44.760]  but when it's patriots saying we have rights, we have dignity, they get viciously attacked.
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:39:09.760]  All the videos are at m4wars.com, with David Ike speaking and more.
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:12.760]  Joe Biden has always been a considerable liar.
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:18.760]  Part of the establishment for close to 50 years, but now, boy, as his brain degenerates,
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:25.760]  we are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election.
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:28.760]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:33.760]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population,
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:36.760]  when not even one tenth of 1% have actually died.
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:42.760]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damage statements out is emblematic
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:47.760]  of the general public being in a trance. How is anyone even putting up with this?
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:40:15.760]  On Bazaar.
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:21.760]  We are seeing a lot of people who are not just brainwashed by the stimulus they are looking for,
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:25.760]  because they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana,
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:29.760]  but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:35.760]  They are trying to create a new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension,
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:42.760]  and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score.
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:47.760]  This is their plan. We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no.
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:41:16.760]  We must embrace God.
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:24.760]  But nobody wants to know him. They can see that he's just a fool.
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:35.760]  And he never gives an answer, but the fool under him sees the sun going down.
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:43.760]  Good morning. Obviously we had a great jobs report this morning, unemployment down below 8%.
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:48.760]  And the economy continues to be robust in its V-shaped recovery,
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.760]  and unfortunately that's not what everybody is focused on this morning.
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:42:01.760]  As all of you know, the President and the First Lady tested positive for COVID-19.
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:07.760]  They remain in good spirits. The President does have mild symptoms,
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:17.760]  and as we look to try to make sure that not only his health and safety and welfare is good,
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:21.760]  we continue to look at that for all of the American people.
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:26.760]  He continues to be not only in good spirits but very energetic.
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:29.760]  We've talked a number of times this morning.
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:35.760]  I got the five or six things that he had tasked me to do like I do every single morning,
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:42.760]  and he is certainly wanting to make sure that we stay engaged.
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:49.760]  I think the other thing that is critically important, the doctors continue to monitor
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:54.760]  both his health and the health of the First Lady will continue to do that.
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:43:01.760]  They'll be glad to provide some updates later today as we look at this.
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:09.760]  But I think the great thing about this President is not only is he staying committed
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:13.760]  to working very hard on behalf of the American people.
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:20.760]  His first question to me this morning was, how's the economy doing?
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:24.760]  How are the stimulus talks going on Capitol Hill?
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:33.760]  A number of us in the core team of the White House continue to get tested on a daily basis like we are,
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:42.760]  like we have been, and as we look to that, we're very excited about making sure that
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:48.760]  not only that the health and safety of the President and the First Lady is addressed,
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:55.760]  but certainly that we address this battle together as a nation together,
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:44:04.760]  and the American people can rest assured that the other President...
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:10.760]  It's Friday, October 2nd, 31 days out from historic election.
[1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:16.760]  CNN says 32, Fox says 31, it's 31 days until election day.
[1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:19.760]  32 until the real chaos kicks in.
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:24.760]  If you count November 3rd and the 79 days of hell starts.
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:29.760]  It wasn't very hard back in March to predict that they would say that Trump got COVID-19,
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:35.760]  either with a real COVID-19 he got or with a false test, which is the most common thing to happen.
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:36.760]  That's a fact.
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:49.760]  Or they have COVID-type chimeras that COVID-19 is a platform for, that they can then implant a more deadly viral effect.
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:56.760]  But then they'll also know, because they genetically engineered it, that when it mutates, it will no longer be deadly.
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:03.760]  So the problem with bio weapons is they blow back on you, even very specific ones.
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:09.760]  They can now tailor bio weapons down to a very individual if they can get some of your DNA.
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:13.760]  And so I've been really worried about designer.
[1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:19.760]  COVID, which will then show up on the toe tag of President Trump if they're able to kill him with it.
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:24.760]  And then that adds the fear and adds the hysteria, and statistically it doesn't kill a lot of people.
[1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:27.760]  They have a tailored COVID-19 for the President.
[1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:36.760]  You know, I said that back in March, knowing what COVID-19 was, knowing how the enemy operates, that was a prime projection.
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:38.760]  That was a possibility.
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:42.760]  That was not a prediction as much.
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:46.760]  But the six minutes of me talking about it in detail is at man.video.
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:51.760]  Right now, Alex Jones predicted President Trump would get COVID.
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:46:00.760]  What I said was, as I postulated that he could get it and they could use it as the cover, either poison him and then just a regular COVID virus didn't really kill him.
[1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:06.760]  But they say it's the cause of death, or they could load it up with a weaponized COVID.
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:08.760]  Because I want to explain something.
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:16.760]  COVID is a five virus HIV delivery system weapon platform.
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:24.760]  But if I have, in fact, ask one of the guys to open a safe and give me a, give me a Glock 9mm of some type, unloaded though.
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:28.760]  But I want the, I want the magazine because that's the allegory.
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:31.760]  COVID-19 is the Glock.
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:35.760]  The magazine with the bullets is what they load into it.
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:37.760]  COVID-19 is an aircraft carrier.
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:39.760]  COVID-19 is a delivery system.
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:41.760]  Think about this way.
[1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:47.760]  COVID-19 is the, is the powder and is the shell casing.
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:51.760]  And then what they load into it is the bullet.
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:56.760]  And when I looked at it and Reverend all the scientists were saying, they're like, this looks like what we have with H1N1.
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:47:05.760]  When they, we learned the year before they put an attenuated H1N1 that was still alive in the flu shot the year before to track it in a big global test.
[1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:08.760]  But then they said, oh, but it turns out the simulate did get some people sick.
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:19.760]  We'll know when you, when people died of other causes, pneumonia, another flu, other natural causes, heart attack, cancer, they would then say it was H1N1.
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:23.760]  So H1N1 was the first big simulate.
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:31.760]  And he became a medical literature that they put H1N1 attenuated in the vaccine the year before as part of a global herd immunity test.
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:46.760]  So they're guinea pigging people and admitting all this. And so when I saw COVID, I said, wait a minute, it's a weapons platform because they're easily able to then create a certain mutation variety of it.
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:50.760]  That again, is way more deadly, but has a very short half life.
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:59.760]  I don't mean that in a truly radiological term, but in its mutations, they've already in a lab mutated it because it's engineered and they know it'll mutate to not be harmful.
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:08.760]  Once they, it's been in its host subject, but for the first gen, for the first person who breathes it or it's sprayed on, like Trump, it's extremely deadly.
[1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:15.760]  Now, I'm not saying that's what's happened, but Trump could be dead in two days.
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:19.760]  People are saying, oh, he staged this to make it look like he's a man of the people.
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:24.760]  No, when I found out that Boris Johnson, people that I know that were around, they said he did have trouble breathing and got really sick.
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:28.760]  Well, they obviously just sprayed some real weaponized COVID in his face.
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:31.760]  They tried to get Bolsonaro, hell, they already stabbed him in the stomach.
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:34.760]  So if you've got people not going along, see how this is a perfect cover.
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:40.760]  While there's COVID hysteria, then you can have targeted assassinations with your souped up COVID.
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:46.760]  That again, after it hits first phase mutation, it's like a terminator seed.
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:47.760]  It's no longer deadly.
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:49.760]  Again, I always go back to terminator seeds.
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:51.760]  That's the archetype for all of this.
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:56.760]  You get the seed, it grows one soybean plant, but can't produce seeds that produce another plant.
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:59.760]  You have to go back to the factory to get the engineered tending with COVID.
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:01.760]  They have got thousands of varieties now.
[1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:06.760]  They know some super deadly, some not, but they find the deadly ones burn out real fast.
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:15.760]  Well, that's because they've already tested the permutations of it and they've already know how it basically is going to operate.
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:18.760]  So again, they can poison him and then say COVID killed him.
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:20.760]  It could be a false test.
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:22.760]  Most of them are false.
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:28.760]  And that way he needs another test that should be a top story as he being tested again.
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  Or again, it's a real bio weapon and they've already assassinated the president.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:35.760]  He's walking dead right now.
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:38.760]  And boy, that'll really help with a permanent lockdown on it.
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:41.760]  And the whole conspiracy theory assassinations never happened.
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:45.760]  Assassinations part of history with kings and emperors and presidents and lords.
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:47.760]  A lot of our presidents have been shot.
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:49.760]  A lot of them have been assassinated.
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:51.760]  Now they had high tech weapons in the 21st century.
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:54.760]  So I would be very, very, very concerned of us.
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:50:00.760]  I was everyone because the media will say, oh, Jones says he's been assassinated or Jones says it's a bio weapon or Jones says it's a hoax.
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:04.760]  No, I'm wargaming for you the real possibilities.
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:08.760]  And we've been proven right over and over again in the wide spectrum analysis.
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:17.760]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but it was easy to predict that in all this hysteria, they were going to say he had COVID and it's probably a false test.
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:23.760]  And now he's saying, well, I kind of got a headache and some sniffles, having some mild symptoms.
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:26.760]  Is that psychosomatic?
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:30.760]  You know, the bad placebo, like you take a sugar pill, you think you're better.
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:32.760]  Oh, people are sick around you.
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:38.760]  You've seen responses where someone throws up.
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:41.760]  And so you feel sick and throw up even though you haven't eaten the bad fish.
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:45.760]  They ate those are sympathetic responses.
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:48.760]  There's a lot of these and the average person isn't aware of it.
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:54.760]  So is Trump having a sympathetic response to a regular cold or flu going around the White House?
[1:50:54.760 --> 1:50:56.760]  Is it a false test?
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:50:58.760]  Has he been poisoned?
[1:50:58.760 --> 1:50:59.760]  Will they say he died of COVID?
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:00.760]  He died of something else.
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:02.760]  That's how I do it.
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:03.760]  That's the easiest way.
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:05.760]  You just poison him.
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:10.760]  Right after you say he has the positive COVID test because they're going around testing the whole White House all the time.
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:13.760]  And so, oh, boom, that's positive.
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:15.760]  Nine out of ten tests are fake.
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:21.760]  Now they're slipping the synthetic poison that'll cause him to have a heart attack.
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:22.760]  It'll metabolize out.
[1:51:22.760 --> 1:51:24.760]  They won't be able to find it in the blood.
[1:51:24.760 --> 1:51:26.760]  But now they're creeping in with the weapons.
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:29.760]  Trump could be dead in hours if that's the scenario.
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.760]  Well, we'll discuss it all.
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:35.760]  Coming up in hour number three at a big special guest, infowars.com.
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:38.760]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:42.760]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:45.760]  They give up freedoms by increments.
[1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:48.760]  Always promising it's only going to be a short period of time.
[1:51:48.760 --> 1:51:51.760]  And then the restressions will be released.
[1:51:51.760 --> 1:51:52.760]  But they're not.
[1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:56.760]  They have a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:01.760]  They will then slightly release it a little bit to only tighten it down even more later.
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:07.760]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:14.760]  This is the most common way that the vegetarians take over, but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up.
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:19.760]  Under the incrementalism, he starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down.
[1:52:19.760 --> 1:52:25.760]  And you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months that you saw in the previous 10 years.
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:28.760]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:34.760]  A world government, shy combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that once you pour
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:39.760]  and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[1:52:39.760 --> 1:52:43.760]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack.
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:45.760]  And I'm really bummed out about that.
[1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:50.760]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:52.760]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:58.760]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack,
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:01.760]  we are unable to secure it anymore.
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:07.760]  This is the highest in AMPM pack system you're going to find where you take half the pills in the morning,
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night.
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:11.760]  It's amazing.
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:15.760]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it.
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:19.760]  And that's why it's having such a great effect, because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:21.760]  So it's your last chance to get a pack power stack.

[1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:59.760]  8-pack power stack, 6% off and free shipping.
[1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:05.760]  I never would have made it through the Arkansas mud if I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud.
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:09.760]  Here's my analysis and war gaming.
[1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:12.760]  Back in March of this year.
[1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:14.760]  I got six months ago.
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:16.760]  Here it is.
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:20.760]  Trump set to declare an actual emergency.
[1:54:20.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  And then the subad line at infowars.com is the fact that the deep state wants to assassinate Trump and blame it on coronavirus.
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:37.760]  Oh, make no mistake, the ether has been swimming with that for about a week here at the office.
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:43.760]  And I wasn't ready to go to it until Wednesday.
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:50.760]  And then I came up here last night to shoot a video on it and I didn't get it done because I was dealing with other stuff.
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:52.760]  There's a lot going on.
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:57.760]  But I will talk about that at the start of the next segment.
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:55:03.760]  But can we pull up on infowars.com the main feed of the show?
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:16.760]  If you just go to infowars.com or newswars.com and you'll see the live feed of the show right there and it says Trump set to declare an actual emergency.
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:22.760]  Leftist targeting 45 for assassination be blamed on coronavirus.
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:24.760]  Well, that's quite a claim.
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:34.760]  It's like the claim we said six weeks ago that they're going to that the virus comes back and like HIV over and over again and you can't get rid of it.
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:39.760]  Oh, that's now Reuters AP.
[1:55:39.760 --> 1:55:43.760]  Everything today.
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:55.760]  The globalist problem is their science. So they can use science for evil, but there are other institutions and universities and people that aren't evil.
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:58.760]  They go and they look and they tell us this and they're like, shut up. It's not true.
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:00.760]  Shut up University of Wisconsin.
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:02.760]  Shut up University of New Delhi.
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:08.760]  Shut up University in Switzerland.
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:13.760]  Hey, this thing has HIV delivery system.
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:14.760]  Oh, shut up.
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:18.760]  Then like, oh, yeah, HIV drugs treat it.
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:21.760]  People are like, well, Alex said that six weeks ago.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:24.760]  And again, it's not that we're that smart.
[1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:26.760]  We understand how stuff works.
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:27.760]  Everyone's not evil.
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:29.760]  Everyone's not involved in a conspiracy.
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:38.760]  That's the globalist problem is there's all these professional classes and all these smart people that are out there that actually have studied things and they know what they're seeing.
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:40.760]  And they're going, hey, this is this is this is manufactured.
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:41.760]  They're like, shut up.
[1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:42.760]  Shut up.
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  You're funding is cut.
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  They're like, whoa, well, the university says I'm fired if I don't withdraw my paper and say it's wrong, but I'm not going to withdraw my paper and say it's wrong.
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:56.760]  And again, that's only a small clip from it.
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:04.760]  Alex Jones predicted the left would use Trump getting covered 19 to hit him with something worse.
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:13.760]  I'm not sure we played the part I wanted to play, but whatever.
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  We're going to break all this down.
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:21.760]  Coming up here today and the good part about live radio and live TV is in post.
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:28.760]  When we put that up at band on video, we'll be able to put the whole six minute clip up there for people.
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.760]  So please put a note in the notes there.
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:34.760]  Can we do that?
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:35.760]  Fantastic.
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:38.760]  That's going to be really good.
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  All right.
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:41.760]  I'm excited about our next guest.
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:43.760]  We're going to break when come back with her.
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:49.760]  She's a doctor and she's been speaking out about COVID and a lot of the things she said have been confirmed.
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:51.760]  A lot of other doctors have said similar things.
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:54.760]  They've been confirmed, but the media and the UN are trying to suppress it.
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:58:05.760]  She's talking about humans 2.0 with this new DNA manipulating vaccines that they've got with Moderna and all the rest of them pushing this.
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:10.760]  And the strangest things happened to me today and I have to leave it at that.
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:15.760]  I got some really interesting information from a very high level today.
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:23.760]  And I'm not able to give you where the information came from, but it's one of the reasons that I was not on air in the last hour.
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:25.760]  And this is incredible information.
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:31.760]  And I think when I start the next hour, I'm going to get to as much of this as I can.
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:33.760]  I'm almost speechless right now.
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:38.760]  I was trying to digest all of this as best I can.
[1:58:38.760 --> 1:58:40.760]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com.
[1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:45.760]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:59:10.760 --> 1:59:15.760]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[1:59:15.760 --> 1:59:18.760]  That is the post-human extermination plan.
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:21.760]  That is the public ideology of the globalists.
[1:59:21.760 --> 1:59:30.760]  And everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:39.760]  And any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:46.760]  This is the satanic, ruling elite, engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[1:59:46.760 --> 2:00:10.760]  The Essence of Evil.
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:16.760]  Well, Dr. Kerry Made is our guest. We really appreciate her coming on. She's a medical doctor.
[2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:23.760]  And her videos have been seen millions of times online when she came out and just read from what's in the mainline science
[2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:28.760]  that a bunch of these vaccines that Bill Gates and others are coming up with are these mRNA vaccines
[2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:33.760]  that aren't what you'd call a vaccine where it teaches your body how to defeat something and creates an autoimmune response.
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:41.760]  It's something else. And so she called it, you know, humans 2.0 and really Monsanto that has its own divisions in vaccine making,
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:44.760]  making you a GMO frank and creature.
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:47.760]  So we've already seen them do it with the soybeans and the corn and everything else.
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:52.760]  Now they're moving on to us. We've got President Trump supposedly with coronavirus.
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:57.760]  And he's got a little bit of a cold, a little bit lethargic with their saying in the media.
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:04.760]  Trump hasn't really confirmed that. They're showing a few stills of him walking yesterday and saying, oh, look, he looks tired there.
[2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:06.760]  You can do that with any stills you want.
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:12.760]  But if they're admitting that most of the tests come up false positive, you've had a flu or cold or infection in the last few years,
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:15.760]  then how can they be sure about this?
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:17.760]  Weren't we hearing about further tests?
[2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:18.760]  There's so much to cover.
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:20.760]  We're trying to get her on for about a month.
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:24.760]  It's perfect timing that she's been set up the last few days for now with all this coming out.
[2:01:24.760 --> 2:01:28.760]  So Dr. Kerry, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:31.760]  Dr. Kerry Monde is here with us.
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:32.760]  And where would you like to start?
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:37.760]  I've got so many questions with what's happening to Trump with the lockdowns, with the numbers.
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:41.760]  Some will say you're saying it's a hoax. You're not saying it's a hoax. You're saying it's overblown.
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:43.760]  They're not saying, look, Trump's got it.
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:45.760]  You guys said it was a hoax. You're full of it.
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:47.760]  But we have the morbidity numbers.
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:48.760]  I mean, we have the facts.
[2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:50.760]  We know it's way overblown from what they originally told us.
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:55.760]  So where would you like to start, doctor? And we salute you for your courage.
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:57.760]  Thanks, Alex. Thanks for having me on.
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:02:01.760]  I guess, you know, start with the vaccine itself.
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:10.760]  And I've studied vaccines for, you know, since my early 20s, because I was very concerned about them.
[2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:15.760]  And like to say that the vaccines are not what we think they are.
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:21.760]  And a little story just to give some of your listeners some history of vaccines.
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:26.760]  The tetanus vaccine, when I studied that, there's a long story behind that.
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:30.760]  But it turns out, really, it's an abortion vaccine.
[2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:39.760]  It's been noted by the NIH, the NIH has admitted this, that there is a pregnancy hormone called the HCG hormone.
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:41.760]  It is inside a lot of the vaccines.
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:45.760]  Now, I don't know if all of them have this, but many of them do.
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  Latino countries, the Vatican has discovered this, that when a woman gets this vaccine,
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:56.760]  that when she gets pregnant, she can abort the baby quickly, okay?
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:02:58.760]  She would not even know she's pregnant.
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:01.760]  So this is not for tetanus. This is something, you know, different.
[2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:03.760]  This is an abortion vaccine.
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:06.760]  So they're outright lying to us.
[2:03:06.760 --> 2:03:09.760]  So if they're lying to us from decades ago,
[2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:13.760]  why do you think they're going to tell you the truth now?
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.760]  So that just goes into a little history of vaccines in general.
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:19.760]  So jump forward to this one.
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:22.760]  I started researching this and I was horrified,
[2:03:22.760 --> 2:03:28.760]  because we are using technology that has never been unveiled on the human race before.
[2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:32.760]  We are messing with the DNA, our genome, which makes us human,
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:39.760]  which it has the blueprint that makes us know how to reproduce, how to create, how to evolve,
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:41.760]  how to heal ourselves.
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:47.760]  And one tiny little, you know, translocation, one little insert,
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:50.760]  one little deletion can make horrible effects.
[2:03:50.760 --> 2:03:52.760]  You can be very sick. You can have mutations.
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:56.760]  You can have cancers or turn into something else.
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:57.760]  We don't know.
[2:03:57.760 --> 2:03:59.760]  And make you sterile.
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:05.760]  So why are we doing this? Why are we rushing this vaccine with something that's brand new technology
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:07.760]  that we've never used before?
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:15.760]  So this is very, very concerning because I've attended a meeting, a scientific meeting with Dr. Craig Venter,
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:19.760]  who was one of the founders of the Human Genome Project,
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:25.760]  and he's still very involved with uploading genomes into the cloud and downloading them, mapping them out.
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:34.760]  He actually says that, you know, we can actually patent a gene or a genome of something that's synthetic.
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:41.760]  So technically, when we are getting a piece or this vaccine and if it does become permanent within our genome,
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:42.760]  it's synthetic.
[2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:45.760]  That part of us can be patented and owned.
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:50.760]  People need to understand this because owner, because patents have owners who would own us,
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  who would own part of us.
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:53.760]  This is insane.
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:56.760]  No human should be owned, no part of a human should be owned.
[2:04:56.760 --> 2:04:59.760]  And this is my alarm call to the world.
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:07.760]  He also said, this scientist researcher said that, you know, in the genomes that they were patenting,
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:14.760]  he was actually, he and the other scientists were putting their name into the genome, branding you already.
[2:05:14.760 --> 2:05:16.760]  This is unbelievable.
[2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:24.760]  So with an organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with the Department of Defense own part of you, who else could own part of you?
[2:05:24.760 --> 2:05:25.760]  What could they do with that?
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:29.760]  You need to understand this because this is the law right now.
[2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:34.760]  On top of that, they're trying to unveil technology with this vaccine.
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:42.760]  They haven't formally announced it, but in their studies, they're using nanotechnology, something called hydrogel.
[2:05:42.760 --> 2:05:47.760]  They're also using, they want to brand you with something called luciferase.
[2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:50.760]  It's an ID for ID 2020.
[2:05:50.760 --> 2:05:58.760]  And that would give you a unique identifier to make sure that you were vaccinated because they want to make sure everybody's vaccinated in the world.
[2:05:58.760 --> 2:06:04.760]  And with that ID, they can also hold your medical information, your vaccination record.
[2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:08.760]  It could gather your biometric information from your body.
[2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:17.760]  And also with this nanotechnology, this ID, this can link you up to the internet of everything into the 5G cloud.
[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:18.760]  Okay.
[2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:20.760]  So why would they want to do that?
[2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:32.760]  Well, interestingly enough, they put a patent, or they published a patent in March 26th of 2020 with the number 0600606, an international patent.
[2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:38.760]  With this patent, of course, Microsoft published this Bill and Linda Gates.
[2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:50.760]  They say that they could actually use these biometric data from your body, and that would be hooked to cryptocurrency, meaning your body would then become your commodity.
[2:06:50.760 --> 2:06:58.760]  So your, you, your body would become your money, not your credit card anymore, not your cash, your body.
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:05.760]  We're talking about the ultimate enslavement of humanity, and we need to wake up and realize this is happening.
[2:07:05.760 --> 2:07:11.760]  If you want to, I encourage everyone, look this stuff up for yourself, look up the patent numbers, they exist, they're there.
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:13.760]  And the same names keep coming up.
[2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:19.760]  The same people will keep, you know, profiting off of us, owning us, controlling us.
[2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:20.760]  And what do we get from it?
[2:07:20.760 --> 2:07:23.760]  Nothing but bad things.
[2:07:23.760 --> 2:07:24.760]  That's right.
[2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:31.760]  Everything when they end up giving us, you know, presses us, gums us down, makes us sick, and controls us.
[2:07:31.760 --> 2:07:41.760]  And what's weird is Bill Gates will openly have the hydro gel, have the nano tech tracker chips, and we'll have MIT and everybody else saying, oh, we do this for Bill Gates.
[2:07:41.760 --> 2:07:50.760]  But then the media will try to discredit it by covering one program he's doing, and claim that we're saying this program does that instead of the program we're talking about, and then try to discredit it.
[2:07:50.760 --> 2:07:56.760]  And he'll be back on the news the next month going, oh, I do want to put a implantable liquid chip in your body to make sure you've had the vaccine.
[2:07:56.760 --> 2:08:01.760]  So they've got a real problem here because the world is scary as all this is.
[2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:02.760]  I'm on the streets.
[2:08:02.760 --> 2:08:03.760]  So I see it.
[2:08:03.760 --> 2:08:04.760]  And I know you're now well known.
[2:08:04.760 --> 2:08:11.760]  People are really rejecting this across all cultural, racial, historic, and political lines.
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:12.760]  Yes.
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:14.760]  And you know, people tell me, oh, that won't happen.
[2:08:14.760 --> 2:08:15.760]  Well, guess what?
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:16.760]  It's already happening in Africa.
[2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:27.760]  Mastercard and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they are using this vaccine with the biometric ID with the children and the adults in Africa as we speak right now.
[2:08:27.760 --> 2:08:29.760]  You know, I saw that.
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:30.760]  I saw that.
[2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:32.760]  And we go to break guys, let's pull that up.
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:33.760]  I want to show people.
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:35.760]  And then I just forgot to even cover it.
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:40.760]  It's like we're all so conditioned now that this stuff is here in the third world.
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:42.760]  And that means it's coming here next.
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:44.760]  This is so diabolical.
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:45.760]  I agree.
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:46.760]  I agree.
[2:08:46.760 --> 2:08:55.760]  The more you look into it, the more you'll find out more and more DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is a huge player in this.
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:00.760]  People need to understand that they are behind transhumanism.
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:07.760]  And Elon Musk, who's now in the vaccine industry, he's been a proponent of transhumanism as well.
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:10.760]  Google, Ray Kurzweil, many people are.
[2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:18.760]  But the people that are pushing these vaccines, they are behind eugenics, meaning, you know, there's too many people on the planet.
[2:09:18.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  Let's get rid of some of us and who's going to choose who stays, who goes.
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  And then the rest of us, obviously, with all these technologies, they're trying to roll out.
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:29.760]  They ultimately want to control us.
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:32.760]  All right, Dr. Carrie Maday, medical doctor, amazing lady.
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:40.760]  She's with us at Twitter at Dr. Maday, that's M-A-D-E-J, YouTube, Dr. Carrie Maday.
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:43.760]  We'll be right back on Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:48.760]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:57.760]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:00.760]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:03.760]  The world being built by the technocrats.
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:08.760]  And the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown.
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:17.760]  It is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:24.760]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:27.760]  This is their stated goal.
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:33.760]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:37.760]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy when we turn this around.
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:39.760]  You must study their own writings.
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:41.760]  You must face the facts.
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:43.760]  And you must come to grips with it.
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:58.760]  We've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation.
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:01.760]  But the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well.
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:05.760]  The general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates.
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:07.760]  He's the most unpopular person on earth.
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:09.760]  People know he's not a doctor.
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:11.760]  People know he's a eugenicist.
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:14.760]  He has cancer viruses, polio, steroids and more.
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:16.760]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:23.760]  So now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global government
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:31.760]  and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing.
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:40.760]  So remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:43.760]  They are the enemies of humanity.
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:45.760]  They want you dead.
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:12:14.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:16.760]  He's the serendipity group.org.
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:18.760]  That's the most important spot.
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:20.760]  Serendipitygroup.org.
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:25.760]  So doctor, since you mentioned Elon Musk, we've got a short clip of him that we've never got to.
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:27.760]  I read the transcript on Monday.
[2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:32.760]  It's like an hour long interview, but we've got it down to three minutes where he really viciously attacks Bill Gates, which sounds good.
[2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:39.760]  And I know people that know Musk and Musk tells them he's a listener and he's made comments about the show before that are positive.
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:40.760]  So I don't think he's a good guy.
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:41.760]  I don't want to single him out.
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:44.760]  Bill Gates is bad news for his own statements of wanting to be populated.
[2:12:44.760 --> 2:12:46.760]  But is he good cop, bad cop?
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  Because he's pushing a vaccine company.
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:53.760]  He's pushing the satellites, the 5G, the brain chips.
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:56.760]  But then he's telling us Bill Gates is bad and that his COVID-19 vaccine is bad.
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:12:59.760]  What do you think is really going on there?
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:01.760]  I'm confused by him.
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:03.760]  He goes back and forth on his viewpoints.
[2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:10.760]  And so I don't know what to make of him either, but I've got my eyes wide open on everybody.
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:15.760]  We hit the break and you were getting into the mRNA vaccines.
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:16.760]  It shouldn't be called vaccines.
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:20.760]  It should be called genetic rewriting, which is what we call cancer.
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:25.760]  I mean, in fact, I was researching studies they've done in animals with these.
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:28.760]  As you know, it kills a lot of them and it causes autoimmune issues.
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:35.760]  It makes the cells create proteins that are supposedly going to block viruses, but that can also mess up the chromosomes.
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:40.760]  I was reading about the 8th chromosome being manipulated. Have you run into that as a medical doctor?
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  Yes, yes. That has to do with your intellect, of course.
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:52.760]  If they manipulate that, they could potentially affect our intellect, among other things.
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:53.760]  It's quite important.
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:14:00.760]  Yeah, right in the medical literature that, oh, this is fertility and intellect.
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:04.760]  Yes, they've already been manipulating our fertility, like I said with the tetanus vaccine.
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.760]  And perhaps other ones as well.
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  So we need to be on the lookout for this.
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:15.760]  But I would like to say, even if you don't want to believe any of the fantastical things I just said, just know this,
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:21.760]  that for the last 20 years they have done research with this kind of vaccine only on animals.
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:25.760]  And in the animal studies, they looked like it was a success.
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:27.760]  Okay, the animals had a robust immune system.
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:29.760]  They had a great T cell response.
[2:14:29.760 --> 2:14:30.760]  Great.
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:40.760]  But then they did a challenge test, which is unethical to do in humans, but they can do a challenge test.
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:42.760]  You know, her Skype broke up.
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:43.760]  We're going to come back to her.
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:49.760]  And I should have opened the show up with this, because when they did the challenge test,
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:56.760]  it caused horrible autoimmune response to whatever the outside pathogen was.
[2:14:56.760 --> 2:15:00.760]  And that is exactly the information I came into receipt of today.
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:04.760]  Serendipity, synchronicity, providence.
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:05.760]  What have I told you?
[2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:12.760]  I ran into the head scientist at one of the major biotech labs,
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:20.760]  didn't know who he was, found out, researched what he was saying, and it was all true.
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:23.760]  And what did he tell me?
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:25.760]  He told me a lot.
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:31.760]  What does the information tell me?
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:38.760]  If you take a vaccine for COVID-19, its main platform is a regular cold virus,
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:46.760]  with a bunch of stuff stacked onto it, genetic traits stacked on, called stacking.
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:53.760]  If you do that, and then your body learns to have an autoimmune response to that particular virus,
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:58.760]  it's so broad, you will now have an autoimmune response to the regular coronavirus
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:02.760]  that's so common, it's everywhere, making it where you can't even go outside,
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:06.760]  because you'll get so sick from regular cold viruses.
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:09.760]  And so they're trying to get rid of your immunity to the cold virus,
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:13.760]  but not just your immunity, they're trying to make it where you're allergic to it,
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:18.760]  which is what killed most of the people in the Spanish flu, was they were allergic to the virus,
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:22.760]  not that it was actually replicating and killing them, they had an autoimmune response.
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:27.760]  And this is so diabolical, and the scientist was breaking down the fact that,
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:32.760]  and this is so critical, the scientist was breaking down the point that,
[2:16:32.760 --> 2:16:36.760]  that's why they can't get an immunity with COVID patients and why it comes back,
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:42.760]  because it's so weak, the body doesn't even see it as a threat and won't create immunity to it.
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:46.760]  So they have to soup it up and add things to the vaccine that you're also allergic to,
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:50.760]  so you have an autoimmune response to both with the adjuvant,
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:52.760]  then just like they used to grow vaccines on peanuts,
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:54.760]  so suddenly kids that ate peanuts would die,
[2:16:54.760 --> 2:16:57.760]  because their body saw that as an outside pathogen,
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:01.760]  because they'd been given it in the flu shot or whatever it was they got when they were younger.
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:06.760]  And so they know what they're doing, they are jacking with us hard, folks.
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:10.760]  And I'm talking to a head of a biotech lab, major one,
[2:17:10.760 --> 2:17:17.760]  I mean, we're talking major, major billion dollar deals all the time with antibodies,
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:20.760]  with artificial nanotech antibodies.
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:23.760]  And they were just saying, no, it's a total scam,
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:26.760]  and it is just a franchise of a new franken virus they've made
[2:17:26.760 --> 2:17:32.760]  so that new versions can come out in the future and what this is is a simulant.
[2:17:32.760 --> 2:17:37.760]  So, so, so this is just the introduction to it all, exactly what we'd already reverse engineered.
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:42.760]  Her Skype broke up right when she got to the big enchilada.
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:50.760]  Dr. Maday, right when she started getting into the key of the key that,
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:54.760]  oh, they gave it to all these animals and they had an incredible autoimmune response
[2:17:54.760 --> 2:18:00.760]  and it boosted their immune system until they ran into the actual thing
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:04.760]  they were supposedly going to be protected from, and then they died.
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:09.760]  Because the body just went, whoa, I don't know how to deal with this, it was over.
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:14.760]  So, the most common virus is corona, it's everywhere, it's on your hands, it's in the air,
[2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:16.760]  it comes out of your body, it's just everywhere.
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:27.760]  Now, we're going to be given a vaccine that is super strong to make us have an autoimmune response
[2:18:27.760 --> 2:18:30.760]  to something our body recognizes as part of it,
[2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:35.760]  which is what the whole other area of gene and virus and cell theory is,
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:37.760]  is that no, viruses really just come out of us.
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:40.760]  No viruses go in and program cells to replicate themselves,
[2:18:40.760 --> 2:18:43.760]  but now they're learning that things that are basically viruses come out of ourselves as well
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:48.760]  as a form of the cells getting wasted out of them.
[2:18:48.760 --> 2:18:53.760]  So, they know how all this works now and we're still following 100-year-old germ theory
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:57.760]  and the globalists have got us in just an absolutely terrible spot.
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:03.760]  I hope her Skype's able to come back because I'm really looking forward to Dr. Carey,
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:10.760]  Maude and the great work she's doing and the fact that they've tried to censor and block.
[2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:14.760]  I've got to have a rule when Skype doesn't work for five minutes, we go telephone.
[2:19:14.760 --> 2:19:18.760]  So, let's go to that rule that we could. Thanks.
[2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:21.760]  I'm going to go to break here in just a few minutes.
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:26.760]  I want to encourage listeners to realize that they want you dependent on them,
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:29.760]  they want you unhealthy, they want you dumbed down, they want you stupid.
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:34.760]  And one of the biggest things is if your immune system's not up, anything's going to attack you and hurt you.
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:37.760]  They don't want you to know about that. That's why I thought you didn't want to talk about vitamin D,
[2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:40.760]  you don't want to talk about zinc, you don't want to talk about any of that stuff
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:43.760]  because these people want you at their own mercy.
[2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:48.760]  Well, I'm always promoting vitamins and minerals and we have some of the highest quality ones out there, period,
[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:51.760]  that are essential for your body's regular function.

[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:02.760]  turbo force, selling out, all the stuff selling out, free shipping,
[2:20:02.760 --> 2:20:06.760]  vaso beats, so good for your heart and body, free shipping and discounted, DNA force plus,
[2:20:06.760 --> 2:20:09.760]  selling out, but we still have it with free shipping.
[2:20:09.760 --> 2:20:13.760]  All T-shirts, 1776 plus free shipping, eight pack power stack.
[2:20:13.760 --> 2:20:17.760]  Can't even get the formula anymore because it's got 13 pills in each day's packages
[2:20:17.760 --> 2:20:19.760]  and so we can't get a bunch up if we have to discontinue it.
[2:20:19.760 --> 2:20:24.760]  You know, it became a best seller. That's 60% off free shipping, eight pack power stack.
[2:20:24.760 --> 2:20:27.760]  Survival Shield X2 is selling out, still discounted, free shipping.
[2:20:27.760 --> 2:20:33.760]  And so much more, infowarstore.com, ultimate fish oil back in stock, free shipping, big discount,
[2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:50.760]  and your purchase makes it all possible, so thank you so much for funding this operation.
[2:21:04.760 --> 2:21:08.760]  As well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like
[2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:12.760]  day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:16.760]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:19.760]  when China reopened within three months.
[2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:22.760]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[2:21:22.760 --> 2:21:29.760]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate style.
[2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:33.760]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com.
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:36.760]  Myself Alex Jones, Dave and I know and sure are covering this heavily.
[2:21:36.760 --> 2:22:05.760]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[2:22:06.760 --> 2:22:09.760]  And he now says you're going to take the shots.
[2:22:09.760 --> 2:22:15.760]  And of course in England they are now saying what I told you, you will not be allowed to travel.
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:19.760]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:28.760]  Dr Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year
[2:22:28.760 --> 2:22:38.760]  for adult, two for baby, baby much more manageable just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[2:22:38.760 --> 2:22:43.760]  I'm Dr Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:50.760]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:55.760]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[2:22:55.760 --> 2:23:01.760]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:07.760]  don't just track your location but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:12.760]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well
[2:23:12.760 --> 2:23:18.760]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do
[2:23:18.760 --> 2:23:25.760]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:30.760]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:33.760]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:40.760]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:42.760]  infowarstore.com
[2:23:42.760 --> 2:23:49.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:25.760]  All right folks, we're getting our guest back on. She's had her phone lines cut, her skype going on.
[2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:30.760]  She does a lot of interviews that never happened before. Dr. Kerry Maday will be going back to her in a moment
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:33.760]  while we line that back up and give this critical information.
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:39.760]  But here's Elon Musk over the weekend talking about Bill Gates. We got you some of the excerpts of it.
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:47.760]  At the end of April with many new cases every day, he tweeted, quote, free America now in all caps.
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:51.760]  On this issue, we do not agree.
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:56.760]  I mean, this is a hot button issue where rationality takes a backseat.
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:25:05.760]  So in the grand scheme of things, I think this is, you know, what we have is something with a very low mortality rate
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:13.760]  and high contagion and something that is of low risk to a young person is of high risk to an older person.
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:18.760]  Essentially, the right thing to do would be to not have done a lockdown for the whole country,
[2:25:18.760 --> 2:25:25.760]  but to have, I think, anyone who's at risk should be quarantined until the storm passes.
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:30.760]  All right, but this storm is coming again. You know, you're talking a lot about saving humanity,
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:33.760]  but these are humans that die in the process.
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:35.760]  Everybody dies.
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:37.760]  I know that, Elon. I get that.
[2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:40.760]  The question is, what on balance is the greater good?
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:42.760]  And you feel lockdowns did not do that.
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:45.760]  No.
[2:25:45.760 --> 2:25:50.760]  This is a no one situation. It has diminished my faith in humanity, the whole thing.
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:53.760]  Because?
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:25:58.760]  The irrationality of people in general.
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:02.760]  Will you get a vaccine? What do you do with your own family? You won't get a vaccine.
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:03.760]  Why is that?
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:08.760]  I'm not at risk for COVID. I know I'm a kid.
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:09.760]  So you won't do that?
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:10.760]  No.
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:15.760]  And what do you do now? Do you just go to work? Is that how you're conducting yourself and your family?
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:16.760]  Yeah.
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:17.760]  Yeah.
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:21.760]  This entire time SpaceX has been at work through this entire thing.
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:26.760]  We didn't skip a day. We had national security clearance because of national security work.
[2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:29.760]  We sent astronauts to the space station and back.
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:36.760]  Tesla has been apart from several weeks where we're shut down by the state and then overzealous Alameda County, which is a travesty.
[2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:40.760]  But apart from that, we've been making cars this entire time.
[2:26:40.760 --> 2:26:42.760]  And that's been great.
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:47.760]  How do you answer your employees? You say, I think you're putting me and my family at risk.
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:49.760]  What do you say to them then?
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:50.760]  Great. Stay home.
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:52.760]  Stay home. That's it.
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:53.760]  Yeah.
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:27:00.760]  Do they get penalized for that or just what's it's what can they do if they feel that they are at risk?
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:06.760]  I mean, if they have a legitimate reason to be at risk and that, you know, they should stay home.
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:13.760]  All right. So when they decide what this is your policy, when these workers are worried, and do you feel that they have a, I want to just get back to that.
[2:27:13.760 --> 2:27:14.760]  Put yourself in there.
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:17.760]  Do you feel they have a good reason to be worried?
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:26.760]  And do you feel a duty to pay them and make sure they're okay, despite the fact that you don't agree with how they feel about COVID versus how you feel about it?
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:27.760]  Just move on.
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:31.760]  Just move on. That's what you want to do.
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:37.760]  Kara, I do not want to get into a debate about COVID situation.
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:42.760]  Okay. All right. Okay. I want to finish up talking about in the podcast. Now we can do it.
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:47.760]  Okay. What do you say? No, we don't. I don't want to end it. I just want to understand where you've got, but I do. I feel like I understand where you are.
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:55.760]  So one of the things I should say, we've also spent quite a lot of time with the Hobbit epidemiology team doing antibody studies.
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:27:59.760]  Tesla makes the vaccine for machines for curavac.
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:02.760]  Gates said something about me not knowing what what is doing.
[2:28:02.760 --> 2:28:07.760]  It's like, hey, we actually make the vaccine machines for curavac that company you're invested in.
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:13.760]  It seems like you have a lot of passion around this topic, like that you feel this has been blown and that there are better ways to do it,
[2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:16.760]  which is what you do in your other parts of your life, correct?
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:22.760]  Whether it's Tesla or SpaceX, the rockets aren't being reused. The cars aren't electric.
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:26.760]  The way we address viruses is irrational.
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:29.760]  It's very irrational.
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:37.760]  All right, we have Dr. Maude back with us. I wanted to show you this International Business Times headline overhead shop, please.
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:43.760]  And it says coronavirus update vaccine skips important animal testing phase straight to humans.
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:45.760]  Now, why is that going on?
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:51.760]  Well, because they've done mRNA testing with similar pathogens.
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:56.760]  And if you can just recap and start over as your Skype cut out and you got cut off on your phone line next doctor,
[2:28:56.760 --> 2:29:02.760]  if you can just start over where you were about the animal testing, look like it was working great.
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:06.760]  And then what happened next?
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:16.760]  Similar studies on animals and in the initial trials, they looked like they had great immune responses, great antibody levels, T cell responses.
[2:29:16.760 --> 2:29:23.760]  Then they were challenged with that virus, which is unethical in human studies, but you could do that with the animals.
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:31.760]  And when they challenged the animals, they had a cytokine storm, meaning they actually had a worsened response.
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:34.760]  They actually got sicker and they even died.
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:37.760]  So they had lung inflammation, liver failure, etc.
[2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:44.760]  So perhaps that's why we are purposely skipping the animal trials in this particular vaccine for us.
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:46.760]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[2:29:46.760 --> 2:29:54.760]  Explain the storm and how that ties into the 1918 Spanish flu for folks that don't know, wasn't the flu replicating that killed them?
[2:29:54.760 --> 2:29:57.760]  It was the autoimmune response in the lungs, correct, doctor?
[2:29:57.760 --> 2:29:59.760]  Yes, that is correct.
[2:29:59.760 --> 2:30:02.760]  The body has an exaggerated immune response.
[2:30:02.760 --> 2:30:04.760]  It doesn't have a normal immune response.
[2:30:04.760 --> 2:30:07.760]  And that's what we're afraid of happening with this exact vaccine.
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:12.760]  This is some of the things that have been brought up by the researchers themselves behind the vaccines.
[2:30:12.760 --> 2:30:16.760]  They say this is definitely something that can happen.
[2:30:16.760 --> 2:30:23.760]  So when you see the common cold, you see the common flu, you see something in that same family of coronaviruses,
[2:30:23.760 --> 2:30:28.760]  you could, instead of having a better immune response, you can have a worsened immune response
[2:30:28.760 --> 2:30:35.760]  and perhaps be one of those people in the intensive care unit who even dies or has other comorbidities from that.
[2:30:35.760 --> 2:30:36.760]  Why are we doing this?
[2:30:36.760 --> 2:30:38.760]  Why are we going to be in the experiment?
[2:30:38.760 --> 2:30:45.760]  Because this not one experiment will be fully completed before October of 2021.
[2:30:45.760 --> 2:30:48.760]  We will all be inside of an experiment.
[2:30:48.760 --> 2:30:52.760]  And I thought that we were supposed to go with the Nuremberg Code from World War II,
[2:30:52.760 --> 2:30:58.760]  where we should not be forced into any experiment without informed consent and our consent.
[2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:00.760]  So what is happening here?
[2:31:00.760 --> 2:31:04.760]  Why are they trying to tell us that we need to have this vaccine to go back to normal?
[2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:09.760]  This does not make sense to me, and to me this goes against the Nuremberg Code.
[2:31:09.760 --> 2:31:15.760]  Well, it doesn't just go against the Nuremberg Code that obviously comes out of Nazi Germany that was then picked up into the Geneva Convention.
[2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:19.760]  It goes against all common sense, common law, federal state laws around the world,
[2:31:19.760 --> 2:31:25.760]  and it's all coercion by a guy that isn't even a medical doctor that tells us he's going to hold his hostage till we do this.
[2:31:25.760 --> 2:31:30.760]  They have British ministers, an Australian minister saying you'll be locked up in your house basically
[2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:36.760]  if you don't let the military come give you this shot, and then they admit it's making 80% of people sick,
[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:41.760]  20% are going to the hospital, that's the weaker vaccine, the mRNA vaccine.
[2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:47.760]  I know Gates is pushing one where 100% of people get sick, and some die, and then they admit they skipped the animals
[2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:49.760]  because they don't want to have all these dead animals.
[2:31:49.760 --> 2:31:57.760]  I mean, this is a bold move, doctor, because this is going to have major backlash.
[2:31:57.760 --> 2:32:07.760]  Yes, you're right. We need to know everything that's going on right now, because in my opinion, there is a plan behind this.
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:12.760]  I think that they're already talking about the second wave. I think they already are expecting this.
[2:32:12.760 --> 2:32:23.760]  The second wave could simply be the people that get the vaccines are now more at immune risk of getting very sick from any sort of coronavirus they come across.
[2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:30.760]  So then they'll blame that on the COVID 20, right? And then they'll say, look, you guys didn't behave yourselves.
[2:32:30.760 --> 2:32:33.760]  You should have been in lockdown longer. You should have worn your mask more.
[2:32:33.760 --> 2:32:39.760]  Perhaps we should take people out of your homes like the World Health Organization has been threatening us with.
[2:32:39.760 --> 2:32:41.760]  We could take your child or you from your home.
[2:32:41.760 --> 2:32:47.760]  That's right. They're making normal viruses normally being sick, and they're saying you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals,
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:52.760]  you need these vaccines, and by the way, if you don't do what we say and don't take constant tests, we're going to take your children away.
[2:32:52.760 --> 2:32:56.760]  It's actually starting in Australia, it's starting in Canada, and the UN is directing it.
[2:32:56.760 --> 2:33:01.760]  I mean, how? This is true dystopia, doctor.
[2:33:01.760 --> 2:33:05.760]  I agree with you. And in Spain, you know, they already have containment camps set up.
[2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:11.760]  And I believe they're saying all asymptomatic carriers will go into that containment camp.
[2:33:11.760 --> 2:33:17.760]  Healthy people, not the sick people. What are we doing in our world?
[2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:23.760]  We need to really pay attention to what's happening around the world because it's being mirrored in all the countries.
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:29.760]  So I have people tell me, well, that's not the United States. That's a wrong idea. It's a wrong thought process
[2:33:29.760 --> 2:33:33.760]  because we have to care what's going on because this is a world issue.
[2:33:33.760 --> 2:33:35.760]  It is not just one country or another country's issue.
[2:33:35.760 --> 2:33:38.760]  That's right. It's the UN, and we've got to fight it globally and locally.
[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:41.760]  We'll be right back. This lady's amazing. Dr. Kerry, my day.

[2:35:43.760 --> 2:35:51.760]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19,
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:55.760]  which are well beyond what they should be,
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:59.760]  it's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:02.760]  200 million people have died.
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:05.760]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:11.760]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:13.760]  when it's not even 200,000 in reality,
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:17.760]  he would honestly say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage.
[2:36:17.760 --> 2:36:18.760]  It's all made up.
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:22.760]  But you know where he got it? The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:27.760]  They said that 4% of America would be dead already.
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:32.760]  Of course, it's.000 and then add a number, because the numbers vary.
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:37.760]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:43.760]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:46.760]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:53.760]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:55.760]  is going to be your most valuable asset.
[2:36:55.760 --> 2:36:58.760]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.760]  The world being built by the technocrats.
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:06.760]  And the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:10.760]  is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:15.760]  into total and complete dehumanization.
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:22.760]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[2:37:22.760 --> 2:37:25.760]  This is their stated goal.
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:28.760]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you,
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:34.760]  but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:35.760]  We turn this around.
[2:37:35.760 --> 2:37:37.760]  You must study their own writings.
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:39.760]  You must face the facts.
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:41.760]  And you must come to grips with it.
[2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:46.760]  We're all being incrementally destroyed.
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:51.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:06.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:11.760]  we're sitting here covering the RMNA vaccine,
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:13.760]  the mRNA vaccine, all of it.
[2:38:13.760 --> 2:38:15.760]  It makes my head spin.
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:18.760]  And we're looking at this news that's breaking.
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:20.760]  This is up on infowars.com.
[2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:25.760]  Pelosi discusses continuity of government following Trump COVID diagnosis.
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:29.760]  I told you, I said they could say he had COVID poisoning
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:31.760]  and then you COG to removing.
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:33.760]  And now you notice I've been harping on COG.
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:36.760]  What's COG? Now it's at newswars.com.
[2:38:36.760 --> 2:38:38.760]  I'll play that clip next hour.
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:40.760]  I'm going to go ahead and host them into the next hour,
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:42.760]  because this is an emergency situation under Nick Baggich.
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:44.760]  We'll do the last two segments.
[2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:48.760]  But we're joined by Dr. Kerry Maudet here.
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:51.760]  And I really appreciate her coming on.
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:54.760]  She's a medical doctor and she had Skype cut out.
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:56.760]  Never happens in her phone cut out.
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:38:57.760]  That was crazy.
[2:38:57.760 --> 2:39:00.760]  And with all the internet censorship and big tech even getting into private messages now
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:02.760]  and censoring, I mean, who knows?
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:05.760]  They're probably doing that because they've been censoring doctors across the board,
[2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:08.760]  scientists, epidemiologists, prestigious, you know,
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:10.760]  former head of the Rockefeller hospital,
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:13.760]  all these people and they've been proven right about herd immunity.
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:16.760]  They've been proven right about the numbers of dead,
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:18.760]  about the things being added to COVID-19.
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:21.760]  Just in general, doctor, you're a smart lady,
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:24.760]  watching all this unfold.
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:26.760]  Where do you see it going?
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:30.760]  What do you see unfolding when Gates is on CBS and goes,
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:33.760]  yeah, 20% go to the hospital, some die.
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:35.760]  And 700 million are going to get sick.
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:38.760]  Seven.
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:40.760]  I mean, it just makes your head spin.
[2:39:40.760 --> 2:39:42.760]  They want in our bodies.
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:46.760]  And then we learn what they're doing is guinea pigging and changes our DNA
[2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:48.760]  and makes us this new creature.
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:50.760]  This is like an alien takeover.
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:52.760]  I mean, whether aliens are real or another planet,
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:59.760]  Bill Gates thinks he's a God who wants to have this genetic revolution over us.
[2:39:59.760 --> 2:40:06.760]  Where do you think this is all going, doctor?
[2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:10.760]  Her skype's frozen again.
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:17.760]  Let's go ahead and play the full clip of Pelosi on television.
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:20.760]  And again, folks, they want Trump out.
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:22.760]  They've already tried coups.
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:25.760]  Obviously, there's more threats to the president than the other president combined.
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:27.760]  Obviously, poisons the way they want to go.
[2:40:27.760 --> 2:40:30.760]  They're always saying he's 74 overweight.
[2:40:30.760 --> 2:40:31.760]  He's going to have a heart attack.
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:32.760]  He goes, there's a medical checkup.
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:33.760]  It's the end of the world.
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:36.760]  What they'll do is say he has COVID and poison him with something else
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:41.760]  or give him weaponized COVID because it's a carrier platform and do it.
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:43.760]  I mean, this is a big deal 31 days out.
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:45.760]  And I told you this was all coming.
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:49.760]  And already the COVID shutdown is annihilating the worldwide economy.
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:56.760]  I mean, stuff is serious when I lay this out, when I tell you all of this.
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:40:57.760]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:40:59.760]  When I tell you the supply chain is breaking down,
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:01.760]  when I tell you our big food supply actually has the food
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:05.760]  and all the other places are sold out and they're trying to buy food months and months out.
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:07.760]  The price has already gone up 20, 30%.
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:09.760]  I mean, this is really going on.
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:14.760]  And they're really coming in Australia, in Canada, in lepid areas of Europe,
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:17.760]  the U.S. saying we're going to forcibly inject you.
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:19.760]  And if you don't, you can't leave your house
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:21.760]  and they're going to make it a waiting list to get it.
[2:41:21.760 --> 2:41:25.760]  And there's a lot of people bought into the fear.
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:33.760]  And it's all weird fetishizing that, oh, you're heroes
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:35.760]  because you wear the mask, you're saving lives.
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:37.760]  And it's like, oh, just wear the mask.
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:38.760]  Oh, just take the inoculation.
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:39.760]  Oh, just have the tracker chip.
[2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:42.760]  Oh, just have the tracker app.
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:44.760]  Oh, just be a hero.
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:48.760]  And then everything that comes with it, and then they know in Mass Stockholm syndrome,
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:51.760]  once they get people to do something that brain damages their kids
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:53.760]  and hurts them and sterilizes them.
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:56.760]  And as you get the medical problems that come with it,
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:41:59.760]  they've already argued and said COVID-19 is magical.
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:03.760]  It'll give you all these brain disorders and it'll sterilize you.
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:05.760]  But it's the vaccine that's doing it.
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:06.760]  We know who's behind it.
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.760]  We know what's in the literature.
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:10.760]  We know the background of it.
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:12.760]  And then Pelosi comes out two months ago and goes,
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:14.760]  he will be fumigated out of the White House one way or other.
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:16.760]  And we'll use the military to remove him.
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:19.760]  And I already met with COG and they say I'm number two in command,
[2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:25.760]  even though it's the secret, even though it's the vice president.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:27.760]  And then they start saying, oh, the military needs to remove him.
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:28.760]  The military says, we won't do that.
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:30.760]  They go, oh, Trump wants the military.
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:33.760]  Then they're going to hold up the election with a balance.
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:37.760]  And then on January 20th, if Trump hasn't won the election,
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:42.760]  clearly she will vote at the House of Representatives and install who she wants.
[2:42:42.760 --> 2:42:45.760]  And they've got it all fired up right now.
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:46.760]  No one gives you power.
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:51.760]  You have to take it from them. That's what Pelosi famously said.
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:54.760]  And if she worked for the Chai comms and the globalists,
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:58.760]  an empty nobody who hates this country put in power by the satanic cult.
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:00.760]  So here she is.
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:04.760]  Pelosi discusses continuity of government following Trump COVID diagnosis.
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:05.760]  Here it is.
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:09.760]  The hero's bill in a moment, but this is a very serious health threat.
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:12.760]  You are second in line for the presidency.
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:16.760]  Has the White House contacted you about the continuity of government?
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:17.760]  No, they haven't.
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:20.760]  But that is an ongoing, not with the White House,
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:28.760]  but with the military, quite frankly, in terms of some officials in the government.
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:31.760]  But let us just all pray for the president's health.
[2:43:31.760 --> 2:43:39.760]  Thank God the vice president has tested negatively and the second lady as well.
[2:43:39.760 --> 2:43:45.760]  So again, that continuity of government is always in place.
[2:43:45.760 --> 2:43:48.760]  I always say it's a relic of the past.
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:53.760]  But nonetheless, they say we have our job, we have to do, and this is what we will do.
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:56.760]  All right, let me decipher that for you.
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:00.760]  They tried to go to the system of COG that knows it's supposedly under lawful government
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:02.760]  and try to give them to overthrow Trump.
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:03.760]  They've said that.
[2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:06.760]  The House Armed Services Committee Democrats wrote a letter two months ago and said,
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:10.760]  please overthrow Trump, and they said, hell no, this is illegal, you're crazy.
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:15.760]  So now they're like, oh, it's a relic of the past, but don't worry, the military is in charge.
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:23.760]  Well, really, the military launched the four doomsday planes to let the deep state know,
[2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:26.760]  even if they try to blow up federal buildings or assassinate people,
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:29.760]  that Trump has aircraft in the air.
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:34.760]  And that's what that is, is the military under Trump saying, no, we have aircraft in the air.
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  You can't stop us because they know the Democrats are in league with the Chai comms and others.
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:45.760]  And America is at war with China and the deep staters and with Bill Gates and the whole nine yards right now.
[2:44:45.760 --> 2:44:48.760]  So she tried to say COG is our savior to remove Trump.
[2:44:48.760 --> 2:44:52.760]  Oh, now it's a relic of the past and, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:55.760]  Let's see, they could use the command and control system.
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:58.760]  See the movie Valkyrie?
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:04.760]  Tom Cruise is based on the true story, how Hitler had a martial law plan to keep control of the government,
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:10.760]  but they reversed Operation Valkyrie and tried to use that COG system against Hitler.
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:12.760]  Well, Pelosi seeing Trump as Hitler.
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:13.760]  So they already tried this.
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:14.760]  It's not working.
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:17.760]  And now Valkyrie is in the air.
[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:20.760]  That's why all four, they're never up at the same time.
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:25.760]  They're all up right now.
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  Tomorrow's news today, folks, we're not playing games.
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:31.760]  All right.
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:32.760]  Dr. Maude is here.
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:35.760]  Dr. Kerry Maude, a lot of problems with her Skype and phone.
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:38.760]  I'm thinking it probably is on purpose with the massive censorship.
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:44.760]  What do you make of the censorship doctors around the world and prestigious scientists have gone through trying to suppress what you have to say?
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:48.760]  That's unprecedented as well.
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:53.760]  Well, I think we've always been censored, but now it's at an all time high.
[2:45:53.760 --> 2:45:56.760]  You know, if you speak up, there's repercussions.
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:45:57.760]  You will be fired.
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:45:58.760]  You will be harassed.
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:01.760]  You will be flandered or even worse than that.
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:02.760]  So it's not new.
[2:46:02.760 --> 2:46:04.760]  It's just heightened right now.
[2:46:04.760 --> 2:46:17.760]  And, you know, in my state of Georgia, my license, if you write the question for hydroxychloroquine, the pharmacist has the right to deny your prescription just because they don't have to give a reason.
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:19.760]  And I heard a record skip there.
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:24.760]  That's on record that you have the medical degree, you have the license, it's something you're allowed to prescribe.
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:25.760]  It's known as safe.
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:27.760]  It's an off-market drug.
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:28.760]  It's cheap.
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:29.760]  It's good.
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:30.760]  It's moral.
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:31.760]  It pushes zinc into the cells.
[2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:32.760]  But now Big Pharma is the God.
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:35.760]  They can say no to the doctor.
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:36.760]  Exactly.
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:41.760]  You're also breaking your own federal laws, privacy laws that are being broken.
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:45.760]  But isn't this all under the guise of the emergency preparedness act?
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:51.760]  Well, what is actually happening is if you look at the data, this is not being emergency act right now.
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:54.760]  It does not support an emergency act.
[2:46:54.760 --> 2:46:55.760]  Exactly.
[2:46:55.760 --> 2:46:57.760]  It's doctors talking about the data they sensor.
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:46:58.760]  Get into the real data about COVID.
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:00.760]  What is COVID from your research?
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:02.760]  And what are the real numbers?
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:04.760]  Well, I mean, what are the numbers?
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:07.760]  They're actually very much manipulated.
[2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:17.760]  And the false side, I mean, for instance, just the state of Florida, they found over 300 individual labs saying they had 100% of the cases positive.
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:19.760]  When they were investigated, less than 10%.
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:24.760]  Don't tell me that was just a mistake because over 300 is not a mistake.
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:28.760]  This has been replicated in other states as well.
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:38.760]  There's been that alone with other things of just giving incentives to the hospitals and the doctors for having different diagnoses putting COVID on the death certificate.
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:41.760]  They get more money or from the discharge, more money.
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:42.760]  I mean, come on.
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:45.760]  These are these are inflated numbers.
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:51.760]  So if you look at what's really happening, it's about on par with maybe the H1N1 flu season.
[2:47:51.760 --> 2:47:53.760]  Didn't declare a pandemic over that.
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:58.760]  So no, this is we're not going by sound science and data.
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:00.760]  So what is going on here?
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:05.760]  And I believe it's really a bigger plan of having control over everybody.
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:12.760]  It's a it's a world plan, not just one country and a little, a little story.
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:13.760]  Doctor, stay there.
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:18.760]  We're going to come right back to Dr. Carrie Monday on the other side at Dr. M. A. D. E. J.
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:20.760]  She's amazing and it's great having her.
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:24.760]  I appreciate her staying late because she's had some Skype problems that we have or whatever the hell's going on.
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:25.760]  Hour number four is coming up.
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:26.760]  She'll leave us about 15 minutes.
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:32.760]  I'm going to blitz huge news and then Dr. Nick Baggett stay with us.
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:36.760]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[2:48:36.760 --> 2:48:39.760]  They give you about freedoms by increments.
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:46.760]  Always promising it's only going to be a short period of time and then the restructants will be released, but they're not.
[2:48:46.760 --> 2:48:50.760]  They have a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:55.760]  They will then slightly release it a little bit to only tighten it down even more later.
[2:48:55.760 --> 2:49:01.760]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:07.760]  This is the most common way that the salitarians take over, but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up.
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:15.760]  Under the incrementalism, he starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out.
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:19.760]  It's just a few days, weeks or months that you saw in the previous 10 years.
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:22.760]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:33.760]  A world government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that once you pour and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:38.760]  This is your last chance to get a packed power stack and I'm really bummed out about that.
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:44.760]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and sort of reordering it.
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:47.760]  It spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:55.760]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:04.760]  This is the highest in a MPM pack system you're going to find where you take half the pills in the morning, half the capitals and pills and gel caps at night.
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:09.760]  It's amazing. I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it.
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:13.760]  And that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:16.760]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack at infowarstore.com.
[2:50:16.760 --> 2:50:18.760]  It's 60% off and free shipping.
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:21.760]  That is at cost for all of you that already support Info Wars.
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:23.760]  We're passing these savings on to you.
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:25.760]  Get your A-Pack power stack now or you still can.
[2:50:25.760 --> 2:50:28.760]  Last chance to get it at infowarstore.com.
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:48.760]  A-Pack power stack 60% off and free shipping.
[2:50:48.760 --> 2:50:51.760]  Global governments had lost control.
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:58.760]  Nationalists and populists were getting elected. The UN director of the vaccine program said in December of last year,
[2:50:58.760 --> 2:51:02.760]  the front lines wobbly, doctors say vaccines are hurting people, not helping them.
[2:51:02.760 --> 2:51:07.760]  It started coming out that most of the polio on the planet was being caused by the polio vaccine.
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:09.760]  What were they going to do?
[2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:11.760]  Fail forward, too big to fail.
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:15.760]  Bring in the biggest global scare ever and watch the sheep line up.
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:18.760]  Bring in a global taxation system, a tracking system.
[2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:22.760]  Social credit score, total surveillance in forced inoculations.
[2:51:22.760 --> 2:51:26.760]  Dr. Kerry Medea is here with us. She's a medical doctor.
[2:51:26.760 --> 2:51:28.760]  This is a short, segment-long segment that she's going to leave us.
[2:51:28.760 --> 2:51:32.760]  You were getting into the big picture. Other facets of this. Please continue.
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:40.760]  Yes, Alex. I just wanted to let your listeners know that my opinion is not coming just from research.
[2:51:40.760 --> 2:51:45.760]  I've actually attended meetings where control of people was discussed.
[2:51:45.760 --> 2:51:50.760]  The one meeting I'd like to bring up briefly is a business owner's meeting in Atlanta.
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:55.760]  This meeting was talking about how to get more companies internationally to come to Atlanta,
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:51:59.760]  but they had problems with the behavior of the people in Atlanta.
[2:51:59.760 --> 2:52:03.760]  That they were too racist, that they weren't amenable to different cultures.
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:06.760]  This is exactly what they said. They had a plan.
[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:08.760]  This is about five years ago.
[2:52:08.760 --> 2:52:13.760]  They said they would introduce a health app, which has already downloaded all our phones now.
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:20.760]  In this health app, this would connect the person immediately to the cloud and give biometric data.
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:30.760]  An example is if somebody lied, the phone would know they're lying immediately because of the GPS, of course,
[2:52:30.760 --> 2:52:33.760]  but also their voice inflection would know that they're lying.
[2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:38.760]  There's an electro-thermal analysis that would be on par with the police station that would know they're lying.
[2:52:38.760 --> 2:52:44.760]  If they were drinking alcohol, the alcohol content would be immediately known what their level was,
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:46.760]  what medications they were on.
[2:52:46.760 --> 2:52:48.760]  Everything about this, they would know.
[2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:52.760]  If someone said, I met someone else's house and they really weren't,
[2:52:52.760 --> 2:52:57.760]  the phone would automatically light up and buzz them saying, you're lying, you're lying.
[2:52:57.760 --> 2:53:03.760]  This was actually introduced at a business meeting in Atlanta five years ago.
[2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:11.760]  They said if you could influence somebody's behavior by saying you're lying and then have repercussions for lying,
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:17.760]  you could instantly change the behavior of a population in an area within 30 days.
[2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:19.760]  Think about that.
[2:53:19.760 --> 2:53:24.760]  That technology is what we're talking about right now with the 060...
[2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:29.760]  Kerry, I want you to come back in the longer segment and recap this and talk about where it was and where it happened.
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:31.760]  Here's the deal.
[2:53:31.760 --> 2:53:36.760]  They called the first Internet when they declassified it in 1962, the Intergalactic Communications Network,
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:43.760]  and a psychiatrist at DARPA, I'm sure you know this, came up with the idea to have terminal computers that are wireless
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:48.760]  with little handheld computers that monitor our physiology, our behavior, they surmise,
[2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:51.760]  they would have instruments strong enough and miniaturize the future.
[2:53:51.760 --> 2:53:57.760]  I wonder where they got all these ideas and that they would then be able to track everything we do in live time
[2:53:57.760 --> 2:54:04.760]  and study the stimuli they put out through the TVs, through the broadcast with the handheld devices to track our behavior
[2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:07.760]  so they could tune us under the control of the system.
[2:54:07.760 --> 2:54:09.760]  And it sounds like that's what you just said.
[2:54:09.760 --> 2:54:13.760]  Yes, this is our real plan for the real business owners meeting.
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:17.760]  And so this is my alarm call to the world.
[2:54:17.760 --> 2:54:22.760]  They want to implement this in Atlanta with one of the pilot cities.
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:28.760]  Well, and that's why they've got alerts on our phones now and alerts on our TVs and alerts that are more and more and more
[2:54:28.760 --> 2:54:34.760]  and messages and messages and all the big tech watches your text messages or even censoring text messages now.
[2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:37.760]  They admit, I mean, this is all happening, isn't it?
[2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:39.760]  It's very true.
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:43.760]  And there's so much more technology done, you know, what we can go over a segment,
[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:47.760]  but it goes deeper down the rabbit hole, really.
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:54.760]  We need to now stop, we have a window of opportunity where we can stop a horrible dystopian future for ourselves.
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:55:01.760]  And we have the power, we have the ability if we just stood up for ourselves and said no and stand united,
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:06.760]  we can make this stop because there's not that many, those people trying to control the rest of us.
[2:55:06.760 --> 2:55:09.760]  All right, Dr. Monde, I'm going to try to reconnect on Skype.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:11.760]  What you just said is so powerful, it's so true.
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:17.760]  And I know the CIA and other globalist ARPA groups, through business groups, through executive groups,
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:21.760]  introduce what they're planning to roll out later so people feel like they're part of the inside.
[2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:25.760]  Just like we have all these off-camera videos, hot mics of Democrats going,
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:29.760]  we just wear the mask for theater to scare them, come on, wear the mask.
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:31.760]  And so a lot of folks are in on this too.
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:32.760]  It's incredible.
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:33.760]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:36.760]  I want you, Dr. to recap what you just said.
[2:55:36.760 --> 2:55:41.760]  That is amazing.
[2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:08.760]  Good ol' fashion stupidity.
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:10.760]  No more pesky law and order.
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:14.760]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:19.760]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:24.760]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts,
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:29.760]  election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:36.760]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:03.760]  All right.
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:06.760]  You know what Dr. Carey Monday said is absolutely on target.
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:08.760]  This is all social engineering.
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:12.760]  They admit that's what the cell phones are, is social controls that track us and control us,
[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:15.760]  that are watching, listening to us in live time, the home assistance.
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:19.760]  Facebook has a plan where in the future they'll own big buildings along with Amazon
[2:57:19.760 --> 2:57:22.760]  that are like 200 square foot for each person.
[2:57:22.760 --> 2:57:27.760]  Even families are in communal areas where everybody spies on you, everybody tattles on you,
[2:57:27.760 --> 2:57:30.760]  and then they make you accept the new way of life.
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:34.760]  You don't get credits on your digital card unless you sterilize your son,
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:38.760]  or unless you take certain nano tech.
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:42.760]  It's all about social score, you submit to big tech, you submit to big pharma,
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:48.760]  you let them put these things in you, and then you get to have a life at least for a little while.
[2:57:48.760 --> 2:57:51.760]  They have so many robots, so many factories, so many computers.
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:54.760]  They can produce all the food, produce everything now.
[2:57:54.760 --> 2:57:58.760]  They don't need you anymore, but to get you to go along with it, they get you to acquiesce.
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:00.760]  And once you give in to it, it's over.
[2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:05.760]  So, Dr, recap what you said on your Skype's back about Atlanta five years ago,
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:07.760]  how you got brought into this, how it blew you away.
[2:58:07.760 --> 2:58:09.760]  I know the stuff you're talking about is very, very real.
[2:58:09.760 --> 2:58:20.760]  What they described as a allegory for people so that they would accept the social credit score coming into the future.
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:25.760]  Again, her Skype just went down again, this is torturing me, but this, and then she was getting into,
[2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:32.760]  we'll just go phone them, she was getting into, we have this window to say no now.
[2:58:32.760 --> 2:58:33.760]  This is the window.
[2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:35.760]  It's not oh, just wear mask for 15 days.
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:36.760]  Oh, just stay inside.
[2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:38.760]  No, I told you, we're never in.
[2:58:38.760 --> 2:58:39.760]  Now CNN says it never goes back.
[2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:44.760]  You never stop mask, and there's going to be shots, and you will decide on your app when you can go out,
[2:58:44.760 --> 2:58:45.760]  when you can drive.
[2:58:45.760 --> 2:58:52.760]  The mega, the megaopolis videos 10 years ago for Children's TV in the UK said,
[2:58:52.760 --> 2:58:56.760]  you'll be told by your phone when you can go out, when you can have meat, when you can have a job,
[2:58:56.760 --> 2:58:58.760]  when you can marry, you get meat once a year.
[2:58:58.760 --> 2:59:01.760]  This is a total societal takeover plan.
[2:59:01.760 --> 2:59:05.760]  And once they get you Pavlovianly to follow orders on something simple like a mask,
[2:59:05.760 --> 2:59:06.760]  everything else follows.
[2:59:06.760 --> 2:59:14.760]  So, Dr, Kerry, Maude, the time we've got here with you, recap what happened in Atlanta and then talk about that window of opportunity you just discussed.
[2:59:14.760 --> 2:59:23.760]  Yes, just going back over, I don't, I'm not speaking just from a scientific background and researching.
[2:59:23.760 --> 2:59:28.760]  I also attended business meetings where the plan to control people was discussed,
[2:59:28.760 --> 2:59:32.760]  and it was a real plan with a timeline.
[2:59:32.760 --> 2:59:37.760]  And there were people in the big tech world, people that you might see on CNN,
[2:59:37.760 --> 2:59:46.760]  they were in small business owners, and we're serious about trying to modify an augment a group of individuals' behavior.
[2:59:46.760 --> 2:59:52.760]  So, within a city, within a county, within a state, and perhaps, you know, bigger areas than that.
[2:59:52.760 --> 3:00:00.760]  So, they want to control what you say, what you think, how you behave, and you'd have repercussion.
[3:00:00.760 --> 3:00:04.760]  And this would be done through the smart phone, through the health app that you have.
[3:00:04.760 --> 3:00:07.760]  If you look on your health app, you'll find dropdowns.
[3:00:07.760 --> 3:00:15.760]  If you really look at subcategories, it'll tell you how many times you've had sex, how many, well, sure, keep the medicines in your body,
[3:00:15.760 --> 3:00:17.760]  the illicit drugs in your body.
[3:00:17.760 --> 3:00:21.760]  Everything about you is known, your emotions are known.
[3:00:21.760 --> 3:00:28.760]  So, everything that you're doing would be transmitted to your cell phone, which would go into the cloud and some AI connection.
[3:00:28.760 --> 3:00:38.760]  And then, if it wasn't the kind of behavior deemed worthy or good for society, for the good of the whole, there would be repercussions.
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:43.760]  So...
[3:00:43.760 --> 3:00:45.760]  Yeah, and again, I see her do interviews all the time.
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:47.760]  Her skype's being cut off, her phone's being cut off.
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:48.760]  She's not doing this on purpose.
[3:00:48.760 --> 3:00:50.760]  This is the next level of it.
[3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:51.760]  And that's what the Chinese communists say.
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:58.760]  They said, we're in your phones and we will not let you take two steps outside of your house if you don't submit to us.
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:01.760]  And they're now celebrating President Trump being sick.
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:03.760]  They're now celebrating all of this.
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:04.760]  It's nightmarish.
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:06.760]  I want to show you a photo here for TV viewers.
[3:01:06.760 --> 3:01:07.760]  Look at the true face of evil.
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:10.760]  Let's pull up the digital photo on m4s.com.
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:17.760]  Michael Morris's evil genius, Trump, could be lying about having COVID to postpone the election.
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:19.760]  Trump's going to win the election.
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:24.760]  It's Democrats that want to postpone it with mail-in ballots saying months and months and then they'll never be decided.
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:28.760]  So, see, if you have any intelligence you know, Democrats do the mail-in ballots.
[3:01:28.760 --> 3:01:29.760]  They want to lock down.
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:30.760]  They say they're going to contest no matter what.
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:31.760]  They know they're losing.
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:32.760]  They want 20th Amendment.
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:33.760]  That's their plan.
[3:01:33.760 --> 3:01:35.760]  He comes out and says, Trump's fake.
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:36.760]  He's not sick.
[3:01:36.760 --> 3:01:38.760]  He wants to hold off the election.
[3:01:38.760 --> 3:01:39.760]  When that's their...
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:40.760]  Just look at that man.
[3:01:40.760 --> 3:01:42.760]  Would you let him babysit your children?
[3:01:42.760 --> 3:01:45.760]  How about he and Brian Stelter pull up to your house as contact tracers?
[3:01:45.760 --> 3:01:46.760]  Oh, sorry.
[3:01:46.760 --> 3:01:49.760]  You didn't submit to the inoculations we're taking your children.
[3:01:49.760 --> 3:01:59.760]  You know, your children are going to have a good, good time with Uncle Stelter and Uncle Moore.
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:01.760]  Dr. Continuing here, what was it like for you?
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:04.760]  Because I know the CIA, you're saying this is like through CNN.
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:06.760]  They really are like the deep, deep part of that.
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:08.760]  I know people have actually been in similar meetings.
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:13.760]  Lawyers, politicians, others actually ran into a high-level guy today that went ahead and told me a bunch of stuff.
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:16.760]  He's so freaked out.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:17.760]  And I guess you're a good-looking woman.
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:18.760]  You're a medical doctor.
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:19.760]  You're a smart person.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:23.760]  Did you get invited to this to see if you'd buy into it, to see if you'd be a change agent?
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:25.760]  For them, why'd they invite you to this?
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:26.760]  You know, that's...
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:32.760]  I was surprised that I was, and the person that really tried to get me to come, and I finally went.
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:35.760]  I said, why would you ever invite me to that kind of a meeting?
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:37.760]  And they said, well, you'll soon see.
[3:02:37.760 --> 3:02:39.760]  It's either us or them.
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:41.760]  What side do you want to be on?
[3:02:41.760 --> 3:02:43.760]  And I said, well, I'll never be like you.
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:45.760]  I will never think like that.
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:48.760]  And I will never think that way of other people of humanity.
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:53.760]  And I said, do you really think that you will be exempt from this technology because you won't?
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:55.760]  I said, you are foolish to believe.
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:03:00.760]  And as they discussed this plan, people were clapping and standing ovation.
[3:03:00.760 --> 3:03:05.760]  And I definitely was the black sheep there because I was in shock.
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:08.760]  I could not believe what they were suggesting and what the plan was.
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:12.760]  So my point to you is, we have a window of opportunity here.
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:14.760]  And we have the power.
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:15.760]  The people have the power.
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:16.760]  We always have had the power.
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:19.760]  We are amazing, brilliant, cherished beings.
[3:03:19.760 --> 3:03:24.760]  All we have to do is say no and stand up for ourselves and be excited and divided.
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:30.760]  And if we just say no to this tyranny, to this insanity, we can change the world for the better.
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:32.760]  We have the ability to have free energy.
[3:03:32.760 --> 3:03:34.760]  We have the ability for clean energy.
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:37.760]  We have tears for just about anything you think of.
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:38.760]  We have it.
[3:03:38.760 --> 3:03:43.760]  So let's stand together and be united and stop this and stop the mass.
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:50.760]  Stop the poor hands for the, you know, not taking these experimental drugs and vaccines.
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:51.760]  And not there's enough.
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:53.760]  And this is my alarm back to the world.
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:55.760]  Well, doctor, did they make you sign a nondisclosure?
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:03:58.760]  Because a nondisclosure doesn't cover criminal activity anyways.
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:00.760]  I mean, you should come back.
[3:04:00.760 --> 3:04:02.760]  We all try you here in Austin.
[3:04:02.760 --> 3:04:05.760]  No, they did not make me sign it.
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:09.760]  What they did is jammed our phones and we weren't allowed to leave the building and we were busted.
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:12.760]  But I did not sign anything.
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:14.760]  Well, no, that's how this actually works.
[3:04:14.760 --> 3:04:16.760]  You know, this happened to my dad.
[3:04:16.760 --> 3:04:20.760]  The plan wasn't as far along then, but he was top of his class when he was about 15.
[3:04:20.760 --> 3:04:23.760]  And he was already at 16, 15.
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:25.760]  He worked at MD Anderson and some stuff.
[3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:29.760]  And then as an assistant, and then he got advanced to plan to University of Texas.
[3:04:29.760 --> 3:04:37.760]  And they brought him in on it to see only five other students in Texas at the time at that age were brought into that plan at UT.
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:39.760]  And it's pretty much the same thing.
[3:04:39.760 --> 3:04:42.760]  And, you know, they had nuclear reactors nobody knew about.
[3:04:42.760 --> 3:04:45.760]  They had CD-ROMs back in the mid-60s.
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:47.760]  And they were basically telling my dad this.
[3:04:47.760 --> 3:04:48.760]  He decided not to be part of it.
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:53.760]  But they've recruited a lot of people to the technocracy to be the little minion overlords.
[3:04:53.760 --> 3:04:58.760]  The idea is you get all this power of the breakaway civilization that's 10, 20 years ahead of us, 30 years.
[3:04:58.760 --> 3:05:02.760]  But the low-level folks get, you know, five years ahead, like they were doing for you.
[3:05:02.760 --> 3:05:04.760]  And I mean, this is evil.
[3:05:04.760 --> 3:05:06.760]  Is this not diabolical?
[3:05:06.760 --> 3:05:08.760]  It is evil.
[3:05:08.760 --> 3:05:11.760]  And to me, we're not just battling on the physical realm.
[3:05:11.760 --> 3:05:12.760]  It's a spiritual battle, too.
[3:05:12.760 --> 3:05:15.760]  It's a battle for our minds, bodies, and souls.
[3:05:15.760 --> 3:05:22.760]  That is my belief, you know, after studying this and researching this and going to meetings.
[3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:24.760]  I mean, it's, we are in a war.
[3:05:24.760 --> 3:05:25.760]  We are in a battle.
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:27.760]  And we need to stand up for ourselves.
[3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:29.760]  It doesn't have to be that hard.
[3:05:29.760 --> 3:05:30.760]  We wouldn't have to have that.
[3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:35.760]  It wouldn't be really so much force or violence if we just said no and stop.
[3:05:35.760 --> 3:05:37.760]  They need us to consent.
[3:05:37.760 --> 3:05:40.760]  So do not consent to this insanity.
[3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:47.760]  You know, let's stand up for ourselves and finally make this Earth the paradise it was always supposed to be.
[3:05:47.760 --> 3:05:52.760]  Well, listen, I want to fly you to Austin, Texas to be on all our shows and work with us for a week or so.
[3:05:52.760 --> 3:05:55.760]  We've got the time, doctor, during all this craziness.
[3:05:55.760 --> 3:05:57.760]  If you want, come the week after that.
[3:05:57.760 --> 3:05:58.760]  I want to have you in studio.
[3:05:58.760 --> 3:06:02.760]  I want to really hear what you have to say because I know when something's real, I know when it's not.
[3:06:02.760 --> 3:06:07.760]  I know what you were invited into because I know a lot of people that have been, they use media organizations.
[3:06:07.760 --> 3:06:09.760]  They use law enforcement organizations.
[3:06:09.760 --> 3:06:16.760]  They use fraternal groups and they are recruiting people into this technocracy that we now see emerging.
[3:06:16.760 --> 3:06:17.760]  That's what big tech is.
[3:06:17.760 --> 3:06:21.760]  I had a pretty high level Google person meet with me about a year ago here in Austin.
[3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:23.760]  He told me basically the same story.
[3:06:23.760 --> 3:06:27.760]  He was recruited out of college into a similar deal and they can get into your private messages, everything.
[3:06:27.760 --> 3:06:29.760]  It's just a big power trip for them.
[3:06:29.760 --> 3:06:33.760]  So, doctor, Carrie, we really appreciate Dr. Carrie Maday for joining us.
[3:06:33.760 --> 3:06:36.760]  You can find her at serendipitygroup.org.
[3:06:36.760 --> 3:06:37.760]  Serendipitygroup.org.
[3:06:37.760 --> 3:06:39.760]  I'll come back with a final segment of Dr. Dick Baggs.
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:40.760]  Stay with us.
[3:06:40.760 --> 3:06:46.760]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman,
[3:06:46.760 --> 3:06:52.760]  they believe there's too many people on the Earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park,
[3:06:52.760 --> 3:06:54.760]  they have to look at us, the common people.
[3:06:54.760 --> 3:06:57.760]  They have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[3:06:57.760 --> 3:06:59.760]  That's why they love the lockdown.
[3:06:59.760 --> 3:07:04.760]  Putting muzzles on us, that gives them a big thrill, controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[3:07:04.760 --> 3:07:08.760]  Bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns.
[3:07:08.760 --> 3:07:14.760]  All of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender,
[3:07:14.760 --> 3:07:17.760]  which is taking sterilant vaccines day one.
[3:07:17.760 --> 3:07:20.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over.
[3:07:20.760 --> 3:07:21.760]  Playtime's over.
[3:07:21.760 --> 3:07:27.760]  They used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance, and now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:30.760]  You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open.
[3:07:30.760 --> 3:07:32.760]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[3:07:32.760 --> 3:07:34.760]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[3:07:34.760 --> 3:07:39.760]  Identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:45.760]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses,
[3:07:45.760 --> 3:07:53.760]  the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said, nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[3:07:53.760 --> 3:07:55.760]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[3:07:55.760 --> 3:07:59.760]  If you get a lot of sunlight, it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3,
[3:07:59.760 --> 3:08:04.760]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3.
[3:08:04.760 --> 3:08:09.760]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well, that's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter,
[3:08:09.760 --> 3:08:11.760]  because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[3:08:11.760 --> 3:08:17.760]  Now, I've pointed this out, and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope
[3:08:17.760 --> 3:08:19.760]  that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[3:08:19.760 --> 3:08:24.760]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C.
[3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:29.760]  He should have also added zinc, because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[3:08:29.760 --> 3:08:32.760]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality,
[3:08:32.760 --> 3:08:36.760]  because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:42.760]  that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:50.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:08:50.760 --> 3:09:10.760]  All right, I'm Alex Jones, your host, Nick Beggins, is coming up.
[3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:14.760]  Look, humans are attaining secrets of the universe.
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:18.760]  And we're attaining a lot of God-like power, but we're not God.
[3:09:18.760 --> 3:09:23.760]  And you've got a lot of really sick people that have set up national security apparatuses
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:27.760]  around the world to keep the public from having that knowledge.
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:33.760]  And the first thing they do is add fluoride and GMO and electromagnetic radiation,
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:42.760]  and now genetic engineering viruses into ourselves to guinea pig us and reprogram us.
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:49.760]  So when I say that Michael Moore looks like a nightmare pedophile to me,
[3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:53.760]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile. His spirit, though, is a monstrous creature.
[3:09:53.760 --> 3:09:59.760]  Not because he's obese, but because he's obviously a very wicked person.
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:01.760]  It shines through.
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:04.760]  But he wants forced inoculation.
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:11.760]  So he wants to rape you with a genetic material from a big company that has liability protection.
[3:10:11.760 --> 3:10:14.760]  I mean, if you were a child, hypothetically, raped by him,
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:16.760]  you know, he might not be able to give you one of his diseases,
[3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:19.760]  though I'm sure he'd want to if he was that type of creature.
[3:10:19.760 --> 3:10:23.760]  But with these vaccines that are nanotech that reprogram you,
[3:10:23.760 --> 3:10:28.760]  it's the ultimate rape of your genetic code.
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:32.760]  And if someone's trying to rape you with a needle that's got liability protection
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:35.760]  who just so happens to have the hobby of wanting to depopulate the Earth,
[3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:38.760]  you have a right and you have a duty to defend yourself.
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:43.760]  So never forget that. And remember, we've gone off the edge of the cliff here.
[3:10:43.760 --> 3:10:48.760]  Compliance isn't going to get you ahead now.
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:52.760]  This is a nightmare system of the Hollywood scum and the big tech scum
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:56.760]  and the Rockefeller and the Rothschild and all the old money
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:11:02.760]  that are slaves of the dark side and their God wants to kill people
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:05.760]  and they're scared and they're slaves and they're carrying out.
[3:11:05.760 --> 3:11:08.760]  You're like, why would they want to do this? Why are they so evil?
[3:11:08.760 --> 3:11:11.760]  Because they're turned over.
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:13.760]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[3:11:13.760 --> 3:11:18.760]  Plans for continuing government in place after Trump coronavirus diagnosis
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:22.760]  Pelosi in case he dies.
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:25.760]  And everybody's like, oh, you thought it was a hoax.
[3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:29.760]  Trump got it. And even medical doctors are like, most of the tests are false positive.
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:33.760]  Let's check that. But the death thing is low.
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:38.760]  They're testing everybody. I mean, Trump just signed $75 million for more testing.
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:46.760]  In the budget is $7 plus billion to test every American over and over and over again
[3:11:46.760 --> 3:11:48.760]  to have a job. They got the wristbands ready.
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:50.760]  Singapore already rolled them out.
[3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:51.760]  Australia already rolled them out.
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:54.760]  Spain already rolled it out.
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:11:56.760]  Quebec City already rolled it out.
[3:11:56.760 --> 3:11:58.760]  Ohio is trying to roll it out.
[3:11:58.760 --> 3:11:59.760]  And they're on the newsstand.
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:00.760]  We're going to come take your kids.
[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:05.760]  They've got contact tracers that come into man blood in Houston and Atlanta and LA.
[3:12:05.760 --> 3:12:14.760]  I mean, they're they're just building their army of weird little political medical officers that come to your house.
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:16.760]  That Hitler always said it.
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:20.760]  First you get the women on your side, then you got the children.
[3:12:20.760 --> 3:12:22.760]  So follow the men.
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:27.760]  And man, I run into these women of particularly not and they're, I'm wearing my mask.
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:32.760]  Can I go? Well, you know that that type of mask doesn't even protect people on the outside.
[3:12:32.760 --> 3:12:34.760]  That's an M 95 only protects you.
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:35.760]  Oh, really? That's not true.
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:37.760]  They don't care.
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:40.760]  They want to feel good because to them.
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:44.760]  Watching a movie or a video games is as real as walking through the forest.
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:48.760]  Having a baby that's online that's imaginary is the same as having a baby.
[3:12:48.760 --> 3:12:55.760]  The people that it's so soft, so long and are such followers and are so programmed and are so stupid.
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:13:00.760]  It's been to all we have to do is divide ourselves from them now.
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:04.760]  Lovingly talk to them, lovingly give them advice, but then don't be their friends.
[3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:08.760]  Don't work with them because they're going to come and make you take shots.
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:09.760]  They're going to take your kids.
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:14.760]  They're going to make you submit to them.
[3:13:14.760 --> 3:13:17.760]  So you better stop submitting to them.
[3:13:17.760 --> 3:13:21.760]  Yeah, let's play the Pennsylvania State Rep with Governor Wolf.
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:26.760]  She's like, no, no, go ahead and wear your mask up on stage. It's political theater.
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:29.760]  It creates fear. It's how they're the good guys.
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:33.760]  And Trump should be running ads about this instead.
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:34.760]  He's a by the book guy.
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:36.760]  Oh, the medical doctor comes in.
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:37.760]  Oh, you're going to check us for COVID.
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:38.760]  All right, the weekly test.
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:40.760]  Oh, we came up positive.
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:42.760]  Nine times out of 10 with that test.
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:44.760]  It's false positive.
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:46.760]  But oh, now you might have the sniffles.
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:50.760]  Oh, then he'll be a hero and he'll beat it in two weeks to be up there with Biden.
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:55.760]  They've decided to go along with the COVID narrative to take control of it.
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:13:58.760]  I think Trump's staging it. No.
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:00.760]  He can't even trust people around him.
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:01.760]  He isn't that type of guy.
[3:14:01.760 --> 3:14:03.760]  They leaked that instantly.
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:05.760]  No, they've, they've, who knows what they sprayed on him.
[3:14:05.760 --> 3:14:06.760]  Who knows?
[3:14:06.760 --> 3:14:07.760]  He's been exhausted.
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:08.760]  He's 74 years old.
[3:14:08.760 --> 3:14:10.760]  It's psychosomatic.
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:16.760]  It's, it's a emotional response in a lot of cases.
[3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:18.760]  They, you know, they call it a sympathetic response.
[3:14:18.760 --> 3:14:20.760]  I'll explain it again.
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:21.760]  They've done the studies.
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:22.760]  You've all seen it.
[3:14:22.760 --> 3:14:24.760]  One person throws up.
[3:14:24.760 --> 3:14:26.760]  Other people start throwing up.
[3:14:26.760 --> 3:14:28.760]  Like one bird takes off.
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:29.760]  All the birds take off.
[3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:30.760]  It's a sympathetic response.
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:32.760]  I'm not saying that's what happened here.
[3:14:32.760 --> 3:14:34.760]  I'm saying we're not in Kansas anymore.
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:36.760]  As I've said a thousand times.
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:39.760]  Here's the state rep a couple of days ago telling Governor Wolf, hey man,
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:41.760]  wear your mask up on the podium.
[3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:42.760]  It's a political theater.
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:51.760]  Here it is.
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:53.760]  Let's just hit pause for a minute.
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:55.760]  No big deal because I'm not getting audio.
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:14:56.760]  It's not a big deal.
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:14:57.760]  We're live show.
[3:14:57.760 --> 3:14:58.760]  It's fun.
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:14:59.760]  Take a few minutes out.
[3:14:59.760 --> 3:15:00.760]  We'll go back to it in a moment.
[3:15:00.760 --> 3:15:01.760]  All right.
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:06.760]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are working around the
[3:15:06.760 --> 3:15:10.760]  clock to shut this show down and you know that.
[3:15:10.760 --> 3:15:14.760]  And whenever I tell you that that's going on,
[3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:17.760]  I don't just tell you that for no reason.
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:21.760]  So now the president, they say could be COG.
[3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:23.760]  The doomsday planes are in the air.
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:25.760]  The world depressions already started.
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:27.760]  2 million have already starved to death.
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:28.760]  100 plus million could starve to death.
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:30.760]  Now the UN says 200 and something million.
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:32.760]  I mean, they've already dominoed things down.
[3:15:32.760 --> 3:15:34.760]  So you better get ready.
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:37.760]  You got three days left at the best verbal food out there at the lowest price.
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:38.760]  It's already a great deal.
[3:15:38.760 --> 3:15:51.760]  You can get $160 off the three month $300 off the six month $600 off the year and
[3:15:51.760 --> 3:15:52.760]  already at that price.
[3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:54.760]  That is such a massive discount.
[3:15:54.760 --> 3:15:55.760]  No more excuses.
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:15:57.760]  No more procrastination.
[3:15:57.760 --> 3:16:01.760]  People complain because we're only offering a three month supply discounted.
[3:16:01.760 --> 3:16:03.760]  So they came back with this six day deal.
[3:16:03.760 --> 3:16:06.760]  It'll be over on Monday.
[3:16:06.760 --> 3:16:10.760]  Three days, 11 hours, 31 minutes, 42 seconds.
[3:16:10.760 --> 3:16:13.760]  And if you look at it, one year supply, 600 bucks off.
[3:16:13.760 --> 3:16:16.760]  Six months supply, 300 bucks off.
[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:18.760]  Three months supply, 160 bucks.
[3:16:18.760 --> 3:16:20.760]  They've got discounts on water filtration.
[3:16:20.760 --> 3:16:23.760]  They've got discounts on some of the survival items.
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:24.760]  It's a great deal.
[3:16:24.760 --> 3:16:25.760]  Check it out.
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:29.760]  Prepare with Alex.com or triple eight for 110350.
[3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:34.760]  That's triple eight for 110350.
[3:16:34.760 --> 3:16:37.760]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:42.760]  And separately at infowarsstore.com, they have the full selection of food at the lowest
[3:16:42.760 --> 3:16:45.760]  price you're going to find other than those few specials that are right there.

[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:52.760]  Infowars emergency election sales going.

[3:17:16.760 --> 3:17:18.760]  And then Dr. Nick Meggich will take over.
[3:17:18.760 --> 3:17:22.760]  It's a short clip of the state rep with the governor saying it's political theater.
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:24.760]  Keep your mask on for the public.
[3:17:24.760 --> 3:17:25.760]  We'll come in, play that.
[3:17:25.760 --> 3:17:29.760]  Dr. Nick Meggich, who I really appreciate taking over from EarthPulse.com.
[3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:30.760]  EarthPulse.com.
[3:17:30.760 --> 3:17:31.760]  Mark that site.
[3:17:31.760 --> 3:17:32.760]  EarthPulse.com.
[3:17:32.760 --> 3:17:58.760]  Stay with us.
[3:17:58.760 --> 3:18:07.760]  As well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:13.760]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months.
[3:18:13.760 --> 3:18:17.760]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:24.760]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate style.
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:27.760]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com.
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:30.760]  Myself, Alex Jones, David, I know and Troy are covering this heavily.
[3:18:30.760 --> 3:18:37.760]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[3:18:37.760 --> 3:18:40.760]  The Renaissance, the great enlightenment.
[3:18:40.760 --> 3:18:46.760]  It's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny.
[3:18:46.760 --> 3:18:55.760]  That's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are above the law.
[3:18:55.760 --> 3:18:59.760]  The public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:04.760]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[3:19:04.760 --> 3:19:07.760]  That is the post human extremist plan.
[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:10.760]  That is the public ideology of the globalist.
[3:19:10.760 --> 3:19:20.760]  And everything they've built with this high tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[3:19:20.760 --> 3:19:28.760]  And any future generations that happen to strangle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[3:19:28.760 --> 3:19:34.760]  This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation.
[3:19:34.760 --> 3:19:37.760]  Humanity, this is the essence of evil.
[3:19:37.760 --> 3:19:41.760]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[3:19:41.760 --> 3:19:48.760]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence,
[3:19:48.760 --> 3:19:50.760]  is going to be your most valuable asset.
[3:19:50.760 --> 3:19:53.760]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[3:19:53.760 --> 3:20:01.760]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown
[3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:10.760]  is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[3:20:10.760 --> 3:20:17.760]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[3:20:17.760 --> 3:20:19.760]  This is their stated goal.
[3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:28.760]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:30.760]  We turn this around.
[3:20:30.760 --> 3:20:35.760]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[3:20:35.760 --> 3:20:48.760]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[3:21:05.760 --> 3:21:09.760]  So Wendy, I'm going to take my mask off.
[3:21:09.760 --> 3:21:10.760]  I'm going to swap.
[3:21:10.760 --> 3:21:13.760]  I'm waiting so that we can do a little political field.
[3:21:13.760 --> 3:21:16.760]  I'm curious.
[3:21:16.760 --> 3:21:37.760]  So that it's on camera.
[3:21:37.760 --> 3:21:46.760]  And welcome back.
[3:21:46.760 --> 3:21:48.760]  You know what, a while Friday, you know, the Skype issues today with the doctor, you know, listening to all of that.
[3:21:48.760 --> 3:21:51.760]  And the interruptions how convenient, right?
[3:21:51.760 --> 3:21:53.760]  Yeah, we all believe that.
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:22:04.760]  Hey, I want to pick up from where everyone kind of left off on this whole manipulation, really what I would call the maximum of propaganda, right?
[3:22:04.760 --> 3:22:08.760]  I mean, we're talking about controlling behavior.
[3:22:08.760 --> 3:22:10.760]  We're talking about controlling what people think.
[3:22:10.760 --> 3:22:12.760]  We're talking about political correctness.
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:19.760]  Really, all of that, when you stop and think about it, then the feedback device, you know, your cell phone to tell you when you're lying.
[3:22:19.760 --> 3:22:28.760]  You know what, back when Jim Roderick and I wrote Earth Rising the Revolution, you know, this was in 2000, 20 years ago.
[3:22:28.760 --> 3:22:41.760]  And one of the devices that we mentioned there was the toilets where you would use the toilet in a public place and analyze your waste and determine all the drugs you're on, get a little DNA sample.
[3:22:41.760 --> 3:22:44.760]  I mean, your whole profile.
[3:22:44.760 --> 3:22:49.760]  And this was where the technology was headed as we reported it two decades ago.
[3:22:49.760 --> 3:22:50.760]  All right.
[3:22:50.760 --> 3:23:03.760]  And so what the doctor was saying about devices, about instant information about biometrics on this level, this is what the literature said so long ago.
[3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:13.760]  For those that caught last night's coast to coast, I was on with George for a couple hours and we've done a lot of shows over the 18 years.
[3:23:13.760 --> 3:23:23.760]  And we were talking about surveillance technology in terms of its broad implications, which is really, it's not just about surveillance, you know.
[3:23:23.760 --> 3:23:39.760]  And on this program and many others, we've talked about social media and the data collection of that and Google's data collection and Cambridge Analytica and how they feed that back and how the surveillance capitalism system works for
[3:23:39.760 --> 3:23:46.760]  gathering data, feeding it back, selling as garbage we don't need, including politicians we don't want.
[3:23:46.760 --> 3:24:02.760]  You know, but this whole mechanism of gather and feedback, gather and feedback is an amplification loop that also is like the optimum push pull it's designed to jam us into a tunnel and keep us there.
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:11.760]  And then when you look at the rollout on tagging the population with your little code, what is that about?
[3:24:11.760 --> 3:24:20.760]  It's again, another level of commoditizing a human being, making us a piece of meat for consuming until that's inconvenient.
[3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:37.760]  And, you know, when I think about all of this, the dehumanizing of what we are as human beings, which so much of this has done, think of the mass media, think of the programming fed to all of us through television, through all of it, you know.
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:49.760]  And media was set up to design and I was talking about this, you know, from Brave New World, which Alex was talking about earlier in the week, 1984, you know, the guy died in the early 60s.
[3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:51.760]  He wrote it in 1932.
[3:24:51.760 --> 3:24:57.760]  But what everybody forgets is he also wrote Brave New World Revisited, which I believe was 58.
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:24:59.760]  The year was I was born.
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:02.760]  And this was where he went, oh, wow, was I so wrong?
[3:25:02.760 --> 3:25:04.760]  More of an essay, not a storybook.
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:09.760]  And he said, I was so wrong because it's way ahead of where I thought it would be.
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:12.760]  And this is in 1958, 62 years ago.
[3:25:12.760 --> 3:25:29.760]  You know, for goodness sake, this is not an accident, ladies and gentlemen, it was indeed a script and an understanding that is elevated to the point where big tech has been the handmaiden of the intelligence agencies.
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:40.760]  Someone, you know, it was asked of me last night about Epstein, you know, and, and I mentioned Alex, I said, because Alex was talking about this stuff 20 years ago, you know, one of the one of the earlier conversations.
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:42.760]  I remember that we're talking about all this crazy stuff.
[3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:46.760]  And I thought, you know, this is really over the edge, but I, I trust Alex.
[3:25:46.760 --> 3:25:49.760]  I know Alex, you know, and I wait and see was my attitude.
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:56.760]  And as life unfolds and you see all this, you go, if somebody had told me this 20 years ago, would I believe it?
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:25:58.760]  Well, I wouldn't have discounted it.
[3:25:58.760 --> 3:25:59.760]  That's my nature.
[3:25:59.760 --> 3:26:00.760]  And I didn't.
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:08.760]  And now we see it unfold for the same reasons that when you develop your data carefully and then you present it and you go, well, here it is.
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:11.760]  Now, what do I really think was going on there?
[3:26:11.760 --> 3:26:24.760]  I think that was an intelligence operation and Epstein made his money by figuring out a way to extort blackmail national leaders for the benefit of intelligence agencies.
[3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:25.760]  And that's worth a lot of money.
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:29.760]  I mean, think about what a B1 bomber cost, you know, billions of dollars.
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:38.760]  Hey, to pay a guy like that a half a billion bucks or, you know, it seems like a huge amount of money, right? $500 million. Wow.
[3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:47.760]  But if he could extort national leaders in a half a dozen countries, what a cheap investment for a government, right?
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:49.760]  Really think about it from that scale.
[3:26:49.760 --> 3:26:51.760]  It's a cheap investment.
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:27:08.760]  If you look at what's being rolled out on us by technocrats and something that we've been talking about for a quarter of a century, ladies and gentlemen, and not through speculation, but behind me and in all those cabinets are stacks of books and a couple of firearms,
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:14.760]  but stacks of books that are intended to develop knowledge.
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:16.760]  You know, you want to see my stack for this week.
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:19.760]  It's sitting there on the, you know, on the table.
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:30.760]  So the thing about it is, gather the knowledge, digest it and dissect it and then put it out there in a way that we can all look at it together.
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:34.760]  That's what info wars has always been about.
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:36.760]  And sometimes it's way out there.
[3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:39.760]  People go, wow, I got to wait for time to catch up with the truth.
[3:27:39.760 --> 3:27:41.760]  But the fact is it does.
[3:27:41.760 --> 3:27:42.760]  It did.
[3:27:42.760 --> 3:27:43.760]  It has.
[3:27:43.760 --> 3:27:44.760]  It was.
[3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:50.760]  Alex talks about some of the things we were writing back there that myself and my colleagues, we put together.
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:52.760]  And it was like we were predicting the future.
[3:27:52.760 --> 3:28:04.760]  And it's true we were, but not on some esoteric basis, but based on the what they published for goodness sake, and they started calling us aggregators and villainizing us as if that's a bad thing.
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:14.760]  I used to call that investigative journalism and that's what I talked about word games and political correctness and why words are so powerful and how you mix words with emotion.
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:16.760]  You get what's the essence of occult magic.
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:22.760]  And you also get the force of creativity when you mix it all together in the right way, what we're intended to do.
[3:28:22.760 --> 3:28:30.760]  And these transhumanist dehumanizing aspects of what we're being fed with technology is to take that away from us to duplicate it.
[3:28:30.760 --> 3:28:43.760]  And the materialists who don't even know, their view of extending the human consciousness is loaded into an AI system that kind of links us all together and sort of a squishy whatever.
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:51.760]  But they don't understand that consciousness that links us all together is what we are.
[3:28:51.760 --> 3:28:57.760]  And now they want to corrupt our carriers, our bodies with more BS.
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:28:58.760]  They already have.
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:03.760]  They got synthetic food, they got GMO, we got all the garbage they feed us and all the chemicals that are in it.
[3:29:03.760 --> 3:29:06.760]  And here's what I would say about a lot of it.
[3:29:06.760 --> 3:29:13.760]  I've talked about wealth before what it means those four factors you look back on at band.video and see all that.
[3:29:13.760 --> 3:29:24.760]  But the important thing when you start to look at all this is self determination, self sufficiency, sovereignty of the individual, the foundation of this Democratic Republic.
[3:29:24.760 --> 3:29:36.760]  And then from that sovereignty of powerful individuals who recognize what we are and who we are and what we're what we're born into as as a birthright as created human beings.
[3:29:36.760 --> 3:29:41.760]  We begin to actualize in the world in all of our ways and all of our individual ways.
[3:29:41.760 --> 3:29:44.760]  That is the power of it.
[3:29:44.760 --> 3:29:47.760]  We're in it to win it.
[3:29:47.760 --> 3:29:51.760]  We don't have to go and wait for the group to form it already did.
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:30:02.760]  It's called the human race, the human being that was created to do something different with a set of rights that made us unique for 242 years in this country.
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:14.760]  In a way of thinking that was to break the back of the tyranny that we all lived under in every place on the planet.
[3:30:14.760 --> 3:30:15.760]  And that's what we're talking about.
[3:30:15.760 --> 3:30:29.760]  And you're the tip of the spear, we're the tip of the spear together because this is the info war and we are in it to win, to win in the 21st century by recognizing who and what we are and act in that way.
[3:30:29.760 --> 3:30:30.760]  We'll be right back.
[3:30:30.760 --> 3:30:36.760]  This is Dr. Nick Begich and you're listening to info.

[3:31:36.760 --> 3:31:41.760]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[3:31:41.760 --> 3:31:50.760]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[3:31:50.760 --> 3:31:58.760]  They want total corporate power. There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Rollerball with James Cahn.
[3:31:58.760 --> 3:32:02.760]  And it's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[3:32:02.760 --> 3:32:06.760]  And in the book, you have mega corporations that control the planet.
[3:32:06.760 --> 3:32:09.760]  And there are no longer nation states.
[3:32:09.760 --> 3:32:14.760]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[3:32:14.760 --> 3:32:21.760]  If you actually read what the Davos group of the CFR and Dr. Lionel commission say in the year 2020, that is their end game.
[3:32:21.760 --> 3:32:22.760]  That is their goal.
[3:32:22.760 --> 3:32:30.760]  So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people to see us as chattel.
[3:32:30.760 --> 3:32:34.760]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and Communist China as their model.
[3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:36.760]  We must reject it now.
[3:32:36.760 --> 3:32:46.760]  Remember, the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent people all over the world.
[3:32:46.760 --> 3:32:51.760]  The globalists have a plan for total vertical integration.
[3:32:51.760 --> 3:33:00.760]  Absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices, of their control.
[3:33:00.760 --> 3:33:03.760]  But that is only a means to an end.
[3:33:03.760 --> 3:33:13.760]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place, they are on record that they will bring in force inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[3:33:13.760 --> 3:33:20.760]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio and actually give people cancer.
[3:33:20.760 --> 3:33:22.760]  Most cancer is viral.
[3:33:22.760 --> 3:33:26.760]  That's a big secret, but the secret is beginning to come out.
[3:33:26.760 --> 3:33:28.760]  It's even in the associated press.
[3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:37.760]  Remember, all of these banned videos and reports are banned on video, but only you can share them and save humanity.
[3:33:37.760 --> 3:33:41.760]  Introducing Info Wars Life, pure turmeric extract.
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:44.760]  This is taken under the tongue.
[3:33:44.760 --> 3:33:46.760]  It is pure turmeric.
[3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:55.760]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[3:33:55.760 --> 3:34:04.760]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is absorbed by the stomach, so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[3:34:04.760 --> 3:34:09.760]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews.
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:11.760]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:13.760]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:15.760]  Some like bodies better.
[3:34:15.760 --> 3:34:20.760]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more, and they fund the Info War.
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:23.760]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively.
[3:34:23.760 --> 3:34:26.760]  InfoWarsTour.com today, an additional 25% off.
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:29.760]  This is a 360 win.
[3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:32.760]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies.

[3:34:58.760 --> 3:35:08.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Nick Baggage.
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:10.760]  And welcome back.
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:16.760]  You know, I always forget to plug my website, earthpulse.com, e-a-r-t-h-p-u-l-s-e dot com.
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:18.760]  And go there.
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:20.760]  There's a lot of free information there.
[3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:24.760]  There's a link to, it says 50 free videos and what that is.
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:28.760]  It links you right back into what I've been doing on InfoWars for the last couple years.
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:32.760]  And it'll hook you into a chronological list of everything I've been doing.
[3:35:32.760 --> 3:35:36.760]  And if you haven't tuned in before, go back and take a look.
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:38.760]  It's all done by Subject Matter.
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:45.760]  The guys, the people in the team that put together the graphics and all the things that make it work really do a great job.
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:47.760]  So support the InfoWars.
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:50.760]  Look at band.video.
[3:35:50.760 --> 3:35:54.760]  Check out the videos of all the various hosts and various issues.
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:56.760]  And look at earthpulse.com.
[3:35:56.760 --> 3:35:58.760]  I appreciate it when you do.
[3:35:58.760 --> 3:36:06.760]  You know, just thinking about the last segment in terms of this sort of really rushed to push everybody around.
[3:36:06.760 --> 3:36:07.760]  And that's really what it is.
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:15.760]  It's the rush to be pushed around by a bunch of idiots that really have us on a panic party and know exactly what they're doing.
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:17.760]  And here's the thing about panic party.
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:24.760]  When you're in that flight or fight response, if you look at your brain activity under an EEG and examine it,
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:30.760]  what happens is you get these very incoherent brain patterns that are associated with flight or fight, right?
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:31.760]  I mean, that's it.
[3:36:31.760 --> 3:36:38.760]  But when you're in the calm, in other words, when something bad happens and you see it and you recognize it
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:45.760]  and you feel the emotion of it, but you pay attention to the emotion of it, instead of reacting to it, the brain activity is different.
[3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:49.760]  Now, let me say that again, because it's really important.
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:55.760]  When you have an emotion and you recognize whether it's fear or anxiety or any of this, hey, whatever, you know,
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:36:59.760]  whatever the thing is you want to tune down a bit, pay attention to it.
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:01.760]  As soon as you notice it, you actually control it.
[3:37:01.760 --> 3:37:02.760]  That's the secret.
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:03.760]  It's very simple.
[3:37:03.760 --> 3:37:05.760]  But here's the point.
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:13.760]  All of the media and the way it's designed now is to whip you up and keep you pushed with the adrenaline rush
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:21.760]  that keeps your brain activity in an incoherent brain pattern that doesn't allow you to reach a higher state of awareness.
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:29.760]  That's associated with higher order intellectual thinking that allows us as sovereign individuals to make better decisions, right?
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:31.760]  That's how the brain is supposed to work.
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:35.760]  So we have to find the center of the storm when all craziness is all around us.
[3:37:35.760 --> 3:37:37.760]  That's what we're seeing.
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:46.760]  That's what Alex was alluding to, we got to kind of separate ourselves out of the chaos and stand in the calm of who we are
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:51.760]  and then begin to do what we know we can with confidence.
[3:37:51.760 --> 3:37:53.760]  Not what we're afraid of.
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:37:54.760]  That won't work out.
[3:37:54.760 --> 3:37:56.760]  No, there's other people out there doing that part.
[3:37:56.760 --> 3:37:59.760]  Do the part you're confident in.
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:01.760]  That's the secret.
[3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:04.760]  The big secret is that's called faith.
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:06.760]  Do what you know you can do.
[3:38:06.760 --> 3:38:11.760]  And begin to do that in your own way in the calm of it.
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:17.760]  You're always in the calm when you're working in your gift, whatever that is.
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:18.760]  Do that.
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:19.760]  And that'll be all right.
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:26.760]  And know that there's millions of other people doing the same and it never requires millions to change anything.
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:31.760]  It only requires one, taking the right action in the right moment at the right time.
[3:38:31.760 --> 3:38:34.760]  And you don't know who that is and it just might be you.
[3:38:34.760 --> 3:38:40.760]  So do that and we get the game going and it goes a different direction because we're not waiting for a group.
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:48.760]  They can infiltrate or a system they can crash because you can't crash human consciousness.
[3:38:48.760 --> 3:38:50.760]  You cannot crash what we are.
[3:38:50.760 --> 3:38:52.760]  Now, they don't get it.
[3:38:52.760 --> 3:39:03.760]  They think you can embed all that in AI and you can hook it up to a human being and augment the carrier and keep this carrier limping along with your consciousness and it for a while longer.
[3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:05.760]  And yeah, you know, science is pretty good.
[3:39:05.760 --> 3:39:14.760]  You can do a lot of things, but the expiration date for the physical body does kick in and the consciousness checks out.
[3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:17.760]  And so that's the way it goes.
[3:39:17.760 --> 3:39:27.760]  If you believe that and most of us get that, it's hard to come to that sometimes when intellect gets in the way and you've got to develop an intellect that allows you to analyze all that.
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:33.760]  That's a logical conclusion is what you see is what you got.
[3:39:33.760 --> 3:39:47.760]  And here's what I'm worried about more than anything else right now is that using technology to get people to agree on things we don't agree on is not a democracy, not a republic, not anything even close.
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:52.760]  And that's what we're concerned about is how this can be done.
[3:39:52.760 --> 3:39:59.760]  And the simple thing of your device feeding you back, you're lying, you're lying to get you to say something different even though you don't believe it.
[3:39:59.760 --> 3:40:02.760]  See, that's the way you break down the psyche.
[3:40:02.760 --> 3:40:12.760]  That's the way you break down your connection because that little voice in the head that tells you what you need to do gets conflicted when that happens.
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:17.760]  And then you start turning off the voice in the head, which is really your consciousness connection.
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:23.760]  And that's what you should be listening to, your gut, whatever you want to call it.
[3:40:23.760 --> 3:40:27.760]  But this is your connection to really what we are.
[3:40:27.760 --> 3:40:43.760]  And so having said that and to strip it down a little tighter here, these technologies have been designed to gather data, feed it back and manipulate us and worse if they can.
[3:40:43.760 --> 3:40:47.760]  So getting everyone to do something, wear a mask, for example.
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:49.760]  See, this is again, how does a herd react?
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:53.760]  What will happen? Will people start yelling at other people for not wearing their masks?
[3:40:53.760 --> 3:40:55.760]  Yeah, look around.
[3:40:55.760 --> 3:40:59.760]  Man, there are some hysteria going on over this stuff.
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:03.760]  And it's created.
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:09.760]  I referenced another book, The Unreality Creation of All of This.
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:17.760]  And it was a 1989 book, and the book was talking about the unreality industry, about the media, and fake news.
[3:41:17.760 --> 3:41:27.760]  In 1989, about the construct of emotionally driven fake news, what we see being rolled out systematically over 20 years.
[3:41:27.760 --> 3:41:33.760]  The quality of news reporting, the aggregate quality has diminished.
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:37.760]  What's been done in research is phenomenal, what people can do.
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:47.760]  And when you look at good, well-researched books with a third of the book as footnotes of sources that are legitimate, there's some great material.
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:53.760]  And I like books. I like hard copy because it doesn't change online as you decide to re-narrate history.
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:42:01.760]  I like books, printed, document books. They're useful for figuring things out, even now.
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:07.760]  I mean, you can learn anything online, right? If you don't mind sharing everything you're learning with everyone else.
[3:42:07.760 --> 3:42:15.760]  The library used to go into, you could study whatever you want, you could read whatever you want, whatever you want in your head, and it was nobody's business for yours.
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:21.760]  Today, because the way systems are set up, that is not the case.
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:25.760]  All of that information is held by someone else and then utilized.
[3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:31.760]  And that just is simply wrong. It's simply wrong. It's criminally wrong.
[3:42:31.760 --> 3:42:36.760]  It's violation of us. It's raping us. It's kicking in your digital doorway.
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:44.760]  It's all those things and I'm trying to give it the full flavor of what it is because they keep tuning down the lane.
[3:42:44.760 --> 3:42:47.760]  Political correctness, a nice name for lying to yourself.
[3:42:47.760 --> 3:42:56.760]  I mean, get real, ladies and gentlemen. Let's cut through the focus group new word scheme, you know, because that's what they do here.
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:43:02.760]  What happens is they test ideas. They don't work so well, so they reframe them.
[3:43:02.760 --> 3:43:16.760]  They change the narrative. See, we've been talking about this the last several weeks because it's all about a scripted programming that is rolled out so effectively with the mediums everyone so willingly dialed in.
[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:24.760]  My fiance and I have been talking about the children we're finishing up with our last two, right?
[3:43:24.760 --> 3:43:31.760]  They're 14 and 13 and talking about just the value systems they're exposed to right now is horrendous.
[3:43:31.760 --> 3:43:43.760]  And the media that they're plugged into is really nothing but a gulag of sorts.
[3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:53.760]  You know, when you think about how people are trapped in these various aspects of the digital world and you got to jerk them out of there every once in a while and get them out into the wilderness and do something different.
[3:43:53.760 --> 3:44:04.760]  Get them off of the electronics long enough to breathe and do the things children need to do and young kids need to do and maybe even get in a little bit of trouble occasionally that you have to straighten them out with.
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:15.760]  Now's the time to rethink about this in terms of our base values, our independence as individuals. What can we do? What do we need to do?
[3:44:15.760 --> 3:44:22.760]  And can we simplify our lives in ways that give quality back to it? How complicated have we made it?
[3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:28.760]  How much have we bought into the other guy's system that isn't ours and doesn't reflect our values?
[3:44:28.760 --> 3:44:37.760]  And it's time to take it back. One piece at a time because that's how we lost it. That's how we get it back. One piece at a time, one person at a time.
[3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:45.760]  And let's start with ourselves. Let's improve who we are. Let's become stronger information warriors or powerful information warriors.
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:52.760]  And let's change the way we see the world together because we can and we don't have to have their vision in 2020.
[3:44:52.760 --> 3:45:03.760]  Let's get 2020 vision, a 2020 vision for the info warrior for this century, for our great grandchildren who we haven't even probably met yet.
[3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:10.760]  Let's see what we can do with our vision for the future. Let's take it back from the elite.
[3:45:10.760 --> 3:45:17.760]  Let's go into the weekend with a different view of the world, a view that says we can take it back.
[3:45:17.760 --> 3:45:23.760]  And we can do it by being the center of the storm. This is Dr. Nick Beggart. Thanks for being here.
