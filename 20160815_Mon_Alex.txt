[00:00.000 --> 00:14.480]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[00:14.480 --> 00:37.280]  I shot a special report over the weekend detailing the United Nations admission that it is using
[00:37.280 --> 00:44.720]  Islamic migrant invasions of Europe to overthrow Western culture in their own words
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  and then now we have hacked emails of George Soros and by the way that more and more this is coming
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.680]  out of patriots inside the US government we now know that not just the Russians the whole world
[01:01.680 --> 01:06.160]  is against the democrats and soros that have hijacked the United States the world knows that
[01:06.160 --> 01:18.240]  specter the quantum group has hijacked the superpower in the new james bond movie the
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.240]  villain has a private corporation called the quantum group and they admit he's supposed to be
[01:22.240 --> 01:32.720]  George Soros and that film was approved by mi6 mi6 has product placement out telling you
[01:32.720 --> 01:40.720]  George Soros is specter and i'm not saying mi6 is perfect the point is they've been hijacked to a
[01:40.720 --> 01:48.160]  great extent by people like this and all over the world not just citizens but agencies understand
[01:48.160 --> 01:56.640]  how much danger everyone is in just like in the 1942 43 the german general staff turned against
[01:56.640 --> 02:01.360]  hitler because they knew where this was going it wasn't they were even good guys they just
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.480]  didn't want to go off the edge of a cliff and take deutschland with them
[02:10.880 --> 02:18.480]  but now soros group funded opposition research on critics of radical islam and researched how
[02:18.480 --> 02:26.400]  to shut them down and then of course they've got all these leftist publications and groups putting
[02:26.400 --> 02:33.040]  out movies and films demonizing yours truly calling me a racist and saying i'm an islamophobe
[02:33.680 --> 02:40.800]  because as a classical liberal i am against that type of incredible oppression globalist unite
[02:40.800 --> 02:45.600]  right mark reports hillary clinton running mate tim cane dines with george soros son
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.800]  as donald trump rise terrifies world elite in fact we print me that again
[02:50.800 --> 02:59.360]  and we've broken hundreds and hundreds of very very serious stories
[03:01.120 --> 03:07.200]  and whereas they'll persecute a mainstream media reporter or go after a journalist and
[03:07.200 --> 03:11.120]  we've seen record persecution of the press they don't know how to handle info wars because if
[03:11.120 --> 03:17.680]  they come after me it will just certify and embolden and emblazoned and highlight everything
[03:17.680 --> 03:24.880]  i've ever said or done because they know what i'm saying is so accurate because it's from their
[03:24.880 --> 03:31.120]  own white papers that if they ever put more attention on what we're doing here it is basically
[03:31.120 --> 03:35.920]  the death star plans and then we can blow the death star up politically that's an allegory
[03:35.920 --> 03:39.040]  obviously for the new york times before they say i believe there's really a death star
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.280]  so we already have the plans we're just sitting here with them made films written countless
[03:45.280 --> 03:51.360]  articles had countless guests on documenting the battle plan and folks are listening not
[03:51.360 --> 03:56.320]  just the general public but people all over the world and intelligence agencies private groups
[03:56.320 --> 04:06.000]  you name it the floodgates are basically open where we're getting intel that time and time
[04:06.000 --> 04:14.480]  again turns out to be dead on accurate on what's really going on inside this globalist takeover
[04:14.480 --> 04:22.000]  and i got information this morning that i'm still processing mentally and it comes from a good source
[04:24.640 --> 04:29.600]  that was doing diplomatic detail security
[04:32.560 --> 04:39.200]  for someone even above soros being brought in to meet with hillary and this guy was shooting
[04:39.200 --> 04:45.280]  his mouth off just right there in front of the security people and they could not believe what
[04:45.280 --> 04:50.640]  they heard and that's what's so scary man these globalists are arrogant they and they were talking
[04:50.640 --> 05:10.000]  about staging a false flag on hillary a false assassination on hillary and blaming it on trump
[05:21.360 --> 05:25.920]  university of michigan which also states quote home buying has become particularly dependent
[05:25.920 --> 05:31.280]  on low interest rates with net references to low interest rates spontaneously mentioned by 48 percent
[05:31.280 --> 05:36.800]  this figure has been exceeded in only two months in the past 10 years in english low rates may rise
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.840]  soon if the fed changes its tune so buyers want to take advantage of the rates now rates are low
[05:41.840 --> 05:46.560]  but not housing prices quote low housing prices were cited by just 25 percent according to the
[05:46.560 --> 05:51.360]  survey is released the lowest figure in 10 years this is starting to create a dissonance of sorts
[05:51.360 --> 05:56.720]  in americans little do many of them know a bubble is set to burst and what's to come is yet the worst

[08:19.600 --> 08:26.320]  surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism they have gotten the political
[08:26.320 --> 08:32.880]  establishment and the media establishment to become pure wanton henchmen of totalitarianism
[08:32.880 --> 08:39.600]  if you were a foreign power looking to weaken america you couldn't do better than hillary clinton's
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.480]  economic agenda i think what the chinese have done is really smart the skyscrapers went up in
[08:46.480 --> 08:53.040]  beijing and many other cities around the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled
[08:53.040 --> 09:00.320]  right here in detroit it's all training us to accept less lowering expectations a post industrial
[09:00.320 --> 09:06.240]  world a new dark age that's what the un biological diversity assessment 1996 calls for when we
[09:06.240 --> 09:14.480]  abandoned the policy of america first we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.520]  not a world wednesday gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger a world that gets
[09:19.520 --> 09:27.120]  uglier and stupider and more stunting that the government should allow hillary clinton to become
[09:27.120 --> 09:32.640]  president of the united states of order for uh hillary clinton well i voted for hillary i guess
[09:32.640 --> 09:37.520]  i have to since i'm working for her as well you want an image of the future winston it's a boot
[09:37.520 --> 09:42.960]  stopping on a human face forever muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.720]  whatsoever to do with terrorism women are treated discriminated against in all of these
[09:48.720 --> 09:54.240]  countries she took money against gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely they're
[09:54.240 --> 09:59.360]  mistreated uh she claims to be their champion don't look at me when sin see the black circles
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.000]  around my eyes and see how ugly and weak i am expressing myself and dying that i torture people
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.800]  18 hours a day and i'm a part of the life that's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of
[10:08.800 --> 10:15.120]  power ripping apart humanity we're here to hurt humans we're here to suck your guts out we now
[10:15.120 --> 10:24.240]  take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance a lot of extreme
[10:24.240 --> 10:31.120]  things are happening in america george soros the roth child's the big ford foundation combines
[10:32.480 --> 10:39.840]  are openly fomening racial division and division between men and women in every form of divide and
[10:39.840 --> 10:49.680]  conquer balkanization we have the pump being primed for civil unrest across the country a
[10:49.680 --> 10:58.400]  second night of violence in milwaukee wisconsin with trump set to speak outside milwaukee tomorrow
[10:58.400 --> 11:10.080]  we have major western governments run by the same foundations that i just mentioned
[11:11.440 --> 11:21.760]  openly financing media operations against those that warn of the invasion of radical islam
[11:21.760 --> 11:31.360]  we're going to be breaking that down today and then they tell us as they try to undermine society
[11:31.360 --> 11:40.480]  and civilization that could solidate control as george soros goes around the world in more than
[11:40.480 --> 11:54.800]  30 countries he's helped crash in the last 50 years they lecture us that we're extremist because
[11:54.800 --> 12:01.120]  we use rhetoric like well of the courts ban all the guns the declaration of independence says we
[12:01.120 --> 12:09.840]  have a right and duty to defend ourselves against this they call that extreme the truth is promoting
[12:11.600 --> 12:18.960]  grassroots movements to randomly go out and shoot police officers firefighters and random citizens
[12:18.960 --> 12:34.080]  is the essence of what i would term 21st century red terror we're going to be getting to the
[12:34.080 --> 12:40.160]  situation in milwaukee we're going to be sending jacari jackson and rob do and others up there as
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.800]  we speak today they're getting ready to go now and they're also going to be covering the trump
[12:44.800 --> 12:51.040]  rally coming up tomorrow night as well so we'll have live feeds of all of that for you obviously
[12:51.920 --> 12:57.280]  we've got the nightly news coming up tonight seven o'clock central time we're going to be going over
[12:58.080 --> 13:07.040]  the latest clips that are simply amazing there's one lady on tape saying hey idiots don't burn down
[13:07.040 --> 13:15.200]  our neighborhoods go burn down the suburbs and i've got to actually say she's got a point
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.800]  if some cop you think wrongly killed a member of your family
[13:23.840 --> 13:29.920]  wouldn't you go after that individual and i'm not even advocating that i'm just saying hypothetically
[13:29.920 --> 13:36.240]  why would you randomly as i've said many times if a cop has something wrong in louisiana you think
[13:36.240 --> 13:43.520]  you go kill five cops in dalis or cops do something bad in chicago so you go kill cops
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.920]  in oakland and how the media always makes it racial i mean this is a black cop the guy reportedly
[13:51.920 --> 13:57.680]  is running around waving a gun he shoots him it's in the middle of the night and then it
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.680]  turns into all these riots with white people being drugged out of their cars and beaten
[14:01.680 --> 14:06.880]  and then just a few days ago i didn't play this clip because i'm not trying to demonize
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.320]  black lives matter they do it for themselves totally sorrows run on record they're blocking
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.040]  a road there's a black lady in a car and she accidentally bumped somebody so they start shooting
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.440]  at her in the car it's just crazy
[14:21.440 --> 14:32.320]  but i i mean i don't want to just sit here and make fun of all this because it is really stupid
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.120]  because it's so serious at the end of the day but it does have a humor element to it in fact
[14:38.640 --> 14:44.080]  let me get to the trump news first and then i'm going to get into all of the latest developments
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.600]  around the country with the justice department caught inside these groups using psychological
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.600]  warfare techniques to hype up all these young people and the mtv gangster culture in the 90s
[14:55.600 --> 15:02.560]  that was on record to weaponize these communities the hip hop culture weaponized by mtv has been
[15:02.560 --> 15:09.120]  exported worldwide and mutates the culture of anybody it hits whether it's russians or appellation
[15:09.120 --> 15:17.680]  whites uh or chinese school kids and the chinese abandoned and the communists won't let it in their
[15:17.680 --> 15:28.560]  country and it's just all a culture about being a thug never amounting to anything all or nothing
[15:31.040 --> 15:34.320]  you can really see what the globalists are doing with their weaponized media
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.240]  and just remember that when you're watching something like the olympics i was watching the olympics
[15:40.240 --> 15:50.320]  a few nights ago during phelps's final race i mean how how couldn't you it is interesting
[15:53.520 --> 16:00.400]  and there was a bowing ad during it but we've looked all bunch of us online if somebody's
[16:00.400 --> 16:07.920]  got a dvr please put it on youtube or send it to us where it says bowing a mechanical company or a
[16:07.920 --> 16:14.160]  technology company we're both and the family's coming to visit bowing and they go in and it's
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.960]  the mother the father and what looks like about their 16 year old son he doesn't look quite right
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.960]  though and then they go to her and she's an engineer working on the plane she's got a wrench
[16:24.960 --> 16:33.280]  in her hand you know got classic mail uh job and they say so you're engineering but you're also
[16:33.280 --> 16:39.760]  technology she's like yes it all meshes together and so the son keeps repeating things and saying
[16:39.760 --> 16:46.240]  things and comparing things to that like fish and water and things like that and starts making
[16:46.240 --> 16:49.760]  a bunch of stupid statements and the family's trying to get him to shut up and then and then
[16:49.760 --> 16:55.920]  the dad finally tells him look shut up and everybody has a laugh and then you realize it was totally
[16:55.920 --> 17:03.920]  near subliminal but wasn't he was autistic and it's like it's okay almost all your son soon
[17:03.920 --> 17:09.040]  will be autistic your daughter can be the man in the future and it was so subliminal
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.760]  i mean it was right there of your conscious and watching it but it didn't even click for me to the
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.640]  end i was like what's going on with this and they were celebrating the brain damage son
[17:18.640 --> 17:26.080]  in our face and by the way i told you a year before they admitted it that that green police
[17:26.080 --> 17:30.800]  ad for out east on the super bowl five six years ago was guaranteed financed by government because
[17:30.800 --> 17:34.640]  it was this it was the green police uniforms it was the real green police operations they're
[17:34.640 --> 17:40.240]  starting in australia and other areas it was all real it just wasn't here yet arresting people for
[17:40.240 --> 17:46.000]  their hot tub being too hot or their house being too cold or having the wrong batteries or you know
[17:46.000 --> 17:53.200]  the wrong emissions test a checkpoint and then the mayor of san francisco came out the san
[17:53.200 --> 17:58.160]  francisco chronicle and bragged that they got international funding and government funding
[17:58.160 --> 18:02.480]  and that that was to condition the public and shot his mouth off in san francisco chronicle
[18:02.480 --> 18:10.960]  understand folks i guarantee you that that was probably department of education funded because
[18:10.960 --> 18:16.240]  they want to see what they do is when you start getting 3 000 percent increases in breast cancer
[18:16.240 --> 18:20.080]  in women in every industrialized nation and then countries that don't have glyphosate just don't
[18:20.080 --> 18:26.640]  have it basically i must keep the breakfast too important what they do is they have to normalize
[18:26.640 --> 18:31.280]  it and make it interesting like getting breast cancers like part of the club kind of like gay men
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.840]  that since the 80s want to get hiv because then they're part of the club called bug chasers the fact
[18:35.840 --> 18:43.440]  and so subliminally but also then ratchet it up you never want to find a cure or you're always
[18:43.440 --> 18:47.440]  claiming you want to find the cure but but you never want to find the real cure that is what's
[18:47.440 --> 18:52.720]  causing it the skyrocket you just want to find quote treatments for it and call them cures but
[18:52.720 --> 18:57.600]  but never find out why it's skyrocketing even though it's been known that that glyphosate
[18:57.600 --> 19:09.040]  grows breast tumors and grows prostate tumors just absolute fact they knew before they approved it
[19:09.040 --> 19:09.280]  so
[19:13.280 --> 19:19.120]  no that's not the ad i spent like hours trying to find this weekend but but again it's all part
[19:19.120 --> 19:23.600]  of the same thing it's always a woman that's the engineer in every star wars the the the the
[19:23.600 --> 19:27.600]  woman's the top general and the woman's the top hero and the woman's this and the woman's the top
[19:27.600 --> 19:32.000]  villain and the and the woman the woman the woman and again i'm not against women being shown in
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.560]  roles like that except that it's force fed and it's done for a reason but i'm gonna get to that
[19:36.560 --> 19:43.280]  the moment then i'm gonna get into trump but people have to understand the bombardment
[19:44.240 --> 19:48.640]  is everywhere it doesn't matter if it's cbs or nbc it doesn't matter if it's entertainment or news
[19:48.640 --> 19:54.720]  doesn't matter what fortune 100 corporation it is it's all unified and they meet in big boardrooms
[19:54.720 --> 19:58.560]  which they don't even hide and decide how are we going to condition the public
[19:58.560 --> 20:04.880]  to accept implantable microchips this was in 1999 and wash tech a magazine of the wash and post
[20:05.680 --> 20:10.640]  actually had one of these tech developers there saying well we just met in chicago last month
[20:10.640 --> 20:16.320]  and we're going to push in the media body modification to get everyone ready for chips
[20:16.320 --> 20:20.720]  now i'm not against body modification if you want to do that yourself the point is
[20:20.720 --> 20:26.000]  all the studs and the earrings and all the all the all these things were suddenly pushed by the
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.920]  media they weren't popular 16 17 years ago like they are now and it was all pushed to just get
[20:31.920 --> 20:40.000]  you ready and and they said they were going to do it it's not my opinion so that's what i'm getting
[20:40.000 --> 20:47.760]  at here is that the breast cancer example they have a run for breast cancer or buy a pink vodka
[20:47.760 --> 20:54.800]  for breast cancer or raise awareness or have a license plate and and feel bad about it and
[20:54.800 --> 20:59.360]  you know be part of the community and then just get normalized to it that it's normal
[20:59.360 --> 21:06.560]  and then they have images there of where it makes it fun that the sun is autistic
[21:06.560 --> 21:13.200]  and he gets slapped down and dad tells him shut up but it's okay we've got a daughter
[21:14.320 --> 21:21.360]  isn't that sweet we've got a daughter men are stunted men are retarded men have autism
[21:21.920 --> 21:31.200]  because they're targeted men can't produce men can't provide for 50 years started in about the 60s
[21:31.200 --> 21:38.320]  they started making dad's quirky dad's weird no longer in charge strong types
[21:39.760 --> 21:44.800]  which then men would look at and try to act like which is what biologically humans are supposed
[21:44.800 --> 21:48.960]  to operate like what women are looking for no matter what they tell you every scale shows women
[21:48.960 --> 21:52.880]  are more unhappy than they've ever been since the mid 1950s going straight down
[21:52.880 --> 22:02.800]  and they incrementally now every major father figure is a mindless idiot total buffoon
[22:02.800 --> 22:07.520]  who can't do anything right and is lazy and stupid and cheating and sitting on the couch
[22:07.520 --> 22:14.400]  farting unless they're a liberal guru a priest type person i don't mean a literal priest but
[22:14.400 --> 22:20.960]  you know priest type who is guruing everyone to be more liberal and henpecking folks to follow
[22:20.960 --> 22:26.800]  globalism socialism and you know he's a gay pastor that marries gay men or whatever
[22:26.800 --> 22:32.240]  you know then then it's okay to have a man in a leadership role but only when they're super
[22:32.240 --> 22:38.160]  hero liberal and then hollywood admits this is their agenda they're not even hiding it
[22:38.880 --> 22:43.920]  and then i have to have debates with people about gamer gay did it exist they admit it existed
[22:43.920 --> 22:49.920]  and the point is it's they're taking down human civilization
[22:52.560 --> 22:58.800]  they're ending humans as we know it we are obsolete the globalists have stated it so first
[22:58.800 --> 23:04.160]  they have to just get us totally atomized broken up where nobody even knows what's going on where
[23:04.160 --> 23:09.120]  everyone's totally confused where women are marching around thinking they're supposed to be the bosses
[23:09.120 --> 23:16.000]  all the time because they're a woman 60 percent in england at 65 percent they're pushing and
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.960]  admitting they want 80 women college graduates because men are bad and need to be made to be
[23:24.320 --> 23:29.680]  a subservient class implying that's what women always were but again it's not like some women
[23:29.680 --> 23:35.760]  we love you we're putting you in charge this is horrible wicked evil ancient twisted men
[23:35.760 --> 23:42.720]  women running a long term program laughing at everyone while they hit women with hardcore
[23:42.720 --> 23:50.800]  chemical weapons and gmo trash and then they know that women want to shelter and love their
[23:50.800 --> 23:57.680]  sons and daughters but then they have to create kind of a sick subliminal joke that it's okay
[23:57.680 --> 24:03.120]  it's kind of fun to celebrate by the way there's a lady i'm going to report on who's won six gold
[24:03.120 --> 24:09.040]  medals i think more than anybody ever they're saying uh for shooting you see almost no coverage
[24:09.040 --> 24:17.200]  about her no one even really knows her name because she's a woman you only show the fantasy
[24:17.200 --> 24:24.640]  rogue one leading everyone because there's all the other messages in it to prime women to think
[24:24.640 --> 24:31.120]  they don't need men in their lives and to prime women in the final phase to be in the military
[24:31.120 --> 24:39.360]  but only to operate the switches and the systems of the technocracy this is the phasing out of humans
[24:41.520 --> 24:43.840]  and they're phasing out the atomic family
[24:48.240 --> 24:54.640]  black americans under oppression in many areas of the country were developing more wealth
[24:54.640 --> 25:02.240]  than the blue collar and even middle class white areas and that sort of creating real racism and
[25:02.240 --> 25:08.320]  real uh jealousy i'm not defending the segregation that was there but the point was what doesn't
[25:08.320 --> 25:15.200]  kill you makes you stronger the statistics don't lie lower illegitimacy rate than in the white community
[25:17.840 --> 25:19.680]  within one decade
[25:19.680 --> 25:28.480]  of the democrats putting in their great society the numbers surpassed whites and then depending
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.120]  on where you are in the country 75 percent is about the average some areas upwards of 90 percent
[25:33.120 --> 25:40.720]  no men in the households how'd it work out not having men around then you give the men an arrested
[25:40.720 --> 25:46.240]  development gangster thug culture to say this is how you're a man you didn't have a daddy the gang
[25:46.240 --> 25:53.280]  leaders your daddy basic psychology the globalists know how to lead people they know how to lead you
[25:53.280 --> 25:57.920]  right into hell and everything you've seen done in the black community is now being duplicated
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.760]  in every quote community even though the communities are all integrated basically
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.400]  and men that are in the upper crust no matter what color they are just kind of hide in their
[26:08.400 --> 26:12.480]  corporate job and go play golf and kiss other men's butts that are above them and then and then
[26:12.480 --> 26:18.240]  follow their orders to bring in women to to to be the new servant class okay sir you're just like
[26:18.240 --> 26:23.680]  IBM engineers will bring in Indian engineers who'd be paid a third to replace them but the truth is
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.440]  it's not creating women it's some new superclass it's getting rid of the entire structure like taking
[26:29.440 --> 26:38.960]  doors off of a submarine how did it do for Mexican culture driving more than 30 million farmers in
[26:38.960 --> 26:45.920]  the last 40 years off of their lands with taxes and regulations in mexico how'd that work out from
[26:45.920 --> 26:53.040]  mexico it's got the most hellish city on earth mexico city the civilization has completely
[26:53.040 --> 27:01.040]  collapsed and then what's left of the farmers have to run here to try to engage in what they
[27:01.040 --> 27:08.160]  were engaging in a few generations ago this is the scientific takedown of humanity ladies and
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.680]  gentlemen and i consider talk about donald trump and talk about what's happening up in milwaukee
[27:13.680 --> 27:20.480]  and and and you laugh at the just flaming racist uh trashy dumb down people
[27:24.480 --> 27:31.120]  except i can barely keep the world from getting control of my kids myself i mean this is so
[27:31.120 --> 27:35.840]  scientific i don't know i'm actually there and laugh at people that have been absolutely
[27:35.840 --> 27:40.160]  psychologically destroyed i don't take any pleasure in it
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.800]  god look what they've done to humanity it's just and and and we already have our own problems
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.280]  but they just grease the skids for every form of evil every form of corruption they just open
[27:53.280 --> 27:58.320]  the door up and they make sure all the machinery is real nice and then they have george soros and
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.960]  obama and hillary lead black people into their new national movement and they notice the just
[28:04.960 --> 28:09.520]  department always picked where there were seven or ten black witnesses that the guy was charging
[28:09.520 --> 28:14.080]  the police and attacking or the guy had a gun or the guy was on top of somebody beating them they
[28:14.080 --> 28:21.840]  always choose the cases that are the worst to make you look like idiots in their whole
[28:21.840 --> 28:26.960]  class of civilizations and i have to sit here and watch all this unfold it makes me sick you know
[28:26.960 --> 28:32.960]  i've learned so much about how stuff works that as soon as i heard trump come out and start saying
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.600]  that he's setting up a national movement
[28:40.080 --> 28:42.320]  to have integrity in elections and have poll watchers
[28:44.160 --> 28:47.360]  i knew that was coming from him and i knew some of his other advisors didn't like it
[28:48.240 --> 28:54.320]  because i know the inside baseball and i and for two days you can't find it on the website you

[33:28.320 --> 33:35.360]  and 27 minutes left we have a lot of big guests joining us former high-level secret service agent
[33:35.360 --> 33:41.280]  and bonjino is going to be coming on the show we were already setting him up last week after he
[33:41.280 --> 33:48.240]  tore don lemon the pieces uh dealing with his attack on donald trump and the second amendment
[33:49.440 --> 33:54.000]  he's not coming on today and he's not the source of our secret service information
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.680]  and concerning hillary having all these health problems okay uh he's coming on to talk about
[33:59.680 --> 34:04.160]  other issues every time we say we have some big secret service news he gets a bunch of
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.320]  threatening phone calls even though it's on record that he's not our source on these things
[34:08.320 --> 34:17.440]  he has says that what we cover dealing with uh hillary uh well he just leaves it at this
[34:17.440 --> 34:22.560]  it's worse than we say that's what other former secret service agents have said who've been on
[34:22.560 --> 34:32.720]  air with us as well we ran into secret service obviously in cleveland they said in a few weeks
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.360]  through an individual we will give you some information and it was basically just confirming
[34:37.360 --> 34:42.000]  what we already know she was in a hospital for almost a year she had a bunch of brain surgeries
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.680]  folks they've kept her medical record secret she looks like hell she's clearly having these little
[34:47.680 --> 34:55.280]  petite mall seizures she is having to be helped upstairs and we were told they'd had to retrofit
[34:55.280 --> 34:59.520]  the vehicles basically with the handicap systems that lower to the ground and then it rises back
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.960]  up because she can't go up steps uh and that they think a big announcement's coming soon
[35:05.920 --> 35:13.280]  then we got other information i mean i have sources that guarded hillary clinton
[35:13.280 --> 35:18.480]  for years when she was in the state department i have sources that guarded her sometimes for
[35:18.480 --> 35:26.800]  just three days and these are serious real people because i'm trusted i'm told this information
[35:26.800 --> 35:32.880]  how she treats people what she does how she behaves and she's definitely a weirdo
[35:32.880 --> 35:41.360]  and some of it is so crazy i don't even want to say it on air it just sounds unbelievable
[35:43.280 --> 35:48.800]  and some of these people are folks that you know could show you photos of them with hillary
[35:51.280 --> 35:56.960]  and we got information today through bigs and one of his contacts that's confirmed
[35:56.960 --> 36:05.440]  him the bigs knows well that they were bringing somebody to meet with hillary just recently
[36:05.440 --> 36:10.000]  and man they were talking about staging an assassination attempt on hillary
[36:12.720 --> 36:16.160]  notice this stuff's all too hot to handle they don't show up here and try to arrest us for
[36:16.160 --> 36:19.200]  leaking stuff they don't they don't do that because they know it's too dangerous
[36:20.400 --> 36:22.480]  they don't want this coming out they don't want this getting attention
[36:22.480 --> 36:28.400]  where's the mainstream media attacking me i mean i'm saying i've made up a leak from
[36:28.400 --> 36:33.840]  the secret service where is it because they know good and well it's not made up over an msnbc
[36:39.200 --> 36:44.640]  all right i i want to compose myself and by compose myself i need a laser beam focus and
[36:44.640 --> 36:47.120]  get through a bunch of this news because there's so much of it that's so important
[36:47.120 --> 36:54.560]  and before i do that let me just get to the point i was making earlier we need to help
[36:54.560 --> 37:02.320]  donald trump sign up american citizens to be poll watchers across the united states but
[37:02.320 --> 37:08.560]  especially in the battleground states like ohio pennsylvania florida and others trump's internal
[37:08.560 --> 37:13.680]  polling shows and this is real polling they're doing with top scientific poll groups to really
[37:13.680 --> 37:18.560]  try to see where they're at is that trump is ahead in all these battleground states five
[37:18.560 --> 37:24.880]  to 10 to 12 points florida it's like 12 points they do poll after poll show in 10 12 13 points
[37:25.680 --> 37:31.440]  he's dead heat in california they say she's like 15 points ahead there he's ahead five six points
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.440]  seven points spinning on the poll in new york this is big he goes to democrat areas and the
[37:37.440 --> 37:42.240]  20 000 people show up most of them registered democrats he got more people to vote for him in
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.120]  the primaries than in all republican history and that was running against 12 13 other people
[37:48.560 --> 37:55.680]  this is big and trump knows the only way they're going to win is fraud and i have advised i'll just
[37:55.680 --> 38:01.280]  leave it at that the strategy that you see taking place right now which is just a common sense strategy
[38:03.120 --> 38:06.720]  now i know there are some people in the campaign that think this is a waste of time
[38:06.720 --> 38:12.880]  was it a waste of time when he challenged that they were stealing primaries from sanders and he
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.440]  they had to give him back to trump because he contested it sanders didn't contest it it's like
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.760]  they call a bad play you go hey i want instant replay remember the old days you had to ask
[38:21.760 --> 38:26.160]  for instant replay that's what we're saying we're going to have instant replay on this
[38:27.040 --> 38:32.000]  there's gonna be a lot of eyeballs on it now for two days since he called for a nationwide
[38:32.000 --> 38:39.920]  movement for people to get organized and it was all over the news i have been looking on the website
[38:39.920 --> 38:46.240]  and it took me over a day to find it nowhere on the front page can you find it at donaldjtrump.com
[38:47.600 --> 38:52.400]  so we finally found out how to do it and we shot a video of us searching on the web to show you
[38:52.400 --> 39:02.320]  how to do it you go to donaldjtrump.com and then after that you put in a url lp so.com forward slash
[39:03.520 --> 39:14.400]  lp to the end of the url okay then you have to scroll down past we will destroy ices when
[39:14.400 --> 39:19.280]  a dinner with donald trump i mean you think this stuff shouldn't be hidden together we are going to
[39:19.280 --> 39:25.840]  make america great again number four get america working again none of this can be found for the
[39:25.840 --> 39:30.240]  front page so i'm doing trump a favor here he doesn't have real war gaming when it comes to
[39:30.240 --> 39:34.960]  fighting election theft he doesn't have real war gaming when it comes people pulling clips of
[39:34.960 --> 39:41.520]  democrat saying you try to take my gun i'm gonna kill you like joe biden said to to show how his
[39:41.520 --> 39:50.000]  statement is is is is mild we're doing the real campaign research you know weaponization here
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.040]  okay and and and the point is never wait for orders from headquarters go to the sound of the guns
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.480]  so after you've gone through all of those down to number five you click on volunteer to be a
[40:02.480 --> 40:08.640]  trump election observer and that's where you do it and they are organizing it and and and and and
[40:08.640 --> 40:13.840]  they're going to push for this and this is one of trump's main initiatives but there are some people
[40:13.840 --> 40:19.760]  in the campaign who aren't bad but their heads are so in the establishment that they just always
[40:19.760 --> 40:26.240]  want to go with the same system before trump won the primaries away nobody else has ever done it
[40:26.240 --> 40:30.720]  trump's been right along his instincts are correct he doesn't need to back off he needs to get more
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.160]  aggressive which by the way he's been doing taking the gloves off putting brass knuckles on
[40:36.160 --> 40:42.240]  time for the dragon to breathe fire it's time to really nail these people and he's coming out talking
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.320]  about how ill she is he's coming out talking about what liars they are and how he's running against
[40:46.320 --> 40:52.160]  the media not even against crooked hillary he's running against the establishment and then it's
[40:52.160 --> 40:56.000]  a referendum on that it's not even about donald trump and politico makes a joke out of that
[40:57.600 --> 41:02.480]  people ask for a champion you've got one what he's doing is amazing they create this background
[41:02.480 --> 41:07.200]  chatter though that's not the case we're also going to send out the url people are saying hey
[41:07.200 --> 41:13.760]  just give us the url but it's hard to do that on radio when the url is so long so we're going to

[42:05.280 --> 42:10.160]  out a snippet of the show right now explaining all this to everyone that is a member of the info
[42:10.160 --> 42:18.480]  wars insider it's free info wars dot com forward slash newsletter but you see stuff like this months
[42:19.280 --> 42:24.080]  almost impossible to find out how to get a dinner with donald trump almost impossible to find out
[42:24.080 --> 42:34.480]  any of this stuff okay if that isn't sabotage it might as well be it's an idiot savant of sabotage
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.480]  so i have to know there's a certain people in trump campaign that pull their hair out
[42:44.080 --> 42:50.880]  that donald trump is talking about rigged elections that donald trump is talking about
[42:50.880 --> 42:55.280]  hillary's health that you know that donald trump is getting on all these issues that's what's making
[42:55.280 --> 43:00.560]  him win in the past and here's a newsflash he is ahead in all the battleground states in internal
[43:00.560 --> 43:05.360]  scientific polling and by the way even bloomberg's come out and admits that and has another article
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.960]  admitting that he is in a dead heat nationally with hillary people say why would bloomberg be
[43:10.960 --> 43:16.160]  putting on an accurate poll because they're a business journal and want to actually have people
[43:16.160 --> 43:21.200]  that want to read them for real info now some of their polls because i've looked at the methodology
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.320]  are scams but still they want to know and do put out polls where they want to gauge what's
[43:26.320 --> 43:29.680]  really happening that's why you'll see one scientific poll where he's ahead and then one
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.000]  where he's in a dead heat in other words 15 behind because they add again 15 percent more
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.880]  democrats into many of these polls i mean this is real simple what they're doing but they create
[43:38.880 --> 43:43.840]  this bandwagon with all these followers and all these empty people that some have even seen are like
[43:43.840 --> 43:49.120]  like i was for trump but hillary's getting in because he's really screwing up because the media
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.880]  says oh he screwed up again saying that hillary's gonna pack the courts and take our guns and that
[43:54.880 --> 43:59.440]  then all we got left is the second amendment at that point all he got there was a big fat giant
[43:59.440 --> 44:07.920]  gold star i mean that's what ronald reagan talks like that everybody talks like that
[44:07.920 --> 44:12.960]  charlton heston how have we gone from charlton heston yeah my cold dead hand
[44:14.800 --> 44:22.640]  so now oh hey that's too much for me i i i don't know what i'm gonna do he gave some mild statement
[44:24.800 --> 44:29.600]  and they made a huge hissy fit out of that so i'm not a wishful thinker everybody knows that
[44:31.520 --> 44:35.040]  like people could say i'm downright negative and pessimistic a lot i know i'm only people to
[44:35.040 --> 44:40.160]  know what's really going on for my research if donald trump was behind in all these battleground
[44:40.160 --> 44:47.040]  states i would be telling you that he's not but folks they want you to lose faith they want you
[44:47.040 --> 44:54.160]  to go away that's classic military we had taken back more than a hundred islands actually hundreds
[44:54.160 --> 44:58.960]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds was untold in some cases was so many at little atolls and
[44:58.960 --> 45:03.680]  little little keys but but over a hundred big islands that had troops on them and airfields
[45:03.680 --> 45:10.240]  with japanese dug in and fighting the death in the pacific war in world war two and we were island
[45:10.240 --> 45:14.000]  hopping marching right up to japan and they were swearing they were going to fight to the end
[45:14.640 --> 45:22.960]  they had tokyo rose broadcasting on shortwave and am millions of watts you can hear am all
[45:22.960 --> 45:30.240]  over the pacific ocean playing the favorite songs of the gis because the gis couldn't get radio from
[45:30.240 --> 45:35.600]  home out there they could only get japanese radio and it'd be all your sweeties at home and i bet
[45:35.600 --> 45:39.760]  grandma might have died by now but you haven't gotten a letter and did you know we just beat
[45:39.760 --> 45:45.520]  you on all these islands and you're losing you're losing and failing in the war is going to be lost
[45:45.520 --> 45:53.040]  for you gi but let me play you some big band music to remind you of that sweetheart is probably with
[45:53.040 --> 46:02.800]  a factory worker right now in the back of that car you could give up any time now you're losing
[46:03.600 --> 46:08.560]  we ought to go on youtube i bet you can find the actual tokyo rose it was a bunch of women by
[46:08.560 --> 46:14.240]  that name but there was one particular and the germans had one too they would broadcast into the
[46:14.240 --> 46:23.280]  uk your boys are going down in the frosty and north atlantic tonight you know you die in just a
[46:23.280 --> 46:32.160]  minute or so yeah it's about 30 40 below zero in that water too bad the weird thing is the germans
[46:32.160 --> 46:35.600]  didn't seem to get that that was going to just piss everybody off and want to kill them see
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.560]  see tyrants kind of get see people think a lot of people cowards go the stuff you put out just
[46:40.560 --> 46:45.760]  demoralizes people and man it's negative it scares everybody i'm not looking for the people that get
[46:45.760 --> 46:50.240]  scared okay i'm telling you what the globalist are really doing because see i think you're just
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.320]  like me somebody says they're hurting me and my family i'm gonna do whatever i take to come after
[46:54.320 --> 46:58.320]  them and you've seen what i've done in 21 years there's a lot better men than me out there what
[46:58.320 --> 47:04.640]  are you gonna do get up off your asses and let's do something i'm never given up never given in
[47:04.640 --> 47:11.280]  we're better than these globalists we're gonna beat them start bragging to me uh you know oh
[47:11.280 --> 47:17.040]  your fan uh oh a lot of people went down in that frozen water fighting for blah blah blah
[47:19.680 --> 47:28.960]  hitler said start bombing the the uh population centers that'll make the british give up oh that
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.320]  jumble jumble what a genius idea but you know maybe those were different americans and different
[47:34.320 --> 47:38.560]  british back then maybe we are different people today where you do something to us and we just
[47:38.560 --> 47:43.760]  crap our drawers and roll over and run up a big old stinking white flag i'm tired of this stuff
[47:44.640 --> 47:49.760]  i tell you how bad these people are because i believe you need to know the truth and i believe
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.440]  you're gonna want to do something instead of rolling over to these bastards
[47:53.440 --> 47:59.440]  now hillary is having a nervous breakdown on top of whatever her weird medical issues are
[47:59.440 --> 48:04.400]  neurologically because she knows the whole world knows she's evil and she knows there are people
[48:04.400 --> 48:08.560]  in government agencies that are actually leaking everything to goose for 2.0 and everybody else
[48:10.160 --> 48:13.840]  and and she knows the truth is coming out and she knows she's in trouble
[48:16.320 --> 48:21.120]  so what are they thinking trying to take this dying possum across the goal line
[48:21.120 --> 48:28.480]  kane like joe big said yesterday we got to look at kane and dig into him and he is a roth child
[48:28.480 --> 48:34.480]  frontman and we know he's been meeting with the roth child and he's been it's in the news and he's
[48:34.480 --> 48:42.000]  been meeting with the heir apparent the firstborn son of george soros
[48:42.000 --> 48:52.000]  and those arrogant people are so stupid they sit there and shoot their mouths off
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.880]  in front of their diplomatic you know they get their diplomats they get diplomatic immunity
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.520]  government and private contractor agencies pick them up as security and take them to little
[49:03.520 --> 49:08.400]  little hillary meanings a little little little kane meanings and then they sit there and talk
[49:08.400 --> 49:12.240]  about what they're going to do to donald trump and and how they could false flag for hillary oh
[49:12.240 --> 49:19.360]  yeah oh yeah oh yeah mm-hmm and you're so arrogant you don't think people that have served four five
[49:19.360 --> 49:26.640]  six eight ten fifteen tours and the guys standing around you listening to all this don't know exactly
[49:26.640 --> 49:30.560]  who you are they're not the general public that doesn't know who you are when you're walking along
[49:30.560 --> 49:39.760]  the beach looking at your prey they know who you are dumbass and they hear everything you're saying
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.520]  and then they're going and telling everybody else in the government and the fbi and the cia
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.120]  it's all decompartmentalized they're like oh my god it's all true they're out to get us
[49:49.840 --> 49:57.440]  alex jones is right matt drudge is right what are we gonna do we have now reached detonation point
[49:57.440 --> 50:03.520]  they could take me out at this point and there's nothing you can do that's real satisfaction filth
[50:04.560 --> 50:10.400]  that's living for something that isn't about you and your hunchback and hating everybody and your
[50:10.400 --> 50:19.680]  devil worship all your crap you think you're gonna take down the west good luck sucker

[54:14.000 --> 54:22.800]  it was back when the country was wrong i really feel sad because it hit me and all dawned on
[54:22.800 --> 54:27.200]  me just now back before it's dawned on me so many times but it dawned so hard this time
[54:28.800 --> 54:35.760]  we really are soft the globalists i've been told rub their hands together and they say
[54:35.760 --> 54:40.240]  jones is dangerous but he demoralizes people by really exposing our true agenda to them
[54:40.240 --> 54:47.040]  and so that makes people scared and and then i'm here knowing their agenda that that makes
[54:47.040 --> 54:55.360]  me want to fight them but see from the mind of a tyrant who's never really done anything but
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.440]  had other men fight their battles for them they think intimidating and threatening people and
[54:59.440 --> 55:06.400]  saying your scum and saying your filth demoralizes them but when they did that to the folks in the
[55:06.400 --> 55:14.960]  uk back then in england all it did was making them raging angry and the war output and everything
[55:14.960 --> 55:22.720]  just exploded and it was the same thing with the japanese broadcasting insulting messages
[55:25.440 --> 55:32.320]  at our sailors and marines in the pacific and it was a phenomenon our newspapers were like
[55:32.320 --> 55:36.800]  don't they understand this just makes us want to fight harder but see that was different people
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.560]  look what they've done to us i don't care who you are you mess with anybody in the world
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.040]  i don't care if they're in africa or latin america or wherever you do that 50 years ago they would
[55:47.040 --> 55:54.480]  fight you but the globalists just rub our faces in everything and just and just uh all the things
[55:54.480 --> 56:04.960]  let's play a club of tokyo rose here it is there will give you a medal but only after you are dead
[56:07.520 --> 56:11.200]  your government lies to you every day poor soldier
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.560]  you have lost this war gi your army will leave you behind they do not care about you
[56:20.560 --> 56:22.560]  you
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.720]  gi your government has betrayed you you will not return for you
[56:32.080 --> 56:36.800]  gi your airplanes bomb your own men you are not safe here
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.400]  there's guys that's enough to see that's political correctness but back then
[56:44.400 --> 56:51.520]  oh your your your airplanes made a mistake or oh the cops shot an innocent person now your whole
[56:51.520 --> 56:58.640]  army air corps and navy air corps are bad when you look at george soros some people they are
[56:58.640 --> 57:04.560]  undermining our country and they've done it to dozens of other nations they're running the
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.680]  arab spring they overthrew ukraine they're starting a war with russia they're trying to start a race
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.240]  war here these are outrageous criminals they know if trump gets in there's going to be hearings
[57:16.240 --> 57:20.560]  there's going to be investigations and yes there's nowhere you globalists are going to be able to
[57:20.560 --> 57:26.720]  run and that's why they're crapping their pants you think killing trump's gonna stop this movement
[57:26.720 --> 57:34.080]  you think shutting me up's gonna stop it we're not weak-minded we know history and we know where
[57:34.080 --> 57:40.880]  this is going and you people just can't deal with throwbacks that's what
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.520]  my dad's dad called men but even in his day he talked about men that were even a lot stronger
[57:49.520 --> 57:53.280]  than him he said that's a caveman that's a real throwback but being a caveman doesn't mean you're
[57:53.280 --> 57:56.960]  some wimp and i'm proud of the fact for my grandfather dad he told my dad he said you got

[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:54.080]  occupier that's not rhetoric it's it's a fact and hillary is run by george soros who is running
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.560]  the whole destabilization program of the country and the cop killing operations
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.520]  so i i mean

[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.000]  now that's why they killed michael hastings he discovered incredible information and
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.280]  went on tv a few days before and said look the whole government's been taken over by foreign
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.480]  interest about to release incredible information the whole press is controlled we're in a crisis
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.000]  situation you've got to get ready it's unbelievable what i've discovered and it was just all sorts of
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.680]  stuff because we've talked to folks to talk to the family before they got threatened and his
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.680]  wife did a 180 of course she was highest level national security council he was definitely
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.800]  spook as well and whatever he found out boy he was running away from homeland security when his car
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:50.560]  blew up we already know what they're doing they don't kill you once you already know it and say it
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:56.480]  they kill respected journalists to discover it on their own and they're going to go tell the world
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.920]  truth is it's already out the whole stinking thing this little detail or that little detail
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.400]  whatever do we need wiki leaks to tell us hillary clinton is putting daily talking points out
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.960]  to over 100 media outlets and then everybody under that takes those talking points and
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:17.040]  regurgitates it down to the local level that there is a circle jerk of them just vomiting
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.680]  in each other's mouths ring around the rosie over and over again and that's why nobody wants to
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:27.520]  watch it it's the most canned garbage with a bunch of con artists trying to look as convincing as
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:36.320]  they can up their vomiting recycled throw up so bonzino is going to be popping in and then i i
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.720]  didn't get to all the stuff i wanted to cover last hour amazing trump news scary trump news
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:47.200]  important trump news the latest stuff going on in milwaukee we're going to break it all down i
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.400]  mean there's some in fact let's play some of the milwaukee clips now just because they're so insane
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.280]  i mean this is what mind control and mtv and summoner redstone and that whole fake hip hop
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.520]  thing did now the first hip hop wasn't like this they got it and turned into gangster garbage
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.560]  some early stuff i liked a lot of it myself and i was like you know kid but it just turned into that
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.800]  whole death culture and that was all weaponized by design but let's play uh the family member
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.960]  who's at the press conference saying let's burn down the suburbs but let's play that
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.600]  oh everything
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.600]  so is mommy y'all fighting for her life burning down s*** ain't gonna have nothing
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.800]  y'all burning down s*** we need in our community take the s*** into the suburbs
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:36.160]  burn that s*** we need our s*** we need our weed i don't worry but we need it
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.720]  now now again this is how weaponized media will work from the global they'll say because we make
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.360]  fun of that we're making fun of women that do hair attachments i mean you know i mean people
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.880]  across the board do that it's funny saying though we need our hair attachments it'd be like you know
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:57.040]  saying we need our curling irons i mean it's just so ridiculously decadent and disconnected
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.840]  our poorest americans are better off than most poor people in almost every other country and
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:11.840]  we've got problems but it again the entitlement level of this is just crazy what is it her brother
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.880]  is a convicted felon all this stuff running around waving a gun in the middle of the night at a
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:23.360]  black cop do they really think the black cop shot him because he was black no i think he shot him
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:31.840]  because he's a guy waving a gun and the truth is police shoot in confrontations whites many times
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.200]  more often than blacks because they feel more comfortable about it and because they'll go into
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.280]  more dangerous situations in a predominantly white neighborhood the police have told everybody this
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:48.160]  and quite frankly man i tell you i've seen some poor white neighborhoods i don't want to go in
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.440]  in east texas same thing with some of these poor black neighborhoods i mean i look listen
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.800]  they don't want the cops there the cops are pulling out of these neighborhoods
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:02.240]  and the crime rates are going straight up article by business insider americans are getting
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.360]  concerned about rising home prices the gap between supply and demand is widening it's being dubbed
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.920]  the new housing crisis and the gap is taking median house prices through the roof san jose
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.960]  is the first city to have an mhp of one million dollars for a one family house last quarter low
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.120]  interest rates are creating higher demand to buy homes according to the consumer sentiment survey
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.920]  from the university of michigan which also states quote home buying has become particularly dependent
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.280]  on low interest rates with net references to low interest rates spontaneously mentioned by 48 percent
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.800]  this figure has been exceeded in only two months in the past 10 years in english low rates may rise
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.840]  soon if the fed changes its tune so buyers want to take advantage of the rates now rates are low
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.560]  but not housing prices quote low housing prices were cited by just 25 percent according to the
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.280]  survey's release the lowest figure in 10 years this is starting to create a dissonance of sorts
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:56.160]  in americans little do many of them know a bubble is set to burst and what's to come is yet the

[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:38.000]  is our guest for just a segment or two he of course uh is a best-selling author he was a
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.720]  special agent with a secret service before that a new york cop he ended up leading the foreign
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.760]  details with a senior secret service agent and obviously he's never released any secrets about
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.000]  obama or about the clinton's when she was in the state department or anything else he saw
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.240]  but he has been harassed uh and had a lot of mysterious things happen uh just for coming
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.080]  out and saying he politically opposes them now we have the emails uh that came out over a month ago
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.200]  that show the democratic party has been directing the media on what to say and having people dress
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.680]  up like bernie sanders supporters to go attack trump supporters now we knew this from our sources
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.000]  now it's confirmed i also wanted to talk to him we're not going to play it it went viral last week
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.520]  for the interest of time he was on don lemon and lemon was saying oh this is so horrible trump uh
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.880]  you know was out here calling for the assassination of hillary and then basically trying to shut off
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.560]  banjina who's trained to know what real threats are and i wanted to be able to elaborate and not
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.280]  be interrupted here even though he did destroy lemon uh i'm not a rocket scientist or a criminologist
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.760]  but i'll tell you this trump was spouting the standard from my cold dead hands statement uh or
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.200]  what i said 1776 commences again that everyone says that when all else is lost we have a second
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.840]  amendment that's basically in the declaration of independence now that's what i got from and
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.600]  in fact i thought it was milk toast compared to even stuff reagan would say he was just kind of
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.840]  like well it was just the judges and they take it away well it's nothing you can do unless i guess
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:06.400]  maybe the second amendment folks think they can do something i mean that was just kind of relaying
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.880]  a cliche of the second amendment and then i have the clips uh where again i have all these media
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.320]  pundits and other people including the vice president saying if obama tries to take my guns
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.240]  i got my beretta and i know how to use it he's gonna have a problem now for me that was a clear
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:28.880]  threat it was a clear joke but he was saying to the colloquialism of the grassroots democrats
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.800]  from my cold dead hand uh mr banjino is that an accurate statement do you think
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:39.520]  yeah i i think what he was trying to do is get out the vote i mean i think he was clearly trying
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.800]  to marshal people who care about the right to self-protection alix you know that matters to them
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.360]  he was clear and and alix let me just be clear on this from the start but i'm not a trump surrogate
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.360]  i i don't speak to him the campaign um i'm doing my own thing i have my own campaign in florida
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:00.960]  run i you know i went on there to defend what i think is liberty and conservative values you were
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.240]  a cruise guy you were a cruise guy i was a cruise exactly no kidding like i was a that's the most
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.040]  amazing part of this whole thing and i even said it in the interview but alice if we allow this is
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.840]  why what happened with don levin and trump's comment this is why this is so destructive and
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.640]  why in this election this matters so much and i know you know this on your show specifically
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:26.320]  once we allow the left-leaning media which is what most of them are to paint conservative or
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.680]  liberty-based talk as inherently violent what do you think the next step is out the next step is
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.640]  censorship you can't allow this to happen so i'm asking your listeners whether you support trump
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:44.080]  cruise rubio ron paul rand paul joey begatona i don't care who you support do not allow them to do
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.440]  this because once they do it it's the next step towards depression of free speech with the let
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.920]  which the left is always and as usual you cut right to the heart they're censoring in europe
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.360]  they're starting to censor here they admit they want to censor us because they can't compete with
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.360]  our ideas and you hit the nail on the head they are wanting to say it's radical they want to put
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.320]  out these law enforcement advisements i mean they even tried to ban in the navy the gadston flag
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.440]  that was the first flag of the u.s navy i mean they mean business right right they do and i'm
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:18.240]  glad you pointed out the fact that one trump never mentioned the word uh uh gun when he was talking
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.280]  about to say he said the second amendment people i don't know that's his quote exactly almost verbatim
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.400]  i may have missed uh uh two word or three letter word in there whatever but he said second amendment
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.080]  people i don't know joe biden said oh he comes from my barretta and then mrs clinton i don't know
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.400]  if you remember this one out since 2008 when she was running against barack obama and was getting a
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.160]  butt kick and wouldn't get out of the race an editorial board said well you know why are you
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.720]  still in this race you're gonna lose and she said well you know bobby kennedy was assassinated in
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:52.960]  june wait wait what bobby kennedy was it did you just did she just imply that barack obama could
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:58.000]  potentially be assassinated that's why she's in the race as a senior former secret service agent
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.520]  trained in and i mean like no one else on how to assess a real threat to me that was a very
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:09.040]  mafia show sly waited directly threaten obama at a time that we know they were at each other's
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:15.120]  throats well i think what happens with politics is we tend to you know you look at these things
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.800]  and you say all right they're running for office and people say all kinds of desperate things run
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.600]  afront i think it was clear whether you whether you when you contextualize all these statements
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.680]  they were imprudently worded and probably could have been worded better but the question you opened
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:32.480]  up with the show with which is the important was was this the threat the answer is of course not
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.000]  and what's sickening about this whole thing alex is the left in the media knows it wasn't a threat
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.120]  the only reason they're doing this is to influence elections and get the american people to think
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:48.960]  that any talk about liberty any talks about conservatism about american values is inherently
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:54.560]  violent and they're using it as a crutch to try and put a muzzle on conservatism exactly in fact i
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.800]  put together a news piece that we heard yesterday where i pointed out just that that when heston said
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.320]  it was okay when i said it was okay when everybody else said and ronald reagan said it and i said he
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:10.240]  said it was okay but suddenly he puts out a mild wimpy form of the statement and then they act
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:15.600]  like it's the end of the world that shows they're trying to change the overton window to make that
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:21.920]  basically uh illegal right and and and what they want to do also yes you're right they want to
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:27.040]  frighten conservatives and libertarians and liberty minded folks in the future from being able to
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.240]  discuss this issue either you know every time they do this people say to themselves in it you know
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.960]  whether advert me or inadvertently they go oh gosh if i bring up this second remedy some media type
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.760]  gonna say i'm calling for violence you understand that this is what they want this is the left wing
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.880]  left wing media's goal and it's always been their goal your goal is to stop you from being able to
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.520]  say things that are going to fight you advance the cause of liberty and this is how they do it i mean
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:57.040]  i read his his statement trump statement in the washington post i got the one tnn sent me the
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.320]  the request for an on-air hit i had to read the article twice to figure out what they were talking
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.240]  about i'm not making this up i read through it and i'm like i don't understand where the thread is
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.480]  here i had to email him i'm like i don't all right i'll appear on the show but i don't get it like
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.280]  what that's what i'm saying it's this new thing where you got george soros and and these big
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:20.320]  foundations openly sending out provocateurs that are saying kill cops and burn down cities and
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:26.560]  that's okay and they're twisting something trump's done it shows a new level of deception right you
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:33.680]  have blm the black lives matter who've been calling for pigs in a blanket flying like bacon and then
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.800]  what do we want dead cops when do we want them now bang bang bang the left is worried that donald
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.960]  trump said hey you know second amendment people you know i don't know i mean that's the quote if
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.280]  you're listening at home going i don't understand what bunch you know and obviously obviously that's
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.600]  what they should all be talking about with rolling stone the new york times calling for banning guns
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.360]  time to quote repeal the second amendment they should be talking about what the repercussions
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.200]  are going to be because i mean even if you're a democrat you should be asking yourself that
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:04.240]  yeah and the one thing i i will give trump and again i'm not a trump surrogate yeah i you know i
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.880]  appreciate that he tweeted some support i could have used it after the don lemon interview where
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.040]  the left was i mean he should have seen the tweets i got i'm sure you used to him but i'm not used to
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.240]  multiple like death threats in one night one or two okay but i got you know it was pretty nasty
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.920]  yeah 150 a minute not good oh i mean in my twitter account you know just exploded but i i just need
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.040]  everybody to take away from this that this is a very coordinated effort by people on the left
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.440]  you know what what is a fred spiegel used to talk about in this book revolt against the masses
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:39.840]  this iron triangle of the media congressional committees and left-wing activists how left
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:44.560] -wing activists push the media and congressional committees to advance issues make no mistake
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:50.080]  that iron triangles working together oh you can see it's a talking point across the board and
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.520]  they are coming after our most basic of rights in fact because you mentioned it let's play a clip
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:03.520]  of heston and then dub tail it with uh joe biden on the campaign trail 2008 uh basically saying if
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:11.040]  obama comes after my gun i'm going to stand up to him here's a clip from my cold dead hands
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.000]  i guarantee you barack obama ain't taking my shotguns so don't buy that malarkey don't buy
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.880]  that malarkey they're gonna they're gonna start peddling that to you i got two if he tries to
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.000]  fool my barretta he's got a problem i like that a little over and under you know i'm not bad with it
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.480]  can you imagine mr bonjino bonjino dot com former senior secret service agent who quit because he
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.800]  couldn't be part of what he saw that he never told us what it is i mean imagine if trump would
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:47.920]  have made that joe biden statement alice i hate to say it but if you said that you'd probably be
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:53.120]  in jail i mean seriously if you were to use that exact joe biden quote and not change it a bit
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.520]  you'd probably have you seriously you would probably be in jail because i know how these
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.840]  these things work behind the scenes how they investigate these threatening but again because
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.600]  he's a liberal leftist he's given a complete total pass because the implicit way to think the way the
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.000]  media wants you to think is that the left is always innocent they always have good intentions
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.640]  and we should always defend them and the right everything they say is a call to violence and
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:21.840]  you should have to defend why we shouldn't lock you up or investigate you it's a complete paradigm
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.080]  shift and it's very dangerous to the cause of liberty and this is what really worries me
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:30.640]  about the future of the country you know we can have sound debates out reasonable debates
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:37.040]  about what the tax rate should be import export policy i mean i'm i'm always default to liberty
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.520]  in these things but i understand how some liberals maybe they feel otherwise that's okay well we can't
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.440]  have a debate about what we can never have a debate about is god given god given capital
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:54.160]  god given right to speech assembly religion these are things that are not available dan
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.840]  bonjima we've only got about five six minutes left with you i want to spend some time about
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.240]  what you're up to these days and where you see the campaign going in uh 2016 and more but but
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:09.760]  shifting years i know a couple times because you've called us or sent us an email asking hey did you
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.880]  say the other day that i was your source for something we've never said you've been our source
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:20.720]  you've only said on air the things you say you've never released any info other than saying it's
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.400]  worse than what people are saying and that's what other secret service agents have said
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.600]  here on this show uh but we know what's going on with hillary we know she was in a hospital for
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.760]  almost a year and had brain surgeries they've kept it secret but they admit it we know she's
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:39.200]  deteriorating uh and i went to cleveland when we get the secret service in trouble i was blown
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.760]  away by it because i've been to a lot of you know major events over the years and uh i had a few
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.360]  federal marshals or secret service say hi or say they like the show i mean i it was amazing uh
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:55.280]  uh i mean the crew witness it over and over again the secret service like cheering us and i don't
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.720]  want to say you know that's unprofessional but that's what was going on and then we had some
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:03.680]  secret service folks want to talk to us and i passed it over to biggs and they said well just
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:08.000]  in about a month or so you're gonna get some info well it came through the channels non-digital
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  and it was just basically what you're saying about hillary is true we're really worried we don't
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.360]  know how they think she's even gonna make it she's she's basically uh having seizures all the time
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.160]  they've had to put in handicap stuff together in the cars uh there's scuttlebutt about some
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.040]  big announcement now obviously this is the kind of stuff you can get people put in prison or killed
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.400]  i i just have a duty when real secret service agents i mean you're there in cleveland this is
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:36.640]  going on things are so bad behind the scenes uh that that we've gotten to this point what do you
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:43.200]  make of all this yeah by the way that that meltdown by the young turk guy was just classic
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.880]  that's some of the best video i'm not kidding man i watched that thing three times that was hysterical
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.680]  to watch these liberals lose their minds you know that's so good job on that one what happened there
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:58.720]  was is you know i mean just briefly their people set him up and told me to go up he was okay with
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:06.000]  it at first then when he saw uh roger stone that's when he blew up sorry go ahead yeah yeah that was
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.560]  no and what i what i said and i said this a while ago in this clip went viral too that it's worse
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.760]  than you know talking about the obama administration the inside you know i meant it and what i mean
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:20.800]  to say but what i think you listen to take away from this is i don't think even the hardcore
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.800]  conservatives and liberty-based folks who understand the gravity of the fight we're fighting
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:32.480]  understand really the level of ranking competence going on in the white house now i get it yeah i'm
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:36.480]  not saying they don't know what they're doing in regards you know the implementation of obama
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:41.200]  care so it was designed to fail so that a third party payer government run system you're right
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:47.040]  it was designed to fail but what i'm saying is i don't think you understand the amateur hour nature
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.240]  of the administration and how they can't even keep control of just basic things in other words
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:56.640]  yes your plan is always for bigger government and implement control they've got a plan but
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.320]  they're truly incompetent which is right and well let me spell on this we're about to put people back
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:09.040]  in that stole the china that was george washington's i mean right now this is important there's so
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:15.600]  there's so incompetent amateur hour that even though they're ideological hard left who are
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.800]  implementing the exact plan you guys thought with obama care and taxes and everything you know the
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:26.320]  war on cash and all this stuff they're so ignorant to what's going on that they can't even implement
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.520]  their failures effect and and is that why because i mean i'll tell you sir i'm shocked and obviously
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.800]  this is dangerous i don't like it but i have a duty when it's real to report it and it wasn't
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:38.480]  these secret stuff or any documents it was just hey yeah you're on target here's some info
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.520]  what does it say about the incompetence inside the government at the white house level that the
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:50.960]  secret service is now at the point that they are so concerned about what's going on that information
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.720]  is being linked yeah i think a lot of people have said i mean that you saw the book gary burned
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.920]  book uh you know gary was you know i get it out i mean i i thought my thing to do these
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.400]  hello books i i you know i don't understand something my bag of chips but i understand
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:10.080]  what people are doing it i mean a lot of people are starting to speak out because this is the
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.480]  calculus they're making out they're saying all right i get it there's a certain oath to keep
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.720]  quiet in the secret service but isn't there a note to save the country first i mean you're a federal
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.520]  agent who's for to uphold the constitution will you hold that open and get your kids killed exactly
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.640]  there's got to be some point at which when you've got foreign actors chinese communists admittedly
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.240]  i mean i've been told by former deputy directors of the cia that hillary is a chinese spy i mean
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:42.160]  there's got to be some level where i'm asking myself what do i do dan well i don't know if
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:48.080]  she's a chinese spy or not but i could tell you that i doubt it but i know her emails i know for a
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:54.080]  fact that her staff knew that that server had been hacked i knew it and and whether she's doing it
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:59.760]  de facto and sharing information didn't know or did know either way the gross what i'm talking about
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:05.520]  by the gross level of incompetence they can't even implement a design failure the white house
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:09.680]  the white house run media matters came out attacked you when you were on six months ago
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:15.600]  and said the hack when they knew it had been hacked exactly they don't even want to plug
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.200]  the hacks they don't want secret service telling you know how evil hillary is
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.400]  but they don't care every foreign government the world can just jump on her server
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.160]  no and this is the crazy thing about that attack like i'm telling you on your show that the person
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:34.960]  who told me this is an unimpeachable firsthand source who was there was literally there like
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:40.240]  physically at the scene when this happened so you would think the left palace to save the country
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.360]  would be like oh my gosh we've got a major hack of the secretary of state this could be a big deal
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.480]  we should try to fix this no they're only concerned let's discredit the source who cares if they know
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.440]  about cia operatives overseas the chinese or the russian and people get killed i mean we already saw
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.000]  the uh was it the uh scientists who was killed so i mean it's ridiculous these people don't care
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.400]  about the country we've only got two minutes left i know you've got to go but but but seriously go
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:11.040]  back as i was interrupting uh i mean at the point where the secret service is was cheering me i was
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:17.120]  almost embarrassed because i mean what does that say about the psychology in the government that
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:22.000]  they're so panicked that they're just happy to see little old alex jones as if there's some hope
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.160]  over there i mean that put responsibility on me that just blew my mind because if we tell you
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.920]  of alex jones is like some big shot at the secret service we're in deep crap i think people are
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.800]  really upset within the government i think they feel like there's uh there's an elite class of
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.760]  bourgeois insider government officials that live by a completely set a different set of rules i mean
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:47.440]  whether it was a cathleen sabilius hatchack violation jim clapper lying to congress about
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.800]  spying on americans hillary clinton with the email server and then you get rank and file men and women
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.440]  in the secret service the fbi and other government age that if they did the same thing would find
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.520]  themselves in bracelets and handcuffs and they feel like you know what the heck is this i mean i
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.360]  didn't sign up for this junk and i think that's why you're seeing this that's why you're seeing
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.920]  this back and people on the inside you know you've been betrayed and you know you're fundamentally
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.560]  hated by a criminal culture it's like they run the country they run it all and it's the old story
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.720]  i'm gonna let you go of ron silver when the clinton's first got in the hollywood actor and producer
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.080]  jets fly over he goes they're threatening us that's how and they go no those are our jets
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.800]  now a lot of these people literally don't even get it and i think that's why hillary reportedly

[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.680]  oh gosh it was uh about 15 years ago secret service has got a file on it was in tennessee
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.960]  papers this guy kept sending me letters saying i'm gonna kill george w bush i'm gonna kill him
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.880]  i've got the guns i've got the weapons i'm gonna kill you too i know you're a devil worshiper i
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:50.240]  know you're a satanist all these weird maps and crap and i called the secret service i've
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:56.720]  i brought the information to him in north austin and they went to the guy's house and grabbed him
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:02.160]  he confessed to it uh they convicted him and i heard he got mental help or something what do
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:10.880]  you do though when it's meetings with hillary's vp candidate and world leaders talking about going
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.560]  after trump i mean at a certain point it's like why do i have to do this i mean i've kind of really
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:23.840]  psychoanalyze it at this point i want the audience to understand this stuff is over the top now this
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.880]  isn't rhetoric okay it isn't rhetoric i had the secret service cheering me all over cleveland
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.520]  and the police and you name it it isn't rhetoric you didn't you heard banjino he wasn't disagreeing
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:40.560]  earlier he knows it's true he's told me off air no secrets but like two three years ago how much
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:46.320]  the secret service loves me and i'm like oh yeah all right the secret service because in my experience
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:50.640]  at rncs and dncs are like angry seven people around trying to keep people from getting killed
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:56.480]  or whatever just come off as kind of arrogant like when i had a point or basically start to point an
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:03.520]  mp5 at me hk driving into the hillary obama meeting in 2008 and you're like oh yeah the secret
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:09.120]  service really allows me sure and then you experience it you're like what twilight zone am i in and then
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:17.920]  we've got i mean incredible pentagon sources incredible contractor sources incredible you name
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:25.600]  it and it's just at a certain point it's like man if i know all this what do the other people in
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.600]  government know i mean these people are bad and you heard what banjino was saying he said that's
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:40.400]  exactly it stealing the silverware and the plates that by the way were valued at millions of dollars
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.240]  because that's stuff george washington signed his first executive orders to get money from congress
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:53.920]  to pay for diplomatic dinners and to have the plates for people to eat on nobody eats on that
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.000]  unless like the queen of england comes or something that's the last time they got it out like that's
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.640]  back when reagan was in that kind of message he wasn't against it let's just say hey here's george
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.920]  washington you know he'd off what he had off it's just kind of interesting i'm sure they thought it
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:12.000]  was really neat too it's that it's that history to it they just stole it and again they run the
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.480]  world basically and they're stealing silverware and that's what i hear about them is that well
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:27.680]  they thought fbi agents that went public hillary would spend hours hanging crack pipes and now
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:36.560]  bobbles ornaments in a christmas tree and and like the secret service in the fbi like these are
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.760]  crazy people i mean even if you hate christmas why are you gonna hang crack pipes in the tree
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.040]  because they're demons folks if you study criminology this is what freaks are into
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:52.960]  this is what they do and you just can't believe that it's the first lady who really ran the
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:37:00.160]  white house about to be back in go to drudgereport.com she now sounds like trump on trade and
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:10.480]  has now starts doing her hair like trump look at this now she copies his hair and the media even
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:17.440]  understands it and thanks to billion drudgereport has biggest month in 21 year history i thought the
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.360]  media mainstream media said he was dying i mean you know that he was just over he was just
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:33.280]  july 16 smashed all viewership records 1 billion 472 million 220 000 and yes on the top 100 website
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:37.840]  list info wars has moved up from 90 something to 80 something i haven't even spent time looking
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:45.040]  at it but i'm just looking at who's number one uh but uh there you go imagine the top 100 websites
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.000]  info wars on another rating service that uses google and others is in the top you know 80
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:58.560]  ms nbc's not even in the you know basically top thousand but they have a lexa and bezo
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.480]  just saying we don't even exist that's these people are a joke is what i'm saying they're
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:13.840]  stealing silverware why are they ruling over us can you imagine going over to nice people's house
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.760]  for dinner they get out nice nice cutlery and stuff and nice platters and things and you like sticking
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:29.280]  silverware in your jacket maybe if you were poor and stupid and didn't know that you could
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:37.440]  have a chance in society to operate by trust the most valuable thing you can have is your name
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:42.640]  even if you're starving you just ask for help you don't need to steal it but no no
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.480]  they've got all this money and all this power and they're stealing silverware and you know i'm
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:52.160]  kind of harping on that when i've got all this endless news to cover because it illustrates
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.160]  everything we're talking about it's it's like a skeleton key it opens every door into the minds
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:04.720]  of these people who would spend their time if i was a decadent sociopath i would spend my time
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:09.760]  you know watching football and having sex and eating the finest food and screwing around
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:15.360]  i was a self-centered dead nobody and that's dead if you don't have passions and don't care
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:21.440]  but see they have passions it's to desecrate crosses desecrate christmas trees run around
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:27.280]  beating people up uh running around being a horrible nasty person and treating little people
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:34.720]  like absolute crap hillary's the top of person like when you see the movie running man when the
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.040]  head of the network a guy's mopping the floor and actually hits his feet he goes oh i'm sorry
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.880]  sir he goes it's all right he goes if that guy's mopping the floor is here tomorrow you know you'll
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:49.280]  be mopping them for a week they fire the old guy hillary's really like that she loves to hurt little
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:59.600]  people she loves to call people that own a restaurant over and go that waiter that waitress this is
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.920]  like well known looked at me in the wrong way and i'm gonna tell you something right now you get
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:10.400]  your manager i'm gonna have this checked and if that person's working here in a week you're gonna
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:17.680]  have big problems just like she did that big laugh stop on the top places in la she had people
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.680]  actually call from the camp and say we're gonna audit you we're gonna shut you down if you have
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:30.160]  any criticism of hillary is that clear is that clear imagine how mad i make her but she's her
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.400]  people are like ma'am you cannot order the hit of this guy he's he's got too much attention on him
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:40.160]  this will blow up in our face it just you cannot do it i'll guarantee you those conversations go on
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:49.040]  i have experienced messages from the clintons i have experienced when the fists are coming down
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:55.600]  into my face in a parking lot shut up about the clintons shut up about weiko course they only got
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:04.080]  about three or four words out and i was spewing blood all over them but it was it was it was fun
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:16.160]  see but see the average person wants to sit there and grovel to this and give into this
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:22.240]  i'm not giving in to a disease hunchback demon i mean i i want to know where the flying monkeys
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.360]  are with this lady okay seriously i expect flying monkeys you just come flying out from
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:34.800]  behind her at any moment i mean what happens if you dump water on her there's a deal she can
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:39.200]  tell me that she's gonna get me and my little dog too i know she's going to get me and my little
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:47.120]  dog at the time of her choosing if i don't meet her on the field all right i i i had so much
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:50.640]  news to cover today i basically only got into a thimble of it because i've just been rhetorically
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.360]  getting into what's happening in the state of the world i'm gonna get to it here in a moment
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:00.080]  but that is bombshell to have bonjino not doubting that the secret service gave us info about her

[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.640]  let's go ahead and start getting into some of these clips let's go to the trump clips first and talk
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:03.520]  about those trump is now getting into her medical issues testing the waters he says
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:11.360]  hillary is exhausted taking weekends off there was an article i think it was the hill over the
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.600]  weekend but i never got to you guys print it hillary wouldn't be able to get back up was the
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:21.680]  headline and it was her doing an interview talking about how i was so exhausted during the enc
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.600]  that if i laid down i wouldn't be able to get back up i'm so exhausted i mean this is what we're
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:34.480]  talking about she clearly looks like hell and the inside info is having all sorts of different
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:41.520]  problems they tell me check the back of the binder here it is hillary couldn't even get up after
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.840]  exhausting convention right barb then it links through to mainstream news articles where she's
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:52.640]  quoted by the end of those two weeks that's exactly how i felt i was oh my gosh i don't know
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:58.960]  that i can get up let alone what i will do if i am vertical by the end of those two weeks
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.760]  i knock on wood and pretty lucky because i have a lot of scamming endurance which is
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:07.840]  necessary in the kind of campaigning i'm engaged in but i also try to eat right and goes on to
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.800]  that so they're trying to get you ready for the medical announcement that's coming she was in a
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.920]  hospital off and on six months straight off and on for over a year with all sorts of surgeries
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:23.760]  going on probably cancer probably you know brain tumors is what dr pacenic thinks a lot of others
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.240]  that then cause all the secondary problems and neurological issues that's why she only does
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.720]  short press conferences it's why she gives short speeches it's why she can't stay during the debates
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.920]  what is she gonna pull is the 64 trillion dollar question to stay out of these three debates with
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:44.160]  donald trump the media tried to act like trump is gonna boycott these like he's done one and and
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.400]  then they said he was afraid of debates they're like 20 something by the end he just said no more
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.520]  not because he was afraid there were just total hit pieces and he'd already dominated
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.600]  but he's got to be in these debates and i've been told he is going to be in them but
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  i don't see how she's going to sit there for hours we're trying to make them shorter i know
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:06.560]  you know when her and nothing against people that are handicapped but her diaper is filling up
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:13.760]  you know uh and um you know she needs to go change the diaper or take some tranquilizers or
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:19.200]  whatever are going on with her that's what this comes down to and that's why all the handlers
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.160]  are behind the scenes talking about false flags
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.240]  to have an attempted assassination of hillary that fails and then blaming on trump and drum
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:40.080]  up anger and fervor shows that it would be seen as tit for tat if something happened to donald
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:52.240]  good lord and these people imagine if i know about this the secret service does
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.000]  that's another reason they're so freaked out i would imagine i mean they've got to know
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.960]  so if i know about this secret service has to know about it
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.120]  i guess we'll just have to talk to the folks that were there and tell me to go the secret
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.520]  service i mean you know that's what's going on with this stuff that's the level we've reached
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.200]  in this country it's it's that's what i'm saying i i have trouble just sitting here i see i can't
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.840]  handle it i love my life i would never commit suicide i would never i i don't mean that i mean
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:30.560]  i can't handle just sitting up here and just daily life goes on and knowing all this and i just
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:41.360]  want listeners to understand this is not high this is not uh us trying to i mean see all the
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:45.440]  stuff we talk about that later comes out and we say we have sources we say things are coming out

[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.440]  to win eerie in a landslide we'll go to that the moment first trump talks about exhausted hillary
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:18.720]  is taking weekends off here it is hillary clinton has supported tax increases on the
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:26.400]  middle class for her entire career she's voted for higher taxes 235 times in the senate i thought
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.600]  it was more than that that doesn't sound think of it she's ready she's voted for tax increases
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:38.400]  and by the way she's proposing a big one today in her speech her teleprompter speech
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:51.760]  she's got a she's got her speeches are so short though they don't last long you know
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:57.040]  they're like 10 minutes let's get out of here go back home and go to sleep
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:05.280]  three days later she gets up and she does another one and goes back home and goes to sleep
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:16.000]  oh boy his ice is hoping for her is china hoping you imagine china they come in
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.560]  they have a negotiate with the chinese they're tough in her bedroom you got to hit them back
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:30.160]  with a lot of energy that's right and of course you notice trump was on the election and fraud
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:35.120]  and now he's on her health things are going very well drudge has been hammering this they've been
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:41.360]  demonizing him because he's on target we're on target you're on target stay on target
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:46.640]  let's go to the other clip trump i'm told i'm going to win eerie in a landslide that's a big
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:53.040]  democrat area he's got internal polling folks he's way ahead all over there's this huge hoax
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:59.520]  though he's gonna lose and that's meant to actually create that perception so he does
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:04.000]  or so when they steal it people believe that he was really a loser but trump's not dumb
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:07.920]  that's why they're looking into other ways to take him out right now let's go to that club
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:14.320]  so i was told this whole area is democratic meaning democrat
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:24.400]  and i was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said i can't believe that
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:30.720]  you have 10 000 people you have people outside trying to get it they said they came up to me this
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:35.520]  is happens to be a democrat who happened to know as a good guy came up to me said i've never seen
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:41.360]  anything like it it always goes democrat is that a correct statement she said you are going to win
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:45.920]  eerie and this surrounding it you're going to win in a landslide it's going to be a landslide
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:52.640]  he is and that's why they are freaking out like chickens with their heads cut off running around
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:57.520]  dinosaur media oh he's evil he's horrible he's a liar he's a fraud he wants her evolution he's

[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:33.360]  for some evangelicals i i could see that it's just that the stuff they say about him isn't true
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:38.560]  by the way he's not out to get mexicans either he just wants to kick felons out of the country

[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:10.400]  entertaining and it's something that should be shown to schools something that should be shown

[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:29.920]  gotten to it because it's just total social engineering you know what we have to look at it
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.560]  we're going to get into that and we're going to also get into gary johnson saying support the tpp
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.160]  but i want to play this because facebook and other places have been trying to censor this
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:44.960]  and block it it's just a short uh 26 second meme you can't be commander in chief if you laugh about
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:52.320]  dead us soldiers here it is as i say in my book i made a mistake giving the bush administration
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.560]  and uh the authority that i voted for just shows you how hard it is to make these choices
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:04.400]  Who just want have calling the book? I'm choices. Who just want have calling the book I'm choices.
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:09.680]  Who just want have calling the book I'm choices. Who just want have calling the book I'm choices.
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:11.760]  Who just want have calling the book I'm choices.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:17.760]  And if you're a radio listener, you're sure her hyena voice. I apologize for that for TV viewers.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.080]  It's obviously showing each second another panel of dead U.S. soldiers.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:28.160]  And she makes jokes about starting the Qaddafi war that was to cause a failed state.
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:30.880]  That was designed to be a failed state.
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:34.960]  And that's what's coming out about the Clintons and Rwanda and other areas.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:41.600]  These are plans to give you a failed state.
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:42.600]  This is what they do.
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:43.600]  Oh, Sahaina.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:51.240]  This was taken off TBS too.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:04:01.600]  You can't have Hillary criticize because that's not allowed.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.320]  Now we're going to come back from break.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:04.640]  We're going to roll out of the intro.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.880]  We're going to play the American trailer for folks.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:11.280]  And we're going to talk to Mr. Haven, who also stars in the film, by the way.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:14.000]  I want to say this because he was the producer of it.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.760]  I think he did just about the best job of acting in the film.
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:24.800]  Me, I had to play an evil senator and so I'll be honest, I didn't practice my lines
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:28.160]  much beforehand because they were changing even the day I got them.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:31.200]  But I did a pretty good job.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:33.880]  But it's got a lot of famous actors in it too.
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:38.600]  And again, it's just all part of the genre of the Liberty Movement getting into Hollywood
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:39.800]  films and countering them.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:44.480]  A lot of Christian films and Patriot films now are bigger at the box office than Hollywood.
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:48.040]  So it's all part of taking the media back from the globalist.
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:53.000]  Gary Haven straight ahead, the new American film by Mike Norris and Gary Haven now exclusively
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  available at infowarstore.com and you get two of my films free when you get it.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.760]  Donald Trump slammed the New York Times as a failing media enterprise on Sunday after
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:07.360]  it published two hit pieces against him mirroring the Clinton campaign's talking points.
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:11.920]  As reported by Steve Watson, the first New York Times piece headline inside the failing
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:16.520]  mission to tame Trump's tongue insinuated that an ominous sources inside Trump's campaign
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.960]  claimed that he is perpetually stolen and erratic.
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:23.120]  The Times said, quote, the smear piece also claimed that Trump broods about his saring
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:24.680]  relationship with the news media.
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.680]  Do you really believe Trump broods about what the discredited failing media thinks about
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:29.680]  him?
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:33.040]  Remember, he started attacking the media as state-run propaganda not long after he entered
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:34.040]  the race last year.
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:37.840]  And the second hit piece, which is barely worth mentioning, claimed that Trump campaign
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:42.800]  chair Paul Manafort has intimate ties with, quote, politically corrupt pro-Kremlin elements
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:43.800]  in Ukraine.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:47.760]  The same Ukraine that was overthrown by George Soros and Western governments to geopolitically
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:51.160]  isolate Russia, one of the few countries not controlled by the global elite.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:55.000]  And to find out more about the desperation of the New York Times and establishment media

[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:03.800]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from infowarslife.com.

[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:22.720]  supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.

[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:30.600]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:35.480]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:40.280]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:44.620]  Its formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:50.040]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:51.800]  quality lab standard.

[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:03.360]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.960]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:12.520]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:24.800]  The reason I'm here today is to encourage the U.S. Congress to take action to protect
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:28.520]  our country from its most imminent threat.
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:33.120]  Electricity would cease, the Internet would go down, and the banking system.
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:38.280]  The smokescreen of national security used by government at every level.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:41.560]  A strong America is the only thing standing in the way.
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:44.080]  Country only needs a little chaos.
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:48.160]  We have a fog that is descended on our entire nation.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.840]  Hello, Mr. President.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:53.160]  Now is the time.
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:56.440]  The average American family only has three days of food.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:57.960]  We need to top face to face.
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:08:58.960]  This is important.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:03.480]  Sir, what's the mission, disarm the population and restore order?
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:06.400]  Have any weapons inside your home or on your personal?
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:12.920]  You had to give the president power to arrest any American by simply accusing them of terrorism.
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:18.440]  The vanity of nationalism will quickly fade, ease up at the birth pangs of a new world
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:19.440]  order.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.360]  I'm just so afraid of the world that you're going to have to grow up.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:30.040]  This is the time, man, woman, young, or old, when folks run and hide, or they pull up their
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:34.040]  bootstraps and they fight.
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:40.960]  When you sell your soul to one time thing, there's no going back.
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:49.120]  Who come into studio, I've asked Gary Haven to come into studio.
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.080]  Any time he wants to, he lives here in Austin.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.400]  Part of the time, he also has a home in Australia.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.200]  And of course, he's founded a bunch of different successful companies like Curves, which has
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:02.000]  been the biggest franchise in world history until he sold it years ago.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.400]  And he has produced a film, Amerageddon.
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:10.000]  But the reason I've invited him here once a month is to get his commentary and analysis.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.880]  It just so happens today, we are launching a deal where you can exclusively for the next
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:23.000]  few weeks until it's in Wal-Mart and other stores, get Amerageddon exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.160]  You can get one copy for $19.95.
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:30.400]  You can get two copies for $39.90, and then get two of my films free.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.560]  My first film, America, destroyed by design.
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:37.400]  And then what I think is probably my best film overall in the state of the world, Fall
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:40.320]  of the Republic, from five years ago, but you watch it.
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.160]  It's more popular today than it was five years ago, six years ago, because it's all happening
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:47.640]  because we have the globalist plan.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:51.240]  So your film is fiction, but almost real world, near future.
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:54.400]  And it dovetails with my nonfiction films.
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.480]  And my first film is pretty darn informative and also pretty entertaining.
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:01.560]  You can see me, you know, even a lot skinnier than I am now.
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:07.080]  But those are available right now, Amerageddon, themovie.com, you can also find out other
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:08.080]  details.
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.440]  It's still, I guess, been showing in some theaters, had a good U.S. run.
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:16.400]  And now churches and other groups are getting set up to have viewings at their facilities.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.520]  You can find out more, obviously, by going to amerageddonthemovie.com, or there's also
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.280]  talk about a TV series and a lot more.
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:29.360]  But again, if you go to infowarstore.com, you're funding our operation and you're helping fund
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:30.360]  true independent film.
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:32.160]  I mean, this guy spent a lot of money.
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:38.520]  He brought in a lot of big actors, did a great job as a trailblazer to really fight back against
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:39.520]  the globalists.
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:44.160]  I've been very, very thankful for Mr. Haven for including me in the film and just, we
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.960]  didn't even ask for this graciously.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.360]  He has helped fund some of the operation a little bit as of late, made some donations
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:52.880]  that we didn't even ask for.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.680]  And he's also, no, I'm not supposed to say that, but you know, I mean, you're a really
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:56.680]  great guy.
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:00.920]  This guy's a big supporter of the Liberty Movement, but also cherries around the world.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:08.240]  And he has also, again, let us have the exclusive for, is it a few weeks or how long is it?
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:10.520]  So, it's a week or so.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:11.520]  Exactly.
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.720]  So, it's available at infowarstore.com.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:17.000]  We're very, very thankful for you doing that because that's a big deal, and that helps
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  from what we're doing.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.040]  And it's the listeners growing this community, growing this economic system.
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:28.560]  The globalists, if you study the Clinton Foundation and the lawsuit three years ago
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:31.520]  about judicial watch and the documents they got, and you're a businessman, I won't talk
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:33.160]  about this first.
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:40.520]  They say, in 1993, after they get in the White House, they say, we cannot let Patriot, Christian,
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:43.880]  conservative, even alternative liberal.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:47.840]  We cannot let anything alternative get a foothold, have their own publications, their
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:49.940]  own films, their own TV shows.
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:52.680]  We have to have the controlled press, call them conspiracy theorists.
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:57.500]  We have to shut them down and stop them and call them profiteers, or we're going to lose
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.000]  the info war.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.560]  Now we have her before Congress as the Secretary of State saying we're losing the info war.
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.920]  So when people buy books, buy videos, give them to people, great way to get one, buy
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:10.520]  a second, get two films free, it's a war, folks.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.040]  And they understand, they want to shut down this economy.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:16.960]  They don't want us to build an alternative system.
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:20.600]  So voting with your dollars is one of the most devastating things you can do to the
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:21.600]  globalists.
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:22.600]  Mr. Haven, great to have you here with us.
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:23.600]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.600]  That's my little intro rant.
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:28.560]  But as a businessman who's had thousands, tens of thousands of employees, started scores
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.840]  of companies, I mean, how fundamental is it for us to understand we vote with our dollars?
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.360]  Attude, I appreciate that great introduction, and I appreciate the great work that you do
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.360]  here.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:45.160]  You know, we have a window of opportunity to access truth.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.840]  Before the internet, you had a completely controlled media.
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:54.200]  And so for a short window, we're actually able to listen to people like you and the
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:55.200]  great work you do.
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:59.160]  I mean, you've done some extraordinary things.
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:00.160]  Globalism's in trouble.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.280]  Globalism's in trouble.
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:03.680]  Because of you and everybody, though.
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:06.040]  The listeners, the point is, look at Brexit.
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:07.040]  Look at UKIP.
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:09.040]  That's a tiny group kicking Goliath's butt.
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:10.040]  Yeah.
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:11.440]  Well, we have a movement going on right now.
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:17.840]  You know, Trump has initiated a movement in this country that exposes the globalist
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:23.840]  in their tremendous effort to take away our sovereignty as our country and our freedoms
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:25.080]  along with it.
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:27.200]  And that exposure now is waking people up.
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:33.880]  And it's not just UKIP in the UK, but you've got Le Pen in France.
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:38.640]  You've got the polemicals movement in Spain.
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:40.160]  People are waking up all over the world.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:43.160]  Now, the problem is, it may be too little, too late.
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.080]  So we have to take advantage of this.
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:46.080]  You know, making this...
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.080]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.080]  We've got to get prepared now.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:52.240]  I mean, because we may end up losing this battle before we win the war.
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:54.240]  And people have got to be bold about it.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:57.120]  You've got to be willing to speak the truth, the power to share this.
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:01.400]  No matter how much ridicule you're exposed to, you've got to start talking about this
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:07.600]  openly and not be afraid of somebody calling you a name or calling you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:10.600]  And Alex, you're really a great leader of this movement.
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:16.200]  I'm so proud to be your friend and to be welcome on your program.
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:20.320]  The little bit I can contribute is so great.
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:24.920]  But as Alex said, our movie's available here exclusively.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:29.920]  The number one complaint we've gotten on our movie is that it just wasn't available.
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:32.960]  We had a limited number of theaters we could play it in.
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:37.320]  And so those of you who've been waiting for this movie, now's the time to act.
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:42.400]  Go to infowars.com store and take advantage of this offer and be the first to have it.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:47.000]  Buy two so you can get the bonus, as well as have one to share at your church or with
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.240]  your friends.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.240]  People need to know.
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:53.520]  And you know, the beauty of AmeriGid is that we made a fact-based movie.
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:56.680]  Now, it may be dramatized so that it's entertaining.
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:59.880]  Well, I just appreciate the fact that you're the man in the arena and taking action and
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:02.240]  trailblazing just like our listeners are doing.
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:05.760]  This is our information warfare revolution.
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:06.760]  And you know, it's tempting.
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:12.480]  I've got resources and I can, you know, try to find a place to escape from this movement
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:13.480]  that's going on.
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:14.480]  But I chose not to do that.
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:20.080]  I chose instead to take my money and my time and my skills and bring the truth to people
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:21.080]  because-
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:22.080]  And stick your neck out there.
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:23.080]  This is free.
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:27.520]  Yeah, but I'll tell you, you're again, you're a great example for this.
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:32.560]  If you can do what you do every day, then people like me can stand up and do what we
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:33.560]  can do as well.
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:37.000]  And together, you know, you want to talk about stronger together.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.440]  We are stronger together because we have the truth on our side.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:46.440]  And what we're fighting for is our country and our freedom and our constitution and people
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:49.360]  are waking up and getting behind this movement.
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:54.520]  And so if you care about your country, if you care about your kids, join us in this fight.
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:56.200]  Take the truth to the people.
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:00.920]  Take it to the power because we have a chance, a window of opportunity right now to take
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.520]  back our country that has literally been stolen from us.
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:08.600]  Now, here's an inside baseball point for folks, Gary.
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:12.320]  The Secret Service tells us that she's got all these medical problems, unprecedented
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:13.880]  historical leak.
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:18.800]  I have a former head Secret Service agent on who ran foreign details and he goes, no,
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:19.960]  I believe you got this leak.
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:22.960]  That's how upset they are.
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:24.480]  It's not fun to get a leak like this.
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:25.480]  It's dangerous.
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:26.480]  They come after leakers.
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:28.640]  They come after folks that put the leaks out.
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:34.280]  I predicted last night that there wouldn't be coverage of this for a few days at least
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.280]  because they've got to go to Hillary and others now and say, what do we do about this leak
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:38.400]  on M4s?
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:40.560]  They're hoping nobody picks it up or covers it.
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:43.440]  Normally mainstream media will attack us on anything, you know, a shoe I drop on the
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:47.000]  side of the road, but they're not touching it because they know it's real.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.200]  They know she's got Parkinson's type disorder.
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:50.840]  They know she's having seizures all the time.
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:53.040]  They know she can't be out in public more than 10 minutes.
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:58.080]  They know this is happening and they know that they're in panic mode right now.
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:02.720]  And so I just typed in Alex Jones again into Google News, dozens of stories attacking me
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:03.720]  today.
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:08.200]  Nothing about us claiming that we had a Secret Service leak because imagine I'm this big
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:09.200]  liar.
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:10.800]  I mean, why not just expose me?
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:13.000]  Why not send the Secret Service here?
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  Why not?
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.880]  In fact, I'd probably got to go to the Secret Service with other info we just got.
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:21.120]  Why not release Hillary's medical records?
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:22.800]  I mean, I'm getting ready to go to the FBI.
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:24.200]  I mean, what are they talking about?
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.880]  I mean, I want people to know what I know.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:27.880]  Okay?
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:31.760]  You know, the issue here is this country's in trouble and what I'm getting at here is,
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.600]  Gary, imagine how screwed up things are behind the scenes if the Secret Service is willing
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.080]  to stick their neck out like this.
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:40.880]  That means they know there's nothing to lose.
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:41.880]  Yeah.
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:47.280]  You know, there's a few good men there, men that are willing to protect their country
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:52.880]  and stand up and back up their oath to defend the Constitution.
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:57.680]  Thank God for them and we want to encourage them to be brave and courageous.
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:05.400]  You know, I, as a Christian, it's hard to be glad that Hillary Clinton is so ill.
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:06.400]  That's right.
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.880]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.240]  But I'll tell you, she, this is an evil person.
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:17.160]  This is a person who is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, hundreds of
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.360]  thousands of Christians in Libya and Syria alone and laughs about it like a demon, like
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:22.360]  a harpy.
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:27.240]  And as a Christian, I'm so glad that God is God and that we're going to see some justice
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.240]  on this thing.
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:35.360]  And, you know, for her to die, again, I feel guilty for saying this a little bit, but that's
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.160]  the best thing that could happen, particularly if it happens naturally.
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:41.400]  We don't wish harm on anybody, but this is a demon.
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.000]  I mean, we're not going to hurt her, but it is God's justice.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  Yes.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.880]  It's like in the Bible, all the plagues would come on Pharaoh or Herod.
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.080]  I mean, you can see it.
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:51.080]  Yep.
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:57.960]  So, you know, I'm a little bit heartened by the fact that justice does come.
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:06.960]  It may come late and slow, but we don't deserve someone of her character in her history being
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:07.960]  put into power.
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:11.520]  And, of course, the amazing thing is that half the American people still think it's
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:17.560]  a good idea that this person with her history, her character, might be the commander-in-chief
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:18.560]  of this country.
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:20.680]  So, we've got to wake people up.
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:21.680]  I agree.
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.680]  I personally think that's cute.
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:26.360]  I think it's more like 35 percent, but that's still a sickening number.
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:29.240]  But they make it like Coke and Pepsi, Ford, Chevy.
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:32.200]  Trump, like you said, is saying, this is a movement.
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:36.520]  And that's what I personally have said to Trump is, you are leading George Washington
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:40.040]  2.0 and you're trailblazing and your instincts are dead on.
[02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:43.920]  You don't need my advice, but, you know, I would hammer this election fraud.
[02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:45.920]  You know, an internal polling, and he's like, yeah, that's true.
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:48.240]  We're going to wear a head, but they're going to try and take it away from you.
[02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:53.000]  Like I told him, I said, watch, you're like 20, 30 points ahead right now after that convention.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.880]  They're going to come out with some giant fraud to reverse that.
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:58.400]  I would say next week and it all started the next week.
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:20:59.400]  Okay.
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:01.560]  And because I sit here and I watch this stuff all day.
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:04.560]  I don't just act like I'm a, you know, political operative and advisor.
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:05.560]  I live it.
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:06.560]  I've seen it.
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:10.840]  And then I went and looked at the methodology of the polls, add 15 percent more Democrats
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:17.080]  in a bunch of different polls, not just Reuters or sample 30 percent independence, but no,
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:18.880]  those samples are really Democrats.
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:22.840]  I mean, they are pulling out the stops to create the self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:28.840]  When you talk about a movement here, Trump understands it's a movement to take down the
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:29.840]  new world order.
[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:31.240]  He is for real.
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:33.960]  And, and, and people say, oh, how do you know that?
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:37.640]  What he's doing is irrevocably damaging the new world order.
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:41.120]  Even if they steal it from him or kill him, he is totally for real.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:45.560]  And I can't get into all the stuff I know behind the scenes, but I'm here to tell you
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:50.040]  Trump is on a suicide mission and a suicide mission militarily doesn't mean you're always
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:51.040]  going to get killed.
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.400]  It means 50, 50.
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:53.400]  He is committed.
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:56.440]  He went to Scotland for a month before he decided to do this.
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:01.080]  I was told this before it was ever in the news and he decided that he can't stand seeing
[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:02.080]  America screwed over.
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:03.280]  It doesn't mean he's not a tough businessman.
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.800]  It doesn't mean he doesn't stand up for himself and his family, but he's not out to get us.
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:08.800]  You're a smart guy.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.520]  I have a lot of, uh, you know, acumen.
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:14.440]  What is your gravitas at your spirit gut level, say about Donald Trump?
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:18.240]  I mean, I just, I just see people attacking him and second guessing him when he's the
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:23.520]  man totally bloody in the arena doing trailblazing things never before seen if you actually watch
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:28.000]  his speeches versus what they twist on the news and all these Sunday morning or Monday
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.840]  morning quarterbacks that sit there and, and, and lecture him and buy into this, this, this
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:39.720]  make believe thing with, uh, you know, folks that watch these clips of him, like telling
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:41.840]  the strong man where he stumbled.
[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:42.840]  It's such a joke.
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.600]  You wanted somebody to fight the new old order.
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:46.360]  You wanted somebody to fight for sovereignty.
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:48.240]  You wanted somebody to fight for lower taxes.
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:50.200]  You wanted somebody to fight for the family.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:52.780]  You wanted somebody that would stand up against the communist Chinese.
[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:56.360]  You wanted somebody that would take on political correctness and the, and the whore media.
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:23:01.000]  This guy is a fricking wrecking ball and, and, and if you don't get behind him, you get what
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  you deserve.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.240]  I think Trump is God giving us a last chance before we're judged.
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:06.240]  Sorry.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:07.240]  Go ahead.
[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:10.080]  I, I, you know, I agree.
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:16.340]  Uh, with a little caveat, I'm cautiously optimistic.
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:20.400]  And uh, I've, I almost got to me with him last week and I almost got to me within the
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:25.040]  week before and I have some direct questions that I want to ask him, we'll say those.
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:28.760]  Well, choosing Pence, what was, was a really concerning thing.
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:34.320]  You know, Pence is a bought and paid for, you know, he's a folk conservative, but he's
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:35.320]  bought and paid for.
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:40.920]  He's, he's part of the establishment and to put him, uh, uh, behind you really puts
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:42.160]  a target on your back.
[02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:44.680]  Now I understand why he, he did it.
[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:48.460]  He said that he needed to unite the party and he also needed the funding that comes
[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:49.960]  from, from the party.
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:51.480]  And he got it as soon as he picked him.
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:52.480]  Yep.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:53.480]  Yeah.
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:58.400]  I think he got 87, uh, million dollars, uh, uh, last month, which is a huge, uh, uh, benefit
[02:23:58.400 --> 02:23:59.400]  over.
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:06.360]  But then he went in, in, in, uh, Paul Ryan and, uh, uh, uh, Senator McCain and in that
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:13.080]  hag from the Northeast who, who has betrayed the, the tea party, uh, he, he supported them
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:17.840]  and endorsed them last week, then it's puzzling, uh, because these people had, they ran a
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:20.960]  hoax saying he was going to step down and they were going to pull funding from him.
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:21.960]  Yeah.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.600]  And just absolutely, uh, they made the decision with Manafort to do it.
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:30.360]  Uh, and, and I mean, the, I mean, they're totally, I mean, you still saw the Republican
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:32.120]  leadership all come out and say, don't give me money now.
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:33.120]  Yeah.
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:36.880]  All I'm saying is no matter if he makes a few moves like that, they're still out to
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:38.120]  getting because they know.
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:39.120]  Yeah.
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:40.120]  Yeah.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:41.120]  No, and you're right.
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:42.840]  At the end of the day, uh, I'm not even saying compromise.
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.640]  It's just that.
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:48.800]  Look at how they came after him saying he was resigning when, when he wasn't.
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:49.800]  Yeah.
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:50.800]  Yeah.
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:51.800]  The, the evidence, I'll tell you, there's people.
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.840]  Would they say actions to be glad that he's got, there's moles in there.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:56.840]  Yeah.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:57.840]  I mean, you better believe.
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:58.840]  Oh yeah.
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:24:59.840]  Yeah.
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:02.960]  With probably, uh, uh, the, the, the person who wrote the speech for his wife, for example,
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:03.960]  and, and pull that off.
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:07.960]  Look, you can't even find the link when he's out saying, join us.
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:11.120]  We're going to, he's telling his people, we're going to organize exit polls.
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:12.120]  We're going to do all this.
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:13.120]  Like, no, we're not.
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:14.840]  They kind of think they know more than him.
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:18.280]  His problem is that he's got people in there that aren't doing what he says.
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:19.280]  Yeah.
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:20.280]  And it's tough.
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:21.280]  It's a big organization.
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:22.280]  I'm not giving a cover.
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:23.280]  I know it's going on.
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:24.280]  Yeah.
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:25.280]  Okay.
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:26.280]  I mean, I have to stop right there.
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:27.280]  I know.
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:28.280]  Yeah.
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:31.480]  And of course I'm a observer, although I have ties in, into the campaign right now.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:32.480]  All right.
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:38.320]  But I, I'll, some with you on this thing, uh, uh, he is obviously, if you judge people
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:43.600]  by their actions and not the words, he is obviously standing against this globalism
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:48.040]  and, and for people to let me kind of put it into real simplistic terms, uh, there's
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:52.760]  a movement for globalism and there's a movement for nationalism.
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:58.760]  Nationalists believe in American sovereignty, the constitution, uh, uh, the culture in America.
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:04.280]  The globalists believe that you need to diminish the American constitution and sovereignty
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:08.600]  so that we will be weakened to accept, uh, a, a global government.
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:13.600]  And you know, that used to be called conspiracy, but it's, it is out there every day now that
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:17.560]  any of the financial times that they all admit, this is our system and we're going to bring
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:20.720]  five million radical Muslims in because Europe's too white.
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:22.560]  It's, it's, it's anti-Christian.
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:23.560]  It's, it's sick.
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:24.560]  It's, it's, it's evil.
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.200]  And they admit this is their world government plan.
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:27.200]  Yep.
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:29.960]  And again, under world government, there's some TPP is ruling over you.
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:30.960]  Yeah.
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:31.960]  I mean, why would anyone be for this?
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:32.960]  Yeah.
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:33.960]  And so we have a movement.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:35.680]  We have sovereignty versus world dictatorship.
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:36.680]  Yes.
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:38.200]  And, and people need to understand that.
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:42.360]  And here's the problem with world dictatorship or this global government, they're, they're
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:43.360]  creating chaos.
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:46.520]  They're, they're bringing us right up to world war three.
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:49.680]  And they're going to claim that globalism is going to solve all these problems.
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:51.320]  They're going to make it look palatable.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:56.880]  And so now's the chance for us to teach people that these globalists are Satanists.
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:57.880]  They're Illuminati.
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:01.600]  And Kissinger said, we're going to cause world war to bring us under world government.
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:05.960]  And Kissinger also said that the only thing standing away of global government is a strong
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:06.960]  America.
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:10.640]  And that means they've got to diminish us and they're well in a way, because the American
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:12.520]  system competed with their garbage.
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:13.520]  Yep.
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:14.760]  Open borders, bringing in unvitted.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:16.560]  Other countries wanting to be like us.
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:19.840]  Well, that messes up your world government of a bunch of poor people.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:20.840]  Yep.
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:21.840]  We're all going to be poor.
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:28.800]  Margaret Thatcher said that, uh, uh, with socialism, uh, uh, we all share poverty.
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:30.520]  And that's, that's where these people are heading.
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:35.000]  And it's extraordinary that, uh, they've gotten this far before we, we as a people
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.800]  have caught on, but we're awake now.
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:38.920]  And again, it's partly because of Trump.
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:41.920]  Well, I want you to meet with Trump because you have a lot of discernment.
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.720]  You early on said, I mean, like a year before it was like, oh, Cruz bad news.
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:46.720]  I met with him really.
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:50.680]  And you kind of got into it with me, you know, as I was all Cruz, Cruz, Cruz, Cruz.
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:52.840]  I wasn't even for Trump at that point.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.680]  And this is really early on, uh, and then you warned me about it.
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:02.440]  But I mean, Trump overall, look, I know he's going up against the new world order.
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:04.120]  There's no way he's saying all this.
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:09.760]  And then, you know, uh, secretly with them, I am worried that nobody understands all
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:10.760]  the angles.
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:16.160]  And I think sometimes I think the people closest to him that have been in New York, all their
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:20.320]  lives and places, I think inherently think all these liberals and intelligentsia are
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:21.320]  their friends.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:24.760]  And whereas Trump doesn't care what other people think, as long as he knows he's right, I quite
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:28.120]  frankly think some people closest to him, that peer pressure gets to him.
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:30.640]  And I know his family's wonderful and they're great.
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:34.360]  But I think some of the folks in there are, um, the biggest issue.
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:35.360]  Yeah.
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:39.120]  You know, uh, I was with a pastor friend of mine last night and he pointed who, by the
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:41.800]  way, is, uh, got a meeting with Trump.
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:48.440]  Uh, uh, so we were discussing it, uh, and, and Trump got into a battle with the Pope.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:52.600]  And, uh, uh, the Pope said he was not a Christian, uh, Trump was not a Christian because he
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:57.800]  was going to build a wall on the border and Trump told the Pope that, uh, damn it.
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.560]  He was a Christian and, uh, and who was he to tell him he wouldn't.
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:03.120]  So think about that.
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:07.160]  Donald Trump even got into an argument with the Pope over his Christianity.
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:10.440]  Well, plus he also tweeted out his hundred plus foot walls.
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:11.440]  Yeah.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:12.440]  He said, what are these?
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:13.440]  Popey.
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:14.440]  Yeah.
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:15.440]  I've been to the Vatican.
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:16.440]  There's some pretty tall walls there.
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:17.440]  Uh, it's amazing.
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:18.440]  Yeah.
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:23.480]  And, uh, Alex, I'm with you, uh, Trump is our only hope and we have got to get behind
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:25.720]  him in supporting and nobody's perfect.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:30.360]  And especially with the delivery of this whole thing, uh, but we've got to support him right
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:31.360]  now.
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.800]  It's the only, it's the only horse we get in this race.
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:34.800]  Absolutely.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:36.800]  And he goes out and gives two hour speeches and they step them up.
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.680]  That's what his folks get mad at him about.
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:42.280]  But that's what's enduring is these things when he really believes now he's pretty much
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:43.280]  on point.
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:47.760]  Uh, but, uh, I want to talk about more about the film we come back and get into where you
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.760]  see the future going in.
[02:29:48.760 --> 02:30:00.360]  Trump loses on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:04.760]  Hillary Clinton apparently suffers from Parkinson's or a similar disease and experiences seizures
[02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:07.920]  from flashing lights such as camera flashes and press conferences.
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:12.040]  The Secret Service told Info Wars, additionally, the federal government has reportedly spent
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.240]  nearly a quarter million dollars to add handicapped steps on government vehicles because Hillary
[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:20.800]  struggles with balance, a fact already established by Reuters photo showing two men helping Hillary
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:21.800]  upstairs.
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:25.440]  The revelations explain her odd epileptic behavior on camera and why she avoids press
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:26.940]  conferences in general.
[02:30:26.940 --> 02:30:30.440]  Over the past several months, Hillary has suffered several seizures and near-comatose
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:34.280]  freeze-ups during speeches, which reveals she's hiding serious medical issues that
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:37.280]  jeopardize her ability to hold public office.
[02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:41.280]  Sources inside the Secret Service initially contacted Info Wars reporter Joe Biggs at
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:45.200]  the Republican National Convention and followed up with details about Hillary's health out
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:47.680]  of respect of the public's interest in national security.
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:51.440]  Similarly, a law enforcement official told Breitbart that Hillary was late returning
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:55.680]  to a debate with Bernie Sanders due to a flare-up of problems from a brain injury.

[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:03.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.200]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:09.500]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:14.700]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:18.600]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:23.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.800]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:29.400]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:30.700]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:33.100]  Tell us about all the stuff I said, there's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:37.600]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:40.900]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:44.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.900]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslifes.com.
[02:32:46.900 --> 02:32:50.500]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:53.900]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslifes.com.
[02:32:53.900 --> 02:32:56.200]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:10.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:12.400]  He never gives up.
[02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:21.400]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:24.100]  Well, the American people never give up and never give in.
[02:33:24.100 --> 02:33:27.100]  Those that are awake, that's the real stars of this fight.
[02:33:27.100 --> 02:33:28.800]  Gary Haven's our guest.
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:32.800]  We have Amerageddon, the film exclusively for the next week or so,
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:34.500]  before it's in stores across the country.
[02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:37.100]  We'll continue to sell it, obviously, a film I'm in.
[02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:42.100]  You get two copies for $39.90 and get two of my films, Fall of the Republic,
[02:33:42.100 --> 02:33:45.100]  and America's Road by Design, free with that.
[02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:47.300]  So get one film for yourself and one for others.
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:52.800]  And then two other films to watch or then give to others or keep as an archive.
[02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:58.400]  Or you can get one copy of Amerageddon, the movie for $19.95 at infowarstore.com.
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:02.800]  Or by calling toll 38882533139.
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:07.200]  Gary Haven is our guest here in studio and boy, I was saying when we were coming back,
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:15.500]  I wanted to get into the fact that we have the situation all over the country
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:21.500]  where big foundations, the White House is trying to foment racial division.
[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:26.200]  And I was asking your view on that and you made a really, really great point
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:31.100]  about something that I only saw in the news one time and hardly got any coverage,
[02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:35.500]  but that we've confirmed is happening all over the country.
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:39.900]  So before we go to some of these clips, Gary, talk about your personal experiences.
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:47.700]  We particularly as Christians need to understand that the elite need to create chaos
[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:49.700]  in order for them to bring in their solution.
[02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:54.900]  Of course, the solution, it means that we give up our freedoms and our resources.
[02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:58.300]  And so this Black Lives Matter, which is clearly funded by George Soros
[02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:06.000]  and that evil ilk that he represents, is by design to allow them to acquire power.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.700]  So we as Christians need to stand up.
[02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:12.900]  We as Americans need to stand up and recognize that our Black brothers and sisters
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:18.000]  are equal to us and that we care about them and love them.
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:23.300]  We cannot allow this chaos to be fomented, this racial war.
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:29.100]  I was in Shreveport, Louisiana the other day and during the events
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:35.000]  that happened in Baton Rouge and in Black people and a few White people
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:40.200]  were standing on the corners in Shreveport holding up signs that we should love each other,
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:47.500]  that we're all children of God and they were deliberately diffusing this chaos
[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:49.400]  that these evil people are trying to do.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:53.200]  And I tell you, I was so proud that they would stand on the corners
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:56.600]  and lift up these signs that we should love each other.
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:01.200]  I read about that in some cities on alternative sites, but never on the national news.
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:03.300]  That's not the image they want.
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:09.300]  They want the image of Black people running around saying kill White people
[02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:11.500]  as if that sells equality.
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:15.000]  No, that actually creates racism against Black people on the other side.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  And it's, again, from the Democrats and the globalists, what a sick, nasty thing to do.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:26.200]  Just like Soros installed, as you know, literal Nazis in Ukraine,
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:28.800]  unelected in our media, called it a great thing.
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:30.800]  I mean, you talk about pushing evil, they do it.
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:34.300]  Now, I have a bunch of these clips, but notice what you said is
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:36.800]  we should all come together and see this as a manipulation.
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:42.600]  Glenn Beck now is the apologist for, and I'm not attacking him because of who he is or whatever.
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.800]  I'm just doing it because people need to know, understand who he is and why he's doing this.
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:51.300]  He comes out and says, I'm going to have to vote basically for Hillary, anybody but Trump.
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:54.900]  He comes out now and says, I understand Black Lives Matter.
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:37:01.900]  I understand them and gives legitimacy to a group that is evil and meant to misrepresent
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:03.100]  what's really happening.
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:09.000]  I want to play a clip of that in just a moment because he's now the apologist for conservatives.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.900]  He now, but not the real apologist, he goes in as the straw man and says,
[02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:17.000]  I know Republicans are racist and bad, which isn't true on average.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:23.200]  And so I'm here to say, I'm the good Republican and it is so ridiculously transparent.
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:29.800]  And he's now running around everywhere saying and telling his listeners, don't vote for Donald Trump.
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:33.600]  We don't want to attack the man because that even gives him power.
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:37.800]  I mean, I mean, the guy has lost much of his audience, just as Fox has lost
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:43.800]  half of one of its key demographics and has now had a coup and is basically pro-Hillary in many cases.
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:47.400]  This is a bellwether of how the globalists are making their full move.
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:49.000]  Or do you disagree with me, Mr. Haven?
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.300]  No, no, I agree.
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:56.000]  And I tell you, I used to be a big Glenn Beck fan when he was on Fox.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  You know, I don't know what happened.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.400]  You know, you can speculate they got to him or whatever.
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:08.400]  And then he's just kind of gone nuts on with his cruise and messianic cruise thing he had going on.
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:12.600]  So it's astounding what he's doing, but he's certainly imploding.
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:15.300]  But I'm going to tell you about this Black Lives Matter thing.
[02:38:15.300 --> 02:38:19.700]  Guys, I've got nothing to apologize because I love people.
[02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:21.400]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:27.300]  I feed 10,000 black children at a day in Haiti and have ever since the earthquake.
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:32.200]  I go there and embrace them and love on them, and it's irrelevant what color they are.
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:34.200]  But you've gone to Haiti with Ted Cruz.
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:36.600]  Not Ted Cruz, but with Rand Paul.
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:37.400]  Because Rand Paul, Rand Paul.
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:38.900]  Yeah, in fact, that's a great little story.
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:39.900]  I'll tell it real quick.
[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:41.800]  Rand Paul is an eye surgeon.
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:49.600]  We took him and two other eye surgeons over and they did cataract surgery on 200 blind elderly Haitians.
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:51.000]  And of course, they're all black.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.800]  And one day they were blind and the next day they could cease.
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:59.600]  So, by the way, my dad's done stuff like that for dentistry, but I'll never even talk about it.
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:01.100]  Like, oh, I'm not racist.
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:03.200]  We do tooth work on black people.
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:04.200]  They're just humans.
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:04.700]  Yeah.
[02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:05.900]  That's how we want to be treated.
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:07.000]  Absolutely.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.400]  And so this phony while the Clinton Foundation steals the money for Haiti.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:11.000]  Unbelievable.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.100]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:12.800]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:13.800]  That's a great point.
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:16.200]  And I have the stats on that.
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:23.500]  96% of the money that Clinton's collected for Haitian relief went into the Clinton's pockets.
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:26.200]  In apparel for their family members and their associates.
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:31.000]  And that's admitted 97% they give to themselves.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:31.500]  Yeah.
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:33.800]  They take their money and then they give it to themselves.
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:35.300]  Tax exempt.
[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:36.600]  That's extraordinary.
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:44.300]  So, you know, the facts are that Republicans and particularly evangelical Christians donate
[02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:50.700]  significantly more to charity six times more higher than the liberals and these other other people.
[02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:57.900]  You know, even Ted Cruz was giving two or 3% of his income and by the way, none to churches.
[02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:00.200]  And so, you know, look where people spend their money.
[02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:03.000]  That's where their hearts are.
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  Mine's fighting the globals.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:07.200]  I spend almost everything comes in just trying to build up a fight to these people.
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:07.600]  Yeah.
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:11.100]  And what's scary is every level we go up, we're more successful.
[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:17.500]  I'm like, as a humble person, I don't, it feels good that we're having an effect,
[02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:24.300]  but it feels weird to have the Secret Service leaking us info and the Pentagon and and it's accurate info and real.
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:26.000]  And it's just, it's like a movie.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.300]  It's like, well, why me?
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:35.500]  You know, you know, you're humble and and and I don't think many people would say or do you,
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:39.100]  but you, you have a humility and that's what makes you usable.
[02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:43.000]  You know, God raises up people that will be obedient and not take them.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.200]  Well, I'm personally humble.
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:45.900]  I get aggressive with the New World Order.
[02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:46.300]  Yeah.
[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:50.000]  And that's a good thing because that aggressiveness doesn't come from you.
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:56.700]  It comes from their purpose and in what you've been raised up for in this place and in this time.
[02:40:56.700 --> 02:40:58.400]  And I'm proud to be sitting here.
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:01.000]  Well, I'm proud to be with you and the listeners and just all these amazing people.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:02.300]  It really is great.
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:03.800]  That's what this big animating contest is.
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:05.600]  It's finding who's good and who's bad.
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:07.600]  And I'm working every day to be good.
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:08.400]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:12.700]  What happens if Trump loses, they steal it, whatever Hillary gets in.
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:14.200]  She's clearly got problems.
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.100]  What do you make of this Cain guy?
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:28.500]  Well, I'm afraid Hillary's health issues are so severe right now that they already plan to elevate Cain to the presidential office.
[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:33.400]  And it's hard to, there's not much known about him.
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:40.800]  A friend of mine is a state rep in Virginia and I've been able to get some insight from him.
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.000]  Cain's not a nice guy.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.600]  He is absolutely bought and paid for by the globalist.
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:49.700]  He will do their bidding obediently just as another puppet.
[02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:52.500]  We're going to have another Obama, probably even on steroids.
[02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:56.000]  So we know what we got.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:02.300]  The globalist will have another maneuver where they're going to continue what they're doing.
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:08.900]  Well, we talked to security people who were just at a meeting and this is a good source.
[02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:17.200]  All we were told was they were just, they don't even care, they're just sitting around openly talking about a false flag to make Hillary look like a victim just to get her in and then get Cain in.
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.000]  And then if Trump tries something with that, they'll, they're talking about, I mean, sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.800]  Well, you know what, I think they're very warm.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:38.000]  I'd be an attempt on Hillary's life that may not be successful, but somehow the rhetoric of Trump is going to be blamed, you know, for that.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.100]  That's why they seized on his second amendment thing.
[02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:41.700]  Yeah, they're prepackaging.
[02:42:41.700 --> 02:43:00.900]  Yeah, that and, and, and, you know, in his, his, uh, the harshness of his tone, which is unfortunate sometimes because he, he creates a lot of problems for himself, but they're going to easily be able to attribute at least the, the environment that, uh, that caused an attempt on Hillary.
[02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:02.700]  Meanwhile, they're the ones trying to find cop killers.
[02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:13.400]  Yep, and, and guess what, we're all going to be feeling sorry for Hillary and, uh, and, and people are going to vote for Cain and she's going to get Cain the sympathy vote or she'll get the sympathy vote.
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:23.600]  And by, here's another interesting point, you are helping to wake people up to, to, to the impairment of her health and how that would normally disqualify her for, for the office.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:32.500]  So an attempt on her life that's unsuccessful moves the sympathy vote in a place to cover the incompetency issue.
[02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:35.200]  So I think all of this is falling into place.
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:48.200]  I just can't believe that they are getting picked up, you know, in private hangars by diplomatic security and just in the cars, in the mansions, just sitting around right in front of security, just talking about incredible crimes.
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:51.800]  And I'm just like, I don't want to go up against these people every day.
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:57.000]  I've got, I mean, I'm not bitching, but at a certain point, this is not, this is not, this is not fun.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:02.400]  And I just wish the public understood how much peril we're in.
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:10.200]  And I think the audience does know that I'm worried about all the trendies Gary, just the average people that just buy into the system.
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:12.700]  The La La land that they must be in.
[02:44:12.700 --> 02:44:13.700]  Yeah.
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:15.600]  I'm doing a big conference this week.
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:20.300]  It's going to be recorded and put out on air on the Jim Baker show.
[02:44:20.300 --> 02:44:27.600]  And the title or the purpose of my speech is talk about truth and in the sorter truth.
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:38.400]  And we is thinking people, much less as Christians, have got to be willing to take truth as harsh, as scary as it is.
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:42.600]  And we've got to bring it into the, into the battle place.
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:45.900]  And we do have truth on our side, but it's scary.
[02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:46.800]  It's overwhelming.
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:48.800]  Even you're feeling it right now.
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:51.700]  Oh, it is scary. Well, it's exciting though that you're able to reach.
[02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:57.500]  I know he reaches over 130 million, 50 million people, something like that, or homes that you're making inroads all over.
[02:44:57.500 --> 02:45:00.800]  I mean, I hear people all over the place talking about, you might have been the guy.
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:05.800]  I know you don't want the credit, but that tipped it on crews for people on all the big Christian networks.
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:06.500]  You're respected.
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:08.100]  They're warning people about crews.
[02:45:08.100 --> 02:45:13.300]  Yes, Nate, you know, it is a, is a nationalist.
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:23.000]  Somebody believes in the sovereignty of our country and having borders and the constitution and the blessing that has been for us and even the rest of the world.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:37.200]  You know, I'm able to work within the media with you and in other people, but as a Christian and somebody who's been very involved in, in, in, in bringing the gospel to the, to the public.
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:39.300]  I'm able to walk in that, in that arena too.
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:46.200]  I've been on the 700 Club many, many times. The, the American Family Association, Tim Waldemann, our good friends.
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:50.200]  I'm on there frequently. And now with Jim Baker, with huge audience.
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:55.800]  So I've been able to, to, to really talk about globalism in a Christian environment.
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:58.700]  Remember a lot of evangelicals, they don't want to hear about this stuff.
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:01.400]  You know, they didn't think you're going to last a year.
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:04.100]  That's clearly why they went after Baker a long time ago, because he's more open to this.
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:05.000]  They wanted to.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:11.300]  Yeah. Yeah. And I tell you, Jim Baker is a fascinating guy. I've, I've really gotten to, to be good friends with him.
[02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:16.700]  And this man was friends with almost every president. He had tremendous influence.
[02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.300]  He was a creator of all the major.
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:19.700]  And that's why they went after him.
[02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:23.600]  And then there I was as a kid watching mainstream media believing that it was all crap.
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:24.100]  Yeah.
[02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:29.100]  I mean, just like they say about myself or anybody, it's just, but that's why they target young people because they don't know.
[02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:29.800]  Yep.
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:36.600]  It's so sad. I want to get back into black lives matter because we've had stories that have like 20,000 comments.
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:37.200]  Okay.
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:42.900]  We've had stories that have been seen by over 2 million people because drugs link to it top drug story.
[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:49.800]  And it's so pathetic that I can't even play these clips because I know it's a Psyop.
[02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:53.400]  I need to play it to expose it as a Psyop, but it makes me sick.
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:57.900]  I don't get off on seeing people act like racist moron idiots,
[02:46:57.900 --> 02:47:05.000]  but it does expose political correctness that it's created this situation where it's made so many minority groups in these enclaves.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:10.700]  Super racist and they don't even know it, but playing some of these clips since I mentioned it.
[02:47:10.700 --> 02:47:12.300]  Burn down white suburbs.
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:15.600]  Sister of man killed by my walkie police urges rioters.
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:19.800]  We're going to play that in a moment, but first let's play Glenn Beck since I've been mentioning this all day.
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:24.000]  Here's Glenn Beck says he understands and relates to black lives matter.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:29.200]  No, you say I relate to all communities, black communities, and when some cops do bad things,
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:31.200]  I understand the anger and the profiling.
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:32.200]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:33.800]  He understands black lives matter.
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:39.200]  And in the larger piece I listened to this morning, he again acts like conservatives really are racist and don't care.
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:40.700]  What a load of manure.
[02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:42.500]  As you said, it's conservatives.
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:48.200]  I know that actually really involved in real charities and education programs trying to build up communities.
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:52.000]  Patriots and Christians don't get off on somebody in squalor.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:57.100]  The left does and wants to put you in that to control you and then writes university plans on it.
[02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:58.100]  Cloward and Pevin.
[02:47:58.100 --> 02:47:59.400]  So, so let's play Glenn Beck.
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:00.400]  Here it is.
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:01.800]  And all pie matters.
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:03.700]  All pie matters.
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:07.500]  All pie matters.
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:08.700]  Okay, that's not the clip I wanted.
[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:10.700]  It's it's it's it's him on MPR.
[02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:13.700]  But yeah, there's an audio clip from MPR.
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:18.800]  I want to play sorry if I told you video where he just goes and apologizes for conservatives.
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:21.200]  And I'm just saying that's not who he represents.
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:24.400]  He does not get to go on TV shows.
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:25.000]  I mean, he can.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:31.600]  We're going to counter it and say that we're not conservatives, but he is when he supports Hillary Clinton for the office of the White House.
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:38.700]  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, if you support Glenn Beck, you have a serious problem because I just don't see how you do.
[02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:40.000]  No.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:45.800]  And how could he possibly think Hillary as president is a good idea?
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:49.200]  You know, did you get to see Dinesh D'Souza's film yet?
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:49.900]  Oh, yes.
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:50.600]  Yeah, finally.
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:51.300]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:53.700]  Everybody needs to see that film.
[02:48:53.700 --> 02:49:01.100]  And you realize the Democratic Party is responsible for so many of the ills of the minority population of our country.
[02:49:01.100 --> 02:49:04.200]  And it's just it's just as clear as day now.
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:12.400]  And surely, Glenn Beck has some historical context.
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:18.000]  He stands up and says Democrats are good for for the minority people.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:21.500]  I think he's being I think he's he looks completely insane.
[02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:25.300]  And I think he's being handled by people continuing here with the next clip.
[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:31.200]  I want to play the sister of the man that was shot, the felon waving guns at the black cop, waving a gun.
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:32.200]  So he got shot.
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:35.400]  I want to play her though, saying don't burn down the black area.
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:36.700]  Go burn down the suburb.
[02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:39.600]  It's code for white people.
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:42.000]  I mean, this is just absolutely crazy.
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:43.600]  But in a way, she's right.
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:47.900]  It's really dumb to burn down your own neighborhood because I saw quotes where we're going to burn down our own
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:48.900]  neighborhood.
[02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:50.900]  Let's go ahead and play that club.
[02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:55.900]  Oh, everything is going to go on fire for her love.
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:58.900]  Burning down is going to help nothing.
[02:49:58.900 --> 02:49:59.900]  Go burn it down.
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:01.900]  We need it more together.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:03.900]  Take the suburb.
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:04.900]  Burn that.
[02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:06.900]  We need our.
[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:08.900]  We need our weed.
[02:50:08.900 --> 02:50:10.900]  I don't wear it, but we need it.
[02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:11.900]  I'm going to skip this break, too.
[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:12.900]  I'm just done with all of it.
[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:13.900]  We're going to go a little bit the next hour, too.
[02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:18.900]  I think she already is coming up with Mr. Haven looking at this.
[02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:19.900]  What do you think?
[02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:22.900]  I mean, I know it's divide and conquer, but what's the larger game plan?
[02:50:22.900 --> 02:50:34.900]  Because the average white person is a totally guilt addled person that hates themselves and basically thinks that they've got all these things to prove that they've done her wrong.
[02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:36.900]  But then the media tells them we'll just support Obamacare.
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:39.900]  That's how you're not racist, which basically cuts people in their hours.
[02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:41.900]  It was a giant global screw job.
[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:44.900]  So I'm not bashing Christianity.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:50.900]  I'm a Christian, but it is abolitionists in England and then the U.S. that ended up finally ending slavery in the West.
[02:50:50.900 --> 02:50:54.900]  It still goes on today, but it's kind of trendy and cool in Africa or the Middle East.
[02:50:54.900 --> 02:51:02.900]  But they take our Christian ethos that's been taken away from us, but still, I don't want to call it guilt, Christian guilt, but caring about others.
[02:51:02.900 --> 02:51:12.900]  And they manipulate that to where you take the Republican Party that's the abolitionist Christians and you somehow transmuted around where they're the evil racists and the KKK Democrats are the good guys.
[02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:14.900]  What is the extrapolation?
[02:51:14.900 --> 02:51:19.900]  I mean, I can move four or five, you know, levels up here in chess, but how about 10 levels?
[02:51:19.900 --> 02:51:21.900]  Where is this going out there?
[02:51:21.900 --> 02:51:26.900]  Because for me, it seems so transparent and looks like it's going to fail.
[02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:28.900]  What's the larger plan?
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:31.900]  Well, it goes back to the Hegelian dialectic.
[02:51:31.900 --> 02:51:40.900]  And Hegel was a German philosopher in the early 1800s, and he designed, and of course this has been going on for thousands of years,
[02:51:40.900 --> 02:51:43.900]  but he figured out that if you want to acquire power, you create problems.
[02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:47.900]  And then when you come in with the solution, that's how you get control.
[02:51:47.900 --> 02:51:49.900]  And this has been in practice a long, long time.
[02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:55.900]  So ultimately, the globalist, the elitist, want to acquire power by creating chaos.
[02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:57.900]  And there's so many things.
[02:51:57.900 --> 02:51:59.900]  It's bringing in the Syrian refugees.
[02:51:59.900 --> 02:52:02.900]  It's opening the border, and it's also Black Lives Matter.
[02:52:02.900 --> 02:52:04.900]  It's all part of the strategy.
[02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:08.900]  So what people need to do is they need to think, and they need to think clearly.
[02:52:08.900 --> 02:52:13.900]  They need to have the confidence and their ability to really work through things.
[02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:15.900]  And I tell you, it's such a mess right now.
[02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:16.900]  It's been going on so long.
[02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:20.900]  I understand it's difficult to really get to the bottom of these things.
[02:52:20.900 --> 02:52:25.900]  The first thing I would do as an American is when I hear something on the news,
[02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:30.900]  when I see these events that are hard to explain, that are confusing,
[02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:35.900]  the police officers being shot in Dallas, as an example, or again in Baton Rouge,
[02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:40.900]  where initially there were multiple shooters, and then finally there's only one, and they're killed.
[02:52:40.900 --> 02:52:46.900]  I would question, in fact, I would assume it's a false flag, a psi-op,
[02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:49.900]  almost everything the government puts out and does right now.
[02:52:49.900 --> 02:52:54.900]  And make the assumption that it's probably not true because they lie to you,
[02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:56.900]  they lie to you, they lie to you.
[02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:02.900]  And from a position of doubt, begin to absorb this information and consider it.
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:07.900]  But this is all about creating chaos because that's where you acquire power.
[02:53:07.900 --> 02:53:12.900]  And if you think about it that way, it's actually quite simple right now.
[02:53:12.900 --> 02:53:17.900]  Whether it's the unvetted Syrians or them trying to take away our weapons,
[02:53:17.900 --> 02:53:21.900]  it's all by design to diminish America, to diminish our freedoms,
[02:53:21.900 --> 02:53:25.900]  our ability to protect ourselves, so that they can acquire power.
[02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:27.900]  And it's been going on a long time.
[02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:31.900]  And I tell you what, they've made tremendous inroads in succeeding.
[02:53:31.900 --> 02:53:36.900]  They have practically destroyed Europe through the influx of these immigrants.
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:40.900]  Sweden, the rape capital world.
[02:53:40.900 --> 02:53:43.900]  They're not bringing in Middle Easters or some of the nicer countries.
[02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:45.900]  They are bringing in people from failed states,
[02:53:45.900 --> 02:53:49.900]  where the Muslims run around murdering each other all day, and it's just hellish.
[02:53:49.900 --> 02:53:56.900]  And 80% of these immigrants are men of the age of being able to fight.
[02:53:56.900 --> 02:53:58.900]  They're not bringing in a lot of women and children.
[02:53:58.900 --> 02:54:00.900]  And they certainly are bringing in Christians.
[02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:02.900]  0.3%.
[02:54:02.900 --> 02:54:06.900]  Yeah, and the Christians are the ones that are being persecuted more than anybody.
[02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:07.900]  Then Obama makes jokes.
[02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:09.900]  So it really is just nasty anti-Christian garbage.
[02:54:09.900 --> 02:54:10.900]  What about the Pope coming out and saying,
[02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:13.900]  you don't want to hear about Christianity and it's horrible roots in Europe?
[02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:14.900]  Europe isn't Christian.
[02:54:14.900 --> 02:54:15.900]  I mean, that's a quote.
[02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:17.900]  That's extraordinary, isn't it?
[02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:19.900]  What are Catholics thinking?
[02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:21.900]  I mean, it seems like evil is making its move on every front.
[02:54:21.900 --> 02:54:23.900]  There's an intensification.
[02:54:23.900 --> 02:54:26.900]  Yeah, you know, I'm not Catholic, but I got a lot of friends that are.
[02:54:26.900 --> 02:54:29.900]  And I bring it up at my peril sometimes.
[02:54:29.900 --> 02:54:37.900]  And I tell you, they're either waking up and realizing the Pope has a different agenda,
[02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:45.900]  or they're in blind denial that the Pope is still this great guy who's just being misquoted all the time.
[02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:53.900]  But there's a great divide in the Catholic Church occurring right now as the Pope continues down his socialist path,
[02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:59.900]  which is empowering governments and really diminishing Christians in the Middle East.
[02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:03.900]  You know, he brings in the Imam into the Vatican.
[02:55:03.900 --> 02:55:05.900]  It's all over the top.
[02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:08.900]  If you told people 10 years ago this would be happening, they'd say you were crazy.
[02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:10.900]  It is hard to believe.
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:17.900]  You know, we've got to get people to look at the evidence because the evidence is in front of our eyes right now.
[02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:20.900]  The Pope calls for world government on a weekly basis?
[02:55:20.900 --> 02:55:22.900]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:55:22.900 --> 02:55:25.900]  So where does it go next after this thing?
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:33.900]  Well, you know, I can answer that from my own judgment or from the influence by the biblical.
[02:55:33.900 --> 02:55:34.900]  That's right.
[02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:37.900]  I think we're going to have world government.
[02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:43.900]  And this is where the Antichrist comes in the Mark of the Beast and, you know, the Bible talks about it.
[02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:45.900]  They're already saying get rid of cash.
[02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:46.900]  It's all happening.
[02:55:46.900 --> 02:55:47.900]  Yep.
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:52.900]  So the question is, what can we do to not be victims of it?
[02:55:52.900 --> 02:56:04.900]  And I've kind of held out for a long time and I've talked to the governor about this, that Texas might be a sanctuary where we stand against the tyranny of an out of control federal government.
[02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:13.900]  But you know, with Obama could snap his fingers and create an economic emergency.
[02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:16.900]  And under an emergency like that can declare martial law.
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:20.900]  And then the second right, freedom of speech, all these things are gone.
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:25.900]  And so instead of, you know, eroding them and trying to do it through either executive.
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:27.900]  And maybe building up the big move.
[02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:28.900]  I'm afraid.
[02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:30.900]  And the answer at that point is this is the big test.
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:31.900]  Don't submit.
[02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:32.900]  Speak out even more.
[02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:33.900]  Yep.
[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:34.900]  The Bibles are clear about it.
[02:56:34.900 --> 02:56:36.900]  If you take the mark, you're lost.
[02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:39.900]  So we are facing some serious times.
[02:56:39.900 --> 02:56:41.900]  You know, it kind of brings us back to our movie.
[02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:50.900]  The theme of the movie is that there's going to be by design an EMP attack on America.
[02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:51.900]  Let's get to that in a minute.
[02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:54.900]  I'm sorry, Gary, but you just said that it's so epic.
[02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:57.900]  They've got ABC saying every child will soon have a microchip.
[02:56:57.900 --> 02:56:58.900]  Yeah.
[02:56:58.900 --> 02:56:59.900]  It's all happening.
[02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:03.900]  Everything the Bible talked about is actually unfolding now.
[02:57:03.900 --> 02:57:06.900]  And the mainline churches aren't even making a big deal about it.
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:08.900]  And we're just sitting here witnessing all this.
[02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:09.900]  This is crazy.
[02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:11.900]  You know, that's hard.
[02:57:11.900 --> 02:57:18.900]  The Bible says there's going to be wars, rumors of wars, earthquakes, diverse places.
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:19.900]  A world government.
[02:57:19.900 --> 02:57:21.900]  We got to have a mark in the hand of the forehead to buy or sell.
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:22.900]  It's here.
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:23.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:24.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:24.900 --> 02:57:25.900]  The technology is here.
[02:57:25.900 --> 02:57:32.900]  And behind the technology, you see the movements, political, global, where they are bring financial,
[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:35.900]  where they're bringing all this into very likely outcome.
[02:57:35.900 --> 02:57:38.900]  And it's so obvious now.
[02:57:38.900 --> 02:57:39.900]  People should not.
[02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:43.900]  I've studied the elite themselves and they are into the occult and believe Lucifer is God.
[02:57:43.900 --> 02:57:44.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:45.900]  And that's the end of the deal.
[02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:46.900]  Global.
[02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:49.900]  And then Lucifer is telling him, I'm going to give you eternal life and all knowledge.
[02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:50.900]  Same thing he said in the garden.
[02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:55.900]  And he go, okay, well, the garden didn't exist, you know, or whatever you're an atheist, but it's happening now.
[02:57:55.900 --> 02:57:56.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:56.900 --> 02:57:59.900]  Whether it's Peter Thiel or Ray Kurzweil, they're all saying we're going to be gods.
[02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:00.900]  We're going to be gods.
[02:58:00.900 --> 02:58:02.900]  It's all Genesis.
[02:58:02.900 --> 02:58:05.900]  It's, it's, it's amazing, isn't it?
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:12.900]  And I tell you, I'm trying to wake up Christians in particular because they just think God, God gave us this info beforehand.
[02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:13.900]  Yep.
[02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:14.900]  And I think for a purpose.
[02:58:14.900 --> 02:58:19.900]  And we're fulfilling that purpose right now because we're, we're, we're teaching it to people.
[02:58:19.900 --> 02:58:25.900]  We're calling you and saying, imagine being people in the desert 2000 years ago in scrolls and caves, writing all this down.
[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:26.900]  And it's happening.
[02:58:26.900 --> 02:58:28.900]  Stay there.
[02:58:28.900 --> 02:58:31.900]  I mean, the film, American, everybody needs to see it.
[02:58:31.900 --> 02:58:32.900]  Great way to wake people up.

[02:59:28.900 --> 02:59:32.900]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:59:32.900 --> 02:59:38.900]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.

[02:59:50.900 --> 02:59:53.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:53.900 --> 03:00:00.900]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:00.900 --> 03:00:03.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:03.900 --> 03:00:09.900]  Gary Amons, our guest of Merrigan, this is a film exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[03:00:09.900 --> 03:00:16.900]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Anthony Guilherme and I will be back with a new episode.
[03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:23.900]  Gary Amons, our guest of Merrigan, this is a film exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[03:00:23.900 --> 03:00:25.900]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Anthony Guilherme is going to come in here in the studio.
[03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:27.900]  I'm overriding things right now.
[03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:30.900]  I'm going to take over the last 30 minutes with a lot of fresh news and info.
[03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:36.900]  Not only news is the night's 7 o'clock Central, our reporters are going to Milwaukee where Trump's giving a speech tomorrow outside Milwaukee
[03:00:36.900 --> 03:00:40.900]  and where there will probably be more riots and shooting tonight to cover that.
[03:00:40.900 --> 03:00:44.900]  Finishing up the whole Black Lives Matter thing in the short segment, Gary.
[03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:48.900]  Beck has come out and said, we need to love everybody and understand this.
[03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:54.900]  But again, that's to make him look like the new sweet conservative, the guy that apologizes for conservatives because we're bad.
[03:00:54.900 --> 03:01:00.900]  No, we need to say, as a patriot, I don't do conservative or liberal, I just try to do the right thing.
[03:01:00.900 --> 03:01:08.900]  We have groups funded by foreign globalists and Nazi collaborators like this horrible person, George Soros.
[03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:14.900]  They're doing this. No, the Black Lives Matter movement is a compromised, bad organization. We say that's bad.
[03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:17.900]  But obviously we understand the plight of people in their cities.
[03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:19.900]  Do you agree with that statement?
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:26.900]  Absolutely. We need to have empathy, but we also need to use our brains.
[03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:30.900]  They released a study last month.
[03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:35.900]  There were 950 shootings by police officers in America in the first six months.
[03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:39.900]  Roughly 250 of them were Blacks being shot.
[03:01:39.900 --> 03:01:42.900]  And many of them were shot by Black police officers.
[03:01:42.900 --> 03:01:47.900]  But the other 750 were almost exclusively White.
[03:01:47.900 --> 03:01:54.900]  So we've got a problem, but it's not necessarily that we're shooting Black people unfairly.
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:56.900]  Statistically, that is. That's the facts.
[03:01:56.900 --> 03:02:01.900]  Well, that's the fact. That's what's crazy. It's the biggest story in the world. It's made up.
[03:02:01.900 --> 03:02:07.900]  While they abort over half the Black babies and almost millions.
[03:02:07.900 --> 03:02:17.900]  Let's play the clip back. Here he is on NPR. He's the new guy that goes on and makes her look bad and apologizes for the conservatives.
[03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:21.900]  I think it's important for us to appeal to everybody.
[03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:28.900]  I had a new kind of thought on Black Lives Matter and the All Lives Matter thing.
[03:02:28.900 --> 03:02:38.900]  And the best way to explain it is, if we're all sitting around at a table having dinner and everybody gets pie, except for you.
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:42.900]  And you say, my pie matters. I don't have pie.
[03:02:42.900 --> 03:02:46.900]  And everybody at the table looks at you and says, I know all pie matters.
[03:02:46.900 --> 03:02:50.900]  It shows that the people at the table aren't really listening.
[03:02:50.900 --> 03:02:54.900]  I don't agree with the Black Lives Matter organizers.
[03:02:54.900 --> 03:03:01.900]  They are stated as anti-capitalists. And it's much more than just the police to them.
[03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:04.900]  It's about changing society entirely.
[03:03:04.900 --> 03:03:08.900]  But I can relate to them and understand them on many different fronts.
[03:03:08.900 --> 03:03:14.900]  And we need to start listening to each other and getting out of our own little...
[03:03:14.900 --> 03:03:16.900]  The clip cuts out there.
[03:03:16.900 --> 03:03:21.900]  That is very, very twisted because statistically it's an issue going on everywhere.
[03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:24.900]  And it is an issue, but compared to all the other issues, it's small.
[03:03:24.900 --> 03:03:27.900]  It's artificially manipulated by the social engineers.
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:31.900]  And here he is saying, no, you've got no pie.
[03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:36.900]  Well, no, if a cop out of control shoots you, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, that's an issue.
[03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:39.900]  But I mean, he's implying that the other lives actually don't matter.
[03:03:39.900 --> 03:03:42.900]  That even though they died, they still got pie.
[03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:45.900]  You know, I don't know what to tell, he said.
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:47.900]  All pie matters.
[03:03:47.900 --> 03:03:52.900]  Well, he's saying, you're at the table, you didn't get pie. And then you say, I want my pie.
[03:03:52.900 --> 03:03:55.900]  And they go, well, all pie matters.
[03:03:55.900 --> 03:03:58.900]  Everybody's had a piece of pie taken.
[03:03:58.900 --> 03:04:00.900]  I'm telling you, man, it is the freaking...
[03:04:00.900 --> 03:04:01.900]  Bizarre.
[03:04:01.900 --> 03:04:03.900]  Well, the point is, I don't know how long this is going to go on.
[03:04:03.900 --> 03:04:06.900]  I don't know how Clear Channel has this on, 500 radio stations.
[03:04:06.900 --> 03:04:07.900]  That's right.
[03:04:07.900 --> 03:04:09.900]  I tune into it sometimes and it sounds like...
[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:11.900]  I don't mean to get off and glint back.
[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:13.900]  By the way, there's another stat on that thing, too.
[03:04:13.900 --> 03:04:23.900]  Black population is only 13%, but about 25% of them represented the cops killing people.
[03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:29.900]  The problem is 65% of violent crime is committed by black people.
[03:04:29.900 --> 03:04:33.900]  That's a fact, because it's been culturally inculcated in this whole gang culture.
[03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:36.900]  And of course, the real problem is black on black killing.
[03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:38.900]  You know, that's way, way beyond.
[03:04:38.900 --> 03:04:41.900]  You know, on Chicago, I think on Saturday, there were 12 of them.
[03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:47.900]  By the way, there's a lot of cultural research on that, but there's also epigenetic research on that.
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:49.900]  That's why whites only kill whites, too.
[03:04:49.900 --> 03:04:50.900]  It's not just proximity.
[03:04:50.900 --> 03:04:55.900]  There is cultural, basically, race memory and killing and having an enemy that looks like you.
[03:04:55.900 --> 03:04:57.900]  So there's some heavy research.
[03:04:57.900 --> 03:05:23.900]  We'll be back.
[03:05:28.900 --> 03:05:33.900]  Remember, he started attacking the media as state-run propaganda not long after he entered the race last year.
[03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:35.900]  In the second hit piece, which is barely worth mentioning,
[03:05:35.900 --> 03:05:39.900]  claimed that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort has intimate ties with, quote,
[03:05:39.900 --> 03:05:42.900]  politically corrupt pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine.
[03:05:42.900 --> 03:05:47.900]  You mean the same Ukraine that was overthrown by George Soros and Western governments to geopolitically isolate Russia?
[03:05:47.900 --> 03:05:50.900]  One of the few countries not controlled by the global elite?
[03:05:50.900 --> 03:05:54.900]  And to find out more about the desperation of the New York Times and establishment media in general,

[03:06:58.900 --> 03:07:03.900]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob Do joins us.
[03:07:03.900 --> 03:07:07.900]  You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours. Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:07:07.900 --> 03:07:11.900]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:11.900 --> 03:07:14.900]  I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run-down.
[03:07:14.900 --> 03:07:18.900]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it, and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:18.900 --> 03:07:23.900]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like...
[03:07:23.900 --> 03:07:25.900]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:25.900 --> 03:07:28.900]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[03:07:28.900 --> 03:07:32.900]  Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise,
[03:07:32.900 --> 03:07:38.900]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:38.900 --> 03:07:42.900]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[03:07:42.900 --> 03:07:48.900]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce, and came in.
[03:07:48.900 --> 03:08:13.900]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:13.900 --> 03:08:28.900]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.900 --> 03:08:34.900]  Okay, Roger Stone has never called me this...
[03:08:34.900 --> 03:08:38.900]  I want to say upset this excited.
[03:08:38.900 --> 03:08:48.900]  I'm going to go ahead and just post all the sour.
[03:08:48.900 --> 03:08:54.900]  Gary Haven has said he wants to ride shotgun with us, so that is going to continue on here.
[03:08:54.900 --> 03:08:58.900]  We were getting into crime statistics and things.
[03:08:58.900 --> 03:09:05.900]  It's just not fair to say there's an epidemic of white officers killing black people when it doesn't exist.
[03:09:05.900 --> 03:09:08.900]  So, we're not going, aha, we proved you black people wrong.
[03:09:08.900 --> 03:09:15.900]  We're saying this is total manipulation by a horrible war criminal who will go into Arab countries and put the radical Muslims in charge,
[03:09:15.900 --> 03:09:19.900]  who will go into one country and put Nazis in charge, and overthrow governments.
[03:09:19.900 --> 03:09:22.900]  I mean, he is a literal, literal James Bond villain.
[03:09:22.900 --> 03:09:25.900]  I mean, the new James Bond movie, it's the name of his company.
[03:09:25.900 --> 03:09:27.900]  It's a quantum.
[03:09:27.900 --> 03:09:29.900]  So, MI6 knows who they're dealing with.
[03:09:29.900 --> 03:09:30.900]  He crashed the pound.
[03:09:30.900 --> 03:09:32.900]  He crashes countries.
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:34.900]  He's trying to stir people up.
[03:09:34.900 --> 03:09:36.900]  And we can sit here and laugh because it has entertainment value.
[03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:39.900]  The lady going, you know, we need our hair products.
[03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:40.900]  Don't burn down the neighborhood.
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:41.900]  In fact, we're going to go through some of those clips.
[03:09:41.900 --> 03:09:47.900]  But we shouldn't laugh so much as we see how sad it is because everybody's buying into some form of propaganda.
[03:09:47.900 --> 03:09:49.900]  So, I want to run through some of these clips.
[03:09:49.900 --> 03:09:52.900]  Let's play the sister of the guy that's dead.
[03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:54.900]  And she's saying, don't burn up your known neighborhood.
[03:09:54.900 --> 03:09:55.900]  Go to the suburbs.
[03:09:55.900 --> 03:09:56.900]  We're going to run through these clips.
[03:09:56.900 --> 03:09:58.900]  And I'm going to get into some of the other clips on TPP.
[03:09:58.900 --> 03:10:07.900]  You name it, with Gary Haven, who is the producer of Amerageddon now exclusively available for the next week or so before it's in stores nationwide at m4store.com.
[03:10:07.900 --> 03:10:09.900]  But let's go to that clip.
[03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:11.900]  Oh, everything.
[03:10:11.900 --> 03:10:14.900]  So, it's going to go on fire for her love.
[03:10:14.900 --> 03:10:17.900]  Burning down s*** ain't going to have nothing.
[03:10:17.900 --> 03:10:20.900]  Go burning down s*** we need in our community.
[03:10:20.900 --> 03:10:22.900]  Take the s*** into the suburbs.
[03:10:22.900 --> 03:10:24.900]  Burn that s*** today.
[03:10:24.900 --> 03:10:25.900]  We need our s***.
[03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:27.900]  We need our weed.
[03:10:27.900 --> 03:10:30.900]  I don't wear it, but we need it.
[03:10:30.900 --> 03:10:32.900]  We need our weaves.
[03:10:32.900 --> 03:10:33.900]  So, that's the classic woman.
[03:10:33.900 --> 03:10:36.900]  You know, we need our lipstick and our everything else.
[03:10:36.900 --> 03:10:38.900]  I tell you, that comes first.
[03:10:38.900 --> 03:10:39.900]  I got a lot of women.
[03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:40.900]  They're so sweet.
[03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:42.900]  But she's saying horrible stuff, though.
[03:10:42.900 --> 03:10:45.900]  Go burn down the white people's neighborhood.
[03:10:45.900 --> 03:10:47.900]  But I got to say, that's a step up from...
[03:10:47.900 --> 03:10:50.900]  I've got this one clip we played yesterday where the guy says,
[03:10:50.900 --> 03:10:51.900]  you're going to find it.
[03:10:51.900 --> 03:10:52.900]  I shouldn't laugh.
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:53.900]  But man, this stuff's so sad.
[03:10:53.900 --> 03:10:54.900]  I got to have some gallows humor.
[03:10:54.900 --> 03:10:56.900]  I laugh at myself too, folks.
[03:10:56.900 --> 03:10:58.900]  But they got this guy going.
[03:10:58.900 --> 03:10:59.900]  We need stuff.
[03:10:59.900 --> 03:11:01.900]  The rich people aren't giving us money.
[03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:04.900]  So, we burn down our own neighborhoods the quote.
[03:11:04.900 --> 03:11:05.900]  I saw it.
[03:11:05.900 --> 03:11:06.900]  This is extraordinary.
[03:11:06.900 --> 03:11:09.900]  I mean, what in earth is going on here?
[03:11:09.900 --> 03:11:12.900]  I'll tell you, here's the good news, Alex.
[03:11:12.900 --> 03:11:17.900]  This group of people that are saying these things is the minority.
[03:11:17.900 --> 03:11:21.900]  Most black people in this country, they're God-fearing.
[03:11:21.900 --> 03:11:22.900]  They want to raise their kids.
[03:11:22.900 --> 03:11:24.900]  They want them educated.
[03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:26.900]  And we got to support them.
[03:11:26.900 --> 03:11:27.900]  They don't care about their families.
[03:11:27.900 --> 03:11:28.900]  You betcha.
[03:11:28.900 --> 03:11:29.900]  Well, no, absolutely.
[03:11:29.900 --> 03:11:31.900]  But look at the media pushing the narrative.
[03:11:31.900 --> 03:11:32.900]  Oh, yeah.
[03:11:32.900 --> 03:11:34.900]  Do you think Soros, because that's who they admit.
[03:11:34.900 --> 03:11:36.900]  I mean, he's targeting groups that don't want open borders,
[03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:37.900]  came out in his emails.
[03:11:37.900 --> 03:11:40.900]  He wants jihadis in the U.S.
[03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:42.900]  Do you think it's a winning strategy?
[03:11:42.900 --> 03:11:44.900]  Well, it's been effective.
[03:11:44.900 --> 03:11:45.900]  So, here's the deal.
[03:11:45.900 --> 03:11:46.900]  I'm not against the Muslims in general,
[03:11:46.900 --> 03:11:48.900]  and I'm not against black people either.
[03:11:48.900 --> 03:11:51.900]  But I'm not going to make an excuse and provide those in.
[03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:55.900]  I haven't done anything to anybody, and it's just not true.
[03:11:55.900 --> 03:11:59.900]  And so, it's just crazy, because if I respond to it all sweet,
[03:11:59.900 --> 03:12:02.900]  people think I'm guilty and they don't listen.
[03:12:02.900 --> 03:12:05.900]  How do I slap folks upside the head in a loving way?
[03:12:05.900 --> 03:12:06.900]  I don't mean black people.
[03:12:06.900 --> 03:12:10.900]  I mean, mainly the white pimps of this that push it and use it.
[03:12:10.900 --> 03:12:11.900]  Yeah.
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:15.900]  You know, you do your best to state facts, to state the truth
[03:12:15.900 --> 03:12:17.900]  and the motive that's going on there,
[03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:20.900]  and you just pray to God that some of these people will start listening.
[03:12:20.900 --> 03:12:22.900]  They'll wake up and see the evidence.
[03:12:22.900 --> 03:12:24.900]  The evidence is clear.
[03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:26.900]  And what you're saying makes a lot more sense
[03:12:26.900 --> 03:12:28.900]  than the myths that they're perpetrating.
[03:12:28.900 --> 03:12:33.900]  You know, it reminds me, I remember when Obek over there
[03:12:33.900 --> 03:12:36.900]  referred to George Soros as spooky dude.
[03:12:36.900 --> 03:12:40.900]  I wonder if spooky dude has become his new hero
[03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:43.900]  since he's aligned himself with Black Lives Matter.
[03:12:43.900 --> 03:12:44.900]  I was told this.
[03:12:44.900 --> 03:12:47.900]  I was told that Glenn Beck met four years ago with George Soros
[03:12:47.900 --> 03:12:49.900]  in New York for a three-hour meeting.
[03:12:49.900 --> 03:12:50.900]  Yeah.
[03:12:50.900 --> 03:12:52.900]  I've never said that till now.
[03:12:52.900 --> 03:12:54.900]  And I was told this by Beck's security detail.
[03:12:54.900 --> 03:12:56.900]  You know, folks better watch what they're saying
[03:12:56.900 --> 03:12:58.900]  in front of their security details,
[03:12:58.900 --> 03:13:00.900]  because these guys are patriots on average.
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:01.900]  Yeah.
[03:13:01.900 --> 03:13:02.900]  That's an interesting thought.
[03:13:02.900 --> 03:13:04.900]  A lot of good information comes from these people
[03:13:04.900 --> 03:13:06.900]  who actually care about this country.
[03:13:06.900 --> 03:13:08.900]  We saw how he went running to Zuckerberg.
[03:13:08.900 --> 03:13:09.900]  Yeah.
[03:13:09.900 --> 03:13:11.900]  I don't want to get off into a Beck bash fest.
[03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:12.900]  Let's play a few more of these clips.
[03:13:12.900 --> 03:13:14.900]  Let's get to something that I haven't mentioned these
[03:13:14.900 --> 03:13:17.900]  and get off the hole, drag the white people out of their cars.
[03:13:17.900 --> 03:13:19.900]  The media actually, this is a good thing.
[03:13:19.900 --> 03:13:21.900]  Again, just to further stir it up.
[03:13:21.900 --> 03:13:23.900]  Let's talk about Gary Johnson, quote,
[03:13:23.900 --> 03:13:25.900]  I would sign the TPP.
[03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:27.900]  Now, I've had Gary Johnson in studio over the years.
[03:13:27.900 --> 03:13:29.900]  Let's not exaggerate.
[03:13:29.900 --> 03:13:30.900]  Probably 10 times.
[03:13:30.900 --> 03:13:33.900]  I've known Gary Johnson for,
[03:13:33.900 --> 03:13:36.900]  since he was governor of New Mexico, probably 15 years.
[03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:38.900]  And he used to kind of be a real person
[03:13:38.900 --> 03:13:39.900]  when you'd meet him and stuff.
[03:13:39.900 --> 03:13:41.900]  The last four or five times I met him,
[03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:42.900]  he was like a robot.
[03:13:42.900 --> 03:13:44.900]  And I've never met anybody like this in my life.
[03:13:44.900 --> 03:13:46.900]  And he'd be here and I'm like, well, thanks for being here.
[03:13:46.900 --> 03:13:47.900]  Thank you.
[03:13:47.900 --> 03:13:48.900]  Alex, good to see you.
[03:13:48.900 --> 03:13:49.900]  He'd have a son with him who like runs his campaign.
[03:13:49.900 --> 03:13:50.900]  You know, good looking guy.
[03:13:50.900 --> 03:13:52.900]  I'm, you know, almost been laged, whatever the point is.
[03:13:52.900 --> 03:13:53.900]  It'd be him and his son.
[03:13:53.900 --> 03:13:54.900]  I'd be like, well, how's it going?
[03:13:54.900 --> 03:13:55.900]  Great.
[03:13:55.900 --> 03:13:56.900]  I'll see you later.
[03:13:56.900 --> 03:13:58.900]  It was just really, the son was like kind of,
[03:13:58.900 --> 03:14:00.900]  I picked up this was an enemy camp.
[03:14:00.900 --> 03:14:01.900]  Yeah.
[03:14:01.900 --> 03:14:04.900]  And that he was just shielding himself to like have no emotion.
[03:14:04.900 --> 03:14:05.900]  Thank you.
[03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:06.900]  Good to see you.
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:08.900]  Now, I don't mean to be mean about that,
[03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:09.900]  but he's been in the studio.
[03:14:09.900 --> 03:14:10.900]  What do you make of that?
[03:14:10.900 --> 03:14:13.900]  Well, you know, the, the Libertarians
[03:14:13.900 --> 03:14:15.900]  under his leadership have just gone off the deep end.
[03:14:15.900 --> 03:14:16.900]  It's extraordinary.
[03:14:16.900 --> 03:14:23.900]  You know, what people need to understand about the TPP is that there is a panel of,
[03:14:23.900 --> 03:14:32.900]  of, of judges that will see cases where corporations who have been damaged by
[03:14:32.900 --> 03:14:37.900]  sovereign laws of states in this panel will,
[03:14:37.900 --> 03:14:42.900]  will make a decision whether a company has lost profits in that panel will make
[03:14:42.900 --> 03:14:44.900]  the decision on how much that profit is.
[03:14:44.900 --> 03:14:49.900]  You can't, you, you, there's no right to appeal to sovereignty to your own country.
[03:14:49.900 --> 03:14:52.900]  If they find that you've damaged a country by law in Texas,
[03:14:52.900 --> 03:14:57.900]  it prevents GMO, for example, which isn't likely to happen anytime soon.
[03:14:57.900 --> 03:14:59.900]  Why does it seems control the foreign groups?
[03:14:59.900 --> 03:15:00.900]  Yeah.
[03:15:00.900 --> 03:15:06.900]  We give, we get it over rides sovereignty and how can the Libertarians
[03:15:06.900 --> 03:15:11.900]  support a trade agreement that overrides the sovereignty of individuals?
[03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:15.900]  How do you support open borders if Mexico doesn't pay for anchor babies?
[03:15:15.900 --> 03:15:16.900]  But we do.
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:17.900]  It's not fair.
[03:15:17.900 --> 03:15:18.900]  Yeah.
[03:15:18.900 --> 03:15:21.900]  We wouldn't have basically anybody bad immigrating here if we didn't have any welfare.
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:22.900]  Yeah.
[03:15:22.900 --> 03:15:25.900]  Well, you know, I used to think of myself as a Libertarian.
[03:15:25.900 --> 03:15:27.900]  I used to too, not anymore.
[03:15:27.900 --> 03:15:28.900]  Yeah.
[03:15:28.900 --> 03:15:29.900]  Not since Gary Johnson.
[03:15:29.900 --> 03:15:32.900]  It is like, it's a joke.
[03:15:32.900 --> 03:15:35.900]  Oh, by the way, I've always been for decriminalization because I don't like the drug war.
[03:15:35.900 --> 03:15:36.900]  Yeah.
[03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:37.900]  But I mean, I love the drug culture.
[03:15:37.900 --> 03:15:41.900]  All they've done with this marijuana legalization is keep the feds where they bust you, have
[03:15:41.900 --> 03:15:45.900]  money at the state level, and then put everybody in a database that smoke and pot and basically
[03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:46.900]  take your kids.
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:47.900]  Yeah.
[03:15:47.900 --> 03:15:48.900]  They're basically just institutionalized.
[03:15:48.900 --> 03:15:51.900]  And this new marijuana, and I've said this before, I've never liked pot in my life.
[03:15:51.900 --> 03:15:55.900]  I don't say that to say, you know, I'm an anti-drug guy.
[03:15:55.900 --> 03:15:57.900]  I just don't like it.
[03:15:57.900 --> 03:15:58.900]  Alcohol is my issue.
[03:15:58.900 --> 03:16:00.900]  And I've always had an issue with it.
[03:16:00.900 --> 03:16:01.900]  And I like it.
[03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:02.900]  I mean, I won't lie.
[03:16:02.900 --> 03:16:04.900]  But I don't like stimulants.
[03:16:04.900 --> 03:16:08.900]  And I don't like, you know, stuff like marijuana that's in the hallucination class.
[03:16:08.900 --> 03:16:14.900]  But I, once a year or so, will be at an event, a party, out in LA, and there's some marijuana.
[03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:16.900]  And I want to know what it's like.
[03:16:16.900 --> 03:16:20.900]  I won't even do it anymore because I smoked some about a year and a half ago and couldn't
[03:16:20.900 --> 03:16:22.900]  get out of a chair for three hours.
[03:16:22.900 --> 03:16:26.900]  And folks, I don't do this anymore, but I can drink, you know, an entire jug of Jack Daniels
[03:16:26.900 --> 03:16:28.900]  and you won't even think I'm drunk.
[03:16:28.900 --> 03:16:32.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, this marijuana is so weaponized now, and they've genetically engineered
[03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:35.900]  a lot of it, this is coming out, that I'm telling you, you better watch out.
[03:16:35.900 --> 03:16:38.900]  Marijuana is seriously dangerous now.
[03:16:38.900 --> 03:16:40.900]  And I'm not saying put people in jail for it.
[03:16:40.900 --> 03:16:41.900]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:16:41.900 --> 03:16:42.900]  Let's be clear.
[03:16:42.900 --> 03:16:44.900]  But I want to put this out here.
[03:16:44.900 --> 03:16:47.900]  Marijuana now, the stuff going out there is weaponized.
[03:16:47.900 --> 03:16:48.900]  Yeah.
[03:16:48.900 --> 03:16:50.900]  You know, I'm with you on the drug war.
[03:16:50.900 --> 03:16:56.900]  It's by design to acquire control, give control over to the government.
[03:16:56.900 --> 03:17:00.900]  And it's been very, very successful with that.
[03:17:00.900 --> 03:17:02.900]  I agree.
[03:17:02.900 --> 03:17:04.900]  A lot of friends will disagree with me on this.
[03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:10.900]  We need to do away with these drug laws because all they have done is give power to the government.
[03:17:10.900 --> 03:17:12.900]  But that doesn't mean we endorse the drugs.
[03:17:12.900 --> 03:17:16.900]  But here's the thing, Soros again, involved with the legalization of the pushing.
[03:17:16.900 --> 03:17:19.900]  Just because we're against putting everybody in prison doesn't mean we endorse the whole,
[03:17:19.900 --> 03:17:21.900]  have three-year-old smoke pie.
[03:17:21.900 --> 03:17:22.900]  Yeah.
[03:17:22.900 --> 03:17:25.900]  Especially when grown men can't get out of chairs when they smoke it.
[03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:26.900]  Yeah.
[03:17:26.900 --> 03:17:28.900]  I've observed the same thing.
[03:17:28.900 --> 03:17:31.900]  It's a dangerous thing right now.
[03:17:31.900 --> 03:17:32.900]  It's funny.
[03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:36.900]  I found myself agreeing with moveon.org over a few things.
[03:17:36.900 --> 03:17:37.900]  Now, is that spooky?
[03:17:37.900 --> 03:17:40.900]  Well, they got to have a few issues that make sense.
[03:17:40.900 --> 03:17:41.900]  Yeah.
[03:17:41.900 --> 03:17:51.900]  So, if it comes to freedom and personal responsibility, that's really where I go with this whole thing.
[03:17:51.900 --> 03:17:59.900]  At the end of the day, if you're not responsible for yourself, someone or some other thing will assume responsibility.
[03:17:59.900 --> 03:18:00.900]  Well, sure.
[03:18:00.900 --> 03:18:05.900]  I remember being in high school and smoking some pot and it kind of, you felt a little bit.
[03:18:05.900 --> 03:18:11.900]  But the stuff now, I'm just saying, it is like a mule kicks you out.
[03:18:11.900 --> 03:18:14.900]  I don't know what they've done with the pot or whatever it is because I'm always saying,
[03:18:14.900 --> 03:18:16.900]  oh, I smoke it once a year to test it like I'm a cop.
[03:18:16.900 --> 03:18:17.900]  No, I literally do.
[03:18:17.900 --> 03:18:19.900]  So, I can be up to speed.
[03:18:19.900 --> 03:18:21.900]  And I'm telling you, I don't know what they've done to it, man.
[03:18:21.900 --> 03:18:22.900]  It is strong, Gary.
[03:18:22.900 --> 03:18:27.900]  Well, you know, it's consistent with 25% of the American population are on psychotropic drugs.
[03:18:27.900 --> 03:18:28.900]  Same thing.
[03:18:28.900 --> 03:18:29.900]  Yeah.
[03:18:29.900 --> 03:18:30.900]  So, they're just...
[03:18:30.900 --> 03:18:32.900]  I mean, I'm very anti-drugs when I'm getting in here.
[03:18:32.900 --> 03:18:33.900]  Yeah.
[03:18:33.900 --> 03:18:34.900]  Yeah.
[03:18:34.900 --> 03:18:35.900]  And I am too.
[03:18:35.900 --> 03:18:36.900]  But I don't want to lock somebody up.
[03:18:36.900 --> 03:18:37.900]  They can call a prozac.
[03:18:37.900 --> 03:18:38.900]  Yeah.
[03:18:38.900 --> 03:18:44.900]  I read a study just two days ago that 75% of the people that are on anti-depressant drugs
[03:18:44.900 --> 03:18:46.900]  are not depressed.
[03:18:46.900 --> 03:18:52.020]  So, I know people that go in for back surgery and they go, oh, would you like a prescription
[03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:53.020]  anti-depressant?
[03:18:53.020 --> 03:18:55.900]  And they'll just write there, oh, we've got a psychologist right here on psychot...
[03:18:55.900 --> 03:18:57.900]  They come right in and just, oh, there's your...
[03:18:57.900 --> 03:18:58.900]  Yeah.
[03:18:58.900 --> 03:18:59.900]  Yeah.
[03:18:59.900 --> 03:19:00.900]  If you're sad, you can...
[03:19:00.900 --> 03:19:02.900]  I went in for my 40th checkup few years ago and the guy was a nice doctor.
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:04.900]  He was like, hey, you want a script for Viagra?
[03:19:04.900 --> 03:19:05.900]  You want a script for this?
[03:19:05.900 --> 03:19:06.900]  You want a script for...
[03:19:06.900 --> 03:19:07.900]  I was like, do you do this for everybody?
[03:19:07.900 --> 03:19:08.900]  I think, oh, yeah, that's what we do.
[03:19:08.900 --> 03:19:09.900]  They were just trying to just give me scripts.
[03:19:09.900 --> 03:19:10.900]  Yeah.
[03:19:10.900 --> 03:19:11.900]  I was like...
[03:19:11.900 --> 03:19:12.900]  Did you get the Viagra?
[03:19:12.900 --> 03:19:13.900]  I did.
[03:19:13.900 --> 03:19:14.900]  I did.
[03:19:14.900 --> 03:19:19.900]  You know, all it made me do was see blurred vision.
[03:19:19.900 --> 03:19:20.900]  I didn't like it.
[03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:22.900]  I think I was already doing okay.
[03:19:22.900 --> 03:19:26.900]  Oh, we're going to do a little too good, man.
[03:19:26.900 --> 03:19:27.900]  No, I mean, I did.
[03:19:27.900 --> 03:19:28.900]  I did.
[03:19:28.900 --> 03:19:29.900]  I did.
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:30.900]  Yeah.
[03:19:30.900 --> 03:19:31.900]  And I'll tell you what's crazy, though.
[03:19:31.900 --> 03:19:32.900]  And then this is a pitch.
[03:19:32.900 --> 03:19:35.900]  Speaking of the devil, I'm going to skip this break too.
[03:19:35.900 --> 03:19:37.900]  No, I went in.
[03:19:37.900 --> 03:19:38.900]  He's just a great doctor.
[03:19:38.900 --> 03:19:39.900]  They took all this blood work.
[03:19:39.900 --> 03:19:41.900]  He goes, you have that checkup 20-something years?
[03:19:41.900 --> 03:19:42.900]  I said, no.
[03:19:42.900 --> 03:19:44.900]  They reattached my finger 10 years ago.
[03:19:44.900 --> 03:19:45.900]  That's my only doctor's visit.
[03:19:45.900 --> 03:19:46.900]  And he goes, well, blah, blah, blah.
[03:19:46.900 --> 03:19:47.900]  And so they took all this blood.
[03:19:47.900 --> 03:19:50.900]  I came back a month later, and they had all these computer diagrams and the blood work
[03:19:50.900 --> 03:19:51.900]  and everything.
[03:19:51.900 --> 03:19:52.900]  It's all high-tech down.
[03:19:52.900 --> 03:19:53.900]  He's one of the top guys.
[03:19:53.900 --> 03:19:54.900]  He's an awesome, real nice guy.
[03:19:54.900 --> 03:19:55.900]  And he turned out he was a listener.
[03:19:55.900 --> 03:19:56.900]  And so he was just being friendly.
[03:19:56.900 --> 03:19:59.900]  But I think you can see Alice in that.
[03:19:59.900 --> 03:20:01.900]  So I kind of got both.
[03:20:01.900 --> 03:20:03.900]  And then I just took it just to see.
[03:20:03.900 --> 03:20:05.900]  And it was like, eh.
[03:20:05.900 --> 03:20:07.900]  And I think it's almost like placebo or something.
[03:20:07.900 --> 03:20:08.900]  And I'm not knocking these things.
[03:20:08.900 --> 03:20:10.900]  I'm sure for somebody it's working great.
[03:20:10.900 --> 03:20:11.900]  But I didn't see any difference.
[03:20:11.900 --> 03:20:14.900]  But when I started taking supermobile vitality, that's what God gave us.
[03:20:14.900 --> 03:20:17.900]  All these herbs that block the estrogen members and stuff.
[03:20:17.900 --> 03:20:22.900]  We don't advertise supermobile vitality as for that or anthroplex.
[03:20:22.900 --> 03:20:26.900]  But absolutely, I mean, within one day of taking it, I noticed the difference.
[03:20:26.900 --> 03:20:29.900]  And that shows what God's given us versus what, you know.
[03:20:29.900 --> 03:20:30.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:30.900 --> 03:20:33.900]  And by the way, I take that as well.
[03:20:33.900 --> 03:20:35.900]  People need to go on your website.
[03:20:35.900 --> 03:20:36.900]  And they need to study your blood.
[03:20:36.900 --> 03:20:37.900]  I didn't even know that.
[03:20:37.900 --> 03:20:38.900]  So be honest with me.
[03:20:38.900 --> 03:20:39.900]  I know a real review.
[03:20:39.900 --> 03:20:40.900]  I know you won't give me a fake one.
[03:20:40.900 --> 03:20:42.900]  Gary Haven, maker of America.
[03:20:42.900 --> 03:20:44.900]  And what nutraceuticals of mine have you taken?
[03:20:44.900 --> 03:20:46.900]  I mean, and what did you think of the super vitality?
[03:20:46.900 --> 03:20:48.900]  And keep in mind, I have a degree in nutrition.
[03:20:48.900 --> 03:20:51.900]  So I have written two New York Times bestseller.
[03:20:51.900 --> 03:20:52.900]  And you're one of the top supplement makers before.
[03:20:52.900 --> 03:20:53.900]  I mean, I've produced a bunch.
[03:20:53.900 --> 03:20:54.900]  That's right.
[03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:55.900]  I forgot that.
[03:20:55.900 --> 03:20:56.900]  That's right.
[03:20:56.900 --> 03:20:57.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:57.900 --> 03:20:58.900]  How can I remember all this?
[03:20:58.900 --> 03:21:00.900]  No, great products, well researched, very effective.
[03:21:00.900 --> 03:21:07.900]  I recommend people go to your store and take advantage of the work you've done to create products.
[03:21:07.900 --> 03:21:08.900]  Let's be clear.
[03:21:08.900 --> 03:21:11.900]  I went out and got the top people and said, I know I'm going to be an FDA target.
[03:21:11.900 --> 03:21:14.900]  I want the absolute cleanest, best stuff.
[03:21:14.900 --> 03:21:17.900]  And I don't want to mark it up five to seven times like the average person.
[03:21:17.900 --> 03:21:20.900]  I want to put really expensive stuff in it, mark it up 100%.
[03:21:20.900 --> 03:21:21.900]  That's our policy.
[03:21:21.900 --> 03:21:23.900]  You still have to pay for stuff with 100% markup.
[03:21:23.900 --> 03:21:24.900]  Yeah.
[03:21:24.900 --> 03:21:25.900]  That's reasonable.
[03:21:25.900 --> 03:21:29.900]  And anyway, I certainly endorse your products.
[03:21:29.900 --> 03:21:31.900]  You want to go back to the movie for a minute?
[03:21:31.900 --> 03:21:37.900]  Let's talk about America again, which is available at m4warstore.com exclusively right now for the next week or so.
[03:21:37.900 --> 03:21:40.900]  You get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[03:21:40.900 --> 03:21:41.900]  Yeah.
[03:21:41.900 --> 03:21:43.900]  And this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[03:21:43.900 --> 03:21:50.900]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America that shuts down the grid.
[03:21:50.900 --> 03:21:57.900]  And our Congress has warned that if this sort of happened, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[03:21:57.900 --> 03:22:01.900]  And so we're talking about the globalist and to quote Henry Kissinger,
[03:22:01.900 --> 03:22:05.900]  the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[03:22:05.900 --> 03:22:13.900]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[03:22:13.900 --> 03:22:20.900]  And in light of the events and things that are happening, I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[03:22:20.900 --> 03:22:21.900]  So I made a movie about it.
[03:22:21.900 --> 03:22:23.900]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[03:22:23.900 --> 03:22:31.900]  Everything from the National Defense Authorization Act, Executive Order 13603, the globalist movement.
[03:22:31.900 --> 03:22:33.900]  But isn't a Carrington event even more likely?
[03:22:33.900 --> 03:22:35.900]  I mean, this is going to happen.
[03:22:35.900 --> 03:22:36.900]  Yeah.
[03:22:36.900 --> 03:22:45.900]  I think the Carrington event now is, what was it, 10% over 10 years or something, which is pretty significant.
[03:22:45.900 --> 03:22:52.900]  But you know, we've got North Korea flying a satellite over our country twice a day that very likely is weaponized.
[03:22:52.900 --> 03:22:55.900]  And so I kind of put that as a higher event right now.
[03:22:55.900 --> 03:22:58.900]  You know, I talked to Dr. Peter Pry, who's probably been on your program.
[03:22:58.900 --> 03:23:00.900]  He's the foremost expert on this.
[03:23:00.900 --> 03:23:05.900]  He's with Homeland Security Watch on EMP.
[03:23:05.900 --> 03:23:07.900]  And I asked him just recently.
[03:23:07.900 --> 03:23:09.900]  Oh, I talked to a lot of Pentagon high-ups.
[03:23:09.900 --> 03:23:11.900]  They say, no, this EMP thing's a real issue.
[03:23:11.900 --> 03:23:17.900]  Well, when I asked Dr. Pry, I said, what's the chances that there's a nuclear weapon on the satellite that crosses our country twice a day?
[03:23:17.900 --> 03:23:19.900]  And his answer was fascinating.
[03:23:19.900 --> 03:23:24.900]  He said to me, I can't believe they don't destroy it.
[03:23:24.900 --> 03:23:26.900]  I can't believe they don't destroy it.
[03:23:26.900 --> 03:23:32.900]  So he strongly believes that twice a day, we're at risk for a satellite.
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:35.900]  But that little goblin in control of it.
[03:23:35.900 --> 03:23:38.900]  Yeah, and of course, the goblin's not ruling control.
[03:23:38.900 --> 03:23:39.900]  You know, he's the puppet.
[03:23:39.900 --> 03:23:49.900]  If we wanted a Chinese in Russia and probably the elitists that control this whole thing, you know, there's several groups of elitists.
[03:23:49.900 --> 03:23:55.900]  We haven't quite figured out who's in charge where, but they certainly are the ones that hold the fate of America in their hands.
[03:23:55.900 --> 03:23:56.900]  Wow.
[03:23:56.900 --> 03:23:59.900]  Well, all I know is it's a great film.
[03:23:59.900 --> 03:24:00.900]  It's powerful.
[03:24:00.900 --> 03:24:03.900]  It's great to show young people, especially churches.
[03:24:03.900 --> 03:24:05.900]  What do folks want to show to their church?
[03:24:05.900 --> 03:24:09.900]  We'll buy a copy and feel free to show it in a public environment.
[03:24:09.900 --> 03:24:10.900]  We want people to see it.
[03:24:10.900 --> 03:24:15.900]  I'm not knocking Mel Gibson and all these other folks, but they would make people pay a license fee in charge for tickets and pay him.
[03:24:15.900 --> 03:24:17.900]  And he'd have representatives there.
[03:24:17.900 --> 03:24:21.900]  That's again, Gary Haven did not need to make this film.
[03:24:21.900 --> 03:24:23.900]  He did not need to make a pretty big budget film.
[03:24:23.900 --> 03:24:25.900]  I mean, I'm just guessing, watching it.
[03:24:25.900 --> 03:24:26.900]  I don't know what you spent.
[03:24:26.900 --> 03:24:28.900]  I mean, five million, eight million.
[03:24:28.900 --> 03:24:30.900]  I mean, how much you spent on this?
[03:24:30.900 --> 03:24:36.900]  You haven't told me before, but yeah, you know, I've never said it publicly, but we're, we're getting good with the cost of distribution.
[03:24:36.900 --> 03:24:38.900]  We're getting close to the five million members.
[03:24:38.900 --> 03:24:39.900]  I knew it was high budget.
[03:24:39.900 --> 03:24:40.900]  Yeah.
[03:24:40.900 --> 03:24:42.900]  I mean, for some fact, I thought it was like 10 million.
[03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:43.900]  It looks so good.
[03:24:43.900 --> 03:24:46.900]  I saw those big crews and all the rest of it and all the ads and the rest of it.
[03:24:46.900 --> 03:24:47.900]  So five million.
[03:24:47.900 --> 03:24:49.900]  You're not, you did this to reach me.
[03:24:49.900 --> 03:24:50.900]  Yeah.
[03:24:50.900 --> 03:24:53.900]  And if folks don't, are we going to save the world with this film?
[03:24:53.900 --> 03:24:54.900]  No.
[03:24:54.900 --> 03:24:55.900]  Am I going to save the world next week?
[03:24:55.900 --> 03:24:56.900]  No.
[03:24:56.900 --> 03:25:00.900]  But might be that secret service agent that gives us info that tips the final domino.
[03:25:00.900 --> 03:25:01.900]  We're hitting them enough.
[03:25:01.900 --> 03:25:02.900]  We're going to see some big effects.
[03:25:02.900 --> 03:25:03.900]  We already are.
[03:25:03.900 --> 03:25:06.900]  And so you need to get this film.
[03:25:06.900 --> 03:25:07.900]  Every listener needs to get it.
[03:25:07.900 --> 03:25:09.900]  You need to show it to friends and family.
[03:25:09.900 --> 03:25:14.900]  And the fact that he's right here, you know, saying show it to your church, show it.
[03:25:14.900 --> 03:25:16.900]  What if folks want to put it on access television?
[03:25:16.900 --> 03:25:20.900]  Well, that, let's get some more momentum from it.
[03:25:20.900 --> 03:25:21.900]  I agree.
[03:25:21.900 --> 03:25:23.900]  Because if you agree to that, then you might not get bigger TV rights.
[03:25:23.900 --> 03:25:24.900]  You want to put it on bigger TV.
[03:25:24.900 --> 03:25:25.900]  Yeah.
[03:25:25.900 --> 03:25:26.900]  Yeah.
[03:25:26.900 --> 03:25:28.900]  So it's not to, I understand because I've been involved with this myself.
[03:25:28.900 --> 03:25:29.900]  Give folks some TV rights.
[03:25:29.900 --> 03:25:31.900]  It nixes out big ones to put it out to millions.
[03:25:31.900 --> 03:25:32.900]  Yeah.
[03:25:32.900 --> 03:25:33.900]  Yeah.
[03:25:33.900 --> 03:25:34.900]  And when could we see this on TV then?
[03:25:34.900 --> 03:25:36.900]  Because I know there's some plans for that.
[03:25:36.900 --> 03:25:38.900]  Probably towards the end of the year.
[03:25:38.900 --> 03:25:41.900]  We're going to have evolved to that level.
[03:25:41.900 --> 03:25:45.900]  So film, theaters, DVD, and then TV.
[03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:46.900]  Yep.
[03:25:46.900 --> 03:25:48.900]  In fact, it's showing at theaters across the country right now.
[03:25:48.900 --> 03:25:51.900]  So if go to theamerageddinthemovie.com website.
[03:25:51.900 --> 03:25:53.900]  I should have mentioned that more.
[03:25:53.900 --> 03:25:54.900]  I mentioned it earlier on.
[03:25:54.900 --> 03:25:56.900]  In fact, give folks a URL again.
[03:25:56.900 --> 03:25:57.900]  Yeah.
[03:25:57.900 --> 03:26:00.900]  Amerageddinthemovie.com and click on the theaters.
[03:26:00.900 --> 03:26:02.900]  And it'll show you where it's showing around the country.
[03:26:02.900 --> 03:26:04.900]  It's even better to go to the theater to see it.
[03:26:04.900 --> 03:26:06.900]  You know, it's a better production of it.
[03:26:06.900 --> 03:26:09.900]  And I tell you, you want to bring your friends to see this thing,
[03:26:09.900 --> 03:26:14.900]  especially those friends that are in doubt over this whole thing.
[03:26:14.900 --> 03:26:18.900]  Because we depict a real scenario that's fact-based.
[03:26:18.900 --> 03:26:22.900]  We also show you how to prepare for this and how to survive after it happens.
[03:26:22.900 --> 03:26:24.900]  And let's add to that.
[03:26:24.900 --> 03:26:29.900]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters.
[03:26:29.900 --> 03:26:31.900]  And so this is the first look, director's cut.
[03:26:31.900 --> 03:26:32.900]  Yeah.
[03:26:32.900 --> 03:26:33.900]  Thanks for reminding me of that.
[03:26:33.900 --> 03:26:35.900]  It's a director's cut with different content.
[03:26:35.900 --> 03:26:40.900]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing.
[03:26:40.900 --> 03:26:47.900]  But what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[03:26:47.900 --> 03:26:49.900]  The most hardcore version.
[03:26:49.900 --> 03:26:50.900]  Yep.
[03:26:50.900 --> 03:26:56.900]  So this is a great place to acquire the movie and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[03:26:56.900 --> 03:27:01.900]  Fox and Friends said, ultimate political thriller, all Americans prepare for the substituation.
[03:27:01.900 --> 03:27:05.900]  Fox and Friends, what happens when the government turns against you?
[03:27:05.900 --> 03:27:08.900]  This is totally going against the grain right here.
[03:27:08.900 --> 03:27:09.900]  Yeah.
[03:27:09.900 --> 03:27:11.900]  You know, there were two purposes of this movie.
[03:27:11.900 --> 03:27:16.900]  One was to really show people the threat that exists to our survival as a country.
[03:27:16.900 --> 03:27:24.900]  The other one, which is the one that's probably put me at greater risk, is that this is by design, that the people in power.
[03:27:24.900 --> 03:27:25.900]  And it's not just the Democrats.
[03:27:25.900 --> 03:27:31.900]  You know, we pretty much know that they're given over to communism and in the globalist.
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:36.900]  But the establishment Republicans, you know, they're the enemy in our camp.
[03:27:36.900 --> 03:27:40.900]  And as Cicero said, they're more dangerous than the enemy at the gates.
[03:27:40.900 --> 03:27:47.900]  So we're exposing power and how they're putting Americans at risk in this movie, as well as the MP threat.
[03:27:47.900 --> 03:27:48.900]  That's right.
[03:27:48.900 --> 03:28:00.900]  You can get one copy of the film, American on DVD at infowarstore.com exclusively right now or get a second copy, two copies for $39.90 and get my first film,
[03:28:00.900 --> 03:28:09.900]  America Destroyed by Design, and then one of my latest, most powerful films, Fall of the Republic, that breaks down everything currently happening free.
[03:28:09.900 --> 03:28:13.900]  Two films free when you purchase two Amerageddon's.
[03:28:13.900 --> 03:28:17.900]  And I'm doing that because I want to get this film out.
[03:28:17.900 --> 03:28:25.900]  Another big thing people can do if you really want to reach a lot of people, get two copies, keep one for your own archive to share, take the other and donate it to the library.
[03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:31.900]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores. I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago,
[03:28:31.900 --> 03:28:40.900]  that what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[03:28:40.900 --> 03:28:44.900]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library.
[03:28:44.900 --> 03:28:50.900]  You're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[03:28:50.900 --> 03:28:51.900]  That is amazing.
[03:28:51.900 --> 03:29:00.900]  All of that, I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local M&M station, but over the Internet over the years,
[03:29:00.900 --> 03:29:08.900]  because somebody gave them a DVD or somebody gave them a card with forbidden information, info-wars.com, or they saw a bumper sticker and it's just exponential.
[03:29:08.900 --> 03:29:09.900]  It's exponential.
[03:29:09.900 --> 03:29:14.900]  I can't imagine where info-wars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[03:29:14.900 --> 03:29:18.900]  And I just pray to God that I can be humble and focused and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[03:29:18.900 --> 03:29:21.900]  But it's not just Alex Jones, it's what Gary Haven's doing.
[03:29:21.900 --> 03:29:22.900]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:23.900]  It's what WorldNet Daily's doing.
[03:29:23.900 --> 03:29:27.900]  It's what people like Donald Trump are doing.
[03:29:27.900 --> 03:29:30.900]  We all are just choosing to not be with the New World Order.
[03:29:30.900 --> 03:29:36.900]  And speaking of somebody who's choosing to do that, Roger Stone joining us, he's clamoring to get on.
[03:29:36.900 --> 03:29:37.900]  Never does that.
[03:29:37.900 --> 03:29:38.900]  I try to get him on the show.
[03:29:38.900 --> 03:29:39.900]  He's a busy guy.
[03:29:39.900 --> 03:29:44.900]  He says he's got big news you need to know about right now coming up straight ahead.
[03:29:44.900 --> 03:29:45.900]  We need to tweak that out, too.
[03:29:45.900 --> 03:29:46.900]  This is big.
[03:29:46.900 --> 03:29:48.900]  We're on the march.
[03:29:48.900 --> 03:29:50.900]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:50.900 --> 03:30:19.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:19.900 --> 03:30:21.900]  We have two men helping Hillary upstairs.
[03:30:21.900 --> 03:30:26.900]  The revelations explain her odd, epileptic behavior on camera and why she avoids press conferences in general.
[03:30:26.900 --> 03:30:31.900]  Over the past several months, Hillary has suffered several seizures and near-comatose freeze-ups during speeches,
[03:30:31.900 --> 03:30:36.900]  which reveals she's hiding serious medical issues that jeopardize her ability to hold public office.
[03:30:36.900 --> 03:30:42.900]  Sources inside the Secret Service initially contacted InfoWars reporter Joe Biggs at the Republican National Convention
[03:30:42.900 --> 03:30:47.900]  and followed up with details about Hillary's health out of respect of the public's interest in national security.
[03:30:47.900 --> 03:30:52.900]  Finally, a law enforcement official told Breitbart that Hillary was late returning to a debate with Bernie Sanders
[03:30:52.900 --> 03:30:55.900]  due to a flare-up of problems from a brain injury.
[03:30:55.900 --> 03:30:57.900]  And to find out more, visit infowars.com.

[03:31:59.900 --> 03:32:01.900]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:32:01.900 --> 03:32:05.900]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:05.900 --> 03:32:07.900]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:07.900 --> 03:32:13.900]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country,
[03:32:13.900 --> 03:32:17.900]  obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:17.900 --> 03:32:20.900]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[03:32:20.900 --> 03:32:24.900]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:24.900 --> 03:32:28.900]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[03:32:28.900 --> 03:32:33.900]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives

[03:33:20.900 --> 03:33:24.900]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:33:24.900 --> 03:33:28.900]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:28.900 --> 03:33:31.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.900 --> 03:33:39.900]  Well, it's serendipitous that Mr. Haven is here with us, the producer and star of Amerageddon.
[03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:42.900]  And then we also have Mr. Stone here with us.
[03:33:42.900 --> 03:33:46.900]  Now, Mr. Stone, I'm normally clamoring to get him on the broadcast, Roger Stone.
[03:33:46.900 --> 03:33:50.900]  Today, he's got stuff so important he wants on the broadcast.
[03:33:50.900 --> 03:33:54.900]  So I don't think I've seen him this animated in a while.
[03:33:54.900 --> 03:33:56.900]  He's still stone cold over there.
[03:33:56.900 --> 03:34:02.900]  But Roger Stone is our guest, Gary Haven, is our guest until the end of the hour as well.
[03:34:02.900 --> 03:34:07.900]  So much going on, Trump coming out, organizing his election fraud.
[03:34:07.900 --> 03:34:15.900]  A lot of polls going back, even with Hillary, Trump predicting landslides in many of these battleground states.
[03:34:15.900 --> 03:34:17.900]  We're going to ask Roger Stone why he thinks that is.
[03:34:17.900 --> 03:34:20.900]  I know some of the internal polls with just private groups.
[03:34:20.900 --> 03:34:27.900]  I talked to say Trump's actually ahead and that this is all just media hoax with 15% more Democrats being sampled by Reuters and others.
[03:34:27.900 --> 03:34:31.900]  But I know Roger Stone will give me his real take on this.
[03:34:31.900 --> 03:34:39.900]  Unlike a lot of other politicos, an advisor to at least four presidents worked for nine different campaigns for president.
[03:34:39.900 --> 03:34:45.900]  And somebody who can really give us the inside scoop on what's happening.
[03:34:45.900 --> 03:34:49.900]  I know also the cover of the New York Times this morning, as I got up at 6 a.m. was reading it,
[03:34:49.900 --> 03:34:54.900]  secret ledger in Ukraine's list, cash for Donald Trump's campaign chief.
[03:34:54.900 --> 03:34:58.900]  I don't know what Roger's going to stay here, but I've followed this closely.
[03:34:58.900 --> 03:35:02.900]  That's like saying, oh, we have a secret list of somebody that paid their electric bill.
[03:35:02.900 --> 03:35:14.900]  It's no secret that his business partner of decades, Mr. Manafort, has worked for the previous elected president of Ukraine.
[03:35:14.900 --> 03:35:18.900]  But they put this headline out and act like, oh, it's mysterious.
[03:35:18.900 --> 03:35:28.900]  Oh, it's bad to ignore all the admitted evidence of Hillary giving up one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply to the Russians for $35 million.
[03:35:28.900 --> 03:35:30.900]  That's been in the Wall Street Journal.
[03:35:30.900 --> 03:35:36.900]  WikiLeaks has said no real connections in our hacks to Trump and the Russians.
[03:35:36.900 --> 03:35:41.900]  Hillary, it's amazing, but not as bad as the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians.
[03:35:41.900 --> 03:35:46.900]  So joining us till the end of the transmission is rogerstoneofstonesone.com.
[03:35:46.900 --> 03:35:47.900]  Good to have you, my friend.
[03:35:47.900 --> 03:35:49.900]  Great to be here, Alex.
[03:35:49.900 --> 03:35:54.900]  You kind of read my mind because this is precisely what I want to address.
[03:35:54.900 --> 03:35:56.900]  The New York Times should be ashamed of themselves.
[03:35:56.900 --> 03:36:10.900]  This story, if you read it carefully, indicates that Manafort is not the subject of an investigation, that there is no evidence of a secret campaign or financial transfers to him.
[03:36:10.900 --> 03:36:12.900]  This is a nothing burger.
[03:36:12.900 --> 03:36:18.900]  All the news that's fit to print embellished with a Clinton tin.
[03:36:18.900 --> 03:36:20.900]  There's no story here.
[03:36:20.900 --> 03:36:22.900]  This was manufactured news.
[03:36:22.900 --> 03:36:31.900]  Now, juxtapose that with the New York Times' failure to delve into the current criminality at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:36:31.900 --> 03:36:43.900]  The Clintons have set up a Clinton Foundation, Canada, that is unregulated, where millions of dollars for Mr. Giustra, who purchased the uranium concession, have flowed.
[03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:47.900]  You know how much of that has been reported in the New York Times?
[03:36:47.900 --> 03:36:48.900]  None.
[03:36:48.900 --> 03:37:02.900]  So this is a manufacturer, which I can reveal here, is done on the basis of research that was conducted in Ukraine by Sidney Blumenthal using heavy-handed private detectives.
[03:37:02.900 --> 03:37:06.900]  They have dug for months on Manafort, and they have found nothing.
[03:37:06.900 --> 03:37:08.900]  There is no investigation.
[03:37:08.900 --> 03:37:10.900]  Manafort is not a target.
[03:37:10.900 --> 03:37:20.900]  The scroll note that is in the headline tracks to no bank transfer records. There is no proof of any payment to Manafort.
[03:37:20.900 --> 03:37:22.900]  It's a canard.
[03:37:22.900 --> 03:37:26.900]  But expanding on that, he has been an international consultant to hundreds of different groups.
[03:37:26.900 --> 03:37:30.900]  And so I don't care if he's been a consultant to an elected government.
[03:37:30.900 --> 03:37:33.900]  It's towards Soros running around overthrowing governments.
[03:37:33.900 --> 03:37:37.900]  But he has never worked for the Ukrainian government or for the Russian government.
[03:37:37.900 --> 03:37:38.900]  So he has.
[03:37:38.900 --> 03:37:43.900]  As you point out, Alex, the whole involvement of Putin and the Russians is a canard.
[03:37:43.900 --> 03:37:44.900]  Let's be very clear.
[03:37:44.900 --> 03:37:59.900]  The DNC hacked emails involving the theft from Bernie Sanders and the role of Deborah Wasserman Schultz was hacked by Crucifer 2 and posted online five weeks ago.
[03:37:59.900 --> 03:38:03.900]  When it got no traction, he took those documents to WikiLeaks.
[03:38:03.900 --> 03:38:08.900]  They put them out and they received substantial traction.
[03:38:08.900 --> 03:38:13.900]  No involvement by the Russians. No involvement by Putin.
[03:38:13.900 --> 03:38:20.900]  The whole idea that Manafort and Trump are somehow aligned with Putin, working with Putin.
[03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:21.900]  This is a false hood.
[03:38:21.900 --> 03:38:27.900]  Well, I've now confirmed from our NSA sources, not just Benny on air, but the word is that it's been tracked.
[03:38:27.900 --> 03:38:33.900]  It is U.S. sources in intelligence leaking most of this now because they're so concerned about Hillary.
[03:38:33.900 --> 03:38:45.900]  And I have had the Secret Service, Mr. Stone, directly give us intel confirming her medical issues now, which I tell you is one of the scariest things I've ever done because I know how serious this is.
[03:38:45.900 --> 03:38:55.900]  Yeah, look, I think that her medical issues are yet another example of the New York Times shirking their responsibilities and essentially writing nothing.
[03:38:55.900 --> 03:38:59.900]  But isn't the New York Times owned by a Mexican kingpin now? I mean, let's get real here.
[03:38:59.900 --> 03:39:08.900]  No, it is owned by Carlos Slim, who is the largest single donor to the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.
[03:39:08.900 --> 03:39:17.900]  That's who owns a controlling interest in the New York Times, which is why you have this assault on Paul Manafort, which is really about attacking Trump,
[03:39:17.900 --> 03:39:22.900]  instead of any investigative journalism about the corruption of the Clintons.
[03:39:22.900 --> 03:39:36.900]  And this is disgraceful. And frankly, I never heard of the reporters whose names are on this story, but they should be ashamed of themselves because they admit no government official says Manafort has been charged with wrongdoing in the story.
[03:39:36.900 --> 03:39:37.900]  He is not the subject.
[03:39:37.900 --> 03:39:44.900]  Why don't we just have an article saying that they found the yellow cake, Niger uranium at Paul Manafort's house.
[03:39:44.900 --> 03:39:53.900]  Well, what's particularly disturbing about this is that within seconds of it being posted last night, it was tweeted online by Corey Lewandowski.
[03:39:53.900 --> 03:40:04.900]  So now I think it is fair to say that Lewandowski is in league with Sidney Blumenthal and the Clintons in this case with the New York Times to discredit.
[03:40:04.900 --> 03:40:09.900]  And it works with CNN's campaign, pathetic, really pathetic.
[03:40:09.900 --> 03:40:15.900]  So now you used to tell me probably you thought Lewandowski was an idiot. You're saying now you think he's been an operative all along just now.
[03:40:15.900 --> 03:40:22.900]  Well, why would you do something detrimental to the Trump campaign? Why would you spread complete disinformation?
[03:40:22.900 --> 03:40:29.900]  Unless of course you're putting yourself ahead of Trump, which is what I think he has done in this instance.
[03:40:29.900 --> 03:40:42.900]  Alex, as you know, last late last week, shortly after it became known on this program that I have had some back channel communication with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange,
[03:40:42.900 --> 03:40:56.900]  regarding the fact that everything that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, the Clinton aides fought that they erased on Hillary's illegal server is in the possession of WikiLeaks.
[03:40:56.900 --> 03:41:03.900]  Probably also the Chinese, the Russians, the Saudis and the Israelis, but most definitely in the hands of WikiLeaks.
[03:41:03.900 --> 03:41:06.900]  This is political dynamite.
[03:41:06.900 --> 03:41:10.900]  Shortly thereafter, as you know, I myself was hacked.
[03:41:10.900 --> 03:41:13.900]  It's far worse than I reported last week.
[03:41:13.900 --> 03:41:19.900]  My personal email accounts, my business email accounts, my bank account was accessed.
[03:41:19.900 --> 03:41:30.900]  My websites were accessed. My social media feeds were accessed. Two of my associates who work with me, one based in Texas, one based in California, both hacked at the same time.
[03:41:30.900 --> 03:41:33.900]  So total data scoop to find out who you're talking to.
[03:41:33.900 --> 03:41:37.900]  30 years worth of political contacts erased.
[03:41:37.900 --> 03:41:39.900]  Email contacts erased.
[03:41:39.900 --> 03:41:40.900]  Sabotage.
[03:41:40.900 --> 03:41:45.900]  Documents that I was working on, research I was working on erased.
[03:41:45.900 --> 03:41:50.900]  Now, fortunately, all of this is backed up in a server in New York.
[03:41:50.900 --> 03:41:57.900]  And therefore all they've done is make me more determined to bring them down and put me back about four or five days.
[03:41:57.900 --> 03:42:02.900]  Well, Trump's coming to town a few weeks. I hope you'll come here so you and I can meet obviously here in Austin.
[03:42:02.900 --> 03:42:04.900]  Get you down here, Roger.
[03:42:04.900 --> 03:42:12.900]  I've got Mr. Haven here who was really looking forward to speaking to you sometime about things he wants to do working with the campaign and pop him with any questions you've got.
[03:42:12.900 --> 03:42:15.900]  Because it's always great to have a wildcard question, Gary.
[03:42:15.900 --> 03:42:28.900]  But specifically, when he says we know if we don't win Pennsylvania that we've been stolen, is that obviously because the internal polling shows he's ahead, he's having giant crowds.
[03:42:28.900 --> 03:42:29.900]  The Democrats say we're all for you.
[03:42:29.900 --> 03:42:32.900]  Most Democrats I talked to say they're for Trump.
[03:42:32.900 --> 03:42:33.900]  They see right through Hillary.
[03:42:33.900 --> 03:42:36.900]  She can't even get 176 people at her rallies now.
[03:42:36.900 --> 03:42:38.900]  He gets 30,000.
[03:42:38.900 --> 03:42:45.900]  I mean, it really seems like they're putting out these polls to create the hoax that he's behind so that people think he's going to lose.
[03:42:45.900 --> 03:42:47.900]  What's the real numbers right now?
[03:42:47.900 --> 03:42:48.900]  As best you can tell, Mr. Stone.
[03:42:48.900 --> 03:42:50.900]  I think you're exactly right, Alex.
[03:42:50.900 --> 03:43:03.900]  It was my intention today to publish a major paper on exactly how this election can be rigged and where exactly I expect it to happen to be clear.
[03:43:03.900 --> 03:43:06.900]  Both parties have been involved in machine rigging.
[03:43:06.900 --> 03:43:16.900]  It's the party in power in the given states that will rig the machines and therefore Pennsylvania and Virginia are two states that must be monitored closely.
[03:43:16.900 --> 03:43:17.900]  What do I mean by that?
[03:43:17.900 --> 03:43:21.900]  Very simply, we need to conduct exit polls.
[03:43:21.900 --> 03:43:31.900]  So if the difference between the results, the official results from the machines and the exit polls are different, we will know that this election has been rigged.
[03:43:31.900 --> 03:43:40.900]  That has to be done. I'm going to unveil a plan shortly to do it, but the hacking of my email, frankly, put me behind a day or two.
[03:43:40.900 --> 03:43:44.900]  No big deal because the struggle continues.
[03:43:44.900 --> 03:43:51.900]  By the way, I don't think it's internal sabotage, but the link that they put is so hidden, you can't even find it.
[03:43:51.900 --> 03:43:56.900]  It took us days to find the link on DonaldJTrump.com for volunteers to sign up for that.
[03:43:56.900 --> 03:44:05.900]  So we're sending out a mass email and we're going to post it the next few minutes to infowars.com with the actual URL where people can go sign up if it has gone live.
[03:44:05.900 --> 03:44:08.900]  Share this link to help Trump stop rigged elections.
[03:44:08.900 --> 03:44:11.900]  Trump calls on Americans to become election observers.
[03:44:11.900 --> 03:44:21.900]  There's a video I shot pointing out that for dinner with Trump or to donate to Trump or all this stuff is literally hidden and inaccessible by any link.
[03:44:21.900 --> 03:44:24.900]  It took data mining, Roger, to find this on the site.
[03:44:24.900 --> 03:44:26.900]  So I just want to let the campaign know about that.
[03:44:26.900 --> 03:44:31.900]  Yeah, I think it's going to be very important to have every polling place covered.
[03:44:31.900 --> 03:44:34.900]  And the Trump campaign is going to do some of that.
[03:44:34.900 --> 03:44:42.900]  Citizens for Trump, the fabulous grassroots organization that co-sponsored our rally in Cleveland is going to do some of that.
[03:44:42.900 --> 03:44:48.900]  We're ramping up StopTheSteel.com again for this specific purpose.
[03:44:48.900 --> 03:44:51.900]  These machines can easily be hacked.
[03:44:51.900 --> 03:44:58.900]  It takes a $15 device that you can buy at Best Buy to allow you to vote multiple times.
[03:44:58.900 --> 03:45:00.900]  Sure, the audience knows that.
[03:45:00.900 --> 03:45:04.900]  But I mean, why do you think Obama came out and flipped out and said, what's a rigged election?
[03:45:04.900 --> 03:45:07.900]  Didn't he put his foot in his mouth with that one?
[03:45:07.900 --> 03:45:09.900]  Well, he said it was ridiculous.
[03:45:09.900 --> 03:45:16.900]  You see what they're trying to do is discredit any claim that this election is not honest up front.
[03:45:16.900 --> 03:45:24.900]  The fact that Obama says the entire concept of rigging the election is ridiculous convinces me all the more that they will attempt to do it.
[03:45:24.900 --> 03:45:27.900]  Well, they just tried to steal the nomination and did from Sanders.
[03:45:27.900 --> 03:45:31.900]  Gary, jump in here with some questions. You say there's a lot you want to ask Mr. Stone.
[03:45:31.900 --> 03:45:32.900]  Gary, go ahead.
[03:45:32.900 --> 03:45:36.900]  Hey, Roger, good to see you. I've been trying to connect here for a while.
[03:45:36.900 --> 03:45:45.900]  You know, you mentioned something really interesting with the Clinton Foundation that it was first founded in Canada.
[03:45:45.900 --> 03:45:48.900]  And I wanted to add something to that.
[03:45:48.900 --> 03:45:54.900]  Canadian law allows that foundation in Canada to not reveal the donors.
[03:45:54.900 --> 03:45:59.900]  And then, of course, they transfer the money into the U.S. where it's safe from being revealed.
[03:45:59.900 --> 03:46:01.900]  So obviously criminal. If I did this, they arrest me.
[03:46:01.900 --> 03:46:06.900]  Yes, they've done the exact same thing in a number of other jurisdictions.
[03:46:06.900 --> 03:46:10.900]  Look, the Clinton Foundation, Gary, as you know, is not a charitable organization.
[03:46:10.900 --> 03:46:12.900]  It's a slush fund for grifters.
[03:46:12.900 --> 03:46:13.900]  Yeah.
[03:46:13.900 --> 03:46:21.900]  It is a vehicle for the facilitation of multimillion-dollar bribes that were paid to the Clintons in return for governmental favors.
[03:46:21.900 --> 03:46:26.900]  The Russians paid, the Chinese paid, the Saudis paid, and they all got something.
[03:46:26.900 --> 03:46:27.900]  It's a classic case.
[03:46:27.900 --> 03:46:32.900]  Let me raise this. Why is the media, I mean, I thought there was a ceiling on hysteria.
[03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:34.900]  Let's say that's a 10. They've now gone to a 30.
[03:46:34.900 --> 03:46:39.900]  I mean, it is into the world panic, run around just lying.
[03:46:39.900 --> 03:46:46.900]  I mean, it's got a backfire on them. Are they panicking because they know Trump's really ahead in their own internal polling?
[03:46:46.900 --> 03:46:51.900]  Because if he was so far behind like they claim, they wouldn't be running around like it's the end of the world.
[03:46:51.900 --> 03:46:56.900]  No, I think they're panicking because they understand that should he be elected, it's the end of the old order.
[03:46:56.900 --> 03:46:59.900]  It's the end of the two-party duopoly.
[03:46:59.900 --> 03:47:02.900]  It's the end of the neocons controlling our government.
[03:47:02.900 --> 03:47:05.900]  It's the end of the erosion of our civil liberties.
[03:47:05.900 --> 03:47:08.900]  It's the end of debt and massive spending.
[03:47:08.900 --> 03:47:12.900]  It's the end of the new order. That's what they say in the Washington Post.
[03:47:12.900 --> 03:47:16.900]  It's the end of bailouts on Wall Street for the crooks and swindlers.
[03:47:16.900 --> 03:47:30.900]  It would open up a whole new era of economic growth and prosperity as Trump trimmed regulations and formulated tax policy that would be job friendly, job creation friendly.
[03:47:30.900 --> 03:47:35.900]  So he challenges the two-party duopoly in 30 years of bad decisions.
[03:47:35.900 --> 03:47:40.900]  Sure, I want to hear some more questions because I love the wall card.
[03:47:40.900 --> 03:47:47.900]  But other 10 bits, Roger Stone, that folks should be aware of right now, what are you concerned about?
[03:47:47.900 --> 03:47:53.900]  Well, my number one concern, of course, is this effort by the mainstream media to call this election over in August.
[03:47:53.900 --> 03:48:04.900]  It's not even Labor Day and you had this major New York Times piece that has the Trump campaign in disarray, the candidate disperited.
[03:48:04.900 --> 03:48:10.900]  He's giving up. It's all over. This is like taking what happened with Ben Carson to the next level.
[03:48:10.900 --> 03:48:15.900]  Shouldn't we make them make the point that they're staging a hoax here?
[03:48:15.900 --> 03:48:21.900]  Well, it's not only a hoax, but anybody who reads this stuff understands that that is not Trump.
[03:48:21.900 --> 03:48:26.900]  Trump is a fighter. Trump never quits things midstream. That's not him.
[03:48:26.900 --> 03:48:30.900]  He won this nomination in a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.
[03:48:30.900 --> 03:48:33.900]  He never settles lawsuits. He loves it.
[03:48:33.900 --> 03:48:42.900]  No, he's a fighter. So the idea that he is going to quit that whole McGuffin was first put out by the Republican National Committee,
[03:48:42.900 --> 03:48:52.900]  and then kind of picked up by the Clinton spin machine as a way to dampen the enthusiasm of both donors and volunteers.
[03:48:52.900 --> 03:48:59.900]  This election is far from over. You have a number of debates that are going to be pivotal.
[03:48:59.900 --> 03:49:06.900]  Donald Trump would like to see the minor party candidates, Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in those debates.
[03:49:06.900 --> 03:49:10.900]  I predict Hillary will never agree to that.
[03:49:10.900 --> 03:49:19.900]  The presidential commission on debates is not appointed by the president, is not a commission, and it's most definitely not about debate.
[03:49:19.900 --> 03:49:24.900]  It's about limiting debate. They will want these debates at a time that almost nobody can see them.
[03:49:24.900 --> 03:49:29.900]  They will want a format that will not allow Trump to cross the exam at Hillary.
[03:49:29.900 --> 03:49:34.900]  Now, she hasn't had a press conference in 250, what, 657 days?
[03:49:34.900 --> 03:49:39.900]  I was about to say, she clearly can't even hardly stand up now. I was watching her day with Biden sitting there.
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:42.900]  She was about to die. How is she going to be in an hour and a half, two hour debate?
[03:49:42.900 --> 03:49:44.900]  I think Trump should push for the longest possible.
[03:49:44.900 --> 03:49:50.900]  Andy should keep a list of all the questions she has failed to answer these many months. I can think of...
[03:49:50.900 --> 03:49:55.900]  Let me ask you about Benghazi. Let me ask you about your foundation.
[03:49:55.900 --> 03:49:58.900]  They'll probably put Megyn Kelly as the moderator of all three.
[03:49:58.900 --> 03:50:08.900]  Well, so the point is you have these debates, then you also have this devastating information from WikiLeaks, which I expect to continue.
[03:50:08.900 --> 03:50:17.900]  So what I've seen online, the trolls that work for David Brock get correct the record and media matters.
[03:50:17.900 --> 03:50:20.900]  Yeah, they tell you a lot about what they troll with. What are they worried about?
[03:50:20.900 --> 03:50:24.900]  Oh, they're constantly attacking you and I personally. It's all name calling.
[03:50:24.900 --> 03:50:29.900]  And now they're trying to discredit Assange because they know he has the goods.
[03:50:29.900 --> 03:50:34.900]  It's all trolls. It's all astroturf. It's all BS.
[03:50:34.900 --> 03:50:44.900]  By the way, both those organizations correct the record and media matters for America operating illegally in violation of their legal charter under the IRS.
[03:50:44.900 --> 03:50:52.900]  So it is typical of the Clinton types. Throw names, call names, personal character assassination.
[03:50:52.900 --> 03:50:59.900]  They can't refute my book, The Clinton's War on Women, which you can get right here at the Info Wars store.
[03:50:59.900 --> 03:51:05.900]  They're not able to refute it on a factual basis, so they engage in name calling.
[03:51:05.900 --> 03:51:14.900]  Why are they? Because I mean, I'm used towards surreal to see CNN, MSNBC every night attacking you and I.
[03:51:14.900 --> 03:51:20.900]  And they're not doing it because we're discredited. They're doing it because they're so scared of the fact that it's our talking points that are reality based,
[03:51:20.900 --> 03:51:24.900]  that Trump is talking about wherever he's getting them and that is so effective against them.
[03:51:24.900 --> 03:51:29.900]  I mean, why are they so scared of us? It's bizarre to always be front and center in the middle of this.
[03:51:29.900 --> 03:51:30.900]  Gary, jump in any time.
[03:51:30.900 --> 03:51:36.900]  You guys are purveyors of truth. You laid out a really good argument.
[03:51:36.900 --> 03:51:42.900]  The difference between a Trump presidency as opposed to these other guys is a marketer.
[03:51:42.900 --> 03:51:45.900]  I'm always looking for reducing things to the ridiculous.
[03:51:45.900 --> 03:51:50.900]  I'm tempted to say this is nationalism versus globalism.
[03:51:50.900 --> 03:51:58.900]  This is suicide versus life. Is that a viable argument or is that ridicule rich?
[03:51:58.900 --> 03:52:06.900]  First, I think it's an absolutely accurate and viable argument for some less sophisticated voters.
[03:52:06.900 --> 03:52:16.900]  Perhaps it bears some explanation, but essentially the entire rise of Trump is a rejection of the policies that have brought this country.
[03:52:16.900 --> 03:52:20.900]  Trump is America fighting for its life. Trump is the last gasp if we don't take it.
[03:52:20.900 --> 03:52:23.900]  Trump is what you were praying for, people.
[03:52:23.900 --> 03:52:29.900]  But Gary, I think just put his finger on it. This is the globalists, those who believe in the New World Order,
[03:52:29.900 --> 03:52:36.900]  those who believe in regional government, those who no longer believe in American sovereignty, American power, versus the nationalists.
[03:52:36.900 --> 03:52:40.900]  They try to put a negative connotation on that. Trump loves America.
[03:52:40.900 --> 03:52:45.900]  He believes in the promise of America. He believes in the exceptionalism of America.
[03:52:45.900 --> 03:52:48.900]  He believes in American sovereignty and American power.
[03:52:48.900 --> 03:52:51.900]  And that's why The New York Times is attacking America.
[03:52:51.900 --> 03:52:57.900]  They hate the American power part. They do not like that because they've used our power to parlay into world government.
[03:52:57.900 --> 03:53:03.900]  And now they think we're done with this like we're some old hooker. And no, that's not happening. It's not happening.
[03:53:03.900 --> 03:53:10.900]  Well, I'm all for having a simplistic approach because let's face it, we're fairly sophisticated in this area.
[03:53:10.900 --> 03:53:20.900]  We have time and spent on it. But to get the attention of the average voter, we can't be bombastic, which is tempting to do because of our frustration.
[03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:22.900]  I am.
[03:53:22.900 --> 03:53:25.900]  Actually, I was talking about you.
[03:53:25.900 --> 03:53:29.900]  I was about to say Trump bombastic.
[03:53:29.900 --> 03:53:31.900]  I'll go ahead. Sorry.
[03:53:31.900 --> 03:53:38.900]  I'd really like to see some smart marketing here because there are so many things that are obvious now that we now,
[03:53:38.900 --> 03:53:42.900]  and thanks to Trump, we have permission to talk about the politically incorrect.
[03:53:42.900 --> 03:53:46.900]  We have permission to talk about globalism and where that leads.
[03:53:46.900 --> 03:53:52.900]  That's where I went. The Chinese president says we can't have Trump. The Saudi president says we can't have Trump with a Saudi leader.
[03:53:52.900 --> 03:53:58.900]  This leader says that would leader. What about you? I mean, I would just say like, but you know, what are the voters say?
[03:53:58.900 --> 03:54:00.900]  For the Communist Party fully supports Hillary.
[03:54:00.900 --> 03:54:01.900]  Exactly.
[03:54:01.900 --> 03:54:08.900]  I mean, every demon group on earth is against Trump. This is a no brainer for me. Roger.
[03:54:08.900 --> 03:54:15.900]  That's about right. You know, I do think that this is going to continue because the mainstream media is not going to let up.
[03:54:15.900 --> 03:54:22.900]  They want this race to be over right now, probably because they know that Hillary doesn't have the stamina for the close.
[03:54:22.900 --> 03:54:27.900]  That's my next question. I'm glad you brought that up. She's crawling. She's falling apart. She's degenerating.
[03:54:27.900 --> 03:54:31.900]  They're even starting to admit it mainstream media. What are they planning then?
[03:54:31.900 --> 03:54:36.900]  I mean, are they going to replace her? Have a fake assassination attempt to make her a hero?
[03:54:36.900 --> 03:54:40.900]  They'll never replace her because the they is she.
[03:54:40.900 --> 03:54:47.900]  The Clintons are now in control of the Democratic Party. Many of my friends in the Democratic Party are supporting her.
[03:54:47.900 --> 03:54:55.900]  Not because they want to, but because they're afraid not to. The Clintons are famously vindictive and they keep score.
[03:54:55.900 --> 03:55:01.900]  Additionally, however, you have Trump out last week doing four campaign events in one day.
[03:55:01.900 --> 03:55:10.900]  This guy is almost 70, but he is showing a Herculean personal stamina working like a dog to win this election.
[03:55:10.900 --> 03:55:19.900]  She can barely stand up. She has continued to ask you any questions about anything, her health, the Clinton Foundation.
[03:55:19.900 --> 03:55:33.900]  And so ISIS last week, as you know, Trump landed a clean punch because Obama and Hillary as well as the Bush administration are responsible for the rise of ISIS.
[03:55:33.900 --> 03:55:34.900]  Yes.
[03:55:34.900 --> 03:55:41.900]  And the mainstream media attempted to ridicule Trump as if that is untrue. However, it is true.
[03:55:41.900 --> 03:55:48.900]  At a minimum, one would have to deny, indisputably, Hillary armed ISIS. And that is a stone cold fact.
[03:55:48.900 --> 03:55:52.900]  And she created the vacuum and put them in charge and did everything else for them.
[03:55:52.900 --> 03:56:02.900]  So, from the internal polls of the research, what, I mean, is it, I mean, for me, I think there's this closeted grip on others that, you know, won't say they're voting for Trump.
[03:56:02.900 --> 03:56:09.900]  I think Trump's way ahead. I mean, I know we can't be overconfident here, but I think this illusion that Hillary's really ahead has to be defeated.
[03:56:09.900 --> 03:56:16.900]  I actually don't think that Trump is necessarily ahead. He may be down three or four points.
[03:56:16.900 --> 03:56:21.900]  Remember, polling is only good in the epic second in which it is taken.
[03:56:21.900 --> 03:56:27.900]  The instant it's compiled, it is technically already obsolete because things are moving around.
[03:56:27.900 --> 03:56:34.900]  Voters are moving around. They are affected by the daily coverage of the race, both good and bad.
[03:56:34.900 --> 03:56:36.900]  So the numbers are always going to fluctuate.
[03:56:36.900 --> 03:56:41.900]  Is Hillary pulled out to some insurmountable lead? Absolutely not.
[03:56:41.900 --> 03:56:47.900]  Is Trump still even or leading in more than half of the swing states? Yes, he is.
[03:56:47.900 --> 03:56:55.900]  Is there any place in which he's now out of range other than reliably blue states where he never was going to win any place?
[03:56:55.900 --> 03:56:57.900]  The answer is no.
[03:56:57.900 --> 03:57:06.900]  So despite the fact that the mainstream media attempts to put this race away to call it for Hillary in August is just not.
[03:57:06.900 --> 03:57:11.900]  Gary, you have a final question and then Roger Stone, any other points you need to make?
[03:57:11.900 --> 03:57:19.900]  It was funny. We forgot about what he spoke about ISIS last week. That's huge. Huge courage.
[03:57:19.900 --> 03:57:21.900]  I'm just so proud I support Trump.
[03:57:21.900 --> 03:57:30.900]  I'm friends with Rand Paul and during the debate, he was accused of being an isolationist and he uttered the words,
[03:57:30.900 --> 03:57:36.900]  well, the first thing I would do is stop supporting ISIS and then he shut up and I told him later.
[03:57:36.900 --> 03:57:39.900]  I said, why didn't you go down that trail?
[03:57:39.900 --> 03:57:49.900]  You know, what turned me on to ISIS being a CIA creation was when the weapons and Mosul were completely turned over the vehicles.
[03:57:49.900 --> 03:57:54.900]  There were 2,500 armored Humvees with the keys left in the ignition.
[03:57:54.900 --> 03:58:00.900]  We had a aircraft carrier right out there in the Persian Gulf, could have sent 2 F-18s and destroyed it.
[03:58:00.900 --> 03:58:03.900]  Absolutely. So that facts out. Roger Stone's 60 seconds closing comments on that.
[03:58:03.900 --> 03:58:09.900]  You know what's particularly disturbing to me was the way Katie Tura of NBC goes up on her Twitter feed and says,
[03:58:09.900 --> 03:58:15.900]  Trump is wrong about ISIS. No, Katie. Trump is absolutely right about ISIS.
[03:58:15.900 --> 03:58:23.900]  Well, that's right. I think they went too far because that's a known fact and that really shows the mainstream media is losing its power.
[03:58:23.900 --> 03:58:26.900]  RogerStoneZoneZone.com. Thank you so much. We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:58:26.900 --> 03:58:28.900]  Great to be here. Thanks, Alex.
