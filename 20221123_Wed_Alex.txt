[00:00.000 --> 00:20.280]  It's Wednesday, November 23, 2022, we have a very, very special rebroadcast for you today
[00:20.280 --> 00:23.960]  made up of some of the most important guests we've recently had on with some of the most
[00:23.960 --> 00:24.960]  important topics.
[00:24.960 --> 00:30.280]  Coming up first in this hour is Steve Quayle on the war in Ukraine, the economy, and how
[00:30.280 --> 00:35.960]  at this point he believes there's not really a temporal or political solution to our problems.
[00:35.960 --> 00:37.480]  It's all spiritual.
[00:37.480 --> 00:40.560]  That is coming up this hour right after the break.
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.520]  Then Martin Armstrong, one of the top economists, one of the best track recorders, predicting
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.680]  what's really about to happen, lays out the real nature of the world economy and the US
[00:48.680 --> 00:52.960]  economy in the hour after that, the second hour.
[00:52.960 --> 00:56.640]  Then, of course, a great interview we had about election fraud, all the information coming
[00:56.640 --> 01:03.400]  out with the Crime Spikes, Mike Lindell will be in the third hour, then Matt Baker will
[01:03.400 --> 01:09.360]  be in the first half hour of the fourth hour, and then, of course, MTG was on with us last
[01:09.360 --> 01:12.760]  week and knocked out of the park on so many fronts.
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.320]  That's what's coming up on this November 23, Wednesday edition.
[01:17.320 --> 01:20.840]  I want to thank the listeners and viewers for all your amazing support, keeping us on
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.520]  air, I'm very, very thankful this Thanksgiving that we haven't had nuclear war, I'm very
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.400]  thankful that the world's awakening, I'm very, very thankful that even NBC News and others
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.240]  are admitting that the poison death shots are causing massive heart attacks, myocarditis,
[01:33.240 --> 01:36.920]  blood clots, and deaths, and I'm very sad that all these bad things happened, but there
[01:36.920 --> 01:44.320]  is a huge awakening, and at least we're getting on a fighting footing politically, culturally,
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.400]  economically, spiritually, and to defend ourselves physically.
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.000]  I am extremely thankful to the crew on this Thanksgiving, I am infinitely thankful to
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.880]  God, of course, number one, and I am just beyond thankful to the incredible listeners
[01:57.880 --> 02:00.960]  and viewers that make everything we do here possible.
[02:00.960 --> 02:06.120]  They attack all of our American institutions, they attack Thanksgiving last few years saying
[02:06.120 --> 02:11.640]  don't go to it, don't be around unvaccinated people, but then Borla Pfizer gets up and
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.160]  says that, oh, the right wing was mean to AIDS patients and said don't get close to
[02:15.160 --> 02:19.760]  them during the 1980s, but oh, anybody that might have a virus is toxic, don't be around
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.240]  them, unless you've had a shot, which we now know creates a spike protein, and basically
[02:24.240 --> 02:29.040]  infects people with the same thing as the virus, it's just insane, so I am extremely
[02:29.040 --> 02:34.320]  thankful that we're still on air, and I cannot express to you enough how amazing the awakening
[02:34.320 --> 02:37.880]  is, again, you're not public figures most of you, so you don't realize how big the awakening
[02:37.880 --> 02:44.840]  is, I am a public figure, and just yesterday I had breakfast with an unnamed, very well-known
[02:44.840 --> 02:50.120]  household name public figure, and he expressed to me the same findings that there's really
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.200]  a giant underground awakening, not just one on the surface, and that in meetings with
[02:55.200 --> 03:01.400]  large groups of members of Congress, who you wouldn't think are Alex Jones fans, most
[03:01.400 --> 03:06.400]  of them are rapidly becoming listeners, so we've definitely hit the zeitgeist, that's
[03:06.400 --> 03:11.520]  why they had the Democratic Party in a big fake news article in the Washington Post a
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.560]  few days ago, after the Sandy Hook family sued Alex Jones and began to move money around,
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.680]  nothing is true in the article, it's all disinfo, except their statement at the end that, oh,
[03:21.680 --> 03:25.840]  he won't have to pay us really any money if he just goes off the year and goes back into
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.240]  private life, we just want Alex Jones to go back into private life and just go away,
[03:30.240 --> 03:34.480]  well, I mean now I can't go into private life, the truth is five, six years ago I was thinking
[03:34.480 --> 03:38.360]  about phasing out within five years, just doing a podcast once a week and writing books,
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.080]  but because you want to take us off air, because everything we've said is coming true, because
[03:42.080 --> 03:45.280]  our credibility is so high, because people are counting on us, especially the unborn
[03:45.280 --> 03:48.600]  babies whose mothers are getting injected, having miscarriages and the little babies
[03:48.600 --> 03:52.520]  being given the COVID shots and the children and everybody else, I'm never going off air
[03:52.520 --> 03:58.040]  until I'm dead, so your attempts to silence me have only made me redouble my efforts and
[03:58.040 --> 04:02.240]  my commitment to fighting the tyrants, so I'm very, very thankful for God giving me
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.600]  will and strength and focus and discernment, I'm very thankful to my parents for raising
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.440]  me good and being loving and strong and the rest of my family and I'm again just incredibly
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.360]  thankful to the listeners, the crew, everybody that makes this transmission possible, our
[04:14.360 --> 04:19.000]  sponsors, our affiliates, everybody, please remember all this Thanksgiving, also give
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.280]  Thanksgiving to God for the great compounds he gave us in nature to have good immune

[04:53.000 --> 05:01.120]  with Steve Quayle straight ahead.
[05:01.120 --> 05:07.840]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[05:07.840 --> 05:13.240]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors, they associated
[05:13.240 --> 05:19.480]  these poisonous vapors with cold weather, of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching
[05:19.480 --> 05:25.840]  a chill that killed people, what was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3, you see the
[05:25.840 --> 05:32.280]  sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting enough
[05:32.280 --> 05:37.160]  sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[05:37.160 --> 05:41.080]  things to start replicating and taking your body over, so now it's more important than
[05:41.080 --> 05:45.760]  ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3 and we have the best with
[05:45.760 --> 05:52.480]  our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body for 50% off at infowarstore.com

[05:57.840 --> 06:23.360]  D3 gummies at infowarstore.com he was on with us one month ago and he repeatedly said they
[06:23.360 --> 06:29.600]  will use an errant missile out of Ukraine to blame Russia with a false flag and escalate
[06:29.600 --> 06:37.640]  the war and bring NATO in. Steve Quell joins us today, he was already set up a week ago,
[06:37.640 --> 06:43.800]  this is a synchronicity serendipity of the lord at work, I want to get to FTX and how
[06:43.800 --> 06:47.920]  I can bring down the whole house of cards, I agree with him and his expert analysis on
[06:47.920 --> 06:52.680]  that we'll get that with, there's only a few people out there that expose the new world
[06:52.680 --> 06:55.800]  order at a greater level than I did before I did, it's not about the credit but it's
[06:55.800 --> 07:00.040]  about understanding who was awake first so we can understand who has the discernment
[07:00.040 --> 07:05.200]  and it was Steve Quell and David Eich, both great minds both ahead of their times and
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.720]  both living legends and Steve Quell obviously needs introduction, he's here with us for
[07:09.720 --> 07:16.640]  the rest of the hour today but the first thing I wanted to hit was this, two years ago they
[07:16.640 --> 07:25.600]  had the official ADL summit in DC and Sacha Bear Cohen who made his money off absolutely
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.440]  horrible disgusting comedy, some of it's funny, some of it's just really disgusting but all
[07:31.440 --> 07:36.800]  granted he's funny sometimes, free speech allowed him to do it, he called for my arrest
[07:36.800 --> 07:43.320]  for talking about replacement theory, well son of theory the UN has an official plan
[07:43.320 --> 07:49.720]  of the replacement migration program since the 60s and they admit and French presidents
[07:49.720 --> 07:53.000]  talk about it and British prime ministers and American presidents and I have all the
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.960]  UN documents, this is why they sell euthanasia, abortion, sterilant chemicals in the food
[07:59.960 --> 08:04.840]  and water so we can't have children, so poor third world populations can be brought in
[08:04.840 --> 08:13.000]  as a permanent underclass, so now Chuck E. Schumer came out today, this just broke an
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  hour ago and calls for amnesty for all 11 million undocumented migrants in the US because
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.640]  American population is not reproducing on its own the same level as it used to, so direct
[08:23.640 --> 08:29.920]  replacement migration statement, we'll put a clip in a moment, Jamie White powered out
[08:29.920 --> 08:35.280]  a quick article on this, great replacement, Schumer calls for blanket amnesty of millions
[08:35.280 --> 08:41.120]  of illegals offset declining US population, here's another article we wrote five years
[08:41.120 --> 08:46.560]  ago, revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants for replacement migration,
[08:46.560 --> 08:52.060]  their word, it has the documents in it, but don't believe me, the UN is pushing the dangerous
[08:52.060 --> 08:59.640]  replacement migration conspiracy theory on their website and here is the actual documents,
[08:59.640 --> 09:03.680]  ladies and gentlemen, population division, department, economic and social affairs,
[09:03.680 --> 09:11.000]  United Nations, 2000 and that was in the year 2000 and there's a bunch of others, so the
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.320]  ADL says if you criticize force injections you're a Nazi and should be banned, debanked
[09:15.320 --> 09:21.000]  and arrested, literally arrested, all of this FTX is involved blocking therapeutics and
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.080]  helping run censorship with the ADL, same deal, so it all ties together, ladies and gentlemen
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.920]  it's a big deal, here is Chuck E. Schumer literally announcing replacement migration
[09:33.920 --> 09:40.080]  but if you talk about it, you get destroyed, these people are incredible, here it is.
[09:40.080 --> 09:47.200]  Now more than ever, we're short of workers, we have a population that is not reproducing
[09:47.200 --> 09:52.320]  it on its own with the same level that it used to, the only way we're going to have
[09:52.320 --> 09:57.600]  a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers and all
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.880]  of them because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers but get a path to citizenship
[10:01.880 --> 10:07.520]  for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here and all the smuggled kids they
[10:07.520 --> 10:08.520]  bring in.
[10:08.520 --> 10:14.040]  So a big, big deal, I wanted to start with that first, obviously the strikes out of Ukraine
[10:14.040 --> 10:20.200]  attacking Poland, Lloyd Austin saying yeah, Ukraine attacked Poland but it's Russia's
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.480]  fault, actual video, that's coming up, FTX all of it but Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com,
[10:25.480 --> 10:29.160]  bestselling author and researcher, we sell some of your amazing books, then FullWarStore.com
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.360]  you can find all your books at SteveQuayle.com, Steve, wow, what a time to be alive, everything
[10:33.360 --> 10:37.080]  you predicted 30 plus years ago now is here.
[10:37.080 --> 10:44.280]  Alex, I think the topic of obviously Schumer's request to, we're not reproducing ourselves
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.080]  just because they're basically, the government is killing off American citizens through in
[10:50.080 --> 10:57.040]  my opinion, obviously vaccinations obviously through abortion, infanticide but most importantly
[10:57.040 --> 11:01.760]  I think the people in this country have got to understand this, Liberty once lost is
[11:01.760 --> 11:07.320]  lost forever and that was John Adams and this is the bigger issue because Liberty, we used
[11:07.320 --> 11:11.760]  to have freedom of speech and I would say this, that anybody who thinks that is still
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.200]  in existence really has been mind controlled and what this whole theater of the political
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.560]  realm in my opinion, I just make it kind of like pig Latin but it's politicus distracticus
[11:22.560 --> 11:30.160]  because they just are distracting and obviously preoccupying the American people with I would
[11:30.160 --> 11:36.880]  call this trivial pursuit, trivial pursuit is how can anything change in the midterms
[11:36.880 --> 11:43.320]  and as you know, I'm on record, I said the midterms will change nothing because the same
[11:43.320 --> 11:47.880]  forces that stole the presidency would steal the midterms, no offense but that could be
[11:47.880 --> 11:48.880]  any more accurate.
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.520]  Hold on, you just had a Freudian slip, you called them the midchains which is the chains
[11:54.520 --> 11:57.040]  are still on, of election fraud.
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.720]  Well, and here's the thing, again, people are looking for a political solution to a
[12:02.720 --> 12:04.280]  spiritual problem.
[12:04.280 --> 12:09.760]  It's my contention that obviously the United States has declared, the Democrats specifically
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.120]  and the Republican whores have declared war on God, they've declared war on everything
[12:15.120 --> 12:21.320]  that made our country great, the destruction of the family, the destruction of a grateful
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.360]  nation versus the one that's basically, we're in a rape pillage and plunder, the United
[12:26.360 --> 12:33.080]  States has been taken under and when we watch what's going on, the heartbreak, why is it
[12:33.080 --> 12:38.560]  all these immigrants come in and they get huge amounts of government stipends, yet we have
[12:38.560 --> 12:41.840]  veterans sleeping and dying on the streets and more so now-
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.840]  And being encouraged in Canada and the US to kill themselves.
[12:45.840 --> 12:52.440]  Yep, and ladies and gentlemen, the nation, I want to say this, I'm responsible, don't
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.160]  get mad at the Alexes, but we are watching a nation that is dead on the inside, expecting
[12:58.160 --> 13:01.120]  to change things on the outside.
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.800]  We have lost our gratefulness to the living God, we have lost our freedom, liberty and
[13:05.800 --> 13:12.200]  again, John Adams nailed it, liberty once lost is lost forever, but again, the political
[13:12.200 --> 13:18.760]  distraction, if you will, what I used to call circus ridiculous, we've got three rings
[13:18.760 --> 13:24.800]  going on continually and that's to keep us off guard because we just had the most evil
[13:24.800 --> 13:31.080]  assemblage in the world at COP 27 in Egypt and I think Alex, everybody forgets what
[13:31.080 --> 13:35.320]  you've done, what I've done all the, those of us who have been around for decades on
[13:35.320 --> 13:42.680]  talk radio and obviously podcasting, broadcasting now, but we've quoted ad nauseam, these guys
[13:42.680 --> 13:48.560]  want to deliver the planet from pretty close 95% of the people you and I covered and this
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.880]  is important, covered the DEGLE report.
[13:51.880 --> 13:57.600]  You can see the acceleration to get to 2025 in the DEGLE report and explain for insurance
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.800]  corporate actuaries of a massive depopulated America, tell people about the DEGLE report
[14:02.800 --> 14:03.800]  that don't know.
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.600]  Well, the DEGLE report was put out by John Deagle, it's like a think tank, but it was
[14:08.600 --> 14:15.400]  a Rockefeller controlled and Rockefeller foundation controlled mouthpiece and by 2025, they're
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.360]  showing the population of the United States of America and they've been doing this now
[14:19.360 --> 14:23.720]  for the past four or five years, maybe even longer than that, but by 2025, the American
[14:23.720 --> 14:31.560]  population would be brought down to a hundred million or less, a hundred million or less.
[14:31.560 --> 14:36.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, that means 260 million plus people have got to be done away with
[14:36.240 --> 14:42.600]  and what's problematic and provocative is when you understand that the zero population
[14:42.600 --> 14:48.480]  people and what we're seeing that just took place in Egypt, we're seeing in my opinion,
[14:48.480 --> 14:55.280]  the absolute Luciferian introduction to globalism to destroy every nation state, obviously United
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.440]  States, Western Europe, obviously big time Russia and they hate Russia the most because
[15:00.440 --> 15:03.320]  Russia believes in their own country.
[15:03.320 --> 15:10.680]  I wish we would be as jealous for our country as all of these these disgusting politicos
[15:10.680 --> 15:15.840]  seem to want to help everybody else but make war on us and how is it Alex seriously?
[15:15.840 --> 15:22.240]  How is it that with the FTX and this is important that the kleptocurrency forget crypto, it
[15:22.240 --> 15:28.320]  was kleptocurrency that tied to the Democratic Party, 37 billion by the way, that's only
[15:28.320 --> 15:34.280]  face value, that's not that's notional value, that's not the derivative value.
[15:34.280 --> 15:40.600]  Within days, there's a new cry to give Zelensky in the Ukraine another $37 billion.
[15:40.600 --> 15:46.400]  And so what I think people have got to understand now, they no longer want to withhold the pillaging,
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.200]  it's going on and people don't think anymore.
[15:49.200 --> 15:50.200]  And stay right there.
[15:50.200 --> 15:51.200]  Stay right there.
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.440]  I think what you're saying is we're not in beta, they're in operational now, we're inside
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.880]  the new world order now, like that old Johnny Cash song you're in the jailhouse now.
[15:58.880 --> 16:02.640]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[16:02.640 --> 16:07.720]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.440]  Your chance to empower your body, your health, your immune system and more and keep us on
[16:11.440 --> 16:13.200]  the air a win-win.
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.360]  The bad news is a bunch of our best selling products have already sold out and because
[16:17.360 --> 16:20.840]  of supply chain breakdowns, it'll be months and months until these great products come
[16:20.840 --> 16:21.840]  back in.
[16:21.840 --> 16:28.840]  X3 sold out, our great American coffee blend has sold out, Biotrystallinium has sold out,
[16:28.840 --> 16:34.920]  but what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate
[16:34.920 --> 16:41.080]  Turmeric Formula, Whole Food Multivitamin, Rainforest Ultra, Super Mill Vitality and
[16:41.080 --> 16:42.080]  so much more.
[16:42.080 --> 16:47.000]  So, you've only got a few weeks to get these products at the lowest price you're ever going
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  to find them.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.320]  Don't fight the crowds, don't fight the traffic, don't do all your Christmas shopping in a
[16:51.320 --> 16:56.520]  month like a fool, do it now, get it all over with, get a great deal, keep Info Wars on

[17:56.640 --> 18:00.240]  Free gifts for every order at infowarstore.com.
[18:00.240 --> 18:05.600]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.560]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[18:10.560 --> 18:16.200]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[18:16.200 --> 18:22.000]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.680]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars, despite the massive
[18:27.680 --> 18:33.600]  lawfare being waged against Info Wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[18:33.600 --> 18:38.840]  Info Wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[18:38.840 --> 18:44.320]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps Info Wars on the air and what that does
[18:44.320 --> 18:50.120]  is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression, so
[18:50.120 --> 18:55.960]  continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to places like Save Info Wars, continue
[18:55.960 --> 19:01.680]  to keep Info Wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[19:01.680 --> 19:07.080]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.120]  a healthier life.
[19:09.120 --> 19:12.320]  Info Wars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with
[19:12.320 --> 19:14.600]  a supplement that contains both.
[19:14.600 --> 19:19.560]  This Info Wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[19:19.560 --> 19:21.160]  from the Info Wars store.
[19:21.160 --> 19:25.960]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[19:25.960 --> 19:28.680]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[19:28.680 --> 19:33.520]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[19:33.520 --> 19:38.200]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[19:38.200 --> 19:39.200]  shown.
[19:39.200 --> 19:43.480]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[19:43.480 --> 19:48.080]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[19:48.080 --> 19:53.200]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[19:53.200 --> 19:54.200]  like here in America.
[19:54.200 --> 19:59.240]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our
[19:59.240 --> 20:01.840]  rose hips don't lie.
[20:01.840 --> 20:28.880]  Making of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:28.880 --> 20:33.800]  Trailblazer of trailblazers that predicted before anybody else exactly what we're now
[20:33.800 --> 20:34.800]  living through.
[20:34.800 --> 20:39.000]  A man way before his time, a man in the wilderness.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.800]  So I want to get into FTX, I want to get into the war in Ukraine, I want to get into the
[20:42.800 --> 20:46.440]  missile strike, they admit Ukraine launched but the Pentagon says it still rises fault,
[20:46.440 --> 20:47.440]  incredible clip.
[20:47.440 --> 20:51.040]  I want to get into Trump versus the Santas, what you think is coming next with the global
[20:51.040 --> 20:52.040]  list.
[20:52.040 --> 20:53.040]  Obviously we don't have two years to get Trump in.
[20:53.040 --> 20:56.320]  All of it with you, it will be 15 minutes with us in the next hour.
[20:56.320 --> 21:00.080]  The Kate Dally takes over ahead of Owen Schroder, 3PM Central with the war, but you were getting
[21:00.080 --> 21:01.080]  into FTX.
[21:01.080 --> 21:06.600]  Take your time here because this is so big, upwards of 100 billion leverage capital to
[21:06.600 --> 21:11.480]  Ukraine, money laundering, all of it going on, money goes to Ukraine for the treasury
[21:11.480 --> 21:16.440]  with Biden comes back to FTX, the Democrats and then patriots online and a lot of others
[21:16.440 --> 21:19.080]  that were exposing FTX the last few months.
[21:19.080 --> 21:22.400]  I see this as a big victory that it's been exposed.
[21:22.400 --> 21:25.760]  They try to recycle it down and say, oh, we need to regulate all cryptocurrencies if it's
[21:25.760 --> 21:26.760]  all bad.
[21:26.760 --> 21:30.760]  Know what they did was bad using it for money laundering, Steve Quill, what's your expert
[21:30.760 --> 21:31.760]  view?
[21:31.760 --> 21:40.320]  Well, FTX is a great example of what I would call a private railroad for ill-gotten gains
[21:40.320 --> 21:45.360]  to grease the palms of all those that were in the money chain.
[21:45.360 --> 21:51.080]  And obviously the poster child isn't interesting, Alex, his name is Bankman Fried, and this
[21:51.080 --> 21:56.600]  thing has the potential, his middle name and last name has the potential to fry all the
[21:56.600 --> 22:02.120]  bankman just like when Bernie Madoff did what he did, he basically made up with everybody's
[22:02.120 --> 22:03.120]  money.
[22:03.120 --> 22:05.480]  And this is way bigger than Madoff though, right?
[22:05.480 --> 22:06.480]  Absolutely.
[22:06.480 --> 22:12.760]  This is beyond huge because so many people were tied in to FTX because let's face it,
[22:12.760 --> 22:18.040]  most of the techno billionaires, not all, but the majority of them are, like they have
[22:18.040 --> 22:25.240]  a tight communication channel, so they were using their holdings and FTX to leverage,
[22:25.240 --> 22:28.560]  you know, and when you've got a little bit of money and you can use a whole lot of leverage,
[22:28.560 --> 22:31.960]  you can get yourself a whole lot of money or a whole lot of trouble.
[22:31.960 --> 22:38.800]  The true actuarial state of what FTX's meltdown means is being hush-hush.
[22:38.800 --> 22:42.680]  And you know this, Alex, nobody is really dealing with that because when you're dealing
[22:42.680 --> 22:47.800]  with the world of derivatives and what you're talking about in derivatives are just basically
[22:47.800 --> 22:55.680]  liars paper that everybody is packaging somebody else's debt and trying to sell it, clip coupons,
[22:55.680 --> 23:03.000]  and now I believe this has the potential to, and really to bring the whole system down
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.120]  because prior to FTX, and this is what's critical, remember the sleight of hand, the sleight
[23:08.120 --> 23:12.440]  of hand, the magician keeps you occupied with his left hand, does the trick with the right
[23:12.440 --> 23:14.800]  hand so you don't see what's going on.
[23:14.800 --> 23:22.000]  And we're watching now the revulsion and the repelling, if you will, of the American dollar
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.440]  being set aside, and that is the absolute straw that breaks the camel's back.
[23:28.440 --> 23:34.880]  We're watching just absolute, how should I say this, financial decimation.
[23:34.880 --> 23:37.240]  And somebody said, well, how do we pay all this money back?
[23:37.240 --> 23:38.600]  The point is we don't.
[23:38.600 --> 23:41.320]  The point is they don't care to, they know they can't.
[23:41.320 --> 23:45.880]  So now we hear about a central bank, U.S. digital bank, 12 major banks are going to
[23:45.880 --> 23:49.360]  give, you know, basically a programmable digital dollar.
[23:49.360 --> 23:51.200]  Who's going to trust them?
[23:51.200 --> 23:53.200]  Who's going to trust them, nobody.
[23:53.200 --> 23:57.480]  And now behind the scenes, Alex, there are a lot of people making claims against their
[23:57.480 --> 24:02.680]  T bills, T bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, Treasury bonds, and U.S. T notes.
[24:02.680 --> 24:04.640]  They want something real.
[24:04.640 --> 24:06.040]  They want commodities.
[24:06.040 --> 24:07.800]  They want farmland.
[24:07.800 --> 24:10.160]  They want our natural resources.
[24:10.160 --> 24:15.240]  But what most people can't understand is that when you see 100 billion, you brought the
[24:15.240 --> 24:20.880]  number up, you know, that would bring our total, total support for Zelensky to 100 billion.
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.160]  Can anybody put two and two together and say, and I don't believe, I believe your listeners
[24:25.160 --> 24:31.160]  can, our listeners can, but the bottom line is, is that where is the disconnect that we're
[24:31.160 --> 24:36.280]  being raped and pillaged and plundered as the American taxpayer, and they're throwing
[24:36.280 --> 24:39.800]  money away, and then you come to find out the whole things of Ponzi scheme.
[24:39.800 --> 24:45.360]  Now, I'm being told, and this is exclusive to your podcast, a broadcast today, is the
[24:45.360 --> 24:52.240]  fact that they're already setting up another vehicle, another crypto, and I call them kleptocurrency,
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.440]  somebody, I didn't make that name up, but Alex, we're watching the crypto currencies
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.440]  turn into kryptonite for the financial systems.
[25:02.440 --> 25:09.800]  Somebody who's cross collateralized, AOSB, who O.C., C.D. and E.O., F.G. and H., and on
[25:09.800 --> 25:10.800]  down the road.
[25:10.800 --> 25:15.520]  Just like the 2008 crisis, anything that this is involved in, it infects it.
[25:15.520 --> 25:16.520]  Absolutely.
[25:16.520 --> 25:17.520]  And that's a great word.
[25:17.520 --> 25:21.640]  This is a financial doomsday infection.
[25:21.640 --> 25:23.440]  That's a great word.
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.960]  And the financial doomsday, and I want people to understand what happens when the world
[25:27.960 --> 25:30.440]  says, we don't want your dollars anymore.
[25:30.440 --> 25:32.240]  We're watching that with the BRICS nation.
[25:32.240 --> 25:34.280]  We watch, again, we watch that.
[25:34.280 --> 25:37.400]  No, I'm telling you, what is your intel on what brought this down?
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.160]  Because I saw some of the other more legitimate exchanges in groups attacking FTX last year.
[25:42.160 --> 25:45.040]  It built your crescendo, them saying it was a Democrat front.
[25:45.040 --> 25:47.840]  Was it some good group striking or just the internet's common sense?
[25:47.840 --> 25:51.480]  I mean, it obviously hurts the deep state that FTX has fallen, or was that part of their
[25:51.480 --> 25:53.360]  larger plan?
[25:53.360 --> 25:57.720]  As part of their, that's part of their larger plan.
[25:57.720 --> 26:01.560]  Because again, ladies and gentlemen, remember this, in the crypto world, there's a lot
[26:01.560 --> 26:06.720]  of people that were common that got onto it and saw it in an early stage and bought into
[26:06.720 --> 26:07.720]  it.
[26:07.720 --> 26:12.600]  But now, remember, they don't want just something to clothe a Schwab.
[26:12.600 --> 26:13.600]  They want it all.
[26:13.600 --> 26:16.120]  They're going to own it all and you'll own nothing and be happy.
[26:16.120 --> 26:17.240]  Well, you'll be dead.
[26:17.240 --> 26:24.120]  But the point is, is that the bigger picture is this, the complete destruction of national
[26:24.120 --> 26:25.120]  currencies.
[26:25.120 --> 26:29.600]  And this is why the war against Russia, when President Putin, listen, this is fact, when
[26:29.600 --> 26:37.520]  President Putin backed the ruble with gold, he took the infinite ability to print US dollars
[26:37.520 --> 26:38.520]  away.
[26:38.520 --> 26:41.800]  And notice the ruble is the strongest currency next to the dollar in the world.
[26:41.800 --> 26:45.280]  It was a weak currency previous to that one move.
[26:45.280 --> 26:46.280]  That one move.
[26:46.280 --> 26:48.680]  And then, and I want to share something.
[26:48.680 --> 26:55.480]  And then with the brilliance of a chess master, look, I wouldn't want to play chess against
[26:55.480 --> 26:56.480]  him.
[26:56.480 --> 27:03.200]  But the President Putin recognized one thing, that he's, and look, I'm not an apologist,
[27:03.200 --> 27:04.200]  okay?
[27:04.200 --> 27:10.120]  And because you tell the truth, that commodities ultimately, Alex, are the basis of all trade
[27:10.120 --> 27:11.120]  power.
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.120]  Sure, you're being a realist.
[27:12.120 --> 27:16.200]  Fiat stuff is only bound to real, tangible energy and real products.
[27:16.200 --> 27:17.200]  Right.
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.200]  And again, you know, here's this, ladies and gentlemen, the great reset.
[27:21.200 --> 27:23.480]  Just get rid of that, Bravo Sierra.
[27:23.480 --> 27:25.240]  It's the great destruction.
[27:25.240 --> 27:28.320]  It's the total destruction of nation states.
[27:28.320 --> 27:31.680]  Because again, I want to say this, Alex, COP 27 in Egypt.
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.600]  People don't understand this, but they rewrote the Ten Commandments, evidently, you know,
[27:36.600 --> 27:42.200]  they thought they could do a better job than God, making literally the creation their God,
[27:42.200 --> 27:43.200]  worshiping the creation.
[27:43.200 --> 27:50.440]  But in the meantime, they're doing stuff behind the site of the common man, by the way, 400
[27:50.440 --> 27:56.240]  private jets, you know, 400 private jets going to Mount Sinai, by the way, the one they went
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.960]  to wasn't the real one, the real Mount Sinai is in Saudi Arabia.
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.200]  But where they went to have their meeting, Alex, I'm being told, I don't think anybody
[28:06.200 --> 28:12.720]  said this publicly, but I'm being told by people that know that interface of that world,
[28:12.720 --> 28:16.600]  that they've already decided who the coming world leader is.
[28:16.600 --> 28:21.240]  They kept him hidden, but this is the same guy that Prince Charles, now King Charles
[28:21.240 --> 28:23.760]  referred to at that global summit.
[28:23.760 --> 28:29.440]  So ladies and gentlemen, all of this politicus distracticus, and I want to say something,
[28:29.440 --> 28:31.880]  isn't that the definition of insanity?
[28:31.880 --> 28:37.600]  And Alex, I don't know if you've addressed it, but how is it that people think that elections
[28:37.600 --> 28:42.720]  in the midterms would not be stolen like they were in the presidential race?
[28:42.720 --> 28:48.520]  And how is it that we're going to see any change, and now I hear a same mind control?
[28:48.520 --> 28:50.000]  Hold on, stay there, stay there.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.960]  You brought up the event, they called for world government, global currency, we'll get
[28:53.960 --> 28:58.080]  to Russia, we'll get to the Mark of the Beast, the Antichrist, straight ahead with Steve
[28:58.080 --> 28:59.080]  Quell.
[28:59.080 --> 29:04.880]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here, we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[29:04.880 --> 29:10.680]  Now the good news is, I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[29:10.680 --> 29:15.280]  The bad news is, by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out, we
[29:15.280 --> 29:17.320]  won't get more for months and months and months.
[29:17.320 --> 29:21.200]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of
[29:21.200 --> 29:22.200]  the year.
[29:22.200 --> 29:26.440]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3, and BioTruth Selenium, and our Wake Up America
[29:26.440 --> 29:31.360]  award-winning coffee, and now DNA Force Plus, VitaMemeralFusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric
[29:31.360 --> 29:36.880]  Formula, so many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso
[29:36.880 --> 29:42.360]  Beats, Secret 12, they are all going to sell out in the next few weeks, or in the next
[29:42.360 --> 29:43.360]  month.
[29:43.360 --> 29:47.360]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today, so every hour you wait, more stuff will be
[29:47.360 --> 29:53.840]  sold out at infowarstore.com, promo code 1776, and you'll get an additional 10% off, the
[29:53.840 --> 29:55.840]  already giant savings, at infowarstore.com.
[29:55.840 --> 29:58.840]  Thank you so much for your support, God bless.
[29:58.840 --> 30:06.680]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting
[30:06.680 --> 30:13.480]  these mail-in ballots, and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[30:13.480 --> 30:20.120]  when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day, and that's the problem,
[30:20.120 --> 30:26.680]  and everything changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections, mailing
[30:26.680 --> 30:31.800]  ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[30:31.800 --> 30:36.280]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[30:36.280 --> 30:40.840]  that can be stolen like this, and I believe that, just like I believe the election was
[30:40.840 --> 30:46.520]  stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and
[30:46.520 --> 30:52.520]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact
[30:52.520 --> 30:56.240]  that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[30:56.240 --> 31:00.200]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.

[31:17.840 --> 31:22.520]  because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[31:22.520 --> 31:29.640]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.

[32:02.480 --> 32:05.040]  It's a post COVID world now.
[32:05.040 --> 32:08.800]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[32:08.800 --> 32:10.040]  There's a solution.

[33:01.760 --> 33:23.920]  Reporting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.920 --> 33:33.240]  He never gives up, he's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[33:33.240 --> 33:41.280]  Well, the case of Steve Well, we got a lion by the tail, he was getting into the whole
[33:41.280 --> 33:49.080]  global attack, the world government being announced, and so at the big UN event that's
[33:49.080 --> 33:52.800]  just now ending with 400 jets and all the New World Order there, say you can't have food
[33:52.800 --> 33:57.920]  or water, you'll have nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll be dead, you'll love it.
[33:57.920 --> 34:02.320]  They are again announcing what's already being set up, G20 to adopt vaccine passports using
[34:02.320 --> 34:06.720]  WHO standards, let's have a digital health certificate acknowledged by the World Health
[34:06.720 --> 34:12.760]  Organization under the UN, you've been vaccinated or tested properly, then you can move around.
[34:12.760 --> 34:17.920]  This is their holy grail of the mark of the beast, here it is.
[34:17.920 --> 34:26.280]  So let's have a digital health certificate acknowledged by WHO, if you have been vaccinated
[34:26.280 --> 34:30.320]  or tested properly, then you can move around.
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.440]  So for the next pandemic, instead of stopping the movement of the people 100% which clock
[34:36.440 --> 34:42.360]  the economy globally, you can still provide some movement of the people.
[34:42.360 --> 34:49.760]  Indonesia has achieved, G20 country has agreed to have this digital certificate using WHO
[34:49.760 --> 34:56.720]  standard and we will submit into the next World Health Assembly in Geneva as the revision
[34:56.720 --> 34:59.080]  to international health regulation.
[34:59.080 --> 35:04.760]  So hopefully for the next pandemic, we can still see some movement of the people, some
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.160]  movement of the goods and movement of the economy.
[35:08.160 --> 35:11.560]  So they hold you hostage with a shot that makes you sick and doesn't work and say next
[35:11.560 --> 35:14.000]  time we'll just give you a passport and make sure you take it.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  Steve Quill, that's exactly what you were getting at, please continue.
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.680]  Well, first of all, they want to control all travel, they want to control all issues of
[35:24.680 --> 35:31.840]  your life and that doesn't get any more provocative and clearer than the gentleman making that
[35:31.840 --> 35:36.640]  statement and I got to tell you something and again ladies and gentlemen, they've taken
[35:36.640 --> 35:42.440]  away everything, the United States we once had pre-lockdown, no longer exists, there's
[35:42.440 --> 35:48.800]  nothing in the budget, but getting back to his idea, a global ID is the mark of the beast,
[35:48.800 --> 35:51.280]  it's right out of the book of Revelation.
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.600]  People can say, I don't believe all that stuff, yeah, well you just had the most powerful
[35:55.600 --> 36:02.920]  Luciferians in Egypt telling, in essence, we're going to write the Ten Commandments
[36:02.920 --> 36:07.240]  because you're going to be a God and that's the same lie that was told to Adam and Eve
[36:07.240 --> 36:13.080]  in the Garden, but going further than that, they have a plan and it doesn't include most,
[36:13.080 --> 36:17.720]  all they want is worker bees because when you're talking about killing off 95% of the
[36:17.720 --> 36:23.720]  world's population, remember King Charles, his father, Prince Philip was on record as
[36:23.720 --> 36:29.720]  saying he wanted to come back as a virus to destroy a world's population, talking about
[36:29.720 --> 36:30.720]  reincarnation.
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.640]  Well, Alex, you know this, they're going to vaccinate, they're going to assassinate,
[36:34.640 --> 36:39.920]  they're going to continue on and right now the story is breaking, that Ebola is breaking
[36:39.920 --> 36:47.600]  out in Uganda, now Tanzania is shutting down and the US is preparing plans for Ebola.
[36:47.600 --> 36:56.120]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, years ago, decades ago, the whole idea of Ebola being cultivated,
[36:56.120 --> 36:59.520]  it was actually portrayed in the movie, I want people to understand this, Hollywood
[36:59.520 --> 37:05.640]  again telegraphed in the movie Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman and Renee Russo, the shenanigans
[37:05.640 --> 37:10.480]  that go on the bioweapon hearing and for the record, Alex, one of the biggest cover-ups
[37:10.480 --> 37:15.640]  in history are the US-funded biolabs that are not only race specific, not only haplo
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.000]  group, genotype specific, but individual specific.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.440]  In other words, bioweapons have redefined, they've gone from a shotgun to a shotgun.
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.280]  And you've been saying that for 25 years and now it's the source of James Bond movies,
[37:28.280 --> 37:30.480]  but it's in the news, it's real.
[37:30.480 --> 37:31.480]  It's in the news, it's real.
[37:31.480 --> 37:37.600]  So what is, I think that people have to understand something, they have to get involved with
[37:37.600 --> 37:43.280]  their own desire to live, you know, you've spent your life, I've spent my life, the majority
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.080]  of it trying to warn people, but the toughest thing is, is that when people choose that,
[37:48.080 --> 37:51.720]  well, it'll just get better, we'll just vote the right man in.
[37:51.720 --> 37:54.840]  You've, ladies and gentlemen, you know what you're saying is key, find your life force,
[37:54.840 --> 37:58.720]  find your connection to God, realize you're under attack, it's biblical, it's real and
[37:58.720 --> 38:01.520]  you're in a war, realize you're in a war.
[38:01.520 --> 38:04.920]  Realize we're in a war, but again, people think it's only fought with guns and bullets
[38:04.920 --> 38:10.640]  and bioweapons and nuclear weapons and all that, but there is a insidious control.
[38:10.640 --> 38:13.480]  This is what the question I get asked more than any other one.
[38:13.480 --> 38:17.520]  How is it that the whole world goes into lockdown at the same point?
[38:17.520 --> 38:20.920]  How is it that the economy shut down at the same point?
[38:20.920 --> 38:25.120]  And the answer to that is simple, Lucifer, but you know, former...
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.360]  This is a world government test of power, so it's not just info wars, it's not just
[38:29.360 --> 38:32.480]  money wars, the key is spirit wars.
[38:32.480 --> 38:38.400]  It is spirit wars and again, you know, people are having all types of interactions with
[38:38.400 --> 38:45.600]  cryptids and strange creatures, everything from incubus, succubus, all kinds of the veils
[38:45.600 --> 38:52.680]  being ripped, Alex, and again, Hollywood prep people and when you've made this bizarre
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.400]  world, not you, but they have made this bizarre world where they told you in advance what
[38:57.400 --> 39:01.920]  they're getting ready to do and ladies and gentlemen, there's one goal and this is one
[39:01.920 --> 39:06.560]  goal only and it's interesting, both Lucifer and all of his minions share it, the complete
[39:06.560 --> 39:08.520]  destruction of human race.
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.720]  When you, Alex, and I started walking and talking about transhumanism, most people thought
[39:13.720 --> 39:17.000]  that was a movie that came out at the same time as Transformers.
[39:17.000 --> 39:25.080]  No, the title was really provocative, but what we're watching now is every area of the planet
[39:25.080 --> 39:33.160]  in political, religious, sociological, and the scientific world converging to control
[39:33.160 --> 39:38.480]  all narratives so that the word truth never exists and I remember when I first met you.
[39:38.480 --> 39:39.480]  Well, let's expand on that.
[39:39.480 --> 39:44.040]  You've got to go back and I've got archives, but they only go back 15 years.
[39:44.040 --> 39:49.440]  If you've got archives of you 25, 30 years ago, everything you said, because you were
[39:49.440 --> 39:52.280]  my guest frequently, literally now happened.
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.000]  So people think Alex Jones stuff is incredible 20 years ago coming true.
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.160]  We've got to find, I know it's in your books, but we've got to find, or maybe you can highlight
[40:01.160 --> 40:05.060]  your books and I've got them around here somewhere and come on about it because people really
[40:05.060 --> 40:07.560]  pay attention to something 20, 30 years ahead.
[40:07.560 --> 40:10.120]  I mean, you laid this out.
[40:10.120 --> 40:18.520]  Well, again, we're at right now, ladies and gentlemen, it's not a just a what what what's
[40:18.520 --> 40:19.520]  what I want.
[40:19.520 --> 40:22.840]  We're not just trying to tell people that, oh, in the future, it's going to be bad.
[40:22.840 --> 40:26.000]  Everything that we warned about is now it's not future oriented.
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.600]  It's now importing 11 million people because our birth rates are down by the very people
[40:31.600 --> 40:38.640]  that introduced Zeno estrogens into the drinking water, American males have been in essence
[40:38.640 --> 40:44.800]  chemically castrated, lowest sperm count, but everything injecting children with a vaccination
[40:44.800 --> 40:49.680]  from hell, all of this stuff 15 people at the Center for Disease Creation, and that's
[40:49.680 --> 40:50.680]  what it's been.
[40:50.680 --> 40:56.200]  I've never called it anything else in my opinion, but all of them vote to vaccinate.
[40:56.200 --> 41:03.920]  You know, infants, what, six months on, I don't think that the ability of people to
[41:03.920 --> 41:07.640]  put cause and effect into the same sentence or thought process.
[41:07.640 --> 41:08.640]  This is genocide.
[41:08.640 --> 41:10.800]  This is depopulation.
[41:10.800 --> 41:12.440]  This is forced use in Asia.
[41:12.440 --> 41:13.440]  We're not in beta.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.440]  We're in operational.
[41:14.440 --> 41:17.160]  We're going to come back and talk about some key ways to protect ourselves and get into
[41:17.160 --> 41:20.840]  what's coming next and the Russia situation and then blaming the missile attack on Russia,
[41:20.840 --> 41:23.480]  even though they admit Russia didn't do it.
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.440]  But Steve, at the end of the day, lead us in a minute of prayer before we go to break,
[41:27.440 --> 41:30.440]  because you don't do this a lot, but we lead us in a minute of prayer because God's the
[41:30.440 --> 41:31.440]  answer.
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.680]  Well, Lord, I ask that you've given Alex the platform.
[41:35.680 --> 41:37.160]  You've given me the platform.
[41:37.160 --> 41:42.560]  I pray you take the veil and the scales off people's eyes and hearts, even those who are
[41:42.560 --> 41:46.960]  agnostic, even those who are atheistic, God, this is the time.
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.080]  This is the time your Bible has declared your word, Lord, that it would be in the end times
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.400]  in that period, just that's presenting itself now, Lord, prior to the second coming of Jesus
[41:58.400 --> 41:59.400]  Christ.
[41:59.400 --> 42:00.400]  Lord, I ask your protection over Alex.
[42:00.400 --> 42:05.000]  I ask you protection over all info warriors, the people that are hungry for the truth.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.880]  They cannot get away from the fact Jesus, you are the truth, the way in the life.
[42:08.880 --> 42:13.440]  And Lord, I pray for your protection over every single one of the listeners and viewers
[42:13.440 --> 42:17.600]  and those who are fighting for freedom because God, you are the ultimate source of freedom.
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.640]  You are the ultimate source of liberty and God, you are the ultimate protection because
[42:22.640 --> 42:28.560]  outside of you, Lord, we can only do what we can do, but you can do the impossible.
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.640]  Thank you, God, for this opportunity to pray and believe for a miracle, Lord, in turning
[42:33.640 --> 42:39.280]  this whole situation around, not only with Alex, but Lord, for exposing all the evil
[42:39.280 --> 42:42.880]  and then people can see the choices they have to make.
[42:42.880 --> 42:44.280]  I'm into that.
[42:44.280 --> 42:45.280]  All right.
[42:45.280 --> 42:46.280]  We're going to come back.
[42:46.280 --> 42:50.480]  Alex Tower, Kate Daly takes over, will Jamon Jefferson and Eric have been holding patiently
[42:50.480 --> 42:51.480]  as well.
[42:51.480 --> 42:53.520]  This is such an insane time.
[42:53.520 --> 42:57.240]  We're going to look at Russia that we talked about up front, the insanity of blaming Russia
[42:57.240 --> 42:59.400]  for an attack to admit Ukraine launched.
[42:59.400 --> 43:02.640]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[43:02.640 --> 43:07.720]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.

[44:05.280 --> 44:06.280]  banned.video.
[44:06.280 --> 44:09.000]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.600]  I'm going to do that right now.
[44:10.600 --> 44:14.360]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.520]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez,
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.720]  how many people have just been put on a launch pad, the outer space because of Alex Jones,
[44:24.720 --> 44:25.720]  including myself.
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.080]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[44:30.080 --> 44:33.840]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex
[44:33.840 --> 44:34.840]  Jones.
[44:34.840 --> 44:38.600]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the
[44:38.600 --> 44:40.600]  super Tim Cass IRL.
[44:40.600 --> 44:45.840]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned.video for granted because
[44:45.840 --> 44:48.160]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[44:48.160 --> 44:50.960]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[44:50.960 --> 44:55.800]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support Info Wars, leave a donation
[44:55.800 --> 44:56.800]  right now.
[44:56.800 --> 45:01.640]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[45:01.640 --> 45:06.520]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the Globals.
[45:06.520 --> 45:12.520]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[45:12.520 --> 45:13.520]  world.
[45:13.520 --> 45:17.520]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[45:17.520 --> 45:19.520]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[45:19.520 --> 45:24.520]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Info Wars are the real
[45:24.520 --> 45:26.520]  reason you've had the success.
[45:26.520 --> 45:31.480]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever
[45:31.480 --> 45:32.480]  had.
[45:32.480 --> 45:39.240]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[45:39.240 --> 45:43.160]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[45:43.160 --> 45:46.000]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[45:46.000 --> 45:51.680]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[45:51.680 --> 45:55.560]  now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.320]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[46:00.320 --> 46:05.280]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has
[46:05.280 --> 46:11.320]  truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged
[46:11.320 --> 46:12.320]  the globalist.
[46:12.320 --> 46:17.960]  He is, consecutively, the most googled man in the world in the last two years, and that's
[46:17.960 --> 46:22.640]  because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[46:22.640 --> 46:29.760]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[46:29.760 --> 46:36.600]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the Top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and
[46:36.600 --> 46:37.600]  his crew.
[46:37.600 --> 46:41.600]  Now you have the chance to benefit in body, mind, and soul with the same supplements that
[46:41.600 --> 46:43.520]  Andrew Tate takes himself.

[46:51.160 --> 46:54.840]  of Andrew Tate's new supplements that are the highest quality on the market.
[46:54.840 --> 46:57.200]  Men grow up to be like me, you're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.720]  record, dedicated athletes who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[47:01.720 --> 47:07.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:07.640 --> 47:29.600]  Well, the one and only Steve Quill is our guest here on the Alex Jones show, going in the
[47:29.600 --> 47:33.960]  second hour with me, but it was Steve Quill a few years ago, got me in touch with some
[47:33.960 --> 47:37.960]  really amazing people that have the highest quality, lowest price you're going to find
[47:37.960 --> 47:43.120]  anywhere, high quality satellite phones, but they've got satellite phones available right
[47:43.120 --> 47:48.560]  now for a limited time, they're sold everywhere else, but they've also got this dongle that
[47:48.560 --> 47:53.160]  plugs into a regular cell phone, but protect where you're at, isn't satellite tracked,
[47:53.160 --> 47:58.360]  isn't cell tower tracked, and you can send text messages with it unlimited.
[47:58.360 --> 48:01.040]  So Steve, you're really the expert on this, you've been harping on this, but with all
[48:01.040 --> 48:06.120]  the craziness going on, we're not as obsessed with shutting down thought leaders like myself,
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.960]  the Tucker Carlson and you and many others, they're obsessed with the average person not
[48:11.960 --> 48:12.960]  being able to communicate.
[48:12.960 --> 48:19.000]  So the crazy times that are coming, the number one insurance policy obviously is a relationship
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.840]  with God, cash, verbal food, water, friends you can trust, self-defense and communications.
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.720]  And so this system with the dongle from infowarsphone.com, that just takes you to the biggest company,
[48:31.720 --> 48:38.320]  Patriot company here in the US, you can get your free ISAT tube, satellite phone, all
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.600]  you do is pay for the minutes, they also have the bivvy stick dongle that turns any cell
[48:43.600 --> 48:49.120]  phone into a satellite phone, just amazing systems at infowarsphone.com, I want to get
[48:49.120 --> 48:53.440]  back into Russia and the war and the missile and the Pentagon saying, yeah Ukraine launched
[48:53.440 --> 48:57.320]  it, but it's really Russia's fault and we're all that's going with you, but spend some
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.280]  time because you're really the guy that's been the expert on this about these amazing
[49:01.280 --> 49:03.280]  products at infowarsphone.com.
[49:03.280 --> 49:09.360]  Well, first of all, we're watching what happened to Florida on two occasions where the power
[49:09.360 --> 49:10.360]  went out.
[49:10.360 --> 49:15.040]  We're watching the communications realm be interfered with all over the planet, cyber
[49:15.040 --> 49:19.560]  attacks, even last night, there were multiple cyber attacks, the neat thing about the bivvy
[49:19.560 --> 49:27.240]  stick and the satellite phones is you're not dependent upon land-based uplinks or downlinks,
[49:27.240 --> 49:31.480]  you can go satellite to satellite, for instance, satellites, you just held up, you just put
[49:31.480 --> 49:37.280]  up the image of the bivvy stick, when things go just all the way down the tube, thank you,
[49:37.280 --> 49:43.160]  I can communicate with you through bivvy stick to the satellite and the only thing your cell
[49:43.160 --> 49:50.320]  phone does is it becomes the transmitting type, you're putting your information, data
[49:50.320 --> 49:55.200]  input and data reception, but you're not linked to the cell phone towers, you're not linked
[49:55.200 --> 49:57.400]  to global power grids.
[49:57.400 --> 50:00.960]  So this is one of the most critical devices and I think the satellite phone store has
[50:00.960 --> 50:06.840]  just knocked it out of the ballpark in three ballparks because in essence, they give you
[50:06.840 --> 50:11.960]  the bivvy stick, the phone and you have to sign up for a monthly deal and I know the
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.520]  owners, I've known the owners of this company for ten years, maybe longer than that now
[50:16.520 --> 50:22.480]  and it's the most reasonably priced two-way communication device that isn't dependent
[50:22.480 --> 50:27.360]  upon any power that's going to be present or not present.
[50:27.360 --> 50:31.440]  And I mean, here's a quick analogy because they've got amazing, very inexpensive high
[50:31.440 --> 50:36.040]  quality solar little panel hand-held systems, so you're totally off the grid, they've got
[50:36.040 --> 50:39.440]  great batteries, they've got hundreds of great products, they supply the board of patrol,
[50:39.440 --> 50:44.400]  you name it, but my analogy is, remember old fashioned TV, you watched it, it didn't watch
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.200]  you, you picked up a transmission, it's the same thing with these, you're communicating
[50:49.200 --> 50:52.960]  but they're not tracking you, this is really great.
[50:52.960 --> 50:58.640]  Well and communication is the number one thing, keeping our brains focused and when
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.520]  you can communicate and get information, listen ladies and gentlemen, the biggest trafficking
[51:02.520 --> 51:08.280]  in the world is private data, data trafficking, everybody's selling everybody's data and
[51:08.280 --> 51:09.280]  so-
[51:09.280 --> 51:13.480]  They've telegraphed the world economic forum, the next thing is a cyber shutdown that they'll
[51:13.480 --> 51:19.520]  obviously launch, blame on some group of the Russians, imagine with no real communication
[51:19.520 --> 51:21.240]  how much they can control us.
[51:21.240 --> 51:28.840]  Right, and that's the key, if you cut off communications, this is a military maneuver,
[51:28.840 --> 51:34.080]  control command and communication, we're watching this going on and hearing bits and pieces
[51:34.080 --> 51:40.400]  of it over in the Ukraine, in the atmosphere, when you lose the war, the theater war, when
[51:40.400 --> 51:46.520]  you lose your ability to communicate, your brain starts to play games on you, so what's
[51:46.520 --> 51:52.320]  neat about the baby stick and if you're friends, you can receive messages from your friends
[51:52.320 --> 51:58.440]  and the satellite phone store is ready to basically get these into everyone's hands
[51:58.440 --> 52:04.040]  and they love, and by the way, the owner of it loves the ability to be able to get people
[52:04.040 --> 52:06.960]  to stay in communication.
[52:06.960 --> 52:12.440]  This is a neat thing, you talked about too, solar panels, they make the neatest solar
[52:12.440 --> 52:18.400]  powered generators that you can charge your baby stick or your satellite phone with and
[52:18.400 --> 52:24.880]  it's the most self-contained and people, and I want to say this, people don't understand
[52:24.880 --> 52:31.000]  what it's like to go without any type of communication, I mean I go crazy when I don't have the internet
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.640]  to go on and get my communications emails and stuff, so everybody needs to have an alternative
[52:36.640 --> 52:43.800]  form of communication that is not dependent on the power grid or the whims of those who
[52:43.800 --> 52:44.800]  can track you.
[52:44.800 --> 52:51.400]  By the way, everybody that got arrested on the January 6th fiasco, they were all placed
[52:51.400 --> 53:01.040]  in proximity by the tracking of their cell phones, the level of this is so important
[53:01.040 --> 53:05.240]  and they're pre-telegraphing that they're going to have cyber attacks and shut down
[53:05.240 --> 53:09.880]  communications, gut level, what's the time frame, how bad do you think it will be, I
[53:09.880 --> 53:12.640]  know we don't obviously know what their exact plan is, but they've telegraphed, they're
[53:12.640 --> 53:16.040]  about to do it, I mean this is insurance, everybody needs to have it right now, people
[53:16.040 --> 53:19.280]  need to get it, they need to learn how to use it, it's very easy, I use it, I've got
[53:19.280 --> 53:22.880]  it in my house, I've got it in the office, this is critical.
[53:22.880 --> 53:28.840]  Well I think that we're already seeing its value right now because especially when Florida
[53:28.840 --> 53:33.600]  had the problems they had with the hurricane, by the way that was weather warfare against
[53:33.600 --> 53:38.760]  Florida both on the east coast and west coast, west coast first, east coast now and what
[53:38.760 --> 53:46.120]  I think that most people are lacking is this, Alex, communication and again the communication,
[53:46.120 --> 53:51.560]  the ability to communicate but the ability to get you the latest information on what
[53:51.560 --> 53:57.080]  just happened, let's say Anu, when it goes up, goes up there, will know it, those of
[53:57.080 --> 54:03.040]  us who are able to communicate but in essence you're watching the destruction and the desire
[54:03.040 --> 54:08.480]  to have total control over all information, total information, awareness and total information
[54:08.480 --> 54:14.680]  control, the satellite phone and the bivvy stick are the only way that you can stay
[54:14.680 --> 54:20.880]  certain of being able to access different communication people that will have these,
[54:20.880 --> 54:25.280]  a lot of hams are getting, the bivvy stick, a lot of hams are getting satellite phones
[54:25.280 --> 54:31.440]  so it's always important for people to understand once you begin to lose it up here and you
[54:31.440 --> 54:39.040]  start to worry and fret and it's the mindset of knowing what's going on takes away from
[54:39.040 --> 54:43.400]  the uncertainty that initiates panic and that's a powerful statement.
[54:43.400 --> 54:47.240]  Absolutely, people should go to infowarsphone.com that takes you to the big satellite store
[54:47.240 --> 54:50.640]  and we get the sponsorship and the credit so it's a win-win for all of us to stay on
[54:50.640 --> 54:56.160]  air plus you get ready, infowarsphone.com and you get the free satellite phone, the free
[54:56.160 --> 55:02.440]  bivvy stick, whatever you choose but you simply pay for the monthly subscription and again
[55:02.440 --> 55:05.960]  calls to your satellite phone are free, it's the calls you use and you get the monthly
[55:05.960 --> 55:16.600]  deal on, you can also call 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020 and also talk to the great
[55:16.600 --> 55:22.440]  operators that can answer all your questions 941-955-1020 but this is one of the no-brainers,
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.720]  you need a gun, you need storeable food, you need a relationship with God, you need water
[55:26.720 --> 55:30.720]  filtration, you need friends and family, that's all the best things and you need a bivvy stick
[55:30.720 --> 55:33.640]  or a satellite phone right now infowarsphone.com.
[55:33.640 --> 55:38.240]  Steve, just final comments on this, I want to come back and get into Russia and the missile
[55:38.240 --> 55:40.320]  and where you see all that going.
[55:40.320 --> 55:48.000]  Well, first of all, again, as we're talking right now, we are seeing things that are absolutely
[55:48.000 --> 55:56.080]  off the charts when it comes to attacks, cyberattacks, there is no secure data bank, FTX, okay, cryptocurrencies,
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.000]  those of you who have cryptocurrencies, you want to be able to access your wallets and
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.520]  you want to be able to have a form of communication and you've got to be able to know what's going
[56:06.520 --> 56:11.840]  on in one part of the world, so there's only one answer and that is a satellite phone or
[56:11.840 --> 56:12.840]  the bivvy stick.
[56:12.840 --> 56:17.960]  The bivvy stick has greater freedom in that it's just text, you don't get pretty pictures
[56:17.960 --> 56:23.120]  but Alex, you can go up to a thousand characters and quite candidly, it's just like going back
[56:23.120 --> 56:28.400]  to the old bulletin board system when the computers, two-way communication between computers
[56:28.400 --> 56:29.400]  came out.
[56:29.400 --> 56:35.880]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is the satellite answer and the bivvy stick answer to go satellite
[56:35.880 --> 56:40.720]  to satellite person to person and completely avoid the necessity for ground-based cell
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.600]  towers or also power stations when the power goes out.
[56:45.600 --> 56:50.760]  Infowarsphone.com takes you to the satellite store and then it helps the broadcast, but
[56:50.760 --> 56:59.320]  folks, this is something everybody needs, infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020, satellitephonestore.com.
[56:59.320 --> 57:03.720]  We'll also take you there.
[57:03.720 --> 57:07.040]  Now, I want to get into Russia and the missile and the insane staples of the Pentagon.
[57:07.040 --> 57:08.040]  We come back.
[57:08.040 --> 57:09.040]  We've got 30 seconds to break.
[57:09.040 --> 57:10.920]  What else do you want to hit when we come back, Steve Quill?
[57:10.920 --> 57:14.880]  Well, right now I think people have got to watch the extreme weather warfare and I want
[57:14.880 --> 57:18.360]  to tell everybody, I think one of the most important things for you to watch and it's
[57:18.360 --> 57:24.200]  going to affect communication is the amount of reverberation of all the weather modification
[57:24.200 --> 57:30.520]  and control weaponry being used by multiple countries against each other and we're watching
[57:30.520 --> 57:35.080]  it and it's only going to become more problematic and there's a reverberation factor, Alex,
[57:35.080 --> 57:41.200]  where everybody who's using weather war against each other, there's the harp in Gakona, Alaska,
[57:41.200 --> 57:42.200]  the antenna.
[57:42.200 --> 57:43.200]  Hold on, stay there.
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.200]  We're also talking Jefferson and Eric.
[57:44.200 --> 57:45.200]  Stay with us.
[57:45.200 --> 57:46.200]  We're going to hit it all.
[57:46.200 --> 57:47.200]  Weather weapons and more.
[57:47.200 --> 57:48.200]  Straight ahead.
[57:48.200 --> 57:55.200]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here and we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[57:55.200 --> 58:00.960]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[58:00.960 --> 58:05.200]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[58:05.200 --> 58:07.600]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[58:07.600 --> 58:11.440]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of
[58:11.440 --> 58:12.440]  the year.
[58:12.440 --> 58:17.840]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and Biotrusillinium and our Wake Up America award winning coffee
[58:17.840 --> 58:23.480]  and now DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other
[58:23.480 --> 58:29.200]  great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12, they are
[58:29.200 --> 58:33.080]  all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[58:33.080 --> 58:35.920]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[58:35.920 --> 58:40.920]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarstore.com, Chromo Coke
[58:40.920 --> 58:47.040]  1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at infowarstore.com.
[58:47.040 --> 58:50.480]  Thank you so much for your support, God bless.
[58:50.480 --> 58:56.360]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[58:56.360 --> 59:01.720]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[59:01.720 --> 59:05.560]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[59:05.560 --> 59:06.560]  to speak freely.
[59:06.560 --> 59:09.800]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[59:09.800 --> 59:11.240]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[59:11.240 --> 59:15.360]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years and I knew they were planning
[59:15.360 --> 59:19.680]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[59:19.680 --> 59:20.680]  your support.
[59:20.680 --> 59:23.800]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[59:23.800 --> 59:28.280]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[59:28.280 --> 59:31.960]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[59:31.960 --> 59:33.640]  because of your past support.

[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:15.720]  get up right now and go to the window, open it and stick your head out and yell, I'm
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.720]  as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.720]  I want you to get up right now.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.720]  Stick your head out of the window, open it and stick your head out and keep yelling and
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.720]  yell, I'm as mad as hell, I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.720]  Just get up from your chairs right now, go to the window.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]  What are you doing?
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:41.720]  Put this thing into the window, open it and stick your head out and yell and keep yelling home.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.720]  I'm as mad as hell, I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:53.720]  I'm mad as hell, I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.720]  I'm mad, I'm not gonna take it anymore, I'm mad, I'm not gonna take this anymore.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.720]  I'm mad as hell, I'm not gonna take this anymore.

[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.720]  John Ski is a demon incarnate. He tried to start a nuclear war the last two days, but he failed.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.720]  In closing, Matt Baker, I really appreciate your brother. Anything else you'd like to add to the viewers before Mr. Armstrong joins us?
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.720]  Well, actually, man, you just got me. You got me to go all there. I mean, I'm literally crying my eyes out over here.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.720]  I'm barely in the break, dude. I'm barely hanging on. You know, I said it before. I'll say it again.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:14.720]  The amount of anger that you hear in my rants is based on the amount. I love the world. And I love everybody.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.720]  And I want the world to succeed. And that's when I see it being stolen, when I see like a baby's throat being slit.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:29.720]  That's how much I love that baby is how mad I'm getting. And that's why I channel this this energy, which seems like hate or anger.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:36.720]  It's really directly proportional to the amount which I actually love the universe and I love life.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.720]  And I want people to realize how precious it really is. And we just can't let it slip through our fingers, man.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.720]  Absolutely. You're showing your right now.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:56.720]  It's not evil. Yeah, I have a great song. I wrote it a long time ago back in the pandemic. It's a takeoff on my ground control to major Tom.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.720]  It's mind control to major scam. I wish you would play it in your breaks every once in a while. I haven't heard it. I'll watch it.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:11.720]  Where do we find just scam? It's it's on band. I actually sent it to Daria earlier. You can play it. She's got the link.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:19.720]  We'll do is we're live now, but we'll add it in post at the end of the interview. We'll add school. What's the name of the video again?
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:25.720]  Mind control to major scam. I don't know if it comes up as that on there, but we'll find it.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.720]  We'll add it at the end of this interview because we're we're live right now at 103 Central Time.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.720]  But later today, this will be in the end of it.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  And beyond anger and beyond being mad as hell, you know, the greatest victory is living a good life. Like I like to have fun. I like to make art.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:52.720]  I like to make music. You know, I like to create and generate things. This wall behind me I built. I'm sitting in a room that I'm actually working on a job site right now.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:04:00.720]  I'm not in a podcast studio. I'm literally in the building that I built with my bare hands. I'm working construction. I'm fighting for freedom.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:09.720]  I'm doing music. I'm doing art. I'm getting out. I'm speaking out. And it started as a joke, but you know, play on words because of the slave to liberty logo.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:22.720]  But it's it's it's becoming a reality that I am a slave to liberty. You know, it's a I can't stop. I have to I have to maintain liberty.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.720]  I have to maintain freedom. It's like people become a slave to Jesus Christ. It sounds strange.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:34.720]  It's like I'm a slave to Jesus and I've never been happier. It's like you have to have a meaning in life and you have to create art.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.720]  You can't it's not just about, you know, standing up against them. It's also about creating our own things.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:47.720]  I totally agree. We don't just stand against them. We build the new world and that is how we win. I'm at imagine that.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.720]  All right, Matt Baker, amazing interview off the charts. Good God bless you, brother.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:57.720]  Thanks, man. Appreciate it. All right, we'll give you the latest economic analysis straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:30.720]  It was a lack of vitamin D three. You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D three.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.720]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D three.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.720]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:46.720]  So now it's more important than ever because the winner is here to take high quality vitamin D three and we have the best with our vitamin D three

[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.720]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.720]  You think just let me say that even now orders are being shot into telephones and men with guns will be on their way.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:22.720]  It's time to settle down. Damn it. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:28.720]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.720]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.720]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television end longer.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:45.720]  Cruelty and injustice and intolerance and aggression. And where once you had the freedom to object and to think and speak as you saw fit,
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:51.720]  you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submachine.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:58.720]  How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:06.720]  They will be held accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:14.720]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease?
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.720]  There were a myriad of problems you'd conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.720]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:40.720]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:48.720]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:08:05.720]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:12.720]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:24.720]  All right, I've been following his work for 20 years. Martin Armstrong is an economist and inventor, stock market expert.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.720]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio. We'll take an hour.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:33.720]  ArmstrongEconomics.com, ask.dashsocrates.com, ask.dashsocrates.com.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:40.720]  And he has been for several years here on air, predicting exactly what we're going through now.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:46.720]  So I would ask him to cut to the chase with what he's predicting is about to happen, and then walk through the mechanics of all of that,
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:53.720]  because we need to be ready for what is taking place, a major political realignment, a major economic realignment,
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.720]  taking place on the planet, a Klaus Schwab two days ago, G20 saying America's power is over.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.720]  I mean, they are really setting us up for a fall.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.720]  So, Mr. Armstrong, great to have you with us here today. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720]  Oh, thank you for inviting me, Alex.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.720]  So I'm going to try to give you the floor for most of the hour.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:20.720]  You want to give us the big picture first and walk through it, or you want to start with the technicals and give us the answer?
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.720]  How do you want to start here?
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.720]  Well, I think that people have to understand what is actually taking place here,
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:35.720]  because a lot of it is just propaganda that tends to try to distract people.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:45.720]  I mean, for years, you know, I've been basically on the opposite side of Schwab in meetings for a long time.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:56.720]  And the reason people are, these governments are lining up with Schwab is because we have a sovereign debt crisis,
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.720]  and that's what's taking place.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:06.720]  Now, we've been borrowing since World War II with no intention of ever paying anything back.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:15.720]  And the real crisis here that is developing is that what Yellen came out and was saying that,
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.720]  oh, maybe the Treasury should step in and start buying long-term debt, et cetera.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:29.720]  And the reason is that the amount of new debt that came out over COVID, it exploded.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  And now you have this Ukrainian war.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:47.720]  And what she's really concerned about is that we have surpassed the ability of basically the primary dealers to even buy the debt.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:54.720]  And people have to understand that the US government traditionally never sold the debt itself.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.720]  It went to the bankers and the bankers are the ones that sold it.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:05.720]  So to be a primary dealer, you have to get on the list and you have to guarantee to buy X amount.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:16.720]  And the problem is, is that as we saw in the UK, you know, you can't imagine the losses that pension funds have endured.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:25.720]  They've had long-term bonds and the EU was issuing debt negative in 2014.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.720]  So all of a sudden you have interest rates soaring to 4%.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.720]  The value of those bonds has just been collapsing.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:46.720]  So what Yellen was talking about, some people misinterpreted it and saying that, oh, she's competing with the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.720]  And that's not true.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.720]  The Fed creates the money.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.720]  The Treasury does not.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:57.720]  She was talking about buying in long-term debt and swapping it for short term.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:07.720]  In other words, that interest rates have been going up so much that what's happened is, is that the bond market itself has been collapsing.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.720]  That was the real problem in the UK.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.720]  And so she recognizes a two-fold problem here.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.720]  One is that as interest rates are going up, nobody wants the long-term.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.720]  They lose too much money.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:36.720]  And two, you have the primary dealers are choking on the debt because if they have to buy it to keep their franchise but can't sell it, then you're looking at taking down the banks, you know, like Goldman and all the primary dealers.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:43.720]  So they were largely complaining and that's why she came out and was talking about swapping the debt.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:53.720]  And what Schwab has been tapping into is that these governments know that the jig is up.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:13:03.720]  If they can't sell the long-term debt, you know, they can no longer continue to fund their appropriations.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:13.720]  And so what you're looking at is a real debt crisis and they've been using this Ukrainian war.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.720]  They needed distraction.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:25.720]  I mean, COVID was one, but honestly, they ended up, you know, exploding the debt all around the world.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.720]  And now they can't really fund it.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:35.720]  And as interest rates go up, the interest expenditures on the government explode.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:42.720]  So, you know, people have to understand that, you know, Keynesian economics was formed in the Great Depression.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.720]  And when, you know, he came up with an idea, the United States had a balanced budget.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:14:01.720]  So, you know, he basically said that's when the government should enter a deficit because the demand in the private sector is contracting.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:08.720]  And to ease the economy, the government spending should increase the compensate for the contraction in private.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:20.720]  Now, the problem was once you told the government that, gee, they can actually spend, you know, and go into deficit,
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.720]  our politicians have done it year after year after year.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:33.720]  So in all fairness, I mean, they never really, they took one sentence from Keynes and ignored the rest of it.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:40.720]  Keynes also said, you know, you can stimulate the economy by lowering taxes.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.720]  You know, they, you know, they go into convulsions if you ever suggest such a thing.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.720]  I mean, how dare we, we always need more.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:15:01.720]  And so, you know, for 40 some years, I've been dealing with governments and our political system, I think, is collapsing.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:06.720]  Largely because nobody will ever address anything long term.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:13.720]  When I've been in meetings and I said, listen, we can't continue this borrowing indefinitely.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:20.720]  And they would respond, yes, but we're different with the government thinking that somebody will always buy their debt.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:29.720]  And secondly, that they've always said, well, you know, you're talking about something that may hit in 20 years, I won't be here then.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.720]  So that'll be somebody else's problem.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.720]  Stay there. We're going to break Martin Armstrong, famous economist, amazing at predicting things.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.720]  We've seen senators and House members say, though, we have unlimited money.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.720]  Government can never run out of money, but we're now coming to that point.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.720]  How does this thing break? What do you see unfolding?
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:51.720]  And when you talk about the end of America, the end of the dollar and more with Martin Armstrong, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.720]  Stay with us in FullWars.com.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.720]  Tomorrow's the news today.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.720]  ArmstrongInconomics.com.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.720]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.720]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.720]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.720]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.720]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.720]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of the year.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:25.720]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and Biotrusillinium and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.720]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Minimum Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.720]  So many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.720]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.720]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.720]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at InfoWars.com.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:54.720]  ChromoCoat1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at InfoWars.com.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.720]  Thank you so much for your support. God bless.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:06.720]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day counting these mail-in ballots.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:13.720]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just...
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.720]  It's election month, Alex. It's not election day. And that's the problem.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.720]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.720]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone,
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.720]  and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.720]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.720]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.720]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020,
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.720]  and I have no problem saying that.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:48.720]  And it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.720]  and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:58.720]  We're not election deniers. We're election realists.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:04.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.720]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.720]  Not just up to 60% off with PromoCoat1776,
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:19.720]  but on top of it, double patriot points and what makes this the most special sale ever.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.720]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.720]  And it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.720]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:38.720]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $495 and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $800.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:43.720]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs, some of them are Alex Jones Halloween masks,
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:47.720]  some of them are books, films, InfoWars flags, American flags.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.720]  There are hundreds of different items.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.720]  It's all random. InfoWarsStore.com, every order gets a free gift.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:09.720]  Free gifts for every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.720]  InfoWars, despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars,
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.720]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against InfoWars,
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:38.720]  the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier,
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.720]  and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:48.720]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.720]  So continue to do it. Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.720]  Go to places like Save InfoWars. Continue to keep InfoWars alive
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.720]  because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:10.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:22.720]  One of the top economists out there, we spend the whole hour about his bio, I'm not going to do it, is Martin Armstrong.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.720]  He has predicted everything that's happened in the last 25, 30 years.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.720]  And he's here making some really scary predictions.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.720]  We're coming to an end of a cycle, an end of a system.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.720]  I have the head of the European Central Bank saying, we're coming to an end.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:39.720]  It's collapsing. We've got to move to a new digital currency that controls very fast of our lives
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.720]  and creates a new Ponzi scheme with carbon taxes.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.720]  So you're getting into all the technicals last segment.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.720]  I want you to drill back into those, Martin.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.720]  But big picture, how would you describe the world economy and the different players and different groups and where we're at
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.720]  and what are you predicting is about to happen?
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:08.720]  Well, what they've been doing is we have, I would say, another little group that really have the White House in control.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.720]  And they're the climate change people.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:20.720]  And they are the ones that are really, I'm not sure if they're just completely insane or they actually know what they're doing.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:31.720]  But trying to shut down fossil fuels on a global scale without alternatives already in place is really insane.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:38.720]  And this is causing the civil unrest to rise and we're seeing that outside the United States first.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:44.720]  Eventually it will get to the United States, but we're looking at probably a lot more civil unrest next year.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:51.720]  And we have to understand that energy is priced in dollars.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:57.720]  So as the dollar has been going up, their energy costs have exploded.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:05.720]  And this is why you're seeing civil unrest in everywhere from Asia and Sri Lanka to Pakistan.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.720]  It's just spreading and it will continue.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.720]  Thanks also to the COVID lockdowns, et cetera.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:23.720]  I mean, we just had a conference in Orlando last week and like three of our staff that wouldn't even let into the country.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.720]  They're stranded off in Dubai.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.720]  But it's just, this is what's happening.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:43.720]  The economic system that we've been under with these people and the central banks are no longer able to really control anything.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:54.720]  Raising interest rates to stop inflation only makes more inflation because this type of inflation is based upon shortages.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:02.720]  The COVID nonsense, lockdown, everything that we had as far as the supply chain.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.720]  And as a result.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:10.720]  By the way, just to interrupt you look at the head of the European Central Bank just said yesterday, they're losing control.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.720]  They have a central bank head saying we're losing control.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:17.720]  That's got to be a terrifying statement.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.720]  Yes, you know, this is what we saw in London.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:25.720]  Okay, that the long term debt, nobody wants it.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:30.720]  You've wiped out all the pension funds in Europe.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.720]  They're broke.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:36.720]  All right, you took an interest rates to negative in 2014.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.720]  And then you also had a law saying that pension funds had to be secure and had to buy government debt.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.720]  I mean, they need 8% to break even.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.720]  We have, you know, as you know, you know, we're probably the largest in the world.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:54.720]  We have clients with portfolios of over a trillion dollars.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:08.720]  And we get requests, can you create a green portfolio that they just break even because they have to have green investments politically to satisfy the politicians, but they lose money on everything.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.720]  I mean, it's an absolute insane world that we're looking at.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.720]  And that's the SCGs explain SCGs.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:22.720]  Well, basically, there's nothing that they can actually make money on.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.720]  I mean, it's you, you just look at Germany.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:34.720]  I mean, these people are so climate insane that they don't even want nuclear power.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:40.720]  I mean, I think the former head of Greenpeace came out and said to AOC.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.720]  I mean, how are people going to get their food into the into cities horse and buggy?
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.720]  I mean, it's gotten really insane with these people.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:25:03.720]  And they are looking at it saying that they have to destroy as much of our energy capacity to produce in case the other side gets back in.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.720]  They won't be able to rebuild it.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:06.720]  And that's really what they're trying to do.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.720]  Quantify that.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.720]  That's so huge because they have all the energy had saying we're going to transition.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720]  We're destroying the old system.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.720]  You said quotes of the other side can't get in.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.720]  That is so key.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.720]  Elaborate on that.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:26.720]  Yeah, I mean, if you destroy most of your capacity to your ability to produce energy.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.720]  All right.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.720]  That's what they want.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.720]  They don't want us to be able to go ever go back to fossil fuels.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:40.720]  This is really why the West is using Ukraine as cannon fodder against Russia.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.720]  Russia is the biggest energy producer.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:46.720]  50% of their GDP is all energy.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.720]  That's why the US basically took out their pipeline.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.720]  If you go back to Syria, why did Obama wanted to go into Syria?
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.720]  Because Qatar wanted to put a pipeline through Syria to cut off the supply from Russia.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.720]  And he refused.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:08.720]  And so right away, he wanted to go in and say, oh, they abused their people, but he lost.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:14.720]  And we, you know, Americans are getting tired of these endless wars.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:21.720]  I was actually went to Mar-a-Largo to see Trump back in March of 2020.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:28.720]  And I've met many heads of state, but I will say this for all the people that don't like Trump.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.720]  I was actually impressed for the first time.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:39.720]  He was a world leader and he actually said that he wanted to pull the troops out of Afghanistan
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:46.720]  because he was sick and tired of writing letters to their parents and saying their son died for God in country.
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.720]  And he said, point blank, he says, what are we there for?
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:54.720]  They've been fighting over borders for a thousand years.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.720]  What difference are we going to make?
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:01.720]  That's why Bolton came out and all he has to be, he's terrible president, blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:06.720]  But he was the first head of state of any country that I ever encountered
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.720]  who ever was concerned about the people that actually died on the battlefield.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.720]  I mean, they all want, oh, this is a war.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.720]  We have to defeat Russia.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.720]  We should push them out.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.720]  How many lives is that going to cost?
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.720]  How many children will be, you know, lose their fathers and grow up as, you know,
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.720]  without, you know,
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.720]  I totally agree.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.720]  We got to go to break it again in a long second.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:36.720]  It's coming up, but just quantify how would you describe the world economy right now?
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:44.720]  Basically, we're collapsing and I don't think you'll see the dollar remain as a viable currency after 2028.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.720]  Well, you talk about they're destabilizing things.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.720]  Swab brags are destabilizing things on purpose to bring in what?
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.720]  But doesn't he know he's getting the blame now?
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.720]  He thinks he can do this collapse and not get the blame.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.720]  Do you think things are going well for the WEF?
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:04.720]  No, look, I mean, Schwab, I can tell you that he is a control freak.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:11.720]  This is why everything he is proposing is absolute control.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.720]  All right, chips and people and all sorts of crazy ideas.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:22.720]  You know, he, look, he's an academic and every academic I've ever, you know, encountered
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:24.720]  are Marxists.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:32.720]  And his view is Marxism would have succeeded had they also had Europe in the United States.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.720]  So this is what they're pushing here.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.720]  One world government, they think the UN can basically then control everybody.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.720]  I mean, it's going to fail.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.720]  Our computer shows that it's going to absolutely fail.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.720]  Absolutely.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:52.720]  And so Marxist, an ultra-rich Marxist, who believes we were all robots, then he's utopia would work.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.720]  Another bureaucrat control freak.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.720]  Martin Armstrong is our guest.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.720]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.720]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.720]  Infowars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.720]  Your chance to empower your body, your health, your immune system and more and keep us on
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.720]  the air win-win.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.720]  The bad news is a bunch of our best selling products have already sold out because of
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.720]  supply chain breakdowns.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.720]  It'll be months and months until these great products come back in.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.720]  X3's sold out.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.720]  Our great American coffee blend has sold out.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.720]  Biotrystallinium has sold out.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:33.720]  But what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, vitamin mineral fusion, body's ultimate turmeric
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:40.720]  formula, whole food multivitamin, brain force ultra, supermail vitality and so much more.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.720]  You've only got a few weeks to get these products at the lowest price you're ever going to find them.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:46.720]  Don't fight the crowds.

[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.720]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.720]  Why is this taking so long?
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:05.720]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.720]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.720]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.720]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.720]  or Governor DeSantis.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.720]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.720]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.720]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.720]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:31.720]  is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.720]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.720]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.720]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.720]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.720]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.720]  People need to get behind infowars.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:55.720]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.720]  We need more of this communications, not less.

[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:31.720]  Martin Armstrong has joined us for decades.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:34.720]  He is probably the most accurate predictor of the future.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.720]  He's giving you all the details and facts and background.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.720]  But how does this break?
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.720]  I mean, what are the different scenarios?
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:47.720]  What should the public know when we've got the head of the European Central Bank saying we've lost power, everything's collapsing?
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.720]  You've got Schwab laughing saying once it all collapses, they'll be able to reorder it.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.720]  But he's getting the blame.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.720]  He thought that wouldn't happen.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.720]  He thought they would collapse things and then use the crisis to get control themselves.
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:00.720]  I don't see it going that way.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:07.720]  So looking out over the horizon, short term, midterm, long term, what does Martin Armstrong say?
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:14.720]  Well, we see a tremendous rise in civil unrest globally next year.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.720]  And it is, as I said, Schwab is an academic.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:25.720]  He actually has a bust of Lenin on his bookshelf.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.720]  You know, this is what he believes.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:37.720]  And everybody that he has there is largely on that same agenda.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.720]  It's not going to work.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:50.720]  I mean, the primary reason that communism failed is because it attempted to make everybody just drones.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.720]  I was called in by China to help them actually become capitalists.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.720]  And it was a very interesting experience.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:10.720]  I went there and effectively they, I had to explain very fundamental economic principles.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.720]  I mean, they wanted to know like why one T was selling at a different price someplace else.
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.720]  And I said, first you have transportation costs.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.720]  And they were like, oh, wow, really?
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.720]  I said, then somebody will pay more for something that they prefer over another.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.720]  So, you know, this is why communism fell.
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:38.720]  Because basically if a T was priced at one dollar here and a one dollar all within the other side of the country,
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.720]  but it costs ten dollars, they get a tear.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.720]  That's why communism collapsed.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:51.720]  And you have these people like Schwab who just are, I don't know.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:53.720]  I mean, they're brain dead or what?
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:58.720]  Well, exactly, you make statements like you'll own nothing and like it.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.720]  And exactly the point you make, well, why is T twenty dollars here and ten dollars here?
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:06.720]  Because the shipping cost and where it's got to go is more.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.720]  They don't even understand basic things.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.720]  It is the dumbest ideology.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:13.720]  Why does it keep taking over then?
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.720]  Because, you know, I don't know.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:22.720]  I mean, Schwab and I have been on opposite sides for decades.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.720]  I mean, Marcus Vetter came and did the movie on May the Forecaster.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.720]  And I was funded by a German TV station.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.720]  Schwab then called him and said, hey, I want you to do a movie on us.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.720]  So, Marcus film is called The Forum.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.720]  I mean, whatever I've done, he then tries to copy.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:48.720]  It's just, it has been a war for decades between us.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.720]  We started our first World Economic Conference 1985.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.720]  He started his first World Economic Forum 1987.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.720]  It's just, you know, we're on opposite sides.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.720]  I mean, Nigel Farage came to ours in 2019.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.720]  And he said, of course, I'm here.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.720]  He says, you know, basically Armstrong is the alternative to Davos.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.720]  I mean, that's, I mean, this has been a long standing war between the two of us for a long time.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.720]  He's just an academic.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.720]  Does he know how much trouble he's in?
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:24.720]  Because he's probably more hated than Bill Gates right now.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.720]  I mean, he is as hate as much as Hitler right now.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.720]  Yeah, look, I mean, this is the problem.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:40.720]  And he has used his influence and to buy time with these politicians.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.720]  And most look at what we have out there.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.720]  I mean, you've got Trudeau in Canada.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:51.720]  You've got who they call me, you know, Mrs. Head down in New Zealand.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:58.720]  I mean, all these people, he's training and stick them in there in these various different governments.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.720]  It's horrible, absolutely horrible.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:08.720]  But not, you know, it's a debate as to who is the worst world leader.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.720]  I mean, look at Biden.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.720]  He's senile and he just reads whatever the cue cards basically say.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.720]  And it's who's, you know, the real president is who's who's writing the cue cards.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.720]  So what should we look for next?
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.720]  Because you've been predicting major upheaval.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.720]  It's now happening.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.720]  What are you predicting comes next?
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.720]  Well, I think we're going to start seeing a lot of civil unrest.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:39.720]  I mean, I mean, I think this is the longest time it has ever taken to even say who won an election.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:45.720]  I mean, we've always known in that night or maybe the day after, not a week later,
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:51.720]  my own staff could have wrote a program, you know, in less than 30 days that everybody can vote.
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:57.720]  I mean, if we can buy on Amazon safely, why can't we vote on a computer safely?
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.720]  What's with all these paper ballots all of a sudden?
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:08.720]  I mean, I know people in Canada that were getting ballots, mail-in ballots and they're not even American.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.720]  Pennsylvania got caught over, you know, sending out 200,000 mail-in ballots,
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.720]  and they weren't even verified as to if they were American or not.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.720]  Let's switch gears.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.720]  You've been really on the Ukraine crisis with Russia.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.720]  This news false flag with a missile attempt blew up in their face pun intended.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.720]  What do you see happening there?
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.720]  Ukraine, I know very well.
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.720]  We actually have had employees from Donetsk as well as from Kiev.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.720]  And I can tell you that you can't even bring a Russian bottle of vodka to dinner in Kiev.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.720]  It's an insult.
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.720]  It goes back very long, you know, time, the hatred in that area.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.720]  There is no resolution.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.720]  Zelensky is nothing but propaganda, basically.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.720]  I mean, he puts out all this stuff.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:15.720]  Adelaide University has just come out and confirmed that the vast majority of all these pro-Ukrainian comments all over the place are done by Ukrainian bots.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.720]  He is losing the war.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.720]  That's really what this is about.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:31.720]  My info from over there from the Ukrainian side said that 300,000 soldiers have been injured and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers are dead.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:36.720]  And he keeps trying to pretend that, you know, he's winning.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.720]  Russia is going to fail and all this other kind of stuff.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:53.720]  This latest missile thing, I mean, you know, he's refusing to keep saying that it's all nothing but, oh, it's Russia, Russia, Russia.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.720]  And he wants to get, you know, he's trying desperately to create World War III.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.720]  I mean, he's a very dangerous man.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:09.720]  And it's unbelievable, but, you know, we should not be supporting Ukraine whatsoever.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.720]  I agree with Henry Kissinger.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:17.720]  The don't ask is historically Russian territory.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:20.720]  And I'm talking about back to the days of the Tsar.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.720]  And that's why you have Russian people living there.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:33.720]  How do you see this ending, because even there's secret U.S. talks now, Ukraine is trying to false flag. What comes next?
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:46.720]  All I can hope for is that the West wakes up and knocks off this insane, you know, proxy war, which is basically what it is.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:57.720]  But unfortunately, I think we're going into World War III and it's probably going to hit after or in 2025, going into maybe 27.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:08.720]  And because we do the same thing with Taiwan, he sent Pelosi over there just before the Communist convention.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:16.720]  I mean, that's like, yes, you better give, you know, she, you know, absolute control.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.720]  I mean, why would you do that just ahead of that?
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.720]  Of course that that supported him.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:32.720]  You know, it's I don't know who's making these decisions in Washington, but they seem to be intentionally trying to make the world far worse than rather than better.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.720]  Exactly. Stay there. Stay there.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.720]  Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com, I want to try to you cover any other big topics you want.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.720]  I've got a lot of questions, but you're smarter than about economics. What's happening?
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:46.720]  What is your advice to the American people, people of the world about the time and place we're in right now?
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:59.720]  Final segment of our special guest, Mr. Armstrong, then Paul Joseph Watson takes over. We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:14.720]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered, not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:24.720]  But on top of it, double Patriot points and what makes this the most special sale ever, every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:31.720]  And it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer. So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:39.720]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $495 and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $800.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:45.720]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs, some of them are Alex Jones Halloween masks, some of them are books, films,
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:54.720]  InfoWars flags, American flags. There are hundreds of different items. It's all random. InfoWarsStore.com, every order gets a free gift.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:58.720]  Free gifts for every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:05.720]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWars and banned.video.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.720]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you. I'm going to do that right now.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:17.720]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry. You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:23.720]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.720]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.720]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:38.720]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:46.720]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:53.720]  We need to support free speech systems right now. So go check out the store, go support their store, go support InfoWars.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.720]  Leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:07.720]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:14.720]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:18.720]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1. And it worked pretty good.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:20.720]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:31.720]  You had the deep burden source and I got really excited about that so I took it. And man, in two weeks I went from brain fog to literally like my brain was enlightened.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.720]  I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:40.720]  And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:44.720]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is Knockout.
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:48.720]  It literally like if you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:53.720]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.720]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.720]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:09.720]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:19.720]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:38.720]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID, post COVID,
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:44.720]  vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:52.720]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products and online store media and health advice.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:47:09.720]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:27.720]  The Top Economist. I mean, I've been following this stuff for 30 years at him on for 20.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.720]  Only a couple of times a year to get him on more often. He's hard to get on.
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.720]  Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:39.720]  During the break, I said, Mr. Armstrong, condense all your predictions and warnings into this segment.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.720]  And can we stop World War 3? And he said, probably not. They need it.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:46.720]  The globalist need it as a smoke screen with a great reset.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:51.720]  So, sir, give us that knowledge and talk about your new book and where this is all going.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:59.720]  Well, their theory is to create a new Brentwoods.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.720]  And to get out of all the debt, they will default on it.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.720]  And that's why Schwab is saying, you'll own nothing and be happy.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.720]  He's trying to make it sound that you're the one in trouble, not them.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:20.720]  And that they will relieve you of all your debts and they're being generous in helping you.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.720]  Well, in fact, it's their debts that they're going to default on, but that wipes out all the pension funds.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.720]  So, security is 100% US government debt.
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:41.720]  And so, they think that using the war, that that will be the justification to create another Brentwoods after World War 2.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:45.720]  And then they get to reestablish everything.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:53.720]  And for 40 years in governments that I've been talking to, their view is that they are not the problem we are.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:49:00.720]  And that if you found a hundred dollar bill on the parking lot, you cheated them out of their 50 dollars, you know, their share.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:07.720]  It's, you know, they never consider anything whatsoever about, you know, themselves.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:10.720]  As I've said, there's no mirrors in Washington.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:15.720]  So, it's always about us and we do not comply with what they want to do.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:21.720]  And that's why they want the digital currencies, because if I gave you 100 dollars, that's fine.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.720]  They don't know where I got it from.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:29.720]  But if it's a digital currency, they know where I even got it from and can follow it all the way down the line.
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:38.720]  So, I mean, this is all getting to be, you know, very draconian, but I mean, this is their objective.
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.720]  And that's what Schwab is really saying with the great reset.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:50.720]  And he has sold this idea to governments as a whole as their way to escape from the debt crisis.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:53.720]  And it's just going to be a complete mess.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:57.720]  And then he thinks he can recreate things.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.720]  And you can't.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:06.720]  I mean, the reason we became the biggest in the world was because we did foreign exchange.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.720]  All right, we were the first ever to do anything like that.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:19.720]  And when we were going to open an office in 1985, I had, you know, launched with one of the top bankers in Switzerland.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:25.720]  And I had a list of foreign names, you know, European advisors, whatever.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.720]  And he said, name one European analyst.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.720]  And I was embarrassed because I couldn't.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:42.720]  And he said there are none because after World War II, every politician used the rise in the currency from zero to prove that he did a good job.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:47.720]  So no bank analyst would ever come out and say, oh, the Deutsche Marks going to go down.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.720]  That was, you know, political.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.720]  So we became the biggest.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.720]  He says, because you don't care if the dollar goes up or down.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:55.720]  I said, it's just a trade to me.
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.720]  That's it.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.720]  So that's how we became so big.
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:05.720]  It was just simply our, you know, foreign exchange was our, you know, our real forte.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:11.720]  And you have to understand that that's why all the governments called us in for this, that the other thing.
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:18.720]  I mean, it was, you know, I got called in for the Korean, the G5 back in 85, 87 crash.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:28.720]  You know, they, I was friends with Margaret Thatcher's kept the pound out of the Euro when they tried to get it in that blew up and Soros became famous.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:36.720]  I mean, all these things I've been in the middle of, and it's always been foreign exchange has been the primary issue.
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:39.720]  And when they were creating the Euro, they came to us.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:43.720]  I told them if they don't consolidate the debts, it's going to collapse.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:46.720]  And they said, look, we just have to get the Euro in first.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.720]  And now they admit.
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.720]  So what's the first to collapse?
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:51.720]  Is it the Euro?
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:52.720]  Is it China?
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:53.720]  Because the rubles weigh up.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.720]  I mean, what's the most?
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:56.720]  Is it the dollar?
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:57.720]  I mean, how do you see this?
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.720]  I know it's hard to make a prediction, but.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:03.720]  The dollar is to last the fall because it's going to be like World War one and two.
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:05.720]  All the money comes here.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.720]  All right.
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.720]  Because you're, you know, you got tanks going down the streets, blowing up things.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.720]  That's what the strength of the dollar has been.
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:19.720]  It's been capital inflows, a US share market as well.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:24.720]  I mean, pay attention to the Dow versus, for example, the Nasdaq.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:26.720]  Nasdaq is retail domestic.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:30.720]  The Dow is, is the big money from international.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:35.720]  It's like when the Japanese came over buying real estate, you know, what do they, they
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.720]  bought all the trophies, you know, Rockefeller Center, et cetera.
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.720]  They don't buy mom and pop houses down the street from you.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:47.720]  So it's, you know, the, the Dow represents big international capital.
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:54.720]  And first you have the concentration of capital into the United States from Europe and Asia.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:59.720]  And then eventually, you know, as all these countries start defaulting on their debt, they're
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:02.720]  going to turn and say, well, the US has got to be next.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:05.720]  So the US will be the last to fall.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:10.720]  And, and, you know, that's why they got Biden in there because he'll sign basically anything
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:11.720]  that, that.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:15.720]  And as you said, they're getting ready to, the Euro to be the first big one to drop,
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:22.720]  but they want a big bailout with their, with their Marshall fund 2.0.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.720]  Pretty much.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:24.720]  Yes.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:31.720]  I mean, you have Zelensky over there who's telling, he was, he got Biden mad.
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:34.720]  He's basically saying he wants the US to cover all their pensions.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.720]  We don't even cover ours.
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:42.720]  I mean, it's, you know, it, it, the whole thing is falling apart.
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:48.720]  How does, how does FTX going belly up tie to this?
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:54.720]  You know, they were basically funding, they were the second largest donator to, to the
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:55.720]  Democrats.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:59.720]  He was basically funding the fake studies for COVID.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:06.720]  And it, you know, it's, he just bought his way into, into the Democrats and thinking that
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:08.720]  he could, you know, buy protection.
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:15.720]  But, you know, they lost so much with the collapse in digital currencies that, you know,
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.720]  it's, you know, there goes.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.720]  I mean, and, and then you're getting a contagion now in, in other areas.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:28.720]  So the good old fashioned things is basically, you know, cash, the metals, things of that
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.720]  nature and you keep them in your drawer for right now.
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:38.720]  But US dollars, I should point out that 70% of the dollars circulate outside the country
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:43.720]  because the US has been the only country that doesn't cancel, cancel its currency.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:48.720]  Whereas Britain cancels it, you have a 10 pound note from, from 20 years ago, they're
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:49.720]  worthless.
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:53.720]  The same thing in, in Europe, I mean, they cancel currencies routinely.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:59.720]  Canada passed the law and he canceled all the high currencies in January.
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:06.720]  So this is, you know, the US is, is the dollar has been the reserve currency.
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.720]  And it's also been used primarily outside the country.
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:14.720]  The dollars are circulating tremendously in Russia.
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.720]  So in closing, and I really appreciate your time, other big predictions, politically
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:24.720]  in America, the war in Russia, just, just quick, quick synopsis if you can.
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:28.720]  Well, you know, this is an election that nobody's going to accept.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:33.720]  And it's our computer warned that it was probably the most, you know, corrupt, correct
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:37.720]  election I think in, in American history.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:43.720]  But it really calls in the question, what's going to happen in 2024?
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:49.720]  And I, I'm not necessarily sure we're even going to have a viable election at that point.
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:55.720]  I mean, it's like Stalin said, you know, anybody can vote whoever they want, but it's
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:58.720]  those account are the ones that decide the election.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:01.720]  And, you know, he wasn't so far off.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:08.720]  You know, you have to understand that we're probably still in a very steep recession.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.720]  Interest rates are still going to rise into next year.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  So you're looking at mortgage rates going up.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.720]  I wouldn't pay off mortgages if you have them at low rates.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.720]  I would, you know, basically keep it because that's the risk you've sold to somebody else.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:30.720]  And I would definitely make sure you have a supply of some food because the supply
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:36.720]  chain has been really seriously disrupted and energy.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:41.720]  I mean, you should have at least some sort of a backup if possible because these people
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:47.720]  are trying to shut down the entire power grids really with, with what they're doing
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.720]  and they don't even understand.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:55.720]  I mean, you had Biden as soon as he came in, the first thing he did was cut off the pipeline from Canada.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:00.720]  Then he outlaws all drilling, yet then he goes over to Saudi Arabia before the election
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:03.720]  and please don't cut off anything before the election.
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:06.720]  We don't care what you do afterwards.
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.720]  But, you know, these people are completely insane.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:16.720]  If everybody had electric cars, the power grid, the most conservative estimate I've ever seen,
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:21.720]  it has to be 400 times larger than what it is now.
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.720]  Incredibly, incredibly said, I know you've got to go, but if you can do five more minutes,
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.720]  a two minute break, I just want you to continue what you're doing now because you just lay it out
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.720]  because they are insane.
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:33.720]  They're collapsing things.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.720]  They admit they want to post industrial world, but they're going to get to blame.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:40.720]  How do we stop them from completely collapsing things and they get new leadership and stop this?
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.720]  Because that's the big question.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.720]  Five more minutes with us, Mr. Armstrong.

[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:06.720]  Alright, final segment with Owen Schreuer.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:14.720]  With a great job laying out these races and what's unfolding. Michael Adele's huge news coming up here in just a moment.
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:17.720]  Other key points you'd like to add, Owen?
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:21.720]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to become talking about on the war room.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:23.720]  Because here's what I'm seeing.
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:28.720]  There's the DeSantis-Trump debate that's obviously raging and people are kind of picking sides right now.
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:33.720]  That's alright. I think mostly people are getting ahead of themselves and it's a politically charged season.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:39.720]  I think the real debate and I think the real movement I'm seeing here that needs to be focused on
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:46.720]  is the removal of power from the Mik Republicans, McConnell, McCarthy and McDaniel.
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.720]  They're ouster. It's time for them to go.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:51.720]  You already have Republicans that just won re-elections calling for it.
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:56.720]  It's pretty much wide swept across the media, conservative media.
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:59.720]  They don't want this Republican leadership anymore. They're not happy with the results.
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:01.720]  They believe Republicans should have done much better.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:09.720]  That's a consensus right now in the Republican voter base, in the populist movement that is trying to take over
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:14.720]  the Republican Party from the establishment and the Uniparty that the McOuster needs to happen.
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:18.720]  McDaniel, McCarthy and McConnell have got to go.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.720]  We're going to see how that develops, but I think there's going to be enough of an initiative and a charge
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:30.720]  with this 118th Congress that you might actually see a position change in those positions.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.720]  And good, the Republican Party has such great talent and such great potential coming up through it,
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:40.720]  it'd be ridiculous to keep these people around who don't energize the party or reach out to the young
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:42.720]  or the cities at all.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.720]  So that's going to be a great thing that's going to come from this no matter how the numbers
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:49.720]  shake out in Congress at the end of the day.
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:56.720]  Now here's another big, maybe not big, kind of a side issue that I'm seeing and that's the Libertarian vote.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.720]  In a lot of these races, Georgia might be your best example, but I think Pennsylvania,
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:07.720]  it was the same case, the Libertarian vote was more than enough to, if you would give all the votes,
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:10.720]  it would always put the Republican ahead, but I don't even think they would need all the Libertarian vote.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:15.720]  I think they would really just need 90% of the Libertarian vote and I believe it would have put Oz ahead
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.720]  and it definitely would have given Walker the majority and he would have won the Senate.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.720]  And so I understand, I'm not going to get into the Libertarian bashing game here.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:27.720]  I understand why Libertarians exist.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:32.720]  I understand why they have a disposition towards the Republican and the Democrat party.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.720]  And I understand that why you vote third party and why you keep a third party out there.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:43.720]  But I think that Libertarians are not being fully honest with themselves after the results of this election
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:48.720]  because if you don't see how you have a real power here,
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:54.720]  because they say, oh, well, I don't want to vote for the two corrupt parties or I don't want to vote for this person or that person.
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:56.720]  Well, how about I put it to you this way?
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:59.720]  Let me give the Libertarians a pitch here because I'm not a Republican.
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:00.720]  I'm an independent.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:06.720]  But let me give the Libertarians a push here of why, a pitch of why they should be moving their votes to Republican.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.720]  Do you want to vote for the Democrat that's going to take your gun or do you want to vote for the Republican that's not?
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:13.720]  I mean, do I really have to say anything else?
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.720]  And here's the classy way to do it and this is what happened in Arizona, Alex.
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:22.720]  And I don't know if it's going to be enough to put masters ahead, but they still have their fingers crossed.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:28.720]  The Libertarian candidate in Arizona bowed out about a week or two before the election and endorsed Blake Masters.
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:31.720]  That's what the Libertarians need to do at this point.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:36.720]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:39.720]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Georgia.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:42.720]  I understand you don't like the Republican Party.
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:43.720]  I get it.
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:44.720]  I get it.
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:51.720]  But if you don't see the power in what you can do now just by endorsing the candidate that's not going to take your guns,
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:54.720]  hopefully not raise your taxes, but I get it Republicans do that too.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:57.720]  But just on the issue of guns, I mean, isn't it easy enough?
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:59.720]  I mean, isn't that clear enough?
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:01.720]  Do you want to be disarmed or not?
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:06.720]  So that's another issue that I kind of see as a side order of Alex that people are going to be talking about.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:09.720]  But these are the big issues that I see that we're going to be covering on the war room.
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:13.720]  I'm looking forward to hearing from Mike Lindell with these ridiculous numbers.
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:15.720]  It's the exact same playbook they ran in 2020.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:16.720]  Well, let's do this.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:21.720]  I know you've got to get ready for your own show at three today, but Mike Lindell is giving us the whole hour.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.720]  I know you'll have some great questions and great analysis.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:25.720]  So you get your big board ready in there.
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:32.720]  And then at the bottom of the hour, we'll have you pop in with some comments, analysis and any questions for Mike Lindell.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.720]  And then you'll be back at 3 p.m. Central with the war room and info wars.com.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:37.720]  That sounds good.

[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:06.720]  He said, did you see our coverage?
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:08.720]  I said, well, of course I was watching and everybody is.
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:09.720]  You've done the best job.
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:10.720]  You've nailed it.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:13.720]  And he said, did you see my crime spikes and live time crime?
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:16.720]  I said, of course I've got a compilation of some of the best of it.
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:19.720]  We'll air a few minutes of it and go to the man, Mike Lindell.
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:20.720]  Here it is.
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:23.720]  Note we have here, we have the votes going up.
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:24.720]  I'm putting my cursor over it.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.720]  Votes going up, staying the same, staying the same.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:32.720]  And then we have, we go from 326,000 votes down to 288,000 votes.
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:34.720]  So where'd they go?
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:35.720]  They're gone.
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:37.720]  You can't go and reverse everybody.
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:38.720]  These are the order.
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:40.720]  These votes are coming in through the Edison report,
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:42.720]  which is one of the biggest monopolies in this country.
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:47.720]  Every single vote goes through New Jersey and then it comes out to us.
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:52.720]  I switched over while you were talking to the governor race in Pennsylvania
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:54.720]  and you'll see it happen there too.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:56.720]  So we have a 63,000.
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:00.720]  We have a 90,000 crime spike, another 90,000 crime spike,
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:02.720]  a 63,000 crime spike.
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:05.720]  And then they go, uh-oh, the whole world's going to know
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:08.720]  that Maseriano's getting, you know, we're cheating by too much.
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:09.720]  So what do they do?
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:11.720]  Everybody write their points of the cursor.
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:16.720]  They got, they took away 90,000 votes from the Democrat.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:17.720]  Yeah.
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.720]  If you look, it took the vote total back to where it had been way back here.
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:27.720]  These are real time crime spikes, machine manipulation.
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:28.720]  Look at that.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.720]  You see that Democrat go ding up 150,000 votes
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:34.720]  because Herschel was taking the lead.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:37.720]  So they just dumped a bunch of votes by computer in there.
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.720]  Everybody can understand that.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:42.720]  That's something everybody can enjoy, real time crime.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:43.720]  Yeah.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:44.720]  That's right there.
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:48.720]  That's 100,000 votes that comes out of nowhere.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:51.720]  That's just not real.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:54.720]  If you took that real spike out, that crime spike,
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:57.720]  Herschel would be up by 150,000 votes.
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:58.720]  Yeah.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:01.720]  It looks like about 100,000 votes spike there.
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:03.720]  If I'm reading that correctly out of nowhere.
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:04.720]  Yes.
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:08.720]  That one for Gretchen Widmer.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:16.720]  That has all the indications of a vote dump of likely counterfeit ballots.
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:19.720]  Both of these look really, really strange.
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:25.720]  But in particular, that one, because there was almost hardly any increase in the.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:26.720]  Yeah.
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:27.720]  22, 23.
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.720]  So that's 10, 23 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:32.720]  If I'm reading that correctly.
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:33.720]  Correct.
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.720]  And so that is almost beyond belief.
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:38.720]  Wow.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:40.720]  Look at this, everybody.
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:44.720]  That's a million votes up and a million votes down.
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:47.720]  You know, a million votes here and a million votes there.
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:49.720]  And eventually it adds up to real, you know, real election.
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.720]  Can you explain this one?
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:53.720]  Can you explain this one?
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:55.720]  Well, I can't really explain it.
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:56.720]  I mean, I can't.
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:57.720]  There is no explanation.
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:58.720]  There is no explanation.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.720]  But you see that you had an update at Eastern time.
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:04.720]  What is that?
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:12.720]  1042 of about a million votes for Duckworth and pretty much none for the other person.
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.720]  And then you see it wasn't like it was something that came right back.
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:18.720]  It's like we kept on having a little more updates, a little more updates.
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:23.720]  And then suddenly there goes the million votes back down again.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:26.720]  That million person spike there.
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:29.720]  We're going to have more of these highlights in the hour, but I got to get to the man himself,
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:30.720]  Mike Lindell.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:31.720]  Wow.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:33.720]  Incredible time to be alive.
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:34.720]  We only got four minutes to break.
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:35.720]  We'll come back.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:36.720]  You'll have the floor.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:39.720]  But just a snapshot to hear the guy, you know, literally at the heart of the fight against
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:40.720]  these people.
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:42.720]  What is really going on, Mike Lindell?
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.720]  Well, what they're doing is the same thing that they did in the 2020 election and in
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:49.720]  the primaries, by the way, what they do is they pull.
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:54.720]  That's why we told everybody to vote same day and don't vote up early or with the mail
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:55.720]  and all this stuff.
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:56.720]  They're just pulling names.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:01.720]  The computer just pulls names and they, and you get these injections of votes.
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:05.720]  So they, let's say, let's use the Oz, the Oz rays.
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:11.720]  You know, they, with Betterman, they did 590,000 vote injections.
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:13.720]  So as soon as it gets close, boom, boom.
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:18.720]  Now, once it's the day of votes, like we're seeing down in Arizona right now.
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:26.720]  All these day of votes come in and those votes aren't as corrupted or might not be at all.
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:31.720]  But this is what's happening and we have to get rid of the machines.
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:36.720]  And this time, though, the miracle, everybody, I want to tell everyone, the miracle is that
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.720]  when I woke up on election day, I'm going, I'm hearing from 32 states.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  Remember, I have people in 50 states, Alex, and all 50 states, we have a massive amount
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:52.720]  of people on the ground and it was reported in 32 of the states, machine malfunctioning,
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:57.720]  just like Arizona, which made national news and international news that they couldn't,
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:59.720]  weren't even accepting ballots.
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:00.720]  People were getting there.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:02.720]  They're going, oh, you've already voted.
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:05.720]  They pull out your little mail in ballots and no, I haven't.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:07.720]  They called their sheriff's departments.
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:13.720]  So right away, the awareness that was made around the world about these machines was,
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:16.720]  that was like a divine intervention.
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:17.720]  That was a gift from God.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:21.720]  And then now we're seeing what goes on inside the machines.
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.720]  And we overrun the algorithms, I believe, so far in at least nine races, but obviously
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.720]  we have all the evidence now of all the ones they stole.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:33.720]  They decimated Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:35.720]  They just took it all.
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:38.720]  They weren't even shy about it this time around.
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:43.720]  What's incredible is even Tucker Carlson that hasn't really looked at the fraud.
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:46.720]  Now he agrees with you and says they clearly stole it.
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:47.720]  So congratulations.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:51.720]  Nobody deserves more credit than you and your supporters and our supporters because Mike,
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.720]  you've been through hell and you're a winner.
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:56.720]  You don't complain about it, but buddy, you've been right about the FBI.
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:57.720]  You've been attacked.
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:58.720]  You've been de-platformed.
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:01.720]  You have been savage, but you seem stronger for it.
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:02.720]  Yeah.
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:04.720]  Well, you know, it's my faith in God.
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:07.720]  And I'll tell you, Alex, we don't want to be Venezuela.
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.720]  And we got a perfect example right before this election of what they did to Brazil.
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:16.720]  5.1 million votes were stole from that great president, Barca Naro.
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:21.720]  And you've seen all the millions of people out there going, this can't be, this can't be.
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:22.720]  But you know what?
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:25.720]  The mainstream media didn't even cover that.
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:26.720]  So you are right.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:33.720]  I'm so happy right now that Tucker and other news outlets actually started covering this.
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:38.720]  If they start covering the real-time crime and start covering these things,
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:43.720]  we're going to get there a lot faster to this beautiful place we're going
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:46.720]  than we could ever think that we'd get there.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:47.720]  All right, Mike Lindell.
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:49.720]  Mike Lindell, truly the man in the arena.
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:52.720]  I'm going to come back and give you the floor to get into everything
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:57.720]  because you are, again, absolutely on target.
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:03.720]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day,
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.720]  counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:12.720]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just,
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:14.720]  it's election month, Alex.
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:15.720]  It's not election day.
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:17.720]  And that's the problem.
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:20.720]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:26.720]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone.
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:29.720]  And sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:31.720]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:35.720]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:39.720]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020,
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:41.720]  and I have no problem saying that.
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:45.720]  And it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:53.720]  that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:56.720]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:30.720]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:35.720]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:37.720]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:41.720]  you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:44.720]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:48.720]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:51.720]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:54.720]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at m4store.com,

[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:00.720]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:04.720]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:06.720]  There's a solution, the wellness company.
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:09.720]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.

[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:22.720]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content,
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:28.720]  virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:35.720]  treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes,
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:39.720]  and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:48.720]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:20:09.720]  Come see the wellness company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the wellness company.
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:19.720]  I think what Mike Lindell said earlier in the last segment of our show is so central.
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:24.720]  If we hadn't had all the poll watchers, if we hadn't had the massive resistance exposing the fraud,
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:28.720]  it would have been far worse and we wouldn't even have a shot at the house or the Senate.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:34.720]  But we're on the march, the vote stealers and their crime spikes are on the run.
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:39.720]  We're trying for the rest of the hour to give you the floor to just go through what happened,
[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:44.720]  what's happening currently, what you see coming next, and how we're going to peacefully expose this.
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:46.720]  Well, we have breaking news just on break here.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:49.720]  I got a text from our lawyers.
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:56.720]  I don't know if everybody knew out there, but there was a company, a CEO called Koenig out of Michigan,
[02:20:56.720 --> 02:21:05.720]  that got charged with probably the biggest lord of data breach in United States history, which was during our elections.
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:10.720]  And this is out of China, everybody, which I've been saying all along that the CCP,
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:14.720]  combined with the unit party, the globalists in the deep state, this is the attack.
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:16.720]  This is who's attacking our country.
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:19.720]  The Democrat Party just loves to join on in.
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:25.720]  Now, let me tell you, they just dropped the charges against Koenig.
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:27.720]  They're against this CEO.
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:29.720]  It's disgusting.
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:32.720]  Now, you think that China isn't involved in our government?
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:36.720]  It's absolutely disgusting with what they just happened.
[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:43.720]  And it says that their office, they took out a press release saying they didn't rely on true-to-votes data,
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:46.720]  but they did their own investigation.
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:50.720]  I remember they put the true-to-vote Catherine and Greg in jail.
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:54.720]  They put them in jail for almost a week.
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:56.720]  And that's important to add. You're getting swat team.
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:00.720]  People are being thrown in jail as you're exposing this and being vindicated.
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:03.720]  That's what people need to be praying for you and everybody that's supporting what you're doing,
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:06.720]  including info wars, because, folks, you want us to fight, we're doing it.
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:08.720]  Continue.
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:11.720]  You guys are awesome, everybody, with your support.
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:13.720]  So this is what we're up against.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:15.720]  But I'll tell you some other lawsuits.
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:20.720]  There's over 45 lawsuits going on in this country right now that we're fighting for in every state,
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:22.720]  and we're adding to it today.
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:24.720]  We have one in Arizona.
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:26.720]  I'll give you Arizona here.
[02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:28.720]  We appealed.
[02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:30.720]  We just appealed to deny.
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:33.720]  Remember, they denied Cochise County in Arizona.
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:36.720]  They told him they couldn't hand count the election.
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:38.720]  What? Why?
[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:42.720]  Why would you come in there and say, and get a ruling from a corrupt judge or something?
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:43.720]  I don't know.
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:45.720]  He ruled that you can't do a hand count.
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:48.720]  Well, we appealed that to the Arizona Supreme Court.
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.720]  We'll see what comes of that.
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:53.720]  Over in Wisconsin, let's move over to Wisconsin.
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:55.720]  There, you won't believe this one.
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:01.720]  This is the complaint that's filed against the WEC.
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:04.720]  This is the Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission.
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:07.720]  The Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission.
[02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:14.720]  And there's been two-way communication between tabulators
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:17.720]  that goes out to an unofficial address.
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:19.720]  It's called wisnet.net.
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:26.720]  It goes to this foundation called Wisnet, W-I-S-N, or W-I-S-C-net.net.
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:30.720]  And all of our stuff, all the Wisconsin elections and our stuff across the country,
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:31.720]  is going to these guys.
[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:33.720]  Then it goes out from there all over the place.
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:37.720]  So we've put a complaint in there, a lawsuit in there,
[02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:41.720]  get to the bottom of it, and I just want everybody to know there's hope everywhere.
[02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:43.720]  And now that we're going to get the House,
[02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:45.720]  I believe we'll get the House and the Senate,
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:48.720]  I believe right now you've got the stuff going on,
[02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:50.720]  I can tell you about in a minute an update on that.
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:53.720]  But to slow the destruction of our country,
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:58.720]  but in the meantime, the big smoke and gun is getting rid of these electronic computers
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:23:59.720]  and voting machines.
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:02.720]  We have to get down to elections, not selections.
[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:07.720]  And we've got, there's just so much hope out there,
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:13.720]  but I know if you're in Michigan or you woke up your Michigan, Colorado, Pennsylvania,
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:18.720]  so many of them have lost hope now, Alex, because they were just decimated
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.720]  by the stalled in election, by these elections that were stalled.
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.720]  But let me tell you, I'll give an example.
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:31.720]  Our cyber guys were watching, do you know in Pennsylvania and with Georgia,
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:37.720]  the same attacks, some of the same IP addresses that did this in 2020
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:41.720]  and in a couple of the primaries came from the same place.
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:44.720]  So we're getting deeper and deeper into that.
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:49.720]  And there's just so much hope in this country right now.
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:50.720]  I'm happy.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:52.720]  I want to say this to everybody too.
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:56.720]  Everyone goes, well, Mike, we didn't get the red wave we wanted.
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:59.720]  You guys, that's a miracle we didn't get that.
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:01.720]  We are so blessed that we didn't get that.
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:02.720]  And here's why.
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:06.720]  If we'd have got this big red wave, if I'd have been there markers,
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:09.720]  I'd have said, don't do anything stupid with the machines.
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:11.720]  Let's let this go.
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:14.720]  And now we can take the country later.
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:15.720]  They're on to us.
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:18.720]  If it had been a big red wave, do you know what they would have said
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.720]  to people like me?
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:22.720]  They would have said, Mike, it's okay to have all these mail-in ballots
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:26.720]  from the China virus and all this garbage for two months of early voting
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:28.720]  like my home state of Minnesota.
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:29.720]  Mike, it's all okay.
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:31.720]  The machines, look at the Republicans won.
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:34.720]  This isn't about that, everybody.
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:39.720]  The Uniparty was there, the CCP, this is what was taking our country.
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:43.720]  50 over 50 countries have been taken by the machines.
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:45.720]  There's my own governor's race.
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:46.720]  Look at this.
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:50.720]  This is, he lives in my hometown, Scott Jensen.
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:54.720]  He, right out of the gate, they just dumped it on waltz.
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  They gave him a quarter million votes, extra votes.
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:57.720]  Here you go, waltz.
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:25:59.720]  And look at that all the way up.
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:01.720]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:03.720]  They stole it, you know.
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:05.720]  And this went on across our country.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:09.720]  This is machine manipulation, everybody, in computers.
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.720]  We cannot have computers for the apex in history.
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:18.720]  We get one chance, one chance to, for our freedoms to be back
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.720]  and to save our country.
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:24.720]  I want to tell, and look at this, look at here in Michigan.
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:28.720]  This is, this is when I went to bed on election night, two in the morning.
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:33.720]  This happened at one, or about 12.58, might have been a little after one o'clock in the morning,
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:35.720]  the traditional Michigan dump.
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:38.720]  Look what they gave to Nessel.
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:43.720]  They gave Nessel, I think it was 200,000 or more than that, votes.
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:47.720]  And just took Matt to Pernod's dream, and everyone's dream, boom, gone.
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:50.720]  That's the attorney general of Michigan, everybody.
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:52.720]  They stole it in real time.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:56.720]  Mike, the graph says it gave them 300,000 plus votes.
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:00.720]  300,000 plus votes instantly.
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:02.720]  Instantly, you guys, this came down.
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:06.720]  And let me tell you, let's just, I'm going to tell you how similar it was
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:10.720]  to the 2020 election in Michigan when they stopped everything.
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:13.720]  And by the way, isn't it weird that they stopped everything in 2020,
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:15.720]  all the states at the same time?
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:17.720]  You think there's not some communication there?
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:19.720]  Shutter down, we got a problem.
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:21.720]  Donald Trump's going to win all these states anyway,
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:24.720]  because he's overrunning the algorithms.
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:29.720]  Well, let me tell you, in Michigan, when 106,000 votes came down for Biden
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:34.720]  at 2 in the morning in Michigan, and 3,000 for Donald Trump,
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:40.720]  and everyone said to us, the big lie was, well, those darn inner city,
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:47.720]  those darn votes from the Democrats all voted for those mail-in votes,
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:50.720]  those darn mail-in votes, well, let me tell you,
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:56.720]  if Fox News or any other news outlet that we had at that time had grown to trust,
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:59.720]  if they had got on there and said, hey, everybody,
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:03.720]  the mail-in votes in Michigan were counted on the morning of the 3rd,
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:06.720]  not in the middle of the night on the 4th.
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:09.720]  Everyone has said, well, then where did they come from?
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:12.720]  All day where they came from, a big white band had pulled in
[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:16.720]  and three fobs and a download of 106,000 votes for Biden.
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:18.720]  So this went on again.
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:21.720]  Everyone needs to understand.
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:24.720]  The same input is going to give you the same output.
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:27.720]  We were getting boiled-like frogs for two decades.
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:30.720]  The Democrats even warned against these machines,
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:34.720]  but now that they're on the right side of a fixed game, they don't care.
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:36.720]  There it is in Michigan.
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:39.720]  It brings back memories, all the memories.
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:40.720]  There they come.
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:44.720]  Here, let's drop 106,000 votes for Biden in the middle of the night.
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:47.720]  Which brings up another point.
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:49.720]  Mike and Bill, stay there.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:51.720]  You'll have the floor. You're on fire.
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:53.720]  When we come back on the other side of this break,
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:57.720]  we'll continue to run the entire field here.
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:02.720]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:06.720]  believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:09.720]  because of something called vapors.
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:13.720]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:17.720]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.720]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:27.720]  You see, the sun, via your skin, helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:31.720]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3,
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:33.720]  and then it's very easy for viruses
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:36.720]  and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:39.720]  So now it's more important than ever, because the winter's here,
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:41.720]  to take high-quality vitamin D3,
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:44.720]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium

[02:29:57.720 --> 02:30:00.720]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process,
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:04.720]  the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible,
[02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:08.720]  the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible,
[02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:12.720]  the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:14.720]  and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:18.720]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:20.720]  made any resistance to it possible
[02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:23.720]  was people continuing to support info wars,
[02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:27.720]  despite the massive lawfare being waged against info wars,
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:31.720]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars,
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:35.720]  the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:38.720]  that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser
[02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:40.720]  is what keeps info wars on the air
[02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:44.720]  and what that does is keep the populist message alive
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:47.720]  in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:48.720]  So continue to do it.
[02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:50.720]  Go to places like infowarstore.com.

[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:54.720]  Continue to keep info wars alive
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:58.720]  because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[02:30:58.720 --> 02:30:59.720]  Ladies and gentlemen,

[02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:16.720]  but on top of it, double patriot points
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:19.720]  and what makes this the most special sale ever.
[02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:22.720]  Every order will get a free gift,
[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:24.720]  no matter how small or how big,
[02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:28.720]  and it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:31.720]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.

[02:31:35.720 --> 02:31:39.720]  and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $800.
[02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:42.720]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs,
[02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:44.720]  some of them are Alex Jones, Halloween masks,
[02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:46.720]  some of them are books, films,
[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:48.720]  info wars flags, American flags.
[02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:50.720]  There are hundreds of different items.
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:51.720]  It's all random.
[02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:55.720]  infowarstore.com, every order gets a free gift.

[02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:02.720]  It's just like yellow or clear.
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:03.720]  That's because it's been denatured.
[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:04.720]  It's been marked down.
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:06.720]  We didn't do that.
[02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:08.720]  Do you think I would metaphysically
[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:11.720]  tell you something that this is the very best I can get?
[02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:13.720]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:16.720]  I will only give you the maximum best info,
[02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:19.720]  the maximum truth, the maximum product,
[02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:22.720]  because I want that good will.
[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:24.720]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:26.720]  Don't you get the big secret?
[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:28.720]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:30.720]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:35.720]  And this little jewel right here is solid,
[02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:40.720]  liquid consciousness.
[02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:42.720]  Look it up.
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:46.720]  Find out how even the FDA and the government
[02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:48.720]  have made some fish oil is incredible.
[02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:50.720]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:53.720]  is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:55.720]  Just like our information is dynamite,
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:32:58.720]  so are our products in 4store.com.
[02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:01.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:05.720]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:21.720]  Our jobs have been shipped overseas.
[02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:22.720]  We've been deindustrialized.
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:25.720]  They've cut our power supplies off to bankrupt us
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:26.720]  and get us under control.
[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:28.720]  We're trying to pay Americans not to work.
[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:30.720]  And if you read different documents
[02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:33.720]  that came out from the Clinton Library,
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.720]  National Library a few years ago,
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:37.720]  when WorldNet Daily soon got the documents,
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:39.720]  when they first got into office in 93,
[02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:41.720]  they were obsessed with killing the U.S. economy
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:44.720]  to control Americans and to kill any populist
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:48.720]  or conservative media that could create its own ecosystem.
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:50.720]  That's why in full wars it's so precious.
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:52.720]  Mike Lindell is just a great entrepreneur
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:54.720]  and a Made in America patriot that solved problems
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:58.720]  and literally just solved the history
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:01.720]  that was taking place and stood up for everybody.
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:03.720]  That's why it's so critical understand
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:05.720]  to fight a war takes money.
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:08.720]  So if you just donated to myself or Mike Lindell
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:10.720]  and we're fighting hard, that's a good thing.

[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:51.720]  for 20, 30 years.

[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:06.720]  you can't make here in the U.S.
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:08.720]  like my Giza Dream Sheets.
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:10.720]  They don't have any weavers or spinners left.
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:13.720]  But I will say that if you go to mystore.com,

[02:36:57.720 --> 02:36:58.720]  But you love what's put together here.
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:01.720]  The point is you're a major employer of the American people
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:03.720]  and you're battling the globalists at Point Blank Range.
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:05.720]  MyStore.com, promo code Alex.
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:07.720]  Getting back to the election.
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:09.720]  Yep, absolutely.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:11.720]  I'm going to tell everybody the,
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:13.720]  I'm going to give everybody a little hope here, too.
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:15.720]  I was down in Florida.
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:17.720]  And when I was there for the Hurricanes,
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:20.720]  we were giving out pillows and blankets, my pillows.
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:23.720]  And we went into the Hispanic community.
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:25.720]  They lost everything.
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:27.720]  They're piled up, all their physical stuff piled up
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:29.720]  like cordwood and it's gone.
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:32.720]  And we, we had, a lot of them, we had to have an interpreter.
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:34.720]  And you know what they were saying?
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:37.720]  Almost, almost unanimously, all of them were saying,
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:40.720]  Mike, is there the stuff going on in this country?
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:42.720]  Can we, can, is there hope?
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:43.720]  Is there hope?
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:45.720]  They were worried about our future, Alex.
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:47.720]  Their freedoms that they have here.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:49.720]  They had just lost everything physical.
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:51.720]  But you're not, they know they're not going to get
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:52.720]  those physical things back.
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:54.720]  If we lose all our freedoms, it's over.
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:56.720]  And that's what we've been fighting for.
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:59.720]  And that's what we, we are winning everybody.
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:02.720]  And I want to tell everybody just to give a couple of updates here.
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:05.720]  You've got going down in Arizona right now.
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:07.720]  Everyone says, are we going to get the Senate?
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:08.720]  I believe we are.
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:12.720]  We've got Carrie Lake, Blake, and Mark Fincham.
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:15.720]  They're all, they're, they're counting the same day votes now.
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:17.720]  Carrie Lake's only down by 13,000.
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.720]  She was down by a quarter million when they were doing
[02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:23.720]  the cheating ones that all the mail in and other early voting.
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:25.720]  And they're overtaking the algorithms.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:28.720]  Everybody, we, they have overtaken the algorithms.
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:31.720]  All three of them, I believe, and when Carrie for sure,
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:32.720]  100%.
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:35.720]  That's key for folks who don't know what overpowering the algorithm
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:39.720]  means is a giant red wave, they can't stop it completely.
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:42.720]  Explain what overpowering or overtaking the algorithm means.
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:43.720]  Right.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:45.720]  So that compute, when you have the computers, you have a,
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:48.720]  you, when you're using computers and you set them,
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:50.720]  you set them to steal.
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:53.720]  So let's say, just like, just like our great president,
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:55.720]  real president Donald Trump in 2020.
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:58.720]  They had these set, you have to have a base to begin with.
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:01.720]  You have to, you know, kind of do a prediction of what you
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:05.720]  think it will be of how many votes will come in on the day of
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:09.720]  and, and now you're taking, you can't make it look so obvious.
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:11.720]  You know, you can't make it look obvious.
[02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:13.720]  Otherwise they would go, Hey, there's a problem here.
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:18.720]  And, but when they do that, so they can only steal so much from
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:22.720]  like, from a Carrie Lake like down there in, in Arizona.
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:25.720]  And I'll give you a perfect example where the primaries were
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:26.720]  Carrie Lake.
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:29.720]  We told everybody to vote day of Carrie Lake.
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:32.720]  Remember, she was down by 10% 11 o'clock at night.
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:35.720]  Then they started counting the day of votes in the primary.
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:37.720]  Remember this was months ago.
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:40.720]  And she caught up and she was only down by 12 or up.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:42.720]  Then she was up by 12,000 votes.
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:44.720]  So what did Maricopa County do?
[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:47.720]  They put the, they stopped the machine, stopped the counting,
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:50.720]  put the covers over the windows, put the fence up again.
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:53.720]  And we waited three days until they find there's nothing they
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:56.720]  could do because there was a 90,000 votes left.
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:00.720]  And the same day was coming in 75 Carrie, 25, the opponent.
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:02.720]  So they had to give it to Carrie.
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:04.720]  It's identical to what's going on right now.
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:07.720]  There's about 400,000 votes left.
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:10.720]  And Carrie Lake's only down by 13.
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:14.720]  All the votes coming in for Blake, Mark and Carrie are,
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:18.720]  are coming in at a 80%, 80, 20 clip.
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:20.720]  So they're all going to, I believe they're all going to win.
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:21.720]  Carrie's going to win for sure.
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:23.720]  And this is going on in other races too.
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.720]  In Nevada, Jim Arshad, the other, the other Senator
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:31.720]  that's there that's running for Senate,
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:33.720]  I can't think of the name right now.
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:36.720]  I got a mind block, but he, he's going to probably win.
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:39.720]  That gives us the Senate control of the Senate.
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:41.720]  And if it does, if just one of them went,
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:44.720]  if just Blake comes in, then we got to go to Herschel Walker
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:46.720]  for that runoff, which Herschel won going away,
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:49.720]  but they, they stole it, made it a runoff.
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:53.720]  And then also Lauren Boeber in, in Colorado,
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:56.720]  she's only down by 30 votes now.
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:58.720]  And so what I mean, everybody, these are the real,
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:01.720]  the real votes coming in the day of votes.
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:05.720]  So they overtook, they beat the machine steel, so to speak,
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:07.720]  whatever they set.
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:08.720]  Okay.
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:10.720]  It's pretty hard for them to do dumps, you know,
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:13.720]  and yeah, we got to pray that Lauren,
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:15.720]  cause she would be the bright spot of Colorado.
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:18.720]  They took everything in Colorado, everybody.
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:19.720]  They stole it all.
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:21.720]  Yeah, that just means she had such a landslide,
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:23.720]  she beat the algorithm if she wins.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:24.720]  In fact, I've been watching today,
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:26.720]  she's been in the lead off and on.
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:30.720]  So this is, this is like a buy a nose horse race right now.
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:31.720]  Right, right.
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:35.720]  Are they, are they, it's kind of like, I mean, if they,
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:37.720]  and by the way, I'm going to tell everybody this too,
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:40.720]  realize the candidates, the ones that they do,
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:42.720]  that they have taken, there's a lot of,
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:44.720]  most of them out there aren't going to concede.
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:46.720]  We're going to go, they have more rights you think
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:48.720]  than to do honest that, and they won't be able
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.720]  to kick them out for standing.
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:53.720]  So I believe what's going to happen, Alex,
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:55.720]  we're going to get the House of Senate, I believe,
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:57.720]  control and that'll slow the destruction.
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:59.720]  And we're going to get this country back
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:01.720]  by the judges, everybody.
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:03.720]  We've got so many sheriffs out there,
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:04.720]  they're going to be bringing this,
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:06.720]  all the evidence of what happened in this,
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:09.720]  in this election to the, to the judges and cases
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:10.720]  and court cases.
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:12.720]  Remember, no judge in the United States
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:14.720]  has looked at any evidence from 2020,
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:16.720]  or for that matter, any of these elections,
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:19.720]  even in the primaries, because they kicked the can
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:21.720]  on something called standing.
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:23.720]  It's just an easy way for a judge to say,
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:24.720]  I don't want to see that.
[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:26.720]  Well, we've got to pray for our judges.
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:28.720]  If you know a judge out there and you,
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:30.720]  and you're a family or you're a friend of,
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:32.720]  as a judge, just encourage them to say,
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:34.720]  just have courage to be the judge
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:36.720]  that God put you here to be, be a judge.
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:37.720]  It is an example.
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:39.720]  It's like the district attorney, Frank Garrison,
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:41.720]  exposed the whole Kennedy thing,
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:43.720]  because one district attorney did the right thing.
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:45.720]  That's why Soros has been trying to buy him off.
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:46.720]  We come back.
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:47.720]  What's coming next?
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:48.720]  Other big developments?
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.720]  Your deep research from two years ago.
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:42:59.720]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:02.720]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022

[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:16.720]  it'll be months and months

[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:39.720]  including uricoma longifolia,

[02:44:56.720 --> 02:44:58.720]  Once a tragedy reaches a level
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:00.720]  of national significance,
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:03.720]  American citizens should be allowed
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:05.720]  to basically question that event
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:07.720]  in any way that they deem fit.
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:09.720]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:11.720]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:12.720]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:14.720]  So, they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:16.720]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon.
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:17.720]  Or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:19.720]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago,
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:21.720]  but only 28 years.
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:23.720]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:25.720]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:27.720]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:29.720]  And now, because we've been so successful
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:30.720]  warning the population of the planet,
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:31.720]  not just America,
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:33.720]  we're public enemy number one
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:35.720]  when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:37.720]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:39.720]  how successful InfoWars has been
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:40.720]  because of your past support.
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:42.720]  So, I salute you and I thank you.
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:43.720]  And I ask you now,
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:44.720]  it's the critical juncture of the battle.
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:45.720]  Three double your efforts
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:47.720]  by visiting infowarstore.com
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:50.720]  and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:52.720]  1776 is the promo code.
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:54.720]  The destination is infowarstore.com.
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:45:57.720]  And I thank you all for your support.
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:01.720]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen,
[02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:03.720]  slowly stolen, day by day,
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:05.720]  counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:07.720]  And it's absolutely absurd
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:10.720]  for anyone to take our election seriously
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:13.720]  when we just, it's election month, Alex.
[02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:15.720]  It's not election day.
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:16.720]  And that's the problem.
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:19.720]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:22.720]  They illegally changed state elections,
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:25.720]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone,
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:28.720]  and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:30.720]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:32.720]  We're in a serious country
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:34.720]  when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:36.720]  And I believe that,
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:39.720]  just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020,
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:41.720]  and I have no problem saying that.
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:44.720]  And it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:47.720]  to attack us that question our election integrity
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:52.720]  and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:54.720]  We're not election deniers.
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:56.720]  We're election realists.
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:03.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:05.720]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:12.720]  Okay, so with that being said, with the exposure,
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:14.720]  once that's lifted,
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:17.720]  now this should get rid of all the lawfare.
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:18.720]  It'll get rid of the lawfare.
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:19.720]  It'll get rid of this.
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:23.720]  Remember, lawfare has not been used in our country since 1798.
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:25.720]  It's horrible what they did.
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:26.720]  And who started that?
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:28.720]  Smartmatic did.
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:32.720]  When Smartmatic sued Fox News on February 4th of 2021,
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:34.720]  our voices got silent
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:36.720]  because they Fox One talk.
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:40.720]  Nobody will have anybody on to talk about the election crime,
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:41.720]  including 2,000 meals.
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:43.720]  And that wasn't even machines.
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:45.720]  So you had, you got your newsmaxes of the world,
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:47.720]  your Foxes of the world.
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:51.720]  Well, they can't talk about election crime or machines
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:52.720]  or anything like that.
[02:47:52.720 --> 02:47:53.720]  It's disgusting.
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:57.720]  And so they are either afraid of being sued.
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:00.720]  Well, once you sue Fox News, everybody was afraid, right?
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:04.720]  And that's a whole nother story about Fox News.
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:07.720]  But anyway, so this lawfare now,
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:09.720]  and all these lawsuits,
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:11.720]  remember these machine companies
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:13.720]  and one of them rhymes with the word dominion,
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:15.720]  they've sued over 200 people
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:17.720]  or sent them threatening letters.
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:20.720]  A lot of these citizens had to go get home security system.
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:22.720]  These were like mafia letters sent to them.
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:24.720]  Well, these citizens, like in,
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:26.720]  nobody hears about in Michigan,
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:29.720]  like these citizens did a class action lawsuit against dominion
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:32.720]  with Alan Dershowitz and one of the lawyers,
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:34.720]  and going, hey, this is wrong.
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:35.720]  You can't do this.
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:36.720]  We did nothing wrong.
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:37.720]  Nobody's did anything wrong.
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:39.720]  We're speaking out against something
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:41.720]  that everybody's seen and knows.
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:43.720]  And so what's happening, Mike Lindell,
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:45.720]  because even last week before the election,
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:47.720]  Politico and a bunch of others wrote articles
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:49.720]  admitting machines are hackable and are being hacked
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:51.720]  and saying everything you said,
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:53.720]  everything I've been reporting for 28 years.
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:54.720]  I mean, so, so, so...
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:57.720]  Well, yeah, we're totally vindicated, you guys.
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:01.720]  I was down at a Senate hearing down in Louisiana
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:03.720]  a couple months ago,
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:05.720]  and all the machine companies were there.
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:07.720]  There's ESNS.
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:09.720]  They're one of the biggest ones in the country,
[02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:11.720]  if not the biggest, out of Omaha, Nebraska.
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:13.720]  One of their owners was there,
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:15.720]  and he comes up and he goes,
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:18.720]  the great Secretary of State,
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:20.720]  Kyle Ardnwin, asked him straight out.
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:23.720]  He said, are your machines hackable and vulnerable?
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:25.720]  And these didn't lie.
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:28.720]  He said, yes, they are, but all machines are.
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:30.720]  All voting machines are.
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:31.720]  End quote.
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:33.720]  And then with these guys,
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:35.720]  they tried to paint themselves
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:37.720]  that they're not Dominion and Smartmatic.
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:40.720]  We're the hometown boys from Omaha, Nebraska,
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:43.720]  but our parts are made in China.
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:45.720]  Our software, it's all the same software.
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:47.720]  It's all corruption.
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:49.720]  And then Alex, you'll like this,
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:52.720]  so they let me talk for 24 minutes.
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:55.720]  And the one gal on the, up there at the committee,
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:57.720]  she says, Mr. Lindell,
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:59.720]  in our state here,
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:02.720]  we'd rather not use paper to save the trees and stuff.
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:04.720]  I said, I said, well, ma'am,
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:06.720]  we're going to recycle too.
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:08.720]  We're going to take these machines, melt them down
[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:10.720]  and turn them into prison bars.
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:11.720]  End quote.
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:12.720]  I love it.
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:14.720]  I want to bring Owen Troyer here
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:16.720]  and hit a bunch of other key points you've got.
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:18.720]  We're very blessed to have you for the full hour.
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:20.720]  Owen Troyer has been our election expert here
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:21.720]  been following your work,
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:23.720]  and he's got a few questions and comments.
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:25.720]  Owen Troyer on the air with Mike Lindell.
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:27.720]  Yeah, Mike, you're doing such great work
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:29.720]  monitoring all of these races
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:31.720]  and all the trends going on across the country.
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:33.720]  It's really an amazing team you've assembled.
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:35.720]  But I'm curious, what are you noticing
[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:38.720]  in these inner cities like Philadelphia,
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:41.720]  Chicago, New York, and San Francisco,
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:43.720]  where Democrats are getting 70, 80,
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:46.720]  sometimes 90% of the vote?
[02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:48.720]  What do you think the story there is?
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:50.720]  I mean, are Democrats really that popular
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:52.720]  in the cities they destroyed?
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:54.720]  Or is your team noticing maybe some shenanigans
[02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:56.720]  that are getting these huge numbers
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:59.720]  for Democrats that end up in Senate races
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:01.720]  overwhelming the state's desires?
[02:51:01.720 --> 02:51:04.720]  Right, well, all you have to do is just look at Florida.
[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:06.720]  Like I said earlier in the show,
[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:08.720]  Florida, they put in stuff there to at least
[02:51:08.720 --> 02:51:12.720]  at least flow the steel to a crawl.
[02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:14.720]  And you just had a governor there, I mean,
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:17.720]  and get a windade county,
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:19.720]  which hadn't been won in decades, I guess.
[02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:22.720]  So if you look at that's what it really would be like
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:24.720]  without machine manipulation, or somewhat,
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:26.720]  because remember they still have machines,
[02:51:26.720 --> 02:51:28.720]  but they put things in place where they couldn't pull names.
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:30.720]  So when you talk what you're saying there,
[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:33.720]  no, they're just blatantly because, oh, it's inner city.
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:36.720]  The propaganda to the people is,
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:38.720]  oh, they're all going to vote Democrat.
[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:43.720]  No, I was out in California for a week about two months ago,
[02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:46.720]  and you could all look it up, Mike Lindell, California.
[02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:50.720]  And I was in a town, they were all very Democrat and liberal,
[02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:52.720]  and the average age was probably 30,
[02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:54.720]  but they all came up to me.
[02:51:54.720 --> 02:51:56.720]  All of them were friendly and they were concerned.
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:58.720]  Their gas was $7.30.
[02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:00.720]  They weren't going to vote Democrat anymore.
[02:52:00.720 --> 02:52:03.720]  By the way, Mike, that's what I've seen where I live
[02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:05.720]  with liberals that are away now.
[02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:07.720]  That's what the CNN exit polls predicted
[02:52:07.720 --> 02:52:09.720]  a mass Republican victory, because 70-plus percent
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:12.720]  of Democrats said, we blame Biden, we're going to vote Republican.
[02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:15.720]  But the exit polls now are completely wrong,
[02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:18.720]  though historically they've always been extremely accurate.
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:21.720]  So I think it's clear, big city, deep blue, Democrat cities,
[02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:24.720]  Chicago's famous for it on record, you know,
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:26.720]  stealing it back in the 60s,
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:29.720]  they are engaged in massive fraud there,
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:32.720]  and I think they're just overdoing it in those areas
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:35.720]  to get up the overall averages for the rest of the state
[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:39.720]  in these statewide congressional and presidential elections.
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:41.720]  What do you think?
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:43.720]  Well, absolutely. It's been ever the public.
[02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:46.720]  Remember, when they use these computers and stuff,
[02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:50.720]  they don't want to make a deviation seem too out of hand.
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:52.720]  Well, if you've got the public convinced
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:54.720]  that everybody loves the inner city,
[02:52:54.720 --> 02:52:56.720]  they're all going to vote Democrat,
[02:52:56.720 --> 02:52:59.720]  that's a big lie. That is a big lie.
[02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:01.720]  Remember, in the 2020 election,
[02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:04.720]  the most votes sold against Donald Trump was California,
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:06.720]  minimum 1.5 million.
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:09.720]  Second most in the country was Texas at 1 million,
[02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:12.720]  and third was Florida at 950,000.
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:15.720]  So what they did, and you say,
[02:53:15.720 --> 02:53:18.720]  well, why would they take from a Republican state
[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:20.720]  like Alabama or Ohio?
[02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:23.720]  Well, here's why. I'll give everybody an example.
[02:53:23.720 --> 02:53:26.720]  Let's say I told you that in my home state of Minnesota
[02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:31.720]  that Donald Trump won 2 million to Biden's 100,000.
[02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:34.720]  Everyone would say, that's a computer error.
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:36.720]  There's something wrong.
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:39.720]  So you have to make it look,
[02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:42.720]  you have to boil the whole ocean, so to speak.
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:44.720]  So you can look at those inner cities and say,
[02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:47.720]  we can take more there because people will believe
[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:49.720]  it's all Democrat.
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:51.720]  Or you can go to Republican area and say,
[02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:55.720]  it's so overwhelming, 80% is going to be Republican,
[02:53:55.720 --> 02:53:58.720]  that you go, hey, we can take 10% off the top there.
[02:53:58.720 --> 02:54:00.720]  It's like skimming.
[02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:02.720]  If you had a massive casino or something,
[02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:04.720]  you're skimming off the top.
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:06.720]  Perfectly said.
[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:09.720]  Perfectly said. I want another question.
[02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:11.720]  Well, Mike, we were all concerned in Nevada
[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:13.720]  that it was going to be Clark County.
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:15.720]  That's Las Vegas, where the Democrats
[02:54:15.720 --> 02:54:17.720]  were going to be up to shenanigans and tricks,
[02:54:17.720 --> 02:54:19.720]  and maybe that's how they were going to try to pull off
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:21.720]  an election victory in the Senate.
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:23.720]  But we've been watching Clark County,
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:26.720]  and it really hasn't seemed to anomalous
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:28.720]  as far as the numbers coming in.
[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:31.720]  But then overnight, it was Reno.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:33.720]  It was Washaw County that magically,
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:36.720]  60% of all the recent ballot dumps
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:39.720]  are coming in for the Democrat, Mostau,
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:42.720]  where it used to be 60% for Laxalt.
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:46.720]  Are you guys watching Washaw County, Nevada right now?
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:48.720]  Are you guys seeing these anomalies?
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:50.720]  Do you think that's where they're going to try
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:52.720]  to steal this Senate seat?
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:56.720]  Well, I have not talked to him about Nevada,
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:54:58.720]  but I will say this.
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:02.720]  I think you need to look more of what votes are they counting.
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:04.720]  I believe they're counting.
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:06.720]  They counted all the early votes.
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:08.720]  Remember, I said that's where most of the steal
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:10.720]  goes in these early voting
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:13.720]  before the same voting.
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:16.720]  So if they're counting in Nevada, I don't care
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:18.720]  if it's Clark County, Reno, wherever it is.
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:21.720]  If those people voted day of,
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:23.720]  I believe that they, you know, you're going to have
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:25.720]  a big win in the Senate there.
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:27.720]  All right, I'll enjoy your great questions.
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:28.720]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:30.720]  We'll be hosting the War Room, 3 p.m. Central today,
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:32.720]  coming up in a few hours.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:34.720]  Mike, we're almost out of time.
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:36.720]  Thank you for so much time in 60 seconds.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:40.720]  Closing comments or any other key things you'd like to add?
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:42.720]  Yeah, I would just like to tell everyone
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:45.720]  we are in, it's absolutely awesome
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:48.720]  that the way things are just laid out here
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:50.720]  from these little mini miracles.
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:52.720]  Remember, we had all this machine problems
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:55.720]  called malfunctioning across our whole country,
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:58.720]  which made national and international news.
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:00.720]  That's huge for what we have to do in the future
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:01.720]  to get rid of them.
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:04.720]  And then we had, we got the House,
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:07.720]  we're going to get the Senate, I believe we're going to get that.
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:10.720]  And then you're going to see Kerry Lake and all them,
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:13.720]  Kerry Lake and Mark Fincham win in Arizona.
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:16.720]  That's the gateway, that'll be the prototype.
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:18.720]  The first thing they're going to do is say,
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:20.720]  we got these machines got to go,
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:22.720]  and then it'll spread across our country.
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:24.720]  We're going to look back and we're going to say,
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:26.720]  when we get to this great place, we're going,
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:28.720]  God had his hand in all of this.
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:30.720]  And if you look back, everything had to happen
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:32.720]  just the way it did.
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:34.720]  And with everybody having patience,
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:38.720]  because even the bad stuff is making people pour in
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:39.720]  to the nonsense.
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:41.720]  As long as we don't give up, they lose.
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:43.720]  And over time, we're out of the boiling frog pot.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:44.720]  We're awake now.
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:45.720]  Now we know we're under attack.
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:46.720]  We're getting stronger every day.
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:48.720]  The longer we continue to fight.
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:50.720]  So again, people should go to mystore.com

[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:22.720]  Keep the faith.
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:23.720]  Yeah.
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:24.720]  So I think we're turning.
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:26.720]  I mean, I think the warms turning.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:28.720]  I totally agree with you that we're awake now.
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:29.720]  You're awake.
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:30.720]  You're in a hellish situation.
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:31.720]  At least you're awake.
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:32.720]  All right.
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:34.720]  Thank you so much, Mike Lindell.
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:35.720]  Thank you.
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:36.720]  There he goes.
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:37.720]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:39.720]  Oh, it's got a little bit of an update.
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:58:08.720]  Then we're going to open the phones up the whole next hour.
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:09.720]  All right.
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:10.720]  Welcome back to Mike Burino owner.
[02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:11.720]  So you know, who's calling people was a lack vitamin d3.
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:12.720]  You see,
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:13.720]  the sun.
[02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:14.720]  Via your skin.
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:18.720]  Helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:21.720]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3.
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:23.720]  And then it's very easy for viruses.
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:24.720]  And other things.
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:26.720]  You start replicating and taking your body over.

[02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:31.720]  D3.

[02:58:48.200 --> 02:58:53.160]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has
[02:58:53.160 --> 02:58:59.200]  truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:00.200]  the globalist.
[02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:05.840]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years and that's
[02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:10.480]  because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:17.600]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[02:59:17.600 --> 02:59:19.960]  Introducing Top G supplements.
[02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:24.400]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the Top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and
[02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:25.400]  his crew.

[02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:31.160]  Andrew Tate takes himself.

[02:59:40.920 --> 02:59:42.680]  highest quality on the market.
[02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:43.680]  Men grow up to be like me.
[02:59:43.680 --> 02:59:46.720]  You're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes
[02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:49.600]  who protect and provide for the people close.
[02:59:49.600 --> 03:00:00.600]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:00.600 --> 03:00:05.800]  I'm not going to sit here and take any more.
[03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:14.560]  The third difference which we see in the force industry revolution is the fact that the winners
[03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:23.520]  take it all, contrary to the previous industrial revolutions, it's very difficult to copy.
[03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:29.160]  So if you are a first mover, you are the winners.
[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:35.800]  And this will determine global competition on a national but also on the business level
[03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:37.680]  to a large extent.
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:44.360]  And I hope in a not too hostile way in the coming years.
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:51.000]  It really is true in a social Darwinistic fashion that is we present all this that's
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:57.640]  very accurate and documented and the general public does not rally and awaken and say no
[03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:02.320]  and bring the perpetrators and justice that really they've all been given ample warning
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:04.280]  and deserve what they get.
[03:01:04.280 --> 03:01:10.120]  And that's why the globalist target adults with deadly shots and assisted suicide and
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:15.080]  all the rest of it because metaphysically in the natural law of the universe, if you can
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:19.520]  get somebody to hurt themselves out of their free will, even if you pretty much trick them,
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:26.120]  you still got to give them a hint, then it doesn't come back on you metaphysically as
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:27.120]  bad.
[03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:35.240]  And what will happen to politics in your country in 20 years when somebody in San Francisco
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:44.400]  or in Beijing knows the entire medical and personal history of every politician, every
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:51.280]  judge and every journalist in your country, including all those sexual escapades, all
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:56.080]  their mental weaknesses and all their corrupt dealings.
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:02:03.320]  Will it still be an independent country or will it become a data colony when you have
[03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:10.000]  enough data, you don't need to send soldiers in order to control a country.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:13.560]  So they're definitely involved in a spiritual alchemy and they understand the laws of the
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:14.560]  universe.
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:20.120]  But when they cross the Rubicon of trying to euthanize children, trying to sterilize
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:28.760]  children, trying to wreck the brains of children, it commits an interdimensional crime that
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:32.160]  God will not put up with and will destroy us.
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:39.200]  Originally it was pericarditis and I was then told just before Christmas actually is perimarcarditis,
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:45.200]  so it's actually worse because I've got pericarditis and the micarditis damage, so I have scarring
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:50.080]  on three parts of my heart and still the delining the muscle of my heart has got the information
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:51.080]  which constricts it.
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:54.720]  That's when my heart rate goes up, that's what's constricting my heart and stopping
[03:02:54.720 --> 03:02:56.120]  me from breathing.
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:02.120]  And the other team who are finding knows that and that's why they try to get us to go along
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:09.240]  and sanction the killing of children, whether it be abortion or assisted suicide or transgenderism
[03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:15.640]  as a form of genetic suicide for the people that actually get sterilized.
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:22.120]  And so they're trying to get us to lower our shields, ourselves.
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:25.120]  The depopulationists dream.
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:32.400]  A 3D printed suicide machine, or in other words, a modern day gas chamber.
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:36.880]  The Sarko Capsule, a high-tech death machine explicitly built for killing yourself was
[03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:38.640]  just 3D printed.
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:45.040]  The Sarko Capsule is being touted by depopulationists as a way to efficiently and effortlessly
[03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:46.680]  kill oneself.
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:51.320]  Amir Farsud has applied for medically assisted dying known as Maid.
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:55.600]  He lives in constant agony due to a back injury but has started the process for end
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:04:00.320]  of life because his rooming house is up for sale and he can't find anywhere else to live
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:01.880]  that he can afford.
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:06.640]  Once inside the pod, the user will have to start the fatal process themselves.
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:11.640]  They will have to press a button which will reduce internal oxygen levels.
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:17.720]  The pod, which is biodegradable, can then be detached to be used as a coffin.
[03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:21.720]  When a Canadian veteran picked up the phone and called Veterans Affairs Canada to get
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:27.680]  treatment for his combat-related PTSD and a traumatic brain injury, he expected help
[03:04:27.680 --> 03:04:30.160]  getting better and getting his life back.
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:35.440]  Instead, he got an unexpected and unwanted offer to help him end it through medically
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:36.440]  assisted death.
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:38.400]  This is all being done by design.
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:42.320]  Well, the globalists say they're destroying the country by design.
[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:58.960]  This is a pro-death pro-terranny cult.
[03:04:58.960 --> 03:05:01.520]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:05.280]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[03:05:05.280 --> 03:05:06.520]  There's a solution.
[03:05:06.520 --> 03:05:07.520]  The wellness company.

[03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:46.760]  that we're living in.

[03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:42.520]  Once Monday that we're going to extend the big sale that's going, the big mega sale,
[03:08:42.520 --> 03:08:50.520]  blowout sales, sellout sale, we're going to extend that until all the products sell out.
[03:08:50.520 --> 03:08:56.320]  Because we've got to get the funds in now to pay our legal and to stay on air and to
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:01.600]  do our appeals and not let them take us off air so we don't just roll over and die so
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:04.520]  they can have their big fake victory.
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:09.520]  Full Wars is in your hands as viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:13.520]  If you financially support us and get great products and empower yourself in your life,
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:17.520]  if you make that decision, then we're unstoppable.
[03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:27.520]  But here's the good news, everything is on sale 50 to 60% off with promo code 1776 at infowarstore.com.
[03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:29.520]  Here's the problem.
[03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:33.520]  We've already sold out of our super high quality coffee.
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:35.520]  We've just sold out of X3.
[03:09:35.520 --> 03:09:38.520]  We're about to sell out of Brainforce Plus.
[03:09:38.520 --> 03:09:42.520]  We have got most of these products about to sell out.
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:46.520]  Now I can sit there and keep a few months at full price of bringing money, but we need the funds now.
[03:09:46.520 --> 03:09:48.520]  Plus I want you to get these products.
[03:09:48.520 --> 03:09:51.520]  So a lot of these won't come in for months and months and months, but we've got to have the funds now.
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:54.520]  Some of these products we're making 10, 15% on.
[03:09:54.520 --> 03:09:56.520]  Some are making 30% on.
[03:09:56.520 --> 03:09:58.520]  Most products are marked up four or five times.
[03:09:58.520 --> 03:09:59.520]  Ours aren't like that.
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:02.520]  When they're at full price, they're marked up 100% percent.
[03:10:02.520 --> 03:10:06.520]  If you're selling them at this price, they are very close to the breakeven margin.
[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:08.520]  So do your Christmas shopping now.
[03:10:08.520 --> 03:10:11.520]  Get products that will empower your life and do amazing things.

[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:12.520]  Don't fight the crowds.
[03:11:12.520 --> 03:11:13.520]  Keep us on air.
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:17.520]  It's a 361 infowarstore.com.
[03:11:17.520 --> 03:11:22.520]  Or triple A 253-3139.
[03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:23.520]  All right.
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:27.520]  Let's shift gears now to the power of the people.
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:29.520]  Whether it's a school board, or whether it's a city council,
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:31.520]  or whether it's a state legislature,
[03:11:31.520 --> 03:11:33.520]  or whether it's a demonstration in Washington.
[03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:37.520]  The most effective place for the average person to get past the sensors
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:39.520]  and to reach tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,
[03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:42.520]  if not millions, or tens of millions of people,
[03:11:42.520 --> 03:11:45.520]  as Matt Baker's done, is to go to these events.
[03:11:45.520 --> 03:11:47.520]  That's why in the last year and a half,
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:49.520]  the FBI went to the school boards and said,
[03:11:49.520 --> 03:11:52.520]  call us in a secret document.
[03:11:52.520 --> 03:11:55.520]  We want to come intimidate people not to come to these events.
[03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:57.520]  It's hurting us too politically if conservatives,
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:02.520]  or populists, or nationalists ever figure it out
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:06.520]  and actually go take back peacefully their counties,
[03:12:06.520 --> 03:12:08.520]  their cities, their states, their school boards,
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:10.520]  their zoning boards are key.
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:13.520]  That's where Gen. 2030 is coming through.
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:17.520]  If that happens, and if people realize how easy it is
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:19.520]  to take over your local governments,
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:21.520]  because what we're promoting is common sense and popular,
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:24.520]  and based on common sense,
[03:12:24.520 --> 03:12:26.520]  it's game over.
[03:12:26.520 --> 03:12:28.520]  And so if you go to your city council,
[03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:30.520]  and maybe a thousand people are there,
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:33.520]  and maybe 10,000 see it on the local TV station,
[03:12:33.520 --> 03:12:35.520]  that's a big win.
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:38.520]  But most people that go give a good speech reach 100,000.
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:40.520]  And a lot of people, every day I can keep track of it,
[03:12:40.520 --> 03:12:42.520]  I'll see dozens of videos, I've been looking,
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:44.520]  of a half million here, two million there,
[03:12:44.520 --> 03:12:46.520]  a million here, 300,000 there,
[03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:49.520]  with people just going black, white, Hispanic, Asian,
[03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:52.520]  old, young, gay, straight, saying, I don't want force masks,
[03:12:52.520 --> 03:12:54.520]  I don't want force injections, I don't want open borders,
[03:12:54.520 --> 03:12:56.520]  I don't want the value dollars, I don't want fentanyl,
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:12:59.520]  I don't want the New World Order, I don't want Klaus Schwab,
[03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:02.520]  I don't want election fraud.
[03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:06.520]  When you simply do that, everybody else already feels like you,
[03:13:06.520 --> 03:13:09.520]  they get mobilized, they get inspired,
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:12.520]  and the weakest link in the New World Order's offense,
[03:13:12.520 --> 03:13:16.520]  the missing patch of scales on Smog's belly,
[03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:19.520]  where we can get the truth, the sword into his heart,
[03:13:19.520 --> 03:13:23.520]  is local governments, while the globalists teach their people,
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:25.520]  think global, act local.
[03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:28.520]  Well, we should think local, think individual,
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:32.520]  and think humanity, and we should take over the local now.
[03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:35.520]  That's their cheek in the armor.
[03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:37.520]  And so we've got some of the greatest hits
[03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:41.520]  of Matt Baker coming up, but as we go to break,
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:43.520]  I want to go ahead and play a clip of him
[03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:46.520]  in front of the Maricopa board,
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:49.520]  where we're talking about election fraud, here it is.
[03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:51.520]  Good morning.
[03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:57.520]  Once again, the eyes of the world are upon Maricopa County
[03:13:57.520 --> 03:14:00.520]  for another botched election.
[03:14:00.520 --> 03:14:04.520]  Am I here to accuse you of stealing the vote?
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:09.520]  Heavens know, for that would make me a terrorist, wouldn't it?
[03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:14.520]  Let me ask you, if you took your life savings to a bank
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:16.520]  and the teller put them in a machine
[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:20.520]  and the machine kicked out one out of four of your bills
[03:14:20.520 --> 03:14:25.520]  and the teller said, don't worry, we'll put them in box three over here
[03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:28.520]  and we'll let you know how many were in there later.
[03:14:28.520 --> 03:14:30.520]  We'll send them off to a separate location
[03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:32.520]  and someone will be sure to get back to you
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:34.520]  and tell you how much money you have.
[03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:36.520]  Would you be okay with that?
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:40.520]  No, you would not be okay with that.
[03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:42.520]  Now ask yourself the question,
[03:14:42.520 --> 03:14:44.520]  which is more valuable?
[03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:47.520]  Your vote or your money?
[03:14:47.520 --> 03:14:50.520]  Now ask a lobbyist that same question.
[03:14:50.520 --> 03:14:53.520]  Now ask a campaign manager that question.
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:57.520]  Now ask Mark Zuckerberg that question,
[03:14:57.520 --> 03:14:59.520]  which is more valuable?
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:04.520]  Your money or your vote or your country or this world
[03:15:04.520 --> 03:15:11.520]  or the corruption that is taking over every single county in this nation?
[03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:14.520]  And then you look into your own soul
[03:15:14.520 --> 03:15:17.520]  and you look back at yourself in the mirror
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:20.520]  and realize that you are the cancer
[03:15:20.520 --> 03:15:24.520]  that is tearing this nation apart.
[03:15:24.520 --> 03:15:26.520]  Good day.
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:29.520]  Thank you, our next speaker.
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:32.520]  And that is the truth and that is the spirit of liberty.
[03:15:32.520 --> 03:15:35.520]  Matt Baker underscored Unhinge on Instagram
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:38.520]  at Bandot Video Slave to Liberty.
[03:15:38.520 --> 03:15:40.520]  Matt Baker and some of his greatest hits
[03:15:40.520 --> 03:15:42.520]  when we come back on the other side.
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:44.520]  Again, Matt Baker is our guest.
[03:15:44.520 --> 03:15:46.520]  We should all be Matt Baker.
[03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:48.520]  They call him the Alex Jones of Dreadlocks.
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:50.520]  He does look like my brother or something.
[03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:52.520]  If I could dreadlocks out if I could, I would look like Matt Baker.
[03:15:52.520 --> 03:16:21.520]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:22.520 --> 03:16:24.520]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:52.520 --> 03:16:54.520]  Get out at importstore.com
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:17:23.520]  But we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[03:17:25.520 --> 03:17:28.520]  Introducing Top G Supplements.
[03:17:28.520 --> 03:17:30.520]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor
[03:17:30.520 --> 03:17:33.520]  the Top G Line of Supplements by Andrew Tate and his crew.

[03:17:42.520 --> 03:17:44.520]  andrutatepower.com
[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:46.520]  andrutatepower.com
[03:17:46.520 --> 03:17:49.520]  and discover the power of Andrew Tate's new supplements
[03:17:49.520 --> 03:17:51.520]  that are the highest quality on the market.
[03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:52.520]  Men grow up to be like me.
[03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:54.520]  You're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record,
[03:17:54.520 --> 03:17:56.520]  dedicated athletes who protect and provide
[03:17:56.520 --> 03:17:58.520]  for the people close to them.
[03:17:58.520 --> 03:18:01.520]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[03:18:01.520 --> 03:18:03.520]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:18:03.520 --> 03:18:05.520]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:07.520]  and they're done in a day.
[03:18:07.520 --> 03:18:09.520]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:18:09.520 --> 03:18:11.520]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:18:11.520 --> 03:18:13.520]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter
[03:18:13.520 --> 03:18:15.520]  whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[03:18:15.520 --> 03:18:17.520]  or Governor DeSantis.
[03:18:17.520 --> 03:18:19.520]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:21.520]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[03:18:21.520 --> 03:18:24.520]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes
[03:18:24.520 --> 03:18:26.520]  without any of those states
[03:18:26.520 --> 03:18:28.520]  where I believe there is an America
[03:18:28.520 --> 03:18:32.520]  first majority in every single one of them.
[03:18:32.520 --> 03:18:36.520]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:18:36.520 --> 03:18:39.520]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:41.520]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:45.520]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:48.520]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:50.520]  People need to get behind info wars.
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:54.520]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you
[03:18:54.520 --> 03:18:56.520]  is vitally important.
[03:18:56.520 --> 03:18:58.520]  We need more of these communications, not less.
[03:18:58.520 --> 03:19:01.520]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[03:19:01.520 --> 03:19:03.520]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:05.520]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:07.520]  and they're done in a day.
[03:19:07.520 --> 03:19:09.520]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:11.520]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:19:11.520 --> 03:19:13.520]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter
[03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:15.520]  whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:17.520]  or Governor DeSantis.
[03:19:17.520 --> 03:19:19.520]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:21.520]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:23.520]  They're going to deny us Arizona,
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:25.520]  and I can't come to 270 electoral votes
[03:19:25.520 --> 03:19:27.520]  without any of those states
[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:30.520]  where I believe there is an America first majority
[03:19:30.520 --> 03:19:32.520]  in every single one of them.
[03:19:32.520 --> 03:19:36.520]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:19:36.520 --> 03:19:39.520]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:42.520]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[03:19:42.520 --> 03:19:45.520]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:19:45.520 --> 03:19:48.520]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:19:48.520 --> 03:19:50.520]  People need to get behind infowars.
[03:19:50.520 --> 03:19:54.520]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you
[03:19:54.520 --> 03:19:56.520]  is vitally important.
[03:19:56.520 --> 03:20:22.520]  We need more of this.
[03:20:22.520 --> 03:20:24.520]  So here's Matt Baker.
[03:20:24.520 --> 03:20:26.520]  Well, over a year and a half ago,
[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:28.520]  confronting the vaccine tyrants.
[03:20:28.520 --> 03:20:30.520]  Remember, back then it seemed like the lockdown
[03:20:30.520 --> 03:20:32.520]  would never end, and they were invincible.
[03:20:32.520 --> 03:20:34.520]  Now they're asking for amnesty,
[03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:36.520]  but we're not giving them amnesty
[03:20:36.520 --> 03:20:38.520]  until they all face Nuremberg Trial 2.0.
[03:20:38.520 --> 03:20:40.520]  Here it is, and we'll go to Matt himself.
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:46.520]  That's the wind.
[03:20:46.520 --> 03:20:48.520]  That's the wind of time.
[03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:50.520]  That's the wind of history.
[03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:52.520]  That's the wind blowing
[03:20:52.520 --> 03:20:54.520]  through your ancestors' bones,
[03:20:54.520 --> 03:20:56.520]  begging you to do the right thing.
[03:20:56.520 --> 03:21:02.520]  That is the wind that Matt Baker is calling upon
[03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:04.520]  from Ocean Beach.
[03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:12.520]  The wind that is blowing through the black people,
[03:21:12.520 --> 03:21:14.520]  through the white people, through the Chinese people,
[03:21:14.520 --> 03:21:16.520]  through the Mexican Americans,
[03:21:16.520 --> 03:21:18.520]  through the people that built this building
[03:21:18.520 --> 03:21:20.520]  with their bare hands
[03:21:20.520 --> 03:21:22.520]  to raise up this nation.
[03:21:22.520 --> 03:21:24.520]  They are begging you,
[03:21:24.520 --> 03:21:26.520]  and they are blowing through your veins,
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:28.520]  and they should be putting a tingle
[03:21:28.520 --> 03:21:30.520]  up the spine of your back,
[03:21:30.520 --> 03:21:32.520]  and they should be begging you
[03:21:32.520 --> 03:21:34.520]  to do the right thing.
[03:21:34.520 --> 03:21:36.520]  You're about to open a pit of hell.
[03:21:36.520 --> 03:21:38.520]  You do not get a vaccine
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:40.520]  passport put on us.
[03:21:40.520 --> 03:21:42.520]  You know, as the population
[03:21:42.520 --> 03:21:44.520]  who's in control,
[03:21:44.520 --> 03:21:46.520]  you know that the people
[03:21:46.520 --> 03:21:48.520]  or the politicians, once you get a power,
[03:21:48.520 --> 03:21:50.520]  you will never relinquish it.
[03:21:50.520 --> 03:21:54.520]  Do you think that the four feet of marble
[03:21:54.520 --> 03:21:56.520]  that holds you above high in this chamber
[03:21:56.520 --> 03:21:58.520]  will help you
[03:21:58.520 --> 03:22:00.520]  from the fate of humanity
[03:22:00.520 --> 03:22:02.520]  which you are unleashing?
[03:22:02.520 --> 03:22:04.520]  No!
[03:22:04.520 --> 03:22:06.520]  No!
[03:22:06.520 --> 03:22:08.520]  It won't!
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:10.520]  Your children and your children's children
[03:22:10.520 --> 03:22:12.520]  will be subjugated.
[03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:14.520]  They will be asked
[03:22:14.520 --> 03:22:16.520]  how many vaccines have you had?
[03:22:16.520 --> 03:22:18.520]  Have you made a good little Nazi?
[03:22:18.520 --> 03:22:20.520]  Hail Fauci!
[03:22:20.520 --> 03:22:22.520]  Hail Fauci!
[03:22:22.520 --> 03:22:24.520]  Hail Fauci!
[03:22:24.520 --> 03:22:26.520]  Hail Fauci!
[03:22:26.520 --> 03:22:28.520]  Hail Fauci!
[03:22:28.520 --> 03:22:30.520]  There's been a lot of talk
[03:22:30.520 --> 03:22:32.520]  about the Nuremberg Code.
[03:22:32.520 --> 03:22:34.520]  Well, I brought you a copy.
[03:22:34.520 --> 03:22:36.520]  You are all in violation
[03:22:36.520 --> 03:22:38.520]  of section one.
[03:22:38.520 --> 03:22:40.520]  Yes, you, Dr. Wilton,
[03:22:40.520 --> 03:22:42.520]  you are in violation
[03:22:42.520 --> 03:22:44.520]  of the Nuremberg Code.
[03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:46.520]  Nuremberg Code
[03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:48.520]  pushes international law
[03:22:48.520 --> 03:22:50.520]  and the definition
[03:22:50.520 --> 03:22:52.520]  is
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:54.520]  the definition
[03:22:54.520 --> 03:22:56.520]  we shall not be
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:22:58.520]  first.
[03:22:58.520 --> 03:23:00.520]  All of this is coercion.
[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:02.520]  The vaccine passport is coercion
[03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:04.520]  and the penalty for violating
[03:23:04.520 --> 03:23:06.520]  the Nuremberg Code is
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:08.520]  violating the origins of the meeting.
[03:23:08.520 --> 03:23:10.520]  Please take a seat.
[03:23:10.520 --> 03:23:14.520]  Please take a seat.
[03:23:14.520 --> 03:23:16.520]  Matt Baker joins us
[03:23:16.520 --> 03:23:18.520]  for the rest of the hour.
[03:23:18.520 --> 03:23:20.520]  Matt, I tell you,
[03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:22.520]  what a time to be alive, absolute Nuremberg
[03:23:22.520 --> 03:23:24.520]  violation.
[03:23:24.520 --> 03:23:26.520]  The ADL is giving an award to Pfizer
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:28.520]  for their Joseph Mengele
[03:23:28.520 --> 03:23:30.520]  activity. They should create the official
[03:23:30.520 --> 03:23:32.520]  Joseph Mengele appreciation award.
[03:23:32.520 --> 03:23:34.520]  I mean, it's not even a joke.
[03:23:34.520 --> 03:23:36.520]  These people are sick. Matt Baker,
[03:23:36.520 --> 03:23:38.520]  your view on the stone election, the whole world,
[03:23:38.520 --> 03:23:40.520]  is a blessing.
[03:23:40.520 --> 03:23:42.520]  God bless you, brother.
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:44.520]  Your own inspiration.
[03:23:44.520 --> 03:23:46.520]  Are we up?
[03:23:46.520 --> 03:23:48.520]  Yes, sir. You're up.
[03:23:48.520 --> 03:23:50.520]  So, just what do you want to tackle first?
[03:23:50.520 --> 03:23:52.520]  I felt like I was going out to a break there.
[03:23:52.520 --> 03:23:54.520]  No, no, I'm bad about that.
[03:23:54.520 --> 03:23:56.520]  I'm bad about that.
[03:23:56.520 --> 03:23:58.520]  The winds of change are with us, brother.
[03:23:58.520 --> 03:24:00.520]  Well, they are.
[03:24:00.520 --> 03:24:02.520]  I went to this other
[03:24:02.520 --> 03:24:04.520]  school board, no, city council meeting
[03:24:04.520 --> 03:24:06.520]  that is. The board of supervisors
[03:24:06.520 --> 03:24:08.520]  know who is it that
[03:24:08.520 --> 03:24:10.520]  creates the talking points for the board
[03:24:10.520 --> 03:24:12.520]  of supervisors? Because
[03:24:12.520 --> 03:24:14.520]  the board of supervisors out here
[03:24:14.520 --> 03:24:16.520]  in Arizona is almost an exact
[03:24:16.520 --> 03:24:18.520]  clone replica of the
[03:24:18.520 --> 03:24:20.520]  board of supervisors that is in San Diego.
[03:24:20.520 --> 03:24:22.520]  They have the same exact talking
[03:24:22.520 --> 03:24:24.520]  points. They have the same exact agendas.
[03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:26.520]  They're all New World Order agendas.
[03:24:26.520 --> 03:24:28.520]  It's all agenda 23, agenda 21.
[03:24:28.520 --> 03:24:30.520]  It's all implemented by Davos.
[03:24:30.520 --> 03:24:32.520]  Yeah, I
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:34.520]  want to know who it is that's giving these
[03:24:34.520 --> 03:24:36.520]  guys their talking points. You need to go
[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:38.520]  to your local board of supervisors
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:40.520]  and find out
[03:24:40.520 --> 03:24:42.520]  what they're up to, because it can guarantee
[03:24:42.520 --> 03:24:44.520]  you it's not good. These people
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:46.520]  pass every single
[03:24:46.520 --> 03:24:48.520]  thing that's on their agenda. They'll have
[03:24:48.520 --> 03:24:50.520]  a supposedly right-leaning
[03:24:50.520 --> 03:24:52.520]  person and a supposedly left-leaning person
[03:24:52.520 --> 03:24:54.520]  and they'll put things on the agenda
[03:24:54.520 --> 03:24:56.520]  and literally
[03:24:56.520 --> 03:24:58.520]  every single thing they put
[03:24:58.520 --> 03:25:00.520]  on the agenda, they go, okay, anybody
[03:25:00.520 --> 03:25:02.520]  against? No, okay, and the agenda
[03:25:02.520 --> 03:25:04.520]  is literally to a T
[03:25:04.520 --> 03:25:06.520]  every single time. It just goes
[03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:08.520]  just a train of tyranny that
[03:25:08.520 --> 03:25:10.520]  just rolls right through all of our towns
[03:25:10.520 --> 03:25:12.520]  and we don't even know, we don't even realize
[03:25:12.520 --> 03:25:14.520]  what's going on with it.
[03:25:14.520 --> 03:25:16.520]  I think we should get some
[03:25:16.520 --> 03:25:18.520]  biodegradable bullets, you know, because
[03:25:18.520 --> 03:25:20.520]  that would be really helpful
[03:25:20.520 --> 03:25:22.520]  in this situation. You know, I'm just
[03:25:22.520 --> 03:25:24.520]  kidding. Well, expanding on that,
[03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:26.520]  what you get is a central
[03:25:26.520 --> 03:25:28.520]  issue, whether we're
[03:25:28.520 --> 03:25:30.520]  in Australia or the US or Canada
[03:25:30.520 --> 03:25:32.520]  or Europe, it doesn't matter. It's the same
[03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:34.520]  New World Order agenda, the same
[03:25:34.520 --> 03:25:36.520]  talking points, the same program.
[03:25:36.520 --> 03:25:38.520]  It is, man, and you got
[03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:40.520]  to get out there, you got to be part of it. You can't
[03:25:40.520 --> 03:25:42.520]  listen to people who say there's nothing we
[03:25:42.520 --> 03:25:44.520]  can do. You know, look
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:46.520]  at the ripple effect that just a person like
[03:25:46.520 --> 03:25:48.520]  I cause or Alex
[03:25:48.520 --> 03:25:50.520]  Stein, you know, I got to give props to Alex
[03:25:50.520 --> 03:25:52.520]  Stein. He's so hard-working.
[03:25:52.520 --> 03:25:54.520]  He kind of inspired me to
[03:25:54.520 --> 03:25:56.520]  continue on and to find
[03:25:56.520 --> 03:25:58.520]  avenues and things that
[03:25:58.520 --> 03:26:00.520]  you can do. Be like
[03:26:00.520 --> 03:26:02.520]  a lightning rod for the things
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:04.520]  that are happening and changing. So
[03:26:04.520 --> 03:26:06.520]  you become the path of least resistance
[03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:08.520]  and you raise your hand
[03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:10.520]  up and lightning strikes you.
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:12.520]  God moves through you because you're
[03:26:12.520 --> 03:26:14.520]  the path of least resistance
[03:26:14.520 --> 03:26:16.520]  and that's what needs to happen.
[03:26:16.520 --> 03:26:18.520]  And while we are channeling that
[03:26:18.520 --> 03:26:20.520]  energy and while we are becoming
[03:26:20.520 --> 03:26:22.520]  the path of least resistance, we need
[03:26:22.520 --> 03:26:24.520]  to use that energy to resist
[03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:26.520]  the New World Order.
[03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:28.520]  We have to put friction
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:30.520]  on what they're doing.
[03:26:30.520 --> 03:26:32.520]  I was joking with Owen the other day
[03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:34.520]  that it's like Klaus Schwab
[03:26:34.520 --> 03:26:36.520]  is penetrating your
[03:26:36.520 --> 03:26:38.520]  cabinet and what you need to do
[03:26:38.520 --> 03:26:40.520]  is put a little friction
[03:26:40.520 --> 03:26:42.520]  and don't lubricate it
[03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:44.520]  for good old Klaus Schwab in the New World
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:46.520]  Order. We need to stop these
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:48.520]  people at every point, at every
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:50.520]  place, everywhere,
[03:26:50.520 --> 03:26:52.520]  every time and all
[03:26:52.520 --> 03:26:54.520]  the time and that's what we have to do.
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:56.520]  And if I and Alex Stein
[03:26:56.520 --> 03:26:58.520]  can make these giant ripples, just
[03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:00.520]  imagine if there was thousands of us
[03:27:00.520 --> 03:27:02.520]  or millions of us. If every single
[03:27:02.520 --> 03:27:04.520]  person on planet Earth
[03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:06.520]  would just simply gain that
[03:27:06.520 --> 03:27:08.520]  warrior spirit and just everyone
[03:27:08.520 --> 03:27:10.520]  just said, nope, we're not doing that.
[03:27:10.520 --> 03:27:12.520]  All in unison, all at the same time.
[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:14.520]  We wouldn't even be having this conversation.
[03:27:14.520 --> 03:27:16.520]  We'd be down at the river
[03:27:16.520 --> 03:27:18.520]  having a beer and looking
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:20.520]  at the fish chump. But no,
[03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:22.520]  we're not because everybody wants to be
[03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:24.520]  a slave and they want to give in
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:26.520]  and they want to relax and they want to say, there's nothing
[03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:28.520]  we can do, trust the plan. Well,
[03:27:28.520 --> 03:27:30.520]  don't trust the plan. You are the plan.
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:32.520]  You are the plan. You are the
[03:27:32.520 --> 03:27:34.520]  motion. You need to
[03:27:34.520 --> 03:27:36.520]  move, get off your ass,
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:38.520]  go out there and engage
[03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:40.520]  the system.
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:42.520]  Everything they do
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:44.520]  is about getting the individual to not
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:46.520]  engage and to believe your back is broken.
[03:27:46.520 --> 03:27:48.520]  We've gotten Pentagon documents that's hijacked
[03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:50.520]  by the globalists. It's all about breaking
[03:27:50.520 --> 03:27:52.520]  the individual's will and making you think you don't have
[03:27:52.520 --> 03:27:54.520]  power. But because we do have the power.
[03:27:54.520 --> 03:27:56.520]  We absolutely
[03:27:56.520 --> 03:27:58.520]  do. We have the power.
[03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:00.520]  You already have the power. And if anyone
[03:28:00.520 --> 03:28:02.520]  has put that out there, it is you, the great
[03:28:02.520 --> 03:28:04.520]  Alex Jones. I love you, man.
[03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:06.520]  When I saw you in
[03:28:06.520 --> 03:28:08.520]  studio, I gave you that big hug and
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:10.520]  afterwards I was like, man, I should have shook
[03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:12.520]  his hand because he's a Texan, but you know
[03:28:12.520 --> 03:28:14.520]  what, I just love you so much. Hey, I was having to get
[03:28:14.520 --> 03:28:16.520]  my hug. I was running from meeting to meeting.
[03:28:16.520 --> 03:28:18.520]  I wish we could have gone and hung out, man.
[03:28:18.520 --> 03:28:20.520]  I just work like.
[03:28:20.520 --> 03:28:22.520]  You know, everyone's like, man, he's just
[03:28:22.520 --> 03:28:24.520]  under the gun. People don't realize. I mean, Alex
[03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:26.520]  is really in it
[03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:28.520]  to win it. He is on the
[03:28:28.520 --> 03:28:30.520]  on the ship. He is that
[03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:32.520]  Moby Dick. He is the Jonah going
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:34.520]  out for that whale. He is
[03:28:34.520 --> 03:28:36.520]  not going down without a fight.
[03:28:36.520 --> 03:28:38.520]  He's going to stay on board and
[03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:40.520]  man this ship, hopefully to
[03:28:40.520 --> 03:28:42.520]  a brighter horizon. Absolutely. Stay right
[03:28:42.520 --> 03:28:44.520]  there. Let's talk about the election fraud.
[03:28:44.520 --> 03:28:46.520]  Ukraine, the war, the world government,
[03:28:46.520 --> 03:28:48.520]  all of it with Matt Baker trade
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:50.520]  had. Listen, I don't worry about me because I know
[03:28:50.520 --> 03:28:52.520]  we're all under attack. I mean, we're all
[03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:54.520]  in deep trouble.
[03:28:56.520 --> 03:28:58.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always
[03:28:58.520 --> 03:29:00.520]  run the biggest deals of the year
[03:29:00.520 --> 03:29:02.520]  starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[03:29:02.520 --> 03:29:04.520]  But this year is hands down
[03:29:04.520 --> 03:29:06.520]  the biggest sale
[03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:08.520]  we've ever offered. Not just

[03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:14.520]  but on top of it, double
[03:29:14.520 --> 03:29:16.520]  credit points and what makes
[03:29:16.520 --> 03:29:18.520]  this the most special sale ever.
[03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:20.520]  Every order will get a free gift
[03:29:20.520 --> 03:29:22.520]  no matter how small or how big
[03:29:22.520 --> 03:29:24.520]  and it's all randomly selected
[03:29:24.520 --> 03:29:26.520]  by the shopping cart
[03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:28.520]  computer. So you might order a sticker
[03:29:28.520 --> 03:29:30.520]  pack for $5. You might order

[03:29:56.520 --> 03:29:58.520]  It's a post-COVID world
[03:29:58.520 --> 03:30:00.520]  now. Americans have lost
[03:30:00.520 --> 03:30:02.520]  trust in their doctors and the healthcare
[03:30:02.520 --> 03:30:04.520]  system. There's a solution.

[03:30:06.520 --> 03:30:08.520]  McCullough and I'm the chief scientific

[03:30:18.520 --> 03:30:20.520]  community pharmacies, in

[03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:32.520]  medical care, but also
[03:30:32.520 --> 03:30:34.520]  COVID-19, acute
[03:30:34.520 --> 03:30:36.520]  and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine
[03:30:36.520 --> 03:30:38.520]  injury syndromes, and the
[03:30:38.520 --> 03:30:40.520]  array of things that now America
[03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:42.520]  has to work through in this
[03:30:42.520 --> 03:30:44.520]  new world that we're living in.

[03:30:54.520 --> 03:30:56.520]  health.
[03:30:56.520 --> 03:30:58.520]  The tip of the spear throughout
[03:30:58.520 --> 03:31:00.520]  this entire process, the only thing
[03:31:00.520 --> 03:31:02.520]  that made any Republican victories
[03:31:02.520 --> 03:31:04.520]  tonight possible. The only thing that
[03:31:04.520 --> 03:31:06.520]  made any resistance to the war
[03:31:06.520 --> 03:31:08.520]  was machine possible. The only thing
[03:31:08.520 --> 03:31:10.520]  that made any opposition
[03:31:10.520 --> 03:31:12.520]  to the lockdowns and the mask
[03:31:12.520 --> 03:31:14.520]  mandates and the school shutdowns
[03:31:14.520 --> 03:31:16.520]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous
[03:31:16.520 --> 03:31:18.520]  drugs possible, made
[03:31:18.520 --> 03:31:20.520]  any resistance to it possible, was
[03:31:20.520 --> 03:31:22.520]  people continuing to support
[03:31:22.520 --> 03:31:24.520]  infowars, despite the massive
[03:31:24.520 --> 03:31:26.520]  lawfare being waged against infowars,
[03:31:26.520 --> 03:31:28.520]  despite the media defamatory
[03:31:28.520 --> 03:31:30.520]  libelous campaign against
[03:31:30.520 --> 03:31:32.520]  infowars, the ordinary people,
[03:31:32.520 --> 03:31:34.520]  the everyday people that buy products
[03:31:34.520 --> 03:31:36.520]  that make their own lives healthier,
[03:31:36.520 --> 03:31:38.520]  wealthier and wiser is what keeps
[03:31:38.520 --> 03:31:40.520]  infowars on the air and what that
[03:31:40.520 --> 03:31:42.520]  does is keep the populist message
[03:31:42.520 --> 03:31:44.520]  alive in an era and an age
[03:31:44.520 --> 03:31:46.520]  of totalitarian oppression.
[03:31:46.520 --> 03:31:48.520]  So continue to do it, go to places
[03:31:48.520 --> 03:31:50.520]  like infowarsstore.com, go to the places
[03:31:50.520 --> 03:31:52.520]  like Save Infowars, continue
[03:31:52.520 --> 03:31:54.520]  to keep infowars alive because
[03:31:54.520 --> 03:31:56.520]  in the process, you're keeping American
[03:31:56.520 --> 03:32:08.520]  liberty alive.
[03:32:26.520 --> 03:32:28.520]  So many other great products like
[03:32:28.520 --> 03:32:30.520]  Ultimate Crill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil,
[03:32:30.520 --> 03:32:32.520]  Vaso Beats, Secret 12,

[03:32:36.520 --> 03:32:38.520]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out
[03:32:38.520 --> 03:32:40.520]  today, so every hour you wait
[03:32:40.520 --> 03:32:42.520]  more stuff will be sold out

[03:33:20.520 --> 03:33:22.520]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:24.520]  you are the resistance.
[03:33:24.520 --> 03:33:26.520]  Live from the Infowars.com
[03:33:26.520 --> 03:33:30.520]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.520 --> 03:33:32.520]  So, I'm about to tie in
[03:33:32.520 --> 03:33:34.520]  a Ponzi scheme bigger than Bernie
[03:33:34.520 --> 03:33:36.520]  Madoff's, not as big
[03:33:36.520 --> 03:33:38.520]  as Bloomberg's Ponzi schemes
[03:33:38.520 --> 03:33:40.520]  and the Federal Reserve's, but
[03:33:40.520 --> 03:33:42.520]  big.
[03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:44.520]  So, I'm going to give you a look
[03:33:44.520 --> 03:33:48.520]  at that.
[03:33:48.520 --> 03:33:50.520]  Big.
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:52.520]  An FTX to the COVID response.
[03:33:52.520 --> 03:33:54.520]  Now, FTX was only set up
[03:33:54.520 --> 03:33:56.520]  three and a half years ago
[03:33:56.520 --> 03:33:58.520]  by consortium of Federal regulators
[03:33:58.520 --> 03:34:00.520]  and then a bunch of their
[03:34:00.520 --> 03:34:02.520]  children in the Harvard Globalist
[03:34:02.520 --> 03:34:04.520]  Mafia that run so much
[03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:06.520]  of this new world order.
[03:34:06.520 --> 03:34:08.520]  And one of the many things they did
[03:34:08.520 --> 03:34:10.520]  was not just ship millions over
[03:34:10.520 --> 03:34:12.520]  to Ukraine on record, but was also
[03:34:12.520 --> 03:34:14.520]  to put in massive amounts
[03:34:14.520 --> 03:34:16.520]  of money into controlling the
[03:34:16.520 --> 03:34:18.520]  COVID response
[03:34:18.520 --> 03:34:20.520]  and going out and financing studies
[03:34:20.520 --> 03:34:22.520]  to say vitamin D isn't good for you.
[03:34:22.520 --> 03:34:24.520]  Hydroxychloroquine isn't good.
[03:34:24.520 --> 03:34:26.520]  All these other great things
[03:34:26.520 --> 03:34:28.520]  are worthless.
[03:34:28.520 --> 03:34:30.520]  So, here it is, together
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:32.520]  COVID-19, togethertrial.com
[03:34:32.520 --> 03:34:34.520]  Holy
[03:34:34.520 --> 03:34:36.520]  Finance subsidiary
[03:34:36.520 --> 03:34:38.520]  of FTX
[03:34:38.520 --> 03:34:40.520]  and they go into working with
[03:34:40.520 --> 03:34:42.520]  the United Nations and Big Pharma
[03:34:42.520 --> 03:34:44.520]  to be a quote, independent third party
[03:34:44.520 --> 03:34:46.520]  which they're not
[03:34:46.520 --> 03:34:48.520]  to tell you that all of these
[03:34:48.520 --> 03:34:50.520]  therapeutics are
[03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:52.520]  worthless.
[03:34:52.520 --> 03:34:54.520]  Absolutely worthless
[03:34:54.520 --> 03:34:56.520]  even though all the other studies show
[03:34:56.520 --> 03:34:58.520]  the opposite.
[03:34:58.520 --> 03:35:00.520]  Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine
[03:35:00.520 --> 03:35:02.520]  the list goes on and on
[03:35:02.520 --> 03:35:04.520]  says absolutely failed
[03:35:04.520 --> 03:35:06.520]  worthless.
[03:35:06.520 --> 03:35:08.520]  So, making sure people didn't get
[03:35:08.520 --> 03:35:10.520]  therapeutics, making sure
[03:35:10.520 --> 03:35:12.520]  they got things like Rindesivir
[03:35:12.520 --> 03:35:14.520]  didn't help you and killed a third
[03:35:14.520 --> 03:35:16.520]  of the people they were given. So, this guy
[03:35:16.520 --> 03:35:18.520]  just didn't steal billions of dollars
[03:35:18.520 --> 03:35:20.520]  at its peak, 100 billion dollars.
[03:35:20.520 --> 03:35:22.520]  He was worth quote, 16 billion dollars.
[03:35:22.520 --> 03:35:23.520]  Sam
[03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:25.520]  Bankman fried.
[03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:27.520]  No, ladies and gentlemen, he is fried now.
[03:35:27.520 --> 03:35:29.520]  This guy was a
[03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:31.520]  front man for the whole deep state
[03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:33.520]  agenda. It's all tied to the CIA.
[03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:35.520]  You name it. We're going to be getting more
[03:35:35.520 --> 03:35:37.520]  into that coming up in the next hour.
[03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:39.520]  But that's the COVID tie-in
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:41.520]  of what these monsters, these killers,
[03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:43.520]  these hit men
[03:35:43.520 --> 03:35:45.520]  of civilization and our
[03:35:45.520 --> 03:35:47.520]  men, women and children and our old people
[03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:49.520]  are up to
[03:35:49.520 --> 03:35:51.520]  absolutely
[03:35:51.520 --> 03:35:53.520]  disgusting demons.
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:55.520]  They can't help it.
[03:35:55.520 --> 03:35:57.520]  It's what they do.
[03:35:57.520 --> 03:35:59.520]  Here we go again,
[03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:01.520]  ladies and gentlemen, Democrats review push
[03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:03.520]  to enforce COVID masks
[03:36:03.520 --> 03:36:05.520]  wearing as winter nears. We'll get more of that next hour
[03:36:05.520 --> 03:36:07.520]  and all the different newscasts pushing it.
[03:36:07.520 --> 03:36:09.520]  But this is the big news. NBC News
[03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:11.520]  admits anti-vaxxers were right about
[03:36:11.520 --> 03:36:13.520]  COVID shots causing mycorditis.
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:15.520]  They don't deny that it does cause
[03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:17.520]  massive increase of mycorditis, heart
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:19.520]  attacks and death. Big report
[03:36:19.520 --> 03:36:21.520]  by Jamie White with all the studies and documents
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:23.520]  and their admissions on infowars.com.
[03:36:23.520 --> 03:36:25.520]  I suggest you share it.
[03:36:25.520 --> 03:36:27.520]  Coming up next hour, the Tucker Carlson report,
[03:36:27.520 --> 03:36:29.520]  mRNA injections destroy your natural
[03:36:29.520 --> 03:36:31.520]  immunity, causing all
[03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:33.520]  sorts of diseases along with heart problems and blood
[03:36:33.520 --> 03:36:35.520]  clots. Lancet study and other studies prove
[03:36:35.520 --> 03:36:37.520]  mRNA injections are dangerous and
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:39.520]  deadly, which we told you
[03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:41.520]  before they even rolled the shots out
[03:36:41.520 --> 03:36:43.520]  in the middle of 2020.
[03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:45.520]  That's why we're demonized. We do our research.
[03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:47.520]  Here are some of the other articles.
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:49.520]  Poster boy for vaccine campaign
[03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:51.520]  dies suddenly at just
[03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:53.520]  four years old.
[03:36:53.520 --> 03:36:55.520]  He's the national poster boy,
[03:36:55.520 --> 03:36:57.520]  ladies and gentlemen,
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:36:59.520]  a tragic events
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:01.520]  Centino
[03:37:01.520 --> 03:37:03.520]  Godoy Blanco, just four years old
[03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:05.520]  has passed away from
[03:37:05.520 --> 03:37:07.520]  pneumonia, November
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:09.520]  3rd and respiratory problems associated
[03:37:09.520 --> 03:37:11.520]  with this heart, according to multiple sources
[03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:13.520]  and it just goes on
[03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:15.520]  how he was the national
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:17.520]  poster boy
[03:37:17.520 --> 03:37:19.520]  in Argentina for those injections.
[03:37:19.520 --> 03:37:21.520]  Here is another one.
[03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:23.520]  Olympic swimmer 24 injured
[03:37:23.520 --> 03:37:25.520]  by Pfizer coba jab. I couldn't function.
[03:37:25.520 --> 03:37:27.520]  I wanted to end my life.
[03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:31.520]  Genevieve Florence
[03:37:31.520 --> 03:37:33.520]  details how British healthcare system
[03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:35.520]  refused to acknowledge
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:37.520]  vaccine blame, but now they admit
[03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:39.520]  it was the vaccine. She was
[03:37:39.520 --> 03:37:41.520]  paralyzed by it
[03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:43.520]  and it just goes on and on
[03:37:43.520 --> 03:37:45.520]  and on. Here's another one.
[03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:47.520]  28 year old Australian football
[03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:49.520]  player. This is just today.
[03:37:49.520 --> 03:37:51.520]  Heather Anderson has died unexpectedly.
[03:37:53.520 --> 03:37:55.520]  Here's an interesting meme from Twitter.
[03:37:55.520 --> 03:37:57.520]  Stop seeing
[03:37:57.520 --> 03:37:59.520]  you did your research before you got
[03:37:59.520 --> 03:38:01.520]  the injection. You are
[03:38:01.520 --> 03:38:03.520]  the research
[03:38:03.520 --> 03:38:05.520]  and that is absolutely
[03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:07.520]  true. Then we've got all these stacks
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:09.520]  I mentioned. Mass could return
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:11.520]  as LA County sees worrying uptick
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:13.520]  in COVID and RSV infections.
[03:38:13.520 --> 03:38:15.520]  When you die of the shot now they call an RSV infection.
[03:38:15.520 --> 03:38:17.520]  Update
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:19.520]  Toxic vaccine ingredient
[03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:21.520]  SM 102 has
[03:38:21.520 --> 03:38:23.520]  connection to Epstein genome project
[03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:25.520]  and his secret genetic editing projects.
[03:38:27.520 --> 03:38:29.520]  And it goes on and on
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:31.520]  from there. I've got some
[03:38:31.520 --> 03:38:33.520]  nightmare footage I'm going to get to
[03:38:33.520 --> 03:38:35.520]  out of China
[03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:37.520]  that is all coming
[03:38:37.520 --> 03:38:39.520]  up
[03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:41.520]  in the next hour.
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:43.520]  Footage they do not want you to see
[03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:45.520]  that is coming up
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:47.520]  next hour.
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:49.520]  But I wanted to get to together
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:51.520]  trial.com
[03:38:51.520 --> 03:38:53.520]  Together, COVID-19
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:55.520]  this consortium group
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:38:57.520]  22 research sites
[03:38:57.520 --> 03:38:59.520]  8,000 patients
[03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:01.520]  enrolled
[03:39:03.520 --> 03:39:05.520]  and the studies
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:07.520]  funded by FTX
[03:39:07.520 --> 03:39:09.520]  fraudulent
[03:39:09.520 --> 03:39:11.520]  company fraudulent
[03:39:11.520 --> 03:39:13.520]  PCR test
[03:39:13.520 --> 03:39:15.520]  fraudulent studies
[03:39:15.520 --> 03:39:17.520]  fraudulent everything
[03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:19.520]  to come out and tell you
[03:39:19.520 --> 03:39:21.520]  that all
[03:39:21.520 --> 03:39:23.520]  of these so called treatments
[03:39:23.520 --> 03:39:25.520]  and therapeutics are
[03:39:25.520 --> 03:39:27.520]  worthless.
[03:39:29.520 --> 03:39:31.520]  Only Rindesavir is good for you
[03:39:31.520 --> 03:39:33.520]  because it didn't work and it was recommended
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:35.520]  by Fauci. So they're giving their marching orders
[03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:37.520]  they go out they do their studies.
[03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:39.520]  So that's what FTX is doing. They're not just stealing
[03:39:39.520 --> 03:39:41.520]  money from you. They are
[03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:43.520]  killing you.
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:45.520]  So that's all coming up after
[03:39:45.520 --> 03:39:47.520]  MGG who joins this next segment
[03:39:47.520 --> 03:39:49.520]  leaves us we'll be looking at the election
[03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:51.520]  and mail in ballots now to stop
[03:39:51.520 --> 03:39:53.520]  this ongoing
[03:39:53.520 --> 03:39:55.520]  massive fraud
[03:39:55.520 --> 03:39:57.520]  with her
[03:39:57.520 --> 03:39:59.520]  coming up
[03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:01.520]  then I'm going to get into
[03:40:01.520 --> 03:40:03.520]  this situation.
[03:40:03.520 --> 03:40:05.520]  In fact, I see that we have
[03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:07.520]  MGG right now
[03:40:07.520 --> 03:40:09.520]  he's ready to go so
[03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:11.520]  we've got her to the end of the hour but let's do a few minutes right now and
[03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:13.520]  come back to her in the next segment
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:15.520]  we'll have her to the end of the hour. Marjorie Taylor Green
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:17.520]  had such a giant
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:19.520]  tsunami they couldn't steal it from her
[03:40:19.520 --> 03:40:21.520]  but wow they certainly are doing
[03:40:21.520 --> 03:40:23.520]  all over the place. Carrie Lake's calling fraud
[03:40:23.520 --> 03:40:25.520]  we have the cameras going out at key
[03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:27.520]  areas it's all the key battleground
[03:40:27.520 --> 03:40:29.520]  areas MGG great to have you
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:31.520]  with us. Thank you
[03:40:31.520 --> 03:40:33.520]  so much Alex and I'm happy to be on with you
[03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:35.520]  today. We got about two and a half
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:37.520]  minutes to break we'll get the meat potatoes
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:39.520]  next segment but your first response
[03:40:39.520 --> 03:40:41.520]  to what we're witnessing
[03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:43.520]  in Arizona I think we
[03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:45.520]  watched the election be
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:47.520]  stolen slowly stolen day
[03:40:47.520 --> 03:40:49.520]  by day counting these mail
[03:40:49.520 --> 03:40:51.520]  in ballots and it's
[03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:53.520]  absolutely absurd for anyone to
[03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:55.520]  take our election seriously
[03:40:55.520 --> 03:40:57.520]  when we just
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:40:59.520]  it's election month Alex it's not election day
[03:40:59.520 --> 03:41:01.520]  and that's the problem
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:03.520]  and everything changed
[03:41:03.520 --> 03:41:05.520]  after COVID-19 they
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:07.520]  illegally changed state elections
[03:41:07.520 --> 03:41:09.520]  mailing ballots
[03:41:09.520 --> 03:41:11.520]  to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:13.520]  mailing multiple ballots to people
[03:41:13.520 --> 03:41:15.520]  well this isn't any way to run
[03:41:15.520 --> 03:41:17.520]  an election we're in a serious country
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:19.520]  when we have elections that can be stolen
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:21.520]  like this and I believe that
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:23.520]  just like I believe the election was stolen
[03:41:23.520 --> 03:41:25.520]  in 2020 and I have no problem
[03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:27.520]  saying that and it's it is
[03:41:27.520 --> 03:41:29.520]  so absurd for the media and the Democrats
[03:41:29.520 --> 03:41:31.520]  to attack us that that question
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:33.520]  our election integrity and question
[03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:35.520]  the the fact that elections
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:37.520]  shouldn't be run the
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:39.520]  way they are we're not election
[03:41:39.520 --> 03:41:41.520]  deniers we're election realist and we
[03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:43.520]  want to see elections that are done
[03:41:43.520 --> 03:41:45.520]  in such a way where no one can question
[03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:47.520]  them Democrats or Republicans
[03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:49.520]  many Democrats have questioned
[03:41:49.520 --> 03:41:51.520]  elections over the years Hillary
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:53.520]  Clinton Stacey Abrams I mean we
[03:41:53.520 --> 03:41:55.520]  can go down the list even the
[03:41:55.520 --> 03:41:57.520]  press secretary questioned
[03:41:57.520 --> 03:41:59.520]  2018 Stacey Abrams election
[03:41:59.520 --> 03:42:01.520]  in Georgia Kerry Lake is right
[03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:03.520]  to be calling it exactly what it is
[03:42:03.520 --> 03:42:05.520]  election fraud and
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:07.520]  you know the people of Arizona deserve better
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:09.520]  the people of the United States deserve better
[03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:11.520]  in our elections and so until
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:13.520]  everyone is willing to get on the same page
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:15.520]  and and really
[03:42:15.520 --> 03:42:17.520]  work hard to protect our elections
[03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:19.520]  then the same thing will continue
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:21.520]  to keep happening
[03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:23.520]  it makes me question about 2024 now
[03:42:23.520 --> 03:42:25.520]  I agree let's cover the
[03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:27.520]  waterfront when you come back but what
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:29.520]  you say is so central I saw a compilation
[03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:31.520]  video this weekend of dozens of newscast
[03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:33.520]  saying the exact same thing
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:35.520]  it's normal we've always waited weeks
[03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:37.520]  this is the this is the new normal it's
[03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:39.520]  not the new normal
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:41.520]  ladies and gentlemen Margie Taylor Greene
[03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:43.520]  is our guest we're going to look at what's
[03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:45.520]  currently happening 2024
[03:42:45.520 --> 03:42:47.520]  Trump to Sanish
[03:42:47.520 --> 03:42:49.520]  January 6 jam-packed segment
[03:42:49.520 --> 03:42:51.520]  mail-in ballots straight ahead stay with
[03:42:51.520 --> 03:42:53.520]  us
[03:42:57.520 --> 03:42:59.520]  until about 150 years ago cultures
[03:42:59.520 --> 03:43:01.520]  all over the world
[03:43:01.520 --> 03:43:03.520]  believe that people got sick
[03:43:03.520 --> 03:43:05.520]  and died in many cases in the winter
[03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:07.520]  because of something called
[03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:09.520]  vapers they associated
[03:43:09.520 --> 03:43:11.520]  with these poisonous vapers
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:13.520]  with cold weather
[03:43:13.520 --> 03:43:15.520]  of course it wasn't the cold weather
[03:43:15.520 --> 03:43:17.520]  or catching a chill that killed people
[03:43:17.520 --> 03:43:19.520]  what was killing people was a lack
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:21.520]  of vitamin D3
[03:43:21.520 --> 03:43:23.520]  you see the sun
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:25.520]  via your skin helps your body
[03:43:25.520 --> 03:43:27.520]  produce vitamin D3
[03:43:27.520 --> 03:43:29.520]  but if you're not getting enough sun
[03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:31.520]  you will not produce vitamin D3
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:33.520]  and then it's very easy for viruses
[03:43:33.520 --> 03:43:35.520]  and other things to start replicating and taking
[03:43:35.520 --> 03:43:37.520]  your body over so now it's more important
[03:43:37.520 --> 03:43:39.520]  because the winter is here
[03:43:39.520 --> 03:43:41.520]  to take high quality vitamin D3
[03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:43.520]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3

[03:43:57.520 --> 03:43:59.520]  so when I first started taking
[03:43:59.520 --> 03:44:01.520]  survival skills basically I was
[03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:03.520]  275 pounds overweight
[03:44:03.520 --> 03:44:05.520]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe
[03:44:05.520 --> 03:44:07.520]  I went on to a job and I heard
[03:44:07.520 --> 03:44:09.520]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it
[03:44:09.520 --> 03:44:11.520]  so the first one I got was the original
[03:44:11.520 --> 03:44:13.520]  survival shield the X1 and it worked
[03:44:13.520 --> 03:44:15.520]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter
[03:44:15.520 --> 03:44:17.520]  you came out with that stew you had with a
[03:44:17.520 --> 03:44:19.520]  deep burn source you know and I got really
[03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:21.520]  excited about that so I took it and man
[03:44:21.520 --> 03:44:23.520]  in two weeks I went from brain fog
[03:44:23.520 --> 03:44:25.520]  to like literally like my brain
[03:44:25.520 --> 03:44:27.520]  was enlightened you know I could think
[03:44:27.520 --> 03:44:29.520]  again I could connect with people again
[03:44:29.520 --> 03:44:31.520]  and over the course of the next couple
[03:44:31.520 --> 03:44:33.520]  of years I got my health back
[03:44:33.520 --> 03:44:35.520]  I could literally take basically all of your
[03:44:35.520 --> 03:44:37.520]  supplements they're all absolutely amazing
[03:44:37.520 --> 03:44:37.520]  supplements
[03:44:37.520 --> 03:44:39.520]  the one I like recently was
[03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:41.520]  knock out literally like if you want
[03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:43.520]  to sleep just take it it's amazing it works
[03:44:43.520 --> 03:44:45.520]  but anyway so the point is we have to
[03:44:45.520 --> 03:44:47.520]  get ourselves clean we have to break free
[03:44:47.520 --> 03:44:49.520]  of the globalist system and the only way
[03:44:49.520 --> 03:44:51.520]  to do that is to take our own health
[03:44:51.520 --> 03:44:53.520]  into our own hands beautifully said brother
[03:44:53.520 --> 03:44:55.520]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed
[03:44:55.520 --> 03:44:57.520]  Thanksgiving
[03:44:57.520 --> 03:44:59.520]  2022 is here
[03:44:59.520 --> 03:45:01.520]  we got the biggest sale of the year going
[03:45:01.520 --> 03:45:07.280]  Now the good news is I'm gonna extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas
[03:45:07.280 --> 03:45:11.880]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out
[03:45:11.880 --> 03:45:13.920]  We won't get more for months and months and months
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:18.520]  So now is the time to take action to support the info war and get the biggest sales of the year
[03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:24.400]  We've already sold out of x2 and x3 and bio true selenium and our wake-up America award-winning coffee

[03:45:55.320 --> 03:45:59.400]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:06.800]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit
[03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:11.480]  The first amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:16.480]  So they're gonna go from Mike Lindell next or they're gonna go for Steve Bannon or gonna go for Tucker Carlson
[03:46:16.480 --> 03:46:19.440]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on there 28 years
[03:46:19.440 --> 03:46:23.680]  And I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere
[03:46:23.680 --> 03:46:28.960]  But I couldn't have done it without your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet
[03:46:28.960 --> 03:46:33.080]  Not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda
[03:46:33.080 --> 03:46:38.680]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support
[03:46:38.680 --> 03:46:45.080]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now the critical juncture of the battle free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com

[03:46:52.440 --> 03:46:54.440]  I thank you all for your support
[03:46:54.440 --> 03:47:22.440]  And I thank you all for your support leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:25.440 --> 03:47:34.440]  MTG has been really scared. It's why they demonize her and lie about her despite all their fraud in Georgia
[03:47:34.440 --> 03:47:41.440]  And we know it went on the evidence is coming out. She won by 66% 33% extra
[03:47:41.440 --> 03:47:51.440]  They are so scared of her only massive tsunamis only red waves can stop the fraud she overwhelmed the algorithms
[03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:58.440]  And remember Mark Elias Hillary Clinton's lawyer ran around the country but mainly targeted her to try to stop her from being able to run
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:04.440]  So if you want to know they'll still elections they try to stop our most popular candidates for running or running for reelection
[03:48:04.440 --> 03:48:12.440]  These people in my view are criminals who were talking during the break you were making points for we went to break about the mail-in ballots
[03:48:12.440 --> 03:48:17.440]  About what we just witnessed and what Americans have to do MTG lay it on us
[03:48:17.440 --> 03:48:26.440]  Well what we're seeing right now is unbelievable and I can't I can't imagine that people sit on the sidelines and just allow this to continue
[03:48:26.440 --> 03:48:34.440]  Here's the problem Alex is we have to look not only at this election we have to look at 2020s election and we have to think forward to 2024
[03:48:34.440 --> 03:48:40.440]  And in order to win elections our elections have to be secure and voters have to be confident in the process
[03:48:40.440 --> 03:48:47.440]  But voters are not confident in the process when ballots just get continued to be counted slowly every single day
[03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:57.440]  And then you watch a strong Republican candidate like Kerry Lake lose day after day and lose and then to the point where the media finally calls it
[03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:03.440]  For the Democrat candidate and here in California we're watching elections be slowly counted and slowly counted
[03:49:03.440 --> 03:49:12.440]  This is this is worse than a third world country we're the laughing stock of the world that's what our elections are and our enemies know it
[03:49:12.440 --> 03:49:19.440]  And we're being played and the American people deserve better here's why Alex the taxpayers pay for the elections they pay for the ballots
[03:49:19.440 --> 03:49:26.440]  They pay for the people that work the elections they pay for the machines they pay for all of it and so they're the customer
[03:49:26.440 --> 03:49:36.440]  So the taxpayers and the voters they deserve better they deserve voter ID we should have same day one day elections not election months
[03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:46.440]  Not where it drags out over and over and over mail in ballots should be reduced drastically only to certain emergent emergency scenarios
[03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:56.440]  And we should have voter ID voter ID only citizens can vote these are easy fixes that would make elections secure and give voters confidence
[03:49:56.440 --> 03:50:03.440]  That's what we should care about is voter confidence and until that happens we're going to continue to have real problems
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:12.440]  And we've been warned about it over and over President Trump has talked about it nonstop for nearly two years now and he's right to do so
[03:50:12.440 --> 03:50:20.440]  But guess what some of the Democrats they have talked about election fraud they have talked about stolen elections and Democrats will do anything
[03:50:20.440 --> 03:50:26.440]  They'll they'll try to take people like me off the ballot through lawsuits and that's what you were talking about just a moment ago
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:33.440]  But it is a very real issue and it's something that I'm concerned about and I will continue to fight for it
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:42.440]  We're fighting up here in Washington DC. Let me tell you something that is very possible and I'm very concerned about it
[03:50:42.440 --> 03:50:49.440]  We don't even know how many seats we are going to hopefully win the majority with we may have 219 seats
[03:50:49.440 --> 03:50:58.440]  You see we have we need 218 to be the majority but if we have such a razor thin razor thin majority like that
[03:50:58.440 --> 03:51:09.440]  The Democrats can possibly choose a speaker by pulling away a few Republicans to vote with them for one speaker that they can all tolerate and get along with
[03:51:09.440 --> 03:51:17.440]  Well let me tell you something Alex the most important thing that Republicans need we need the gavel and we need subpoena power
[03:51:17.440 --> 03:51:26.440]  We need subpoena power because without subpoena power we cannot hold these traders accountable for all of the corruption that they have been doing to the American people
[03:51:26.440 --> 03:51:34.440]  For the past two years the pina power can only come if Republicans choose the speaker and I'll tell you right now
[03:51:34.440 --> 03:51:41.440]  There's talks going on with the very moderate Republicans in our conference of speaking with the Democrats
[03:51:41.440 --> 03:51:50.440]  There was one particular congressman Don Bacon that actually told a reporter last night that he would consider working with the Democrats to choose a speaker
[03:51:50.440 --> 03:51:57.440]  And that's something that should terrify every single American you know the next two years where we don't have the White House
[03:51:57.440 --> 03:52:06.440]  The next two years we do not control the Senate the next two years we're going to have a razor thin razor thin majority of Republican controlled house
[03:52:06.440 --> 03:52:13.440]  And that's why we have to be unified behind a speaker just our speaker so we have subpoena power
[03:52:13.440 --> 03:52:17.440]  And that's what this is all about subpoena power and we've got to control the purse strings
[03:52:17.440 --> 03:52:27.440]  Absolutely and we need the house to be able to start the indictment process for impeachment of Biden who certainly deserves it for open borders
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:30.440]  For Ukraine, for Hunter Biden and all the things they're doing
[03:52:30.440 --> 03:52:36.440]  What do you make separately of the attempt to drive a wedge by corporate media between Trump and DeSantis
[03:52:36.440 --> 03:52:40.440]  What do you make of that whole attempted civil war they're trying to kick off
[03:52:40.440 --> 03:52:48.440]  Well I have to give you props Alex you were right all along this is a war of information it's the information war
[03:52:48.440 --> 03:52:56.440]  And I love to say it Alex Jones is right and you have been right on that and Republicans we are constantly losing this war
[03:52:56.440 --> 03:53:04.440]  You know there's so many donors Republican donors donate hundreds of millions of dollars that go to organizations and PACs and places all over the country
[03:53:04.440 --> 03:53:11.440]  But they never fight the war of information they never fight the left the left controls the media and when the left controls the media
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:19.440]  They control the narrative and you can see that their media is very powerful and they beat up Republican candidates every single election cycle
[03:53:19.440 --> 03:53:25.440]  I get smeared and lied about every single day in the news I get vilified every single day in the news
[03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:34.440]  When if they actually talk to me and knew what I'm about and who I am as a person they could never say those things about me but they control the media
[03:53:34.440 --> 03:53:41.440]  What we have to do is we have to fight smarter Alex we need to declare war on the media that's called control
[03:53:41.440 --> 03:53:46.440]  I totally agree you've got to go early because your vote just got called but the minute that we have left
[03:53:46.440 --> 03:53:56.440]  This FTX, sham, bankman fried all this stuff we now know is a Democrat money laundering slush fund funding their operations siphoning money off
[03:53:56.440 --> 03:54:05.440]  If the Republicans take the house are you going to call for committee hearings and investigation into them and their money laundering slush fund of FTX to Ukraine
[03:54:05.440 --> 03:54:10.440]  And the 50 million they gave the Democrats in this election cycle
[03:54:10.440 --> 03:54:20.440]  Absolutely Alex and that's why I am going to vote for Kevin McCarthy for speaker because we need the gavel to have subpoena power in order to do just that
[03:54:20.440 --> 03:54:30.440]  Those things are outrageous that is American taxpayer dollars that was supposed to be aid to Ukraine that clearly went into the cyber investment program
[03:54:30.440 --> 03:54:40.440]  And this went into this you know it's outrageous we have got to hold those people accountable I want an audit of every single penny that has gone to Ukraine
[03:54:40.440 --> 03:54:48.440]  But in order to do that we have to have the gavel and we have to have subpoena power that's the most important thing that I can express to people
[03:54:48.440 --> 03:54:57.440]  We can we could choose any speaker we want and we could fight for these conservative outlines and policies that I absolutely adore
[03:54:57.440 --> 03:55:05.440]  But we can't get anything done over the next two years we've got to have the gavel we've got to have and that's why Tucker said on them accountable
[03:55:05.440 --> 03:55:13.440]  I agree that's what Tucker said on the eve of the election they've got to steal it because they're cornered rats the good news is humanity's waking up populism is exploding
[03:55:13.440 --> 03:55:17.440]  MTG thank you so much for joining us so go get that vote done
[03:55:17.440 --> 03:55:19.440]  Okay thank you yeah
[03:55:19.440 --> 03:55:26.440]  All right there she goes ladies and gentlemen wow and she'll be in studio with us hopefully very very soon what a great lady
[03:55:26.440 --> 03:55:36.440]  All right we're going to start the next hour and I'm going to then take my time getting into the model of the new covid roll out the new lockdowns
[03:55:36.440 --> 03:55:44.440]  Biden's planning it's admitted now it's it's about to go down and but we have the public waking up we can stop it we can do it together
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:55.440]  Now with the globalist planning to do new covid lockdowns and new covid hysteria and new fear it is so important God knows what they're going to release or what they're going to pull
