[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:37.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.080 --> 00:44.320]  well Syria has accepted Russian weapons proposal and Obama is now revising his
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.440]  address to the nation they are defusing the attempt to start a larger
[00:49.440 --> 00:53.960]  regional war and coming up we've got a clip from that Charlie Rose interview
[00:53.960 --> 00:58.920]  where Assad says look I don't want to start another crazy war and when you
[00:58.920 --> 01:01.880]  basically do this it's gonna set off the whole region and that's what he keeps
[01:01.880 --> 01:05.800]  alluding to when he talks about yeah there could be a chemical attack the
[01:05.800 --> 01:09.520]  extremists could get the chemicals and then the media spins it Assad's
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.320]  threatening a chemical attack now to be fair I think when he talked about 9-11
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.360]  that was open-ended both ways we're talking about rebels but also other
[01:18.360 --> 01:25.600]  parties in the region IE Iran but this is really good news and it means that
[01:25.600 --> 01:29.520]  Obama cannot divert everybody that's when you get a war is when all the
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.200]  interests line up military-industrial complex wants a war for more weapons
[01:33.200 --> 01:39.680]  sales and to break older stuff they sold all parties you've got France needs a
[01:39.680 --> 01:42.400]  political diversion that's why they're cheerleading more than anybody other than
[01:42.400 --> 01:48.240]  Obama elements in Israel of the Likudniks they want to be able to grab
[01:48.240 --> 01:52.640]  more of Syria during a breakup of the country from the Golan and beyond what
[01:52.640 --> 01:58.160]  they already have you've got the globalists that don't want any sovereign
[01:58.160 --> 02:00.920]  nation operating they don't control they want to be able to come in and
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.080]  destroy the country and then get it all basically into deep debt and there's a
[02:05.080 --> 02:10.920]  lot of other interests that that fit into this but domestically there is the
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.360]  seven big scandals and Obamacare is I think the big one really starting to
[02:15.360 --> 02:19.040]  hit people the folks out there are really finding out how big the betrayal
[02:19.040 --> 02:23.960]  was that's what Obamacare was always set to come in after Obama had won
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.520]  reelection because they knew what was going to happen but this backlash is
[02:28.520 --> 02:35.120]  massive and if the Republicans cannot repeal it why do we even have two
[02:35.120 --> 02:39.320]  parties why not just have one fascist party and I think you're gonna see a
[02:39.320 --> 02:45.480]  lot of neocon Republicans thrown out in next year's 2014 elections and 2014 is
[02:45.480 --> 02:49.880]  Matt Drudge and many others have said is key we need to get real tea party
[02:49.880 --> 02:56.160]  libertarian Rand Paul Ted Cruz type people in by the dozens more and it's
[02:56.160 --> 03:00.540]  over I mean they can then put out real policies that made this country gray
[03:00.540 --> 03:06.160]  reverse the kleptocracy that's wrecking the nation to then basically loot it and
[03:06.160 --> 03:13.640]  basically use us up it like like scrap metal or like derelict hunters this is
[03:13.640 --> 03:18.480]  the vulture capitalist economy that's the opposite of free market and so we're
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.200]  going to be breaking all that down today and opening the phones up for the
[03:23.200 --> 03:27.920]  entire broadcast to the last 30 minutes when Nicholas winded reffin
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.680]  director of only God forgives comes on the broadcast because I thought it was a
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.760]  good movie and I I think I got it not that I'm a smart guy it was
[03:38.760 --> 03:43.040]  blaringly obvious but no one seems to know what the movie means so we're gonna
[03:43.040 --> 03:49.080]  get the director on today and we're going to see if I'm right about my
[03:49.080 --> 03:54.200]  breakdown of the film which is really about good and evil and about how good
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.280]  can be incredibly more vicious than even evil thinks it can be and then it's
[03:59.280 --> 04:04.120]  about someone choosing to be good but also having a personal sacrifice of you
[04:04.120 --> 04:11.040]  can't just repent and then I actually put something into it and the police
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.400]  captain person's almost like an angel who you know is there a visiting
[04:16.400 --> 04:23.680]  destruction down and he means obviously psychic it's it's kind of like
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.120]  almost like the shining where they've got the telekinesis connection the old
[04:29.120 --> 04:32.960]  black guy and a little white kid I mean that's what I picked it's completely
[04:32.960 --> 04:39.120]  obvious and and I'm literally no pundit no reviewer got it so I wanted to get
[04:39.120 --> 04:41.800]  the director on I haven't talked to him yet he's coming on we'll see if I'm
[04:41.800 --> 04:48.120]  right so that is coming up in the last 30 minutes or so of the transmission by
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.800]  the way we broke this a week and a half ago I'm not bragging it's just a fact
[04:51.800 --> 04:56.200]  McClatchy's now picked it up intercepts caught Assad rejecting requests to use

[08:16.960 --> 08:21.120]  GCN radio network
[08:35.360 --> 08:40.160]  the Associated Press is reporting that Syria says it has accepted Russian
[08:40.160 --> 08:46.880]  weapons proposal Syria said Tuesday it has accepted Russia's proposal to place
[08:46.880 --> 08:51.720]  its chemical weapons under international control or subsequent dismantling
[08:51.720 --> 08:58.880]  Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Malim said Tuesday after meeting with Russian
[08:58.880 --> 09:05.560]  Parliament Speaker that his government quickly agreed to the Russian initiative
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.720]  his statements sounded more definitive than his remarks Monday when he said
[09:12.720 --> 09:17.080]  that Damascus welcomed Russia's initiative meanwhile Russia's Foreign
[09:17.080 --> 09:21.840]  Minister said today that Russia is now working with Syria to prepare a detailed
[09:21.840 --> 09:28.000]  plan of action which will be presented shortly and of course Assad said in his
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.160]  Charlie Rose interview and they've said it in press releases from the government
[09:33.160 --> 09:40.960]  will do anything to avoid another crazy war and then we're gonna play this clip
[09:40.960 --> 09:46.720]  coming up and then Rose the Bilderberg trilateral Commission CFR member
[09:46.720 --> 09:54.160]  globalist comes back Charlie Rhodes and says Charlie Rose comes back and says
[09:54.160 --> 10:06.560]  well so so you know you aren't concerned about the ramifications of an
[10:06.560 --> 10:12.160]  attack and he says look it's about the entire region it's not about Assad it's
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.800]  not about me and see that's the psychology the media always uses look at
[10:16.800 --> 10:22.120]  this big powerful guy he's bad he's killing his own people we need to go in
[10:22.120 --> 10:27.080]  there and destroy him and what they actually destroy is the people and almost
[10:27.080 --> 10:37.760]  three years ago almost three years ago if you go back this whole war started
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.360]  with the West starting it and I know I've talked about that at nauseam it's
[10:41.360 --> 10:47.160]  just amazing to watch the establishment media the state-run media sit up there
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.160]  on television and in print and and all over the internet saying we've got to do
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.360]  something look what Assad's done look what his regime has done he's so terrible
[10:57.360 --> 11:01.640]  look at the horrible things he's done and then never having any evidence of
[11:01.640 --> 11:09.200]  what you've got is Turkey Israel Jordan Saudi Arabia Qatar US troops training
[11:09.200 --> 11:16.120]  extremists and mercenaries out of Iraq ganging up from every angle you can
[11:16.120 --> 11:21.200]  imagine French special forces the list goes on and on to attack this country
[11:21.200 --> 11:27.960]  and it is an incredible spectacle to behold an incredible war crime and so
[11:27.960 --> 11:35.120]  what the United Nations really wants to do here is set the precedent that they
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.520]  can come into any country they want that has any type of weapons systems and
[11:39.520 --> 11:45.800]  call them WMDs and then dismantle that country's infrastructure Iraq was
[11:45.800 --> 11:53.560]  under sanctions from 1990 until just a few years ago oh yeah even after the
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.240]  liberation it was still under controls of what could go into the country so the
[11:57.240 --> 12:01.080]  select corporations that the inside track could go in and charge exorbitant
[12:01.080 --> 12:04.480]  prices for everything and they wouldn't even let them have dental equipment or
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.680]  the tubing for the water hoses you know to clean out people's mouths or or or
[12:09.680 --> 12:14.880]  novocaine or chlorine for their water supply because you know it could be used
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.080]  in chemical weapons production and that's why you had an industrialized
[12:19.080 --> 12:27.040]  society whose population had more than tripled since the 1930s if you look up
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.080]  the numbers where you had millions of people die because they became a post
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.120]  industrial nation without electricity without clean water without medicine
[12:37.120 --> 12:42.880]  can you imagine the United States if we lost all of that the hell on earth that
[12:42.880 --> 12:46.360]  would be caused that's why there's a congressional report put out last year
[12:46.360 --> 12:57.000]  and another one this year predicting 90% casualties in North America if there was
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.480]  a EMP blast that knocked out most the electrical systems and by the way it
[13:01.480 --> 13:04.560]  doesn't just have to be an EMP blast from some foreign country or the
[13:04.560 --> 13:08.560]  globalist it could be a giant solar flare knocking them out that that's a
[13:08.560 --> 13:13.320]  congressional report can you imagine if we ever get hit by one of those solar
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.560]  flares that they estimate hit us about every hundred years or so the last time
[13:18.560 --> 13:22.360]  it happened it knocked out most of the electrical systems across the United
[13:22.360 --> 13:26.280]  States but only a few cities actually had it and I'm not even saying that's
[13:26.280 --> 13:30.960]  going to happen my point is the globalists come in and basically visit
[13:30.960 --> 13:36.280]  this on Libya visit this type of thing on Iraq and now they're visiting it for
[13:36.280 --> 13:43.840]  almost three years on Syria and it is a ultra massive war crime of biblical
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.680]  level proportions
[13:51.200 --> 13:55.840]  and the people are waking up to the fact that it's a war crime across the
[13:55.840 --> 14:01.880]  political spectrum and that's good news sadly though this still only creates
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.920]  more division I don't think people should see themselves as black or white or
[14:06.920 --> 14:11.920]  as German or Chinese or Jewish or Mexican it's fine to like your culture
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.120]  your heritage and the political correct groups want you to get rid of your
[14:15.120 --> 14:18.880]  heritage and adopt globalism but I think everybody should keep their heritage
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.400]  but also try to adopt the heritage of liberty and freedom and due process and
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.640]  organize ourselves collectively into that mindset because humans will organize
[14:29.640 --> 14:32.840]  themselves collectively and the globalists want to collectively organize
[14:32.840 --> 14:40.200]  us into scientific balkanization and division held together by globalism and
[14:40.200 --> 14:45.200]  a synthetic plastic dead culture
[14:50.720 --> 14:59.520]  and it's very very sad an example of this is I don't like the policies that
[14:59.520 --> 15:08.960]  Israel has to try to break up its neighbors so that it can then control
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.720]  ethnically subdivided substates and that's the official Israeli policy by
[15:13.720 --> 15:19.440]  the current power structure there is to break Syria up in three to four pieces
[15:19.440 --> 15:26.800]  two pieces of that's all they can get and basically take more of the Golan
[15:26.800 --> 15:35.760]  Heights down into the plains and down into the rich water rich and natural
[15:35.760 --> 15:41.440]  gas rich areas and so when I state the admitted Israeli policy we get emails we
[15:41.440 --> 15:47.960]  see comments on info wars.com you're just anti-submitting which is just a
[15:47.960 --> 15:55.000]  political tool I mean that's immoral to just throw that out there just like
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.640]  when you say oh I don't like Obama's government-run healthcare I don't like
[15:58.640 --> 16:02.800]  Obama increasing taxes on poor people I don't like Obama invoking racial
[16:02.800 --> 16:06.320]  division I don't like Obama trying to come after our guns people say well
[16:06.320 --> 16:09.920]  you're a racist that's what political correctness is to end any type of
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.760]  debate now conversely I'm between a rock and a hard place because this world
[16:16.760 --> 16:26.640]  always tries to force people into a camp that's the name of the game and the
[16:26.640 --> 16:31.720]  people that hate Israel have become radicalized to where if you're not
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.280]  wearing a Nazi uniform you're not cool and I've seen this process happen and
[16:37.280 --> 16:40.680]  it's been pushed by big foundations and the globalists are heavily involved in
[16:40.680 --> 16:46.480]  it and there's this religion of hating Jews and a religion of saying everyone's
[16:46.480 --> 16:51.040]  Jewish I'm Jewish Warren Buffett's Jewish anybody that knows how to tie their
[16:51.040 --> 16:55.160]  shoelaces must be Jewish if you've ever been successful or written a good book
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.000]  or made a film you're secretly Jewish no one's allowed to be successful unless
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.760]  you're Jewish blah blah blah I'm funded by Israel totally untrue just so people
[17:04.760 --> 17:09.680]  can feel good about themselves it's tribalism and say everybody else is
[17:09.680 --> 17:13.960]  bad so I don't like what Israel's doing I'm a real critic of a lot of the things
[17:13.960 --> 17:20.520]  Israel does and we're continually anti-war and then there's this mental
[17:20.520 --> 17:27.320]  illness of running around in circles saying you know Alex Jones they ain't
[17:27.320 --> 17:34.520]  any boo boo Alex Jones you know is a Zionist hill which tends to then drive
[17:34.520 --> 17:39.600]  someone the other direction because it's I mean it's bad to be a thinker it's bad
[17:39.600 --> 17:43.640]  to try to really be fair it's bad to address things on actual issues and
[17:43.640 --> 17:49.320]  not from a hateful perspective I mean the last place I want to be is with the
[17:49.320 --> 17:55.240]  crazy anti-Israel crowd that spends their entire life obsessing over Israel
[17:55.240 --> 17:58.720]  exaggerating you know where I could appear and I say well you got a lot of
[17:58.720 --> 18:01.320]  interest that want to you know break up Syria you got the military industrial
[18:01.320 --> 18:05.920]  complex you got the big megabanks you've got France wants a diversion Obama
[18:05.920 --> 18:09.440]  wants to divert from all these scandals I mean his own pundits are admitting
[18:09.440 --> 18:14.400]  that Saudi Arabia is the big driver paying for it because they're Sunni and
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.840]  they have a Sunni Empire it's 80% of Islam and so historically they kill
[18:18.840 --> 18:22.760]  each other even more than they kill outside groups that's a geopolitical
[18:22.760 --> 18:27.800]  historical fact and then Israel wants to break up the country as well and get
[18:27.800 --> 18:32.080]  rid of one of their old enemies and it's very immoral to the people living there
[18:32.080 --> 18:37.600]  to start this war and to work with al-Qaeda and Israel admits they've got a
[18:37.600 --> 18:41.240]  policy of destroying one enemy with another enemy but but again Israel
[18:41.240 --> 18:45.360]  needs to have the high ground don't they have not working with al-Qaeda and then
[18:45.360 --> 18:48.760]  our government's also using al-Qaeda the threat of al-Qaeda to take our liberties
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.440]  so there's all these interests and then people sit there and freak out over it
[18:52.440 --> 18:57.560]  going no there's Israel and that's it and if Israel didn't exist the world
[18:57.560 --> 19:04.120]  would be milk and honey everybody would be you know living in heaven really there

[24:28.240 --> 24:34.200]  if we have an outside enemy and the problem is nine times out of ten the
[24:34.200 --> 24:40.360]  globalist literally the very same mega banks that funded Napoleon and the
[24:40.360 --> 24:46.760]  British 200 years ago the very same families if you go look up the names
[24:46.760 --> 24:54.080]  are busy financing both sides of every war and the public is starting to get
[24:54.080 --> 24:59.400]  their mind around this and the globalist at its heart this is about
[24:59.400 --> 25:04.600]  world government out of all the interest Syria is about world government
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.800]  it's about mopping up the few rogue countries that are left putting them
[25:08.800 --> 25:13.640]  under bank or control so the public can be forced to take vaccines forced to have
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.200]  their families broken up forced to teach kindergartners how to have sex that's
[25:18.200 --> 25:23.200]  why from Australia to Germany to the US from Israel to many areas of Eastern
[25:23.200 --> 25:27.920]  Europe to Africa the Central Africa its standardized sitcoms its standardized
[25:27.920 --> 25:34.440]  dramas funded by the UN through Hollywood and other groups to create this
[25:34.440 --> 25:40.280]  anti-human agenda and that's what this is about I mean I have a stack of news
[25:40.280 --> 25:45.200]  here about white people being beaten to death all over the United States and
[25:45.200 --> 25:51.440]  what do you think movies like Django and machete and and and all this race war
[25:51.440 --> 25:56.160]  stuff is going to do and most the time because it's politically incorrect when
[25:56.160 --> 25:59.920]  a black person shoots or kills a white person because they're white the media
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.040]  reporters have come out in the shed we've been told not to even say the race
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.120]  a lot of times you'll hear we're looking for a man believed to be over 30
[26:08.120 --> 26:12.640]  wearing a red shirt and it won't say what race the person is and you can
[26:12.640 --> 26:19.520]  always bet it means they're black because it's it's such mind control that
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.240]  you can't even say that but see the tipping points hit there as well why did
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.080]  the clan go around routinely murdering black people because they've been taught
[26:28.080 --> 26:34.360]  they're bad they're evil they're out to get you it's tribalism humans are
[26:34.360 --> 26:41.120]  exactly the same folks is different color skin basically and they would go up
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.840]  until the public said Christians said this is wrong this shouldn't be done
[26:45.840 --> 26:53.840]  we're gonna stand up against this now instead the media is there to cover up
[26:53.840 --> 26:59.880]  the lynching by gun and by fist and by brick just like Reginald Denny got his
[26:59.880 --> 27:08.920]  face bashed in where he looked like the kid from mask true story because I mean
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.480]  here does bus riders face smashed in during hate attack and of course that's
[27:13.480 --> 27:18.280]  in Harlem where you don't have or you know where you don't have a right to
[27:18.280 --> 27:22.680]  Second Amendment I mean I can hold my own folks but nowadays somebody comes up
[27:22.680 --> 27:26.680]  wanting to bash my head in I still got out shoot them and it's like shouldn't
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.040]  bring your fist to a gunfight shouldn't bring your knife to a gunfight I mean I
[27:31.040 --> 27:34.760]  got things to do I'm just gonna kill you you try to kill me I'm gonna kill you I
[27:34.760 --> 27:41.080]  don't care what color you are and bus riders face smashed in during hate
[27:41.080 --> 27:48.400]  attack in Harlem reportedly yelling cracker as he beat the man's face in but
[27:48.400 --> 27:54.000]  don't worry the cracker is dead the Union Square I hate white people
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.280]  beating victim dies at Bellevue Hospital and let's show people up if they're
[27:59.280 --> 28:03.760]  watching on TV the evil photograph of the white man so don't worry he's dead
[28:03.760 --> 28:09.120]  now doesn't he look threatening and bad I mean he's white he must be bad he you
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.120]  know he's an Arab he must be bad that you know that's kind of the thing here
[28:12.120 --> 28:15.320]  when we're bombing the Middle East well there are just kill him so what if we
[28:15.320 --> 28:20.120]  have a half million Iraqi children in the first ten years of sanctions that
[28:20.120 --> 28:23.760]  died on record Madeline Albright says it's a good price to pay I mean their
[28:23.760 --> 28:29.520]  Arabs and you know God forbid the Arabs ever try to have a secular government
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.480]  and movie theaters and shopping malls they'll just be overthrown God forbid
[28:33.480 --> 28:37.480]  you ever try to build resorts and invite Europeans and folks in you know from
[28:37.480 --> 28:41.680]  Europe to come to your Syrian beaches we'll just blow those up we'll just
[28:41.680 --> 28:44.800]  ship a couple hundred thousand al Qaeda and we'll call them protesters on the
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.880]  news the globalist want divide and conquer they want command destruction
[28:50.880 --> 28:56.760]  they want chaos worldwide so they can then offer the solution order out of
[28:56.760 --> 29:01.800]  chaos is the new world order's motto and man I'm seeing articles ladies and
[29:01.800 --> 29:07.280]  gentlemen every day now or white people are being killed because they're white
[29:07.280 --> 29:15.760]  and you notice there's no there's no white Jesse Jackson out there to run
[29:15.760 --> 29:21.200]  around you know talking about it because that's not the game plan the game
[29:21.200 --> 29:26.920]  plan is that you guilt the majority group into signing on to socialism and
[29:26.920 --> 29:30.560]  centralization and political correctness by telling them they're racist all day
[29:30.560 --> 29:34.480]  while telling all the other groups that they should unify themselves racially
[29:34.480 --> 29:38.920]  and go after white people then white people run to the state and the police
[29:38.920 --> 29:43.600]  as their savior you understand how that works the globalist want everything to
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.200]  be racially based all right big breaking news coming up on the serious

[33:09.560 --> 33:14.640]  GCN radio network
[33:14.640 --> 33:31.920]  so the good news is the Russians about a year ago moved in troops to the couple
[33:31.920 --> 33:36.440]  bases that have the legal and lawful chemical weapons stored in them inside
[33:36.440 --> 33:42.440]  Syria and now the Russians are officially going to oversee and invite the
[33:42.440 --> 33:46.240]  United Nations in to remove the chemical weapons that Syria has legally and
[33:46.240 --> 33:52.080]  lawfully now remember Iraq agreed to this back in 1993 two years after they
[33:52.080 --> 33:58.760]  were bombed into the Stone Age and then for a decade the sanctions were put
[33:58.760 --> 34:05.000]  into place that completely annihilated the population five million had to leave
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.160]  the country some estimates are as many as two plus million died in fact the
[34:11.160 --> 34:16.280]  estimates were a million and a half by the year 2000 by the way you guys had it
[34:16.280 --> 34:19.880]  ready the other day I never played it will you after I play this aside clip I
[34:19.880 --> 34:25.280]  want to play the Madeline Albright clip if we have that because people don't
[34:25.280 --> 34:29.120]  believe this when she says well yeah half a million dead kids a good price to
[34:29.120 --> 34:33.640]  pay so just remember when they're telling you go attack a country it's for
[34:33.640 --> 34:39.120]  the children that's a big hoax they've been attacking Syria for almost three
[34:39.120 --> 34:44.720]  years it'll be three years in December as everybody remember that and I want you
[34:44.720 --> 34:51.120]  to also remember that info wars calm breaks real news the Israeli release
[34:51.120 --> 34:54.720]  communication that they caught between Hezbollah and the high command of the
[34:54.720 --> 35:01.800]  Syrian military a few weeks ago what Israel released was the high command
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.920]  saying who is engaged in these chemicals it better not be you because you've been
[35:06.920 --> 35:11.480]  ordered not to use chemicals and then that was the evidence Assad caught
[35:11.480 --> 35:15.840]  launching attack and then the the communique said the opposite well to
[35:15.840 --> 35:27.480]  their credit German newspapers in build and son tag and other big publications
[35:27.480 --> 35:33.200]  have reports of the intelligence agency chief in Germany saying that no the
[35:33.200 --> 35:40.160]  communiques actually show that Assad was ordering them not to use chemical
[35:40.160 --> 35:47.360]  weapons and that is McClatchy German paper intercepts caught Assad rejecting
[35:47.360 --> 35:52.520]  requests to use chemical weapons German paper says wow well let's give them a
[35:52.520 --> 35:58.120]  Pulitzer prize huh let's give McClatchy one how about we give Paul Watson one I
[35:58.120 --> 36:02.560]  don't want the credit but I mean I'm telling you weeks and months and years
[36:02.560 --> 36:07.800]  before it's mainstream news you hear it here and why Watson actually went to the
[36:07.800 --> 36:18.320]  communiques and read them and said so many times the mainstream media will say
[36:18.320 --> 36:21.960]  it was pitch dark that's the headline and then you read the article actually it
[36:21.960 --> 36:25.920]  was at high noon at the bottom of the article it's very bizarre where they
[36:25.920 --> 36:30.520]  won't even lie a lot of times they'll just totally spin I guess that's what
[36:30.520 --> 36:38.720]  spin is what I call it spin they'll 180 what's going on in fact now and they
[36:38.720 --> 36:41.600]  would say this for about a year but but now it's starting to get a little bit
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.320]  louder that oh well yeah we have to go in because the rebels might get the
[36:46.320 --> 36:49.680]  chemicals actually it could have been the rebels and that's why we need to go
[36:49.680 --> 36:55.400]  in and bomb Assad counting on the Western public going oh yeah those darn
[36:55.400 --> 37:01.680]  rebels of Assad's no the darn rebels are put in by the left and listeners are
[37:01.680 --> 37:04.680]  going really Alex I mean that's actually happening yeah you see it on the
[37:04.680 --> 37:09.400]  news and it's bizarre so here's the toll-free number on any subject you
[37:09.400 --> 37:13.360]  want to call in about obviously I think it's great news that this is being
[37:13.360 --> 37:24.040]  diffused from now I think it's fabulous news that Vladimir Putin has put Obama
[37:24.040 --> 37:30.760]  and the globalist in check that drudge calls it checkmate and has had his whole
[37:30.760 --> 37:38.440]  site go blue for royal Russian blue because again I'm not rooting for the
[37:38.440 --> 37:43.360]  the the Russian system but I am rooting for war not happening I am rooting for
[37:43.360 --> 37:49.080]  Obama not getting a diversion from Obamacare and IRS gate and spy gate and
[37:49.080 --> 37:55.240]  and and and whistleblower gate and NSA gate and Benghazi gate and fast and
[37:55.240 --> 38:04.800]  furious and salandra energy scams and just all the things that are going on and
[38:04.800 --> 38:09.560]  now you're even seeing the Germans who a week ago were spending the Israeli
[38:09.560 --> 38:17.160]  releases that were real high command to communicate Germany first was saying oh
[38:17.160 --> 38:21.360]  yeah this shows Assad's people did it but they weren't in control of it no no
[38:21.360 --> 38:26.160]  the communiques clearly show that they didn't do it so that is now coming out
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.640]  and that's a really a big deal now now Paul Watson asked the question up on
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.800]  info wars.com and I want to ask you this as I give the number out is Assad
[38:34.800 --> 38:40.680]  being tricked into sacrificing Syria and he talks about Gaddafi gave up his WMD
[38:40.680 --> 38:46.600]  chemical biological weapons most of them sold to him by the West same thing
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.480]  with Saddam that all came out that mainly the US and England France sold him
[38:50.480 --> 38:57.360]  all his stuff so he could have it against the Iranians US military directed
[38:57.360 --> 39:05.440]  the chemical attacks on the Kurds that's come out congressional hearings and so
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.440]  you saw Saddam do what he was told and get set up you saw Gaddafi come in and
[39:10.440 --> 39:13.160]  invest all his money with the West and let all the Western companies in and
[39:13.160 --> 39:17.840]  say here have the infrastructure and he would get on the news and say oh Obama's
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.200]  my friend and I like Sarkozy and we're gonna fix this and you know what they
[39:22.200 --> 39:25.880]  set him up they're like hey lower your guards just like and save it Private
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.200]  Ryan which is fiction but but based on a real battle that happened and I can't
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.360]  tell you how many accounts of French warfare I've read about or street to
[39:34.360 --> 39:39.040]  street hand-to-hand combat where they found in psychological warfare they
[39:39.040 --> 39:41.840]  would have the Germans do this the French do it in World War one back and
[39:41.840 --> 39:46.640]  forth when they would run into foxholes or run into trenches they would yell
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.240]  that was same about Ryan's World War two but it's the same thing they would say
[39:51.240 --> 39:55.840]  we're here to help we're friend don't shoot don't shoot as they jump into the
[39:55.840 --> 40:01.000]  doorway and fire automatic weapons and they found statistically a lot of people
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.800]  didn't want to kill didn't want to fight wanted to be in denial we're gonna con
[40:05.800 --> 40:09.040]  themselves instead of getting ready to kill with your bayonet and your weapon
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.240]  they're coming in let's kill them when they try to kill us ah instead of like
[40:13.240 --> 40:16.360]  getting your killer instinct going people will lower their hands just like in
[40:16.360 --> 40:20.040]  Private Ryan same private Ryan when when the American starting to beat the
[40:20.040 --> 40:24.760]  German and they've got the bayonets to each other and they're in in death grip
[40:24.760 --> 40:30.280]  and the German goes oh no no I'm your friend let's stop and the guy gives in
[40:30.280 --> 40:34.200]  for a minute and he gets the initiative and drives the sword drives the dagger
[40:34.200 --> 40:39.440]  right into him and that's what the globalists do they go don't get angry
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.360]  don't get upset don't listen to Alex Jones yelling and screaming don't listen
[40:44.360 --> 40:49.240]  to you know to the people that get upset stay calm listen to NPR NPR this
[40:49.240 --> 40:52.400]  morning was still saying Assad was caught with chemical weapons because it's
[40:52.400 --> 40:59.680]  totally government run totally government and foundation run because
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.040]  they don't care they're a hundred percent government singing ends pretty much
[41:03.040 --> 41:06.600]  government run and MSNBC but still they know they're totally losing their
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.280]  audience so they're telling the higher ups we're gonna lose everybody if we
[41:10.280 --> 41:15.760]  don't at least tacitly agree with them that this war is wrong and the higher
[41:15.760 --> 41:19.880]  ups are it doesn't matter you do what you're told you sell the war and I think
[41:19.880 --> 41:23.760]  that's great because the more they have our full of hubris the worse they look
[41:23.760 --> 41:31.000]  the problem is they figured it out and backed off because they realized they
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.760]  were hemorrhaging out ladies and gentlemen they are hemorrhaging out
[41:33.760 --> 41:38.080]  right now the question is what's gonna come out of it because by the way I'm
[41:38.080 --> 41:45.040]  not happy about the collapse of the New World Order and let me quantify that I
[41:45.040 --> 41:49.800]  was on a Watson this this morning the what's gonna fill the vacuum is the
[41:49.800 --> 41:56.360]  communist Chinese and the Russians and and and and and the robber barons that
[41:56.360 --> 42:01.960]  are still gonna be operating you understand that's why the EU was set up
[42:01.960 --> 42:05.920]  to collapse Europe to then set up a bigger Union later they intend on
[42:05.920 --> 42:11.400]  collapsing this Anglo-American New World Order and and I'm happy that it
[42:11.400 --> 42:14.680]  collapses compared to their total eugenics takeover but they're just
[42:14.680 --> 42:20.160]  gonna come back again so be ready for that is what I'm saying I'm not happy I
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.840]  mean I guess it's kind of like Samson and if you use that analogy in the
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.360]  Liberty Movement we've had our eyes gouged out we've been starved to death
[42:28.360 --> 42:31.960]  you name it we've been gel did and we're standing there between the two
[42:31.960 --> 42:37.520]  pillars and we're trying to push down the New World Order but it's gonna come
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.400]  down on us I hope you understand that but but it's slow death and a sure death
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.200]  and a sure death of the psyche and the soul and the mind if the globalist
[42:47.200 --> 42:51.520]  culturally are allowed to do what they want to do here the transhumanism you
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.680]  know the end of the family all the things they want to do the evil agenda
[42:55.680 --> 43:01.280]  our only hope is to beat it and justice be done may the heavens fall justice be
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.400]  done though the temple fall down on top of us and many of us will end up
[43:05.400 --> 43:09.960]  surviving and there will be a better world on the other side of that but
[43:09.960 --> 43:15.200]  it's still not going to be fun but it's better to have a Soviet Union style
[43:15.200 --> 43:20.720]  collapse of the globalist Empire that's known as the American Empire than to
[43:20.720 --> 43:24.760]  have World War three and they will try to launch a World War three if they can
[43:24.760 --> 43:30.400]  maneuver people into it to bring in their total world government that is
[43:30.400 --> 43:34.560]  their in-game plan as Joel Scowze and others have concurred we can debate
[43:34.560 --> 43:37.600]  about when they plan that but the United States has spent more money on
[43:37.600 --> 43:41.360]  underground bases and congressional hearings you can look this up then all
[43:41.360 --> 43:49.080]  other governments worldwide combined but in Switzerland and Russia and China
[43:49.080 --> 43:54.000]  they have fallout shelters still for the general public if you notice there's no
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.720]  fallout shelters now here there's parking garages you'll see your nuclear
[43:57.720 --> 44:02.480]  fallout you're supposed to go in there and die supposed to go in a parking
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.840]  garage so it can collapse in on top you and your family we have paid for a
[44:07.840 --> 44:12.320]  breakaway civilization level technocracy that have already got
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.840]  incredible treatments 30 40 years in advance medically and and and that's what
[44:18.840 --> 44:22.080]  government health care is about they can never allow that to all come on the
[44:22.080 --> 44:26.440]  market they can never allow you to get access to that and and so that's why
[44:26.440 --> 44:29.920]  they're saying you don't get these tests you don't get these surgeries you don't
[44:29.920 --> 44:34.800]  get these advances I was listening to NPR this morning at 6 15 in the morning
[44:34.800 --> 44:42.560]  and they had an author on there talking about and it sounded like literally in
[44:42.560 --> 44:50.520]  rapture talking about the power of the bioethics board in Katrina and Sandy and
[44:50.520 --> 44:54.760]  other events and how the doctors would go through the wards with the sick
[44:54.760 --> 45:02.680]  patients killing them with morphine and then I got back in the car I got into
[45:02.680 --> 45:10.880]  work late today at 10 a.m. and tuned in NPR out of Houston and they were on
[45:10.880 --> 45:14.840]  another show talking about euthanasia a big because see for them that's the
[45:14.840 --> 45:19.960]  ultimate power and they were there with these voices going he checked with the
[45:19.960 --> 45:27.840]  nurse she was on the bioethics board and then they put the morphine in and I'm
[45:27.840 --> 45:32.160]  listening to this and it's like and then I tune in three hours four hours later
[45:32.160 --> 45:37.960]  and it's another show it's like the grim reaper programming or something and
[45:37.960 --> 45:46.560]  it's just all about them running our lives and it's so incredibly creepy and
[45:46.560 --> 45:50.960]  they just want to have this calm voice with everybody and oh this is how it's
[45:50.960 --> 45:56.800]  going to be and oh don't get upset don't struggle and I use the analogy of if
[45:56.800 --> 46:02.920]  you're going to pick up an old horse to sell it a lot of people get attached to
[46:02.920 --> 46:06.720]  their old workhorses and end up when they're in pain or whatever you know
[46:06.720 --> 46:10.360]  just put them out of their misery shooting them but you know old old cut
[46:10.360 --> 46:18.040]  throat farmers and ranchers they'll call in Elmer's they'll call in and the the
[46:18.040 --> 46:24.840]  the what do they call it the glue wagon and you might just wait cuz you'll buy
[46:24.840 --> 46:28.280]  horses in group maybe you got some 15 year old 20 year old horses that are
[46:28.280 --> 46:31.600]  kind of broke back and you know or lame or whatever you don't get a little bit
[46:31.600 --> 46:36.240]  of money out of those and the glue wagon pulls in I haven't seen this I've
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.240]  read about it and I've had family that's seen it and you think horses are
[46:39.240 --> 46:42.920]  stupid they're not stupid they're just real instinctive so there's they're
[46:42.920 --> 46:48.000]  real wild and these are horses been around you for 15 years and know you
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.720]  and that glue wagon pulls in and the glue wagon guy gets out those horses
[46:54.720 --> 46:59.320]  can smell the fear of the last horses that were in it in their urine the
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.480]  hormones in their urine and the horses start kicking and getting upset and put
[47:04.480 --> 47:07.280]  the glue wagon fellow he goes come on over and help me let's just get him and
[47:07.280 --> 47:12.600]  and they talk to him just like an MPR voice that's where that comes from you
[47:12.600 --> 47:21.600]  said the original NLP and they just go it's all right baby and you just lead
[47:21.600 --> 47:25.680]  that horse right on in there and there's any others they just go right in
[47:25.680 --> 47:32.360]  with it and you'll close it and you lock it and they pay the farmer here's your
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.960]  five dollars back in the day you know here's your hundred dollars they're
[47:36.960 --> 47:40.680]  gonna get turned into dog food they're gonna get turned into fish food they're
[47:40.680 --> 47:45.240]  gonna get their hooves and things rendered down into glue what it is is
[47:45.240 --> 47:51.800]  cartilage and the farmer goes turns around and this is I've seen this with
[47:51.800 --> 47:55.800]  slaughtering animals and around a farm even though you know a pig or you know
[47:55.800 --> 48:00.280]  a cow it's kind of like yeah oh bet she's gonna be on the dinner table let's
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.240]  go get something to eat because that's just what you got to do that's people
[48:03.240 --> 48:06.360]  so that's immoral what's really immoral is pulling into Wendy's and getting your
[48:06.360 --> 48:09.800]  hamburger then and then criticizing people to go hunting but the whole
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.880]  psychology is the same thing so I'm here because I don't want to just be a
[48:14.880 --> 48:19.320]  horse loaded up I'm here saying hey we better get upset I'm here trying to get
[48:19.320 --> 48:25.520]  your instincts for survival activated an NPR and all these globalists they are
[48:25.520 --> 48:29.320]  your enemy and they all know full well what they're doing it's funny to them
[48:29.320 --> 48:34.400]  they're a military operation you're not allowed on those shows unless you play
[48:34.400 --> 48:40.520]  part in the cult one time they had me on national NPR they never aired it and
[48:40.520 --> 48:43.240]  they were taping at the University of Texas it was the national NPR and the
[48:43.240 --> 48:47.960]  ISD in line I was talking just like this and they said can you just calm down and
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.520]  can you talk smooth Alex should be a lot more popular if you did that I said
[48:52.520 --> 48:57.360]  well this is how I am I get upset about this information
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.520]  it was like a some retrospective deal on you know ten years of Alex Jones or
[49:02.520 --> 49:06.120]  something and you know the new older conspiracy theorist or whatever and I was
[49:06.120 --> 49:09.520]  disagreeing with the house course they never aired it and they were all just
[49:09.520 --> 49:15.460]  like going oh your voice oh the people at UT the RTF department was the
[49:15.460 --> 49:20.400]  professor that was running it was there just going oh please stop oh because
[49:20.400 --> 49:24.560]  they're all in a trance too they all just want to feel like their winners feel
[49:24.560 --> 49:28.920]  like their members of the establishment and that's the end of it but you're not
[49:28.920 --> 49:39.280]  your suckers your schmucks your marks your idiots you've been conned you're
[49:39.280 --> 49:42.760]  not part of the winning team either just because you sit around licking your
[49:42.760 --> 49:48.280]  lips about the case for killing granny and you know like Jack Kovorgi used to
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.840]  get excited on TV talking about you know gassing people and it's just like wow
[49:52.840 --> 49:58.960]  these people are so weak that that all they want is the power of life and death
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.400]  over patients that are under their control it's like moonshows and my
[50:03.400 --> 50:08.840]  proxy or something on a mass scale and you realize what freaks they are you
[50:08.840 --> 50:16.240]  realize it's it's a legion of pit of hell scum and then you they call themselves
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.240]  liberals that's the vanguard of the new world order they're the cutting-edge and
[50:20.240 --> 50:24.760]  they're up there just poking their finger in racial division and sticking
[50:24.760 --> 50:28.840]  salt in there sticking salt in the one and grinding it in and going and going
[50:28.840 --> 50:33.720]  now you're gonna do what we say and all this racial pain is gonna stop and they
[50:33.720 --> 50:39.760]  just sit back and smile as blacks beat and kill white people every day and you

[54:12.240 --> 54:18.000]  by the way we have some really amazing gas coming up this week some
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.600]  of them are pretty hot to handle so I'm not gonna announce them till they're on
[54:22.600 --> 54:32.960]  the air but that's coming up later in the week you know I learned about a month
[54:32.960 --> 54:39.360]  ago or about two months ago now actually that I'm not even gonna go there
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.720]  I'm gonna go there I'll tell that story later the point is that there's a lot
[54:43.720 --> 54:50.080]  happening a lot of people waking up but you've also got the power structure
[54:50.240 --> 54:55.040]  attempting to intimidate everybody and they're not speaking up but as more and
[54:55.040 --> 55:00.320]  more of us speak up it's harder for the intimidation to work and once the
[55:00.320 --> 55:05.680]  intimidation implodes then you see a huge acceleration of the sea change
[55:05.680 --> 55:10.400]  we're already seeing accelerate and I know that's elementary but we need to
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.760]  think about that just like in Bugs life if you let one aunt stand up they might
[55:15.760 --> 55:21.200]  all stand up those puny aunts outnumber us a hundred to one and if they ever
[55:21.200 --> 55:26.280]  figure that out then that's it for our way of life and their way of life as the
[55:26.280 --> 55:31.120]  globalist is not just sucking our money and energy out of us but programming our
[55:31.120 --> 55:38.120]  minds trying to destroy our free will that's the big sin so open phones in the
[55:38.120 --> 55:42.000]  next hour I'm gonna give the number out on the subjects that we've already
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.520]  covered so far any subject you'd like to raise the toll-free number to join us
[55:45.520 --> 55:56.120]  is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 we'll also get into new government ammo

[56:07.040 --> 56:10.680]  probably failed but I'll try I want to play this clip I talked about here's a
[56:10.680 --> 56:17.800]  sod one of the clips from Charlie Rose talking about how he'll do anything to
[56:17.800 --> 56:21.760]  avoid another crazy war here it is
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.200]  president is prepared to strike and perhaps we'll get the authorization of
[56:26.200 --> 56:31.760]  Congress or not the question then is would you give up chemical weapons if
[56:31.760 --> 56:38.160]  it would prevent the president from authorizing a strike if that is a deal
[56:38.160 --> 56:42.160]  you would accept again you always imply that we have chemical I have to because
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.040]  that's the assumption of the president yeah that is his assumption and he is the
[56:46.040 --> 56:50.600]  one who will order the strike it's his problem if he has assumption but for us
[56:50.600 --> 56:54.560]  in Syria we have principles we do anything to prevent the region from
[56:54.560 --> 56:59.000]  another crazy war it's not only Syria because it will start in Syria do
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.800]  anything to prevent the region the reason of the crazy war yes you
[57:02.800 --> 57:07.280]  recognize the consequences for you if there is a strike it's not about me
[57:07.280 --> 57:10.920]  it's about the region that's right it's always about we're just gonna take out
[57:10.920 --> 57:16.280]  this guy and you know he's a bad guy we say so let's kill everybody no it's
[57:16.280 --> 57:21.720]  about the region it's about the world I can't believe how calm he is I got mad
[57:21.720 --> 57:24.960]  at Pierce Morgan and I've gotten mad at other people on national TV when they're
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.520]  lying saying nobody wants to take your guns well of course you want to it's on
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.960]  record everywhere you're in control the globalists take all the guns shut up
[57:32.960 --> 57:37.520]  then I'd be like how dare you send in al Qaeda to our country and do this but see
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.400]  it was taped so they knew it would never end up on the air and I mean they
[57:42.400 --> 57:46.680]  tried to blow him up over and over again in his family I can't believe how calm he
[57:46.680 --> 57:51.560]  is and then you look at the sycophanticness of
[57:51.560 --> 57:55.600]  Charlie Rose and all the rest the globalists how they get off on the power
[57:55.600 --> 58:00.400]  how they get off on the weapons how they get off on talking about striking how
[58:00.400 --> 58:03.600]  about you give a hey hey Rose how about we just give Obama five more peace
[58:03.600 --> 58:08.320]  prizes for what he's done in Syria huh you people are sick and you're not gonna

[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:37.720]  Alex Jones you know during the breaks on the TV feed we put info wars.com up we
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.840]  put up prison blood.com some of the other websites our Twitter real Alex Jones
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:49.080]  Facebook and things and I'll be looking at the images from the news and I know
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.680]  what the al-Qaeda bin Laden brigade and different jihadi flags are the black
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:01.320]  flags what they say in Arabic I've learned the flag of my enemy as anybody
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.680]  with half a brain would do and it's so offensive when I'm watching CNN or
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.680]  whatever to see all these flags everywhere and then to have Kerry going
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:15.080]  oh there's no al-Qaeda remember last week in the in the house hearing there's no
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.640]  al-Qaeda and then Putin starts laughing at him going what an incredible liar
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.800]  and it really is embarrassing for my country and I think it's embarrassing
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:28.120]  for Israel too and it's very embarrassing to people that have not been
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.280]  anti-Israel you can debate whether it was good to found Israel or what's
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.840]  happened since for some of the colonial policies and things like that but I don't
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.800]  hate Israel and I've had friends and family that have been to Israel is that
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.760]  people are really nice and they've gone to some of the other countries they say
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.760]  it's not nice I mean I my old bills I'm not into the religion of hating Israel
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:56.640]  but man it makes it really hard to to to just mildly criticize Israel and then
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.240]  to have you know the ADL groups like that say oh Jones must be anti-Semitic
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.680]  and you know to see the media it's anti-Semitic if you don't turn your guns
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:13.840]  in to see people's goodwill used by the collectivist lobbies out there and a
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.480]  pack and others to not just try to take people's rights in the Middle East away
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:23.720]  but try to take mine away I guess to secure the political rearguard or Israel
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.720]  firsters well I'm not for Israel first I am for the Bill of Rights and
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.960]  Constitution in the Second Amendment but at the same time I don't support Iran
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:39.120]  saying blow-up Israel see the once things get radicalized everybody thinks
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.320]  they can act however they want I don't want to attack Syria but it doesn't mean
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.760]  I'm anti-Israel it means I'm pro-justice and pro-peace and I talked
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:55.960]  about this some of this in the last hour it's a moral way for people to feel
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.840]  superior to say well you don't want to turn your guns in you're anti-black you
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.520]  say what does that have to do with being anti-black actually the Klan was
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.600]  anti-black owning guns and the NRA was set up to train blacks how to use guns
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.720]  and they go shut up cracker you see that with the Fox Sports guy and others
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.320]  because the people saying it no it's not true that's a weapon for them it's like
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.280]  that matter I got the race bomb here I'm gonna use this on you and that's who's
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:33.720]  really sick is the people that use all this division to control people and for
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:38.320]  those of us that are informed it's completely evident what's happening
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.360]  it's absolutely evident what's happening and the globalist are de-industrializing
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.240]  they use weapons inspections to wreck all the factories to basically bring in a
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:58.040]  gender 21 in Iraq and in places like Libya or they're not even allowed again
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.960]  to have chlorine for their water supply they're not allowed to have any
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.920]  civilization because it can be used for weapons I mean that's what the globalist
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:10.320]  want including everybody in the West everyone is going to be de-industrialized
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.000]  everyone is gonna be put back in the Stone Age to be controlled and then
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.720]  Obama and the globalists and the robber barons they're gonna fly around in
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.840]  their jet copters and their Air Force ones and their red carpets like gods above
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:27.640]  us and they're gonna get the life extension technologies and then they
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.760]  don't put movies out explaining that the globalist are using collectivism
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:35.540]  selectively enforced to create an Elysium type society they sell the idea
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:40.280]  that collectivism and government-run healthcare will give you access to Elysium
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:48.320]  the golden fields of the gods the golden fields of the gods space and humanity
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:55.000]  being unleashed but the globalists don't want that they want dark ages they are

[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:35.200]  well if you just joined us we're down to the second hour alex jones here we
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.800]  have the amazingly good news that Assad and the Syrian government has agreed to
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.800]  have the Russians oversee the chemical weapons officially and to have the world
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.640]  government in the UN to see that they're dismantled now in a way that's bad
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.360]  news another sovereign country will then have its weapons taken they'll
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.520]  continue to inject al-qaeda forces in and probably stage chemical weapons later
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.240]  and say Assad did it just like they had a Saddam give up all his weapons and then
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.960]  still set him up lied about weapons and came in so they get you to give the
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.080]  weapons up so you can't defend yourself then they come in and take you out later
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:16.240]  but at least it looks like they're not doing it now and they've got the six
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.720]  Russian ships and a couple Chinese ships and a whole bunch of NATO and US
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:25.920]  ships all facing off against each other so it is really good news to de-escalate
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:34.240]  this and now we can start moving that death con down a little bit because I'd
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.480]  say you know if I had a real death con that they're saying it's been a death
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.240]  con five or four one is nuclear war I'd say the real death cons been about three
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:51.360]  or two I mean it's it's been really bad Cuban missile crisis level type stuff and
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.440]  just just thank God things are going in a good direction right now we need to now
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.800]  have public pressure to not have the West train al-qaeda rebels al-Nuzra and
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:10.480]  others out of four countries surrounding beleaguered and bedraggled Syria it is
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:15.000]  extremely immoral and for almost three years they've been injecting al-qaeda
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.760]  that's the main force into the country and they are I mean I have articles up
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:27.540]  on info wars.com and the videos where the al-qaeda forces are all flying the
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:31.080]  black flag now folks you know what the black flag means you go back thousands
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:37.480]  of years ago it varied but the black flag meant no quarter it's the opposite
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.640]  of the white flag and so they started putting skull and crossbones or daggers
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.200]  or or or the image of blood dripping to mean we're not just going to kill
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.800]  everybody when we take your ship if you don't give up right now we're going to
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:58.520]  torture everyone that's what skulls on your uniform means that historically the
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.480]  plague is a what a purple flag with a black spot on it it varies but the point
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:10.840]  is is that when you see al-qaeda that has black flags and it says in arabic what
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.120]  brigade they're part of I mean it's bin Laden brigade one
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.040]  bin Laden brigade you know bin Laden forever brigade this there are scores of
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.520]  different brigades and I've gone and looked up because they have you know
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:30.120]  online military sites that show the different flags are and the flags when
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.080]  they have cross swords on it basically say we are going to kill everyone convert
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.280]  or die and they're going into Catholic villages in Orthodox Christian villages
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.920]  in Syria right now this is happening yesterday and today and you'll have
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.720]  you hundreds killed in one village you'll have a village of 23 one person
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.240]  gets out some of them are shooting video and they come in on loudspeaker and
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.840]  they say come out and then they say convert and even when people convert
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:03.720]  they say I don't believe it and chop children up their feet first their arms
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.280]  and then their head and those articles are on info wars.com that's Spanish news
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.920]  that's Dutch news German news Italian news precious little girls dismembered
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.640]  while they're still alive by Obama's psychopathic Syrian rebels and ladies and
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.160]  gentlemen I mean you can go find the videos we've got links to the sites that
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.680]  have them we're not putting them on our site you watch kids getting chopped up
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.280]  by people in al-Qaeda uniforms with al-Qaeda patches and you look at how sick
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.800]  these guys are in the eyes and I'll tell you that our government is so evil and
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.680]  I've seen neocons and also liberals on on on on neocon but mainly liberal sites
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.680]  I'm not going to plug them you can go find them type my name into news you'll
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.800]  find the articles attacking me and they're going hey ten foil head you know
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.600]  big deal we have abortion so what if they're killing kids that's pretty much
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.040]  a paraphrase quote I read this morning you know people's profiles and stuff on
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.000]  YouTube these are real people they're the minority of the military but they're
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.600]  like hey you pooper so you like Assad you know some people are going to get
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.200]  killed taking out his Islamic filth and there's comments like oh you right
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.000]  winger republicans don't like what Obama's doing he's fixing things and
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.680]  it's just like wow wow and then this argument of us so what to see them do
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.280]  this to the people and I have empathy for little Muslim children for Zola
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:40.080]  laster children now that predate Christianity the Alawites and I mean
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.800]  they are killing them they are shelling their villages and then the videos they
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.280]  come in there they're flying black flags and of course if you don't know what
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.920]  basic heraldry is or basic naval communication or or basic tower
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.440]  communication I mean it's different different culture but it's basically the
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.040]  same the black flag says we're going to kill everybody no quarter and then it
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:07.880]  says in Arabic different things but you will convert or die and it's got the
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:13.240]  swords crossed we're going to chop your head off and of course they say
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.720]  everyone's animals so they rape the women they rape the children they
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.640]  torture the fathers they make the fathers car bomb or they'll kill their
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:27.200]  families and this is all going on and I've got a look at Obama up there and
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.680]  and the weirdo so-called left media that if I say I don't want to turn my guns
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:40.200]  in I'm a racist when they're just using that as a weapon it makes me disgusted and
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:45.320]  I'll tell you this God bless our military that is finally completely waking up
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.720]  and going public and we even have one of the guys on that did the Facebook and
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.960]  the Twitter saying he will not work for al-Qaeda he will not be al-Qaeda's you
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.880]  know military boots on the ground remember two weeks ago the media said
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.720]  our stories weren't true they said they were fake of course now singing and
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.600]  saying and MSNBC let's arrest some of these people these are real we can't
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.240]  have them refuse to help al-Qaeda chop little five-year-old girls heads off
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:16.400]  after they rape them I mean what's America going to do if we don't let al-Qaeda
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.320]  murder children
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:27.440]  and the sickest thing is the phone calls to the office and the emails of people
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.440]  going Alex I've liked you for years but you're being anti-Semitic because you're
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:37.720]  against elements in Israel supporting this I'm against the US doing it I'm
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:43.240]  against Germany being involved France England the US Israel I mean I just
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.480]  morally look at something and I don't look at what color somebody is or what
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.360]  what religious background they've got and people need to stop thinking like
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:58.080]  gang members and start thinking about right and wrong people that's why they
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:04.560]  inject all this race stuff so you and religious division is so that they can
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.600]  put you in your group and not make it about being a moral person it's so
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.840]  fundamental that's why they inject all this race stuff that's why they hype it
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.920]  24-7 I'm going to come back and go to Steve Joe William Jim good crisis and
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.160]  others the toll-free number to join us in this hour is 800-259-231 but I have
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.840]  prayed multiple times daily on my knees I don't normally pray on my knees
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:34.520]  folks I'd usually sit in a chair you know at like 5 a.m. in the morning and
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:38.200]  pray about when I wake up and feel moved by the spirit that's when it generally
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:44.680]  happens this incredible discernment but I've just felt moved to get on my knees
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.960]  and asked God to open the eyes of people so we can repent I want to go to this
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:56.160]  clip put out by Second City found about the great folks like John Candy and
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:02.080]  others I want to go ahead and play this clip we've got to break from Second
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.000]  City headline help kickstart World War 3 I'm gonna send this out on Twitter too
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.920]  here it is hi I'm Steve I'm Irene I'm Lisa my name is Tom I'm a graphic
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.920]  designer college freshman stay-at-home mom with a full-time job scholar on
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.600]  social policy and a barista and I'm just like you I'm an Obama supporter I
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.280]  support President Obama but the president needs your help our president
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.920]  can't launch into another war without you and remember when we voted for him in
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:37.600]  2008 and 2012 we promised to support him no matter what together we can do it
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.680]  that's why we here at the Americans for whatever Barack Obama once did you know
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.080]  he's friends with Jay Z have launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund World War 3
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:51.600]  and America is dead-ass broke so our goal is to raise 1.6 trillion dollars on
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.640]  behalf of the US government that's where you come in even a small donation would
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:02.000]  make all the difference World War 3 is a very important very progressive war
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.240]  that Obama tells me is very important so it must be when I first saw the
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:12.360]  president speak in 2008 in a YouTube clip posted in my Facebook page I knew he
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:19.320]  was going to be right all the time so I support World War 3 and 4 and any moon
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.400]  war the president may want to start I mean there is no way that he or the
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.600]  cabal of corporate interests by agencies and shadow bankers that tell him what to
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:36.840]  do would ever mislead us the 1.6 trillion dollars that we raised will help
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.760]  create a war that truly puts the liberal in neoliberal there will be millions of
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.200]  troops thousands of organic grass-fed bombs hybrid Priests tanks rockets
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.160]  controlled by iPads and drones that play the luminaires while they attack World
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:57.360]  War 3 is not going to be like those other Republican wars fought on just 1% of
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.120]  the world this war is going to be fought in 99% of the world it'll be
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:07.240]  everywhere Russia China Africa Cincinnati your favorite brunch spot the one
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.840]  with those kick-ass ranchero breakfast burritos everywhere World War 3 will
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.360]  also be the most social media focused war ever it'll be all over Twitter
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:22.120]  Facebook Vine Pinterest and whatever eventually replaces Pinterest and I mean
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.680]  just think of all the hilarious gifts we can make of cats reacting to their
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:33.560]  owners homes being obliterated lots of shock but tons of all and come on guys
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:40.720]  how good will Michelle's arms look in sleeveless army fatigues we have a lot

[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:16.760]  please help us reach our goal of $1.6 trillion so we can make World War 3 a
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:24.720]  reality why because Obama because Obama
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:37.400]  what because Obama it's even more powerful it's even more powerful hey
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.360]  just just tell the internet guys to send it out send that out it's posted on
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:47.560]  info wars.com I want to send that out on the Twitter because that's important
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.160]  and I'm gonna be on air so I I guess I can't broadcast and tweet but that
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:58.280]  video definitely says it all and that's the exact type of humor the once I'm
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:03.360]  able to launch the new TV studio and get some of the new crew trained we're
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:08.160]  gonna be doing more humor because that definitely gets the message across to
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:13.400]  people but in the final equation it's not funny it's very very serious but you
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:19.480]  can only reach a lot of the trendies and folks out there by using humor and I
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:25.720]  think that that piece absolutely says it all let's go ahead now and go to your
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:32.480]  phone calls Joe thank you for holding you're on the air welcome
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:39.000]  Alex here yeah absolutely man I'm on my cell you buzzed out first that's all
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.320]  you're on the air okay I just wanted to tell you that that NPR voice you're
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.880]  referred to there's a scientific name for that it's called Autonomous Century
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:55.360]  Meridian Response or SMR and if you look that up online there's tons of YouTube
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:01.520]  videos there's oh I know everybody's been into it for over a decade and NLP
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.280]  whatever you want to call it and the general public's already in a trance
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:09.480]  and so that type of programming works on them and they show statistically that
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:13.600]  people are in lower brainwaves they're in a near sleep like trance that's why
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.440]  people are more suggestible after 60 years of television because they've
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:22.960]  been programmed to be suggestible and that's why so many business people so
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:31.320]  many politicians are the head of the NSA they all talk to you like this and I
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.320]  catch people doing it to me all the time and I'll go what you've read NLP books
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:39.440]  they're like yeah I'm trying it on you I'm like hey don't work on me it's kind
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.400]  like Obi-Wan Kenobi says you know the force can be a powerful ally on the
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:49.800]  weak-minded but it doesn't work on job of the Hut folks so absolutely but I go
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:55.280]  ahead and make your point no no NPR on record has a trained NLP staff nationally
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.280]  and I've been told that they train them locally in most areas or they pick people
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.560]  that already talk in that simpering voice and of course they've done this for
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:08.760]  decades with the classical music announcers where you find yourself in
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.080]  a trance they're like and now we're going to have the music of Wagner followed
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:19.000]  by Bach and then we're going to have some Ludwig van Beethoven here in the
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.440]  8th Symphony and D minor don't forget that September is the month for your
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.240]  donations I can't even do the voice they do but you catch yourself like
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:37.120]  ready to jump into a vat of acid if they order you to do so but go ahead sir
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:43.520]  I first discovered it with the there was a PBS show when I was a kid Bob Ross
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:49.360]  he's the teacher how to paint happy little trees and that's why I first came
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.600]  across it but yeah it's called the autonomous centering irradiant response
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:59.040]  or sometimes known as attention induced euphoria and it's it's been studied
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:05.440]  for a long time now I know it has you I naturally learned about this because I
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.440]  did retail off and on some in high school and I wasn't bad looking either
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:15.080]  look like I was about 25 and I was like 17 and women would come up to the line
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.760]  and I would be tired or whatever and calm I would say and here's your change
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.240]  that's $3 and he just talked real soft to women especially they'd say I want
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:29.560]  your phone number right now but I mean it's real you can you start talking
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:34.240]  sometimes I'll get tired even now and I'll start talking to women yeah in that
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.520]  voice and it's not on purpose but you're absolutely right that's what's going on
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.680]  maybe I should start doing the voice like that all right folks we're gonna be
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:46.240]  going to break here in a moment is there anything this is won't work on you
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.080]  William but William is there anything else you'd like to say oh I'm sorry we're
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:55.120]  not talking to William yet I'm sorry Joe's or anything else there no I prefer
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.400]  when you when you scream at the top of your lungs personally well that's what
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.120]  I do I'm not I'm not Mr. Slick though I could be what if I had like an alter
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.880]  ego called Mr. Slick that came in maybe once a week and promoted the New World
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.040]  Order they were trendy little glasses or something how's that sound
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:18.280]  dress like a hipster absolutely that guys pull that up I forgot the name of
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.360]  it because I did read some of the boil downs of NLP and things like that and
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.480]  we do this naturally I mean I'm a good storyteller so I'll describe things you
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:32.800]  know using an analogy an allegory for radio which is theater of the mind again
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.960]  this isn't so much about how people are talking it's that the public has been
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:41.080]  put artificially into a trance by the electromagnetic flicker of the television
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:47.200]  set but but real quick Joe what was the point you were getting into what's the
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.400]  name specifically because I've forgotten that term so we can look that up of it's
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:59.720]  ASMR for short autonomous sensory meridian response it's a physical
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:05.120]  sensation characterized by a pleasurable tingling that typically begins in the
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.920]  head and scalp and often moves down through the spine and the limbs
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:15.280]  absolutely and and that's what hypnotists can do yes but the old thing
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.880]  of the guy at the bar if he's been talking to a girl for about an hour you
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:21.920]  know what how about we just get out of here you know what I mean I mean a lot
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.360]  of us just like Fonzie trying to act cool and if you're aware of it it's a joke
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.080]  I mean it's it's it's ridiculous but that's exactly what's going on we're
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.560]  just there's hundreds of different sciences of propaganda that the true
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.520]  masters fuse together and the only way to respond to it is just to activate
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.000]  your survival response tell yourself you're under enemy attack tell your
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.600]  brain to start analyzing enemy attack profiles and your brain will switch into
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.360]  warfare mode and then none of this stuff works anymore God bless you good to hear
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:56.800]  from you that is our tactic is just the full frontal assault to all this hey I
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.480]  don't care how slick it is or how you doll it up or how many war horrors you
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.160]  get up there with sex tapes pushing the Assyria attack we see through you you're
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:11.400]  the enemy you're giving us no quarter no quarter for you charge let's talk to
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:18.440]  William in West Virginia William you're on the air hello Alex I'm a ex marine
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:24.880]  field artillery I've been a listener for a year now I'd like to make a point about
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.080]  what you just said you're exactly right you know I believe that everybody now
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:34.520]  at least they're more intelligent and freedom-loving Americans are starting to
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:40.000]  recognize these people for what they are that's obvious but like you said once
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.520]  you start to see them and listen to them I think that you basically come upon the
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.920]  conclusion that this is not just evil in the regular sense of the word this is a
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.600]  type of evil that is biblical almost beaming possessed evil there's no
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.800]  almost about it when the deeper you study this you then discover that they
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.480]  know this and they believe this even if an atheist doesn't believe it the
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:08.880]  globalist are spiritualist they serve the dark side for power and they they
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.560]  believe they're channeling spirits and yes it's the Bible calls it the mystery
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.240]  of evil they are animated by an unseen hand by an animating force but we are
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.680]  animated by the opposite force you see that's why I say the way to beat them
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:27.560]  is having the spirit of liberty do you see what I'm saying yes and that's what
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.720]  was so awesome about how you went in and you blew up that whole cremation of care
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.680]  thing and that's what got me when I saw that you know and I from there I just
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.880]  kind of caught on everything and ran with it but my one question for you
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:44.680]  right now is that we have a lot of people I believe that are feeling just
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.560]  like me and you know listening to you and people like you and they're angry
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.080]  especially with these events that have just happened now how are we going to
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:58.040]  be able to organize these people and establish the type of communications so
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:02.120]  that when it does come time for us to actually take action whether it be
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.560]  through legal avenues or even you know God forbid actually having to fight to
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.640]  protect our rights you know what if you know they take away the internet or I
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:15.520]  can't hear you anymore you know I don't have the capabilities you have to reach
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:22.760]  out to the people who are like me to get us together to make a change that's the
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.920]  big question how do we organize I think we're doing it you touch those you have
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.720]  access to I touch those I have access to we all build circles of more aware
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.680]  people who then feed off each other to build each other up not tear each other
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.480]  down and by the way I've been saying this for the last week that I believe the
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.960]  number one that stage terror attack they may stage is a chemical attack out of
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.960]  Syria against Israel the Russian government is now reporting that the
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:53.280]  rebels are planning a false flag we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:26.080]  we're gonna go back to your phone calls here in a moment first we're gonna
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.640]  cover the story RT sources Syrian rebels planned chem attack on Israel from
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:36.840]  Assad controlled territories now I've been telling you for a week if I was
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:40.640]  Al Qaeda that's what I do that's the secret of warfare folks is putting
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.000]  yourself in the mind of the enemy and then war gaming out all the scenarios
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.240]  and now they've got intel that's what they're planning well of course in fact
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:56.480]  if I was Benjamin Netanyahu and I wanted to take part of Syria for Israel
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.600]  which is the stated goal here I would send in in some of the rebel controlled
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:06.960]  areas so that the jihadis wouldn't upload video bragging about it that's the
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.760]  problem is they're not controlled if I was Benjamin Netanyahu I would just send
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.320]  in a helicopter or something with a three-man team it's got a smaller medium
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:21.000]  range missile or even a long range short range and I would fire a chemical
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.960]  weapon into Israel and they're probably gonna do that so just get ready for it
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:28.880]  I mean I wargamed all that out last week it's not hard that's what you do and
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:36.240]  then you nuke them and no one will dare say Israel's wrong and that'll just be
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:42.800]  how it goes and I just tell the truth there folks that's that's that's what
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.560]  or they might send in the Saudi Arabians to do it they might send in the French
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.880]  to do it French commandos are always popping up doing really amazingly bad
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.640]  stuff I don't know who's going to do that but that's what I would do if I was
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:59.240]  them I'm not saying the media will spend that I'm not saying I think that should
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:04.120]  happen I'm saying that's what I would do if I was them I'm gonna go back to that

[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.360]  Syrian rebels plan chem attack on Israel from Assad control territories now
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.880]  again I'm not bragging I just know what I'm talking about I told you that what
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:30.320]  about a hundred times desperately last week a chemical attack may be launched
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:35.120]  on Israel by Syrian rebels from government control territories as a major
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:40.520]  provocation multiple sources have told RT that means I've told Vladimir Putin
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:47.360]  the report comes as Russian foreign minister proposed that Syria put its
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.440]  chemical weapons arsenal under international control for subsequent
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.920]  destruction in order to prevent a possible military strike against the
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.800]  war-torn country and they've agreed to that thank God but don't think the
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:03.000]  devil's gonna stop there folks Moscow also urged Syrian authorities to join
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:08.440]  the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the offer was already
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:14.320]  been passed over to Syrian foreign minister who met with the foreign
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:21.280]  minister of Russia in Moscow for talks yesterday and it goes on to say that
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:29.160]  their sources are telling them that this is being planned now again ladies and
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:34.720]  gentlemen this is the reality of what we're facing and there's other false
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:40.280]  flags they could do as well the rebels have said that the Saudi Arabian
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:49.560]  intelligence and then the ambassador Bandar Bush as he's known did go and
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.720]  meet with the Russians this came out in the news and said if you don't back out
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.280]  we're gonna start launching terror attacks on you and the Olympics that's
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:01.600]  worth billions to you and they're like sorry we already gave you Libya and you
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:05.000]  promised you'd stop I mean they cut Libya loose they gave that to them they're
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.560]  saying you will not stop and now you're gonna attack us anyways and you've
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.120]  already tried to overthrow Russia that's why the reset ended they tried to use
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:15.880]  fifth column George Soros groups in last year to overthrow the Russian
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:21.000]  government and the globalists don't play games they've already overthrown the US
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.480]  government they run all the major governments in the world and they've
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:30.200]  never been beaten until now and folks they're not gonna give up easily so I
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.880]  asked the question last week I even asked collars to call in with your take
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:41.560]  on it no one but one caller out of like 20 would call in and tell me what they
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:46.000]  thought was going to happen but I want to know what false flags you think they
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:54.600]  might launch but if if I was the new world order and all the different
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:41:00.960]  interests they've got to do this I would use Israeli French or some NATO group
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.520]  because they can do it professionally the jihadis are our clowns because they
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.920]  want to upload videos be rock stars they're their narcissist of them doing
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:12.360]  it so they upload videos of them launching the chemical attacks cutting
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:17.680]  children up after raping them and you are the west is having a pain of
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:22.240]  conscience our leaders don't this is very entertaining for them they love to
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.560]  use the dead children that they clearly kill with the chemical attack to to
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:32.760]  manipulate our heartstrings but you got all these players from Saudi Arabia to
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.800]  Israel to France to the NATO partners to Obama who really needs who's really
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:44.040]  embarrassed needs to get this going it's just a big gang and believe me there
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:48.360]  won't be investigations in Israel about missing funds and bribes that are going
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.400]  on if there's a big war see war is good for all these governments it's just not
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.560]  good for we the people so let's go to your calls right now I'm gonna go quick
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:01.840]  now Jim listening again in Chicago on 15 30 a.m. Jim you're on the air go ahead
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:07.960]  hey Alex thanks for taking my call real quick I got a quick question that he
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:14.400]  touched briefly on it should should this stand off should Obama back down
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.720]  which was a huge blessing is there a possibility especially with the 911
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.800]  anniversary of a staged a false flag attack and then Obama just saying hey
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:29.640]  look I have no choice I got to go right now this is it what's your opinion on
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:40.720]  that say that again well let's say like I just saw on the news Obama when he was
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:46.240]  side-stepping the answers of side-stepping the answers at the G20 summit of
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:51.640]  him saying well would you enter Syria without congressional approval and he
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.000]  didn't need you know he just answer on the question he didn't say anything yes
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.640]  or no my question is with 911 being tomorrow is it possible they pull a
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.760]  false flag here and then Obama says hey look we can't you know we can't wait I
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.440]  have to go I'm looking out for the American people and then just jumping
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:16.160]  into the wall right then anything is possible and I have a bad feeling about
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:19.840]  tomorrow it's the anniversary of Benghazi we'll be here live Lord willing
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:23.200]  covering whatever happens I think because we're aware of what's happening
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.280]  any plans that may have been already planned may have changed it looks like
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.840]  they're kind of resetting right now because everything they touch turns to
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:37.760]  horse pucky so my gut is I was really concerned about 911 a few weeks ago I'm
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:43.280]  not as concerned now because they're posturing but also their body language
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:48.080]  is they're in a tailspin right now but I do think they're gonna reorganize and
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.480]  stage something and it could be a chemical attack out of Syria tomorrow
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:57.080]  launched against Israel or launched against Turkey oh by the way I forgot
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:02.000]  about the Turks they are really pushing for war and have been one of the biggest
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.040]  players putting troops in and having artillery attacks on the Syrian military
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:14.520]  anytime they try to drive al Qaeda out of cities bordering Turkey so that's
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:18.360]  another big player in fact now that I think about it problem is Turkey's
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:22.480]  further away though it'll be harder for them to get their forces down to the
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:30.080]  south east to be able to launch a attack into Israel the West likes to use
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.160]  jihadi proxies because they can just kill them later or deny it or say here's
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:38.200]  the weapons go do this but again they've been doing such a bad job this is
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:43.640]  such a big deal the West tends to do a really big false flag themselves and not
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:49.880]  just finance it I don't know what they're gonna do because I don't think they
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:53.960]  know what they're gonna do right now but it's a good question Jim well thank
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.200]  you so much and keep up the good work God bless Alex thank you sir God bless
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:04.440]  you I know I just try to think like the globalists would think and they're in
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.800]  their councils right now and they're conferring with all the different
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:13.080]  criminal players there's a whole bunch of them involved in this gang of gang of
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:23.840]  would-be world dominators to basically figure out how to have this victory
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:31.560]  let's talk to Stephen in Florida you're on the air go ahead I wanted to talk
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:35.760]  about the serious situation and all flags the first ball on the side as far
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:41.480]  as you adapting an NPR like boys I don't see that ever working because you've got
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:47.520]  too much testosterone and too much heart so you know just too much manliness to
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.680]  have that kind of boy no but I need to start doing the voice more like it's
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:58.360]  time to turn the guns in for the children we love you coming up next on all
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:04.200]  things considered more on death panels saving America and then we'll discuss
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:10.120]  compulsory national service it's the right thing to do and then fluoridation
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:16.000]  the wonder of the last century I'm sorry did you want to add anything Stephen
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.960]  never mind all those FEMA centers we're building never mind all the troops in
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:26.440]  black uniforms never mind all the face-scanning cameras never mind all
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:31.400]  your neighbors with cancer never mind Stephen did you want to say something
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:37.360]  Stephen about the wicked Assad and how he gassed his own children you're not
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.120]  for letting him kill more children are you because Kerry said if there's any
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:48.160]  more deaths it's your fault Stephen turn your guns in Stephen you're the one
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:55.960]  you're the one that did Sandy Hook gun owners collectively are responsible
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:03.760]  Stephen well I'm gonna you know what I want to get is what I believe as far as
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.000]  false flagged and you've alluded to some of that you know possibly overseas but
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.440]  you know with Syria you gave the analogy about the horse flu situation and I
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:18.760]  think of the parable of the scorpion and the fox you know the thing lets it up on
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:22.800]  its back and then finally gets on its nose and bam stinger when it's all it
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.280]  wasn't done what you do that's just my nature you know you were willing to
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:31.880]  trust me and you know so the the new order I think they're luring Assad
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.600]  through fear all the pressure and everything to capitulate and yeah it's
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:40.560]  given some temporary leave but you know like you're saying we could see an
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:45.280]  attack a false flag through Israel but culture to home this is what I'm getting
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:48.800]  and you had asked about this last week what I think could occur as far as
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:54.880]  false like I have just a gut feeling I may be wrong we haven't seen this yet
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:00.600]  we've seen different scenarios in various places you know in different
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:05.880]  times I'm thinking they may actually come up with a scenario where they're
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:12.720]  going to do simultaneous multiple false flagged attacks here domestically all
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.960]  around the country combining probably bombings and shootings oh yeah there's
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.120]  no doubt there's no doubt they're gonna do that in the future that's on the
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:24.720]  drawing board and out of the laboratory on the street because then we can't pin
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.320]  down one event and prove that was a false flag well you I haven't even said
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.280]  this on air because I don't want to give my ideas but I'm sure they've already
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.400]  thought of it that that way we can't have our witnesses pinned down that this
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:37.800]  was fake or that was fake they hit us with so many kind of a blitzkrieg of
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:42.360]  false flags the blitzkrieg false flag move to where they can absolutely
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.000]  grandstand and credit hysteria and then get their anti-gun stuff through get
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.640]  their open borders through get their shut down to the alternative media through
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:55.920]  which they're openly announcing get their cybercom in absolutely why are you so
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:02.640]  concerned Steven the government has your best interested art lay down your
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:13.480]  arms to homeland security they come in peace Steven they are your friends it's
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:25.680]  for the children Steven don't be afraid Steven join the team Steven the New
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:30.240]  World Order loves you Steven thank you for the call I appreciate you calling in
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.000]  we're gonna come back and get some more your calls but can we go to Watson's
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.080]  piece about how dare Assad defend himself let's go out to break with the
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.360]  Paul Joseph Watson video he put out yesterday his his special his special
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:54.880]  report where he came out and said it's now time ladies and gentlemen to to to
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.640]  call for Assad's execution in fact here's part of that clip
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.840]  thought gave a chilling warning when Charlie asked what kind of retaliation
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:08.440]  American interest could face if the US launches a strike will it be attacks
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.480]  against American bases in the Middle East if there's an airstrike should
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:18.840]  expect everything should expect everything well there you have it if
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:24.600]  there was ever any clearer need for the US to attack Syria then we haven't seen
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.960]  it because I know that the US versus Syria is the geopolitical equivalent of
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:36.080]  King Kong fighting a dwarf with both its hands tied behind its back but how dare
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:42.680]  Syrian president Bashar al-Assad tell Bilderberg member Charlie Rose that he
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:49.840]  will fight back that he will respond in any way to Obama's humanitarian love
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:55.920]  bombs he should thank Obama for every single bomb that falls on Damascus
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.280]  that's right absolutely that's logic

[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:23.040]  disgusting but watching all the sycophantic pundits licking their lips
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:27.840]  talking about a war when most of them have these Ivy League pedigrees and
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:31.960]  have never been in the military and never even been in a fight and they've
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:37.600]  got bodyguards I mean even mid-level reporters now have bodyguards you know
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:41.760]  to go out to dinner they're so scared of everything meanwhile they're sitting
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.040]  back just you know oh let's back al-qaeda mass murdering people that is the
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:51.600]  essence of decadence is to call for war when you're not willing to go out and
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.920]  fight it it's disgusting it's absolutely disgusting watch all these soft
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:03.120]  pathetic people joining willingly in the expanded war crimes that have been
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.760]  going on for a very very very long time by the way we're gonna continue with
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:14.120]  calls and news and get to some domestic news as well but we have the director of
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:21.240]  drive and only God forgives and he's made a lot of other big movies joining us
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:29.560]  coming up at the bottom of the next hour and it's drive one the cancer film
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:34.440]  festival back in 2011 some people who got mixed reviews only God forgives I
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:41.160]  thought it was a good movie but we'll see of my allegorical breakdown of it is
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:44.960]  accurate according to the director but he has agreed to come on the show is he's
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:51.240]  still in the US or is he joining us from Europe is it Skype we got him on I meant
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:56.160]  it a Skype although that'll be good I'm a fan of his work so we'll get his take
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.400]  on the nature of good and evil with the director and then of course Gosling's in
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.880]  that he's a interesting actor in his own right so we'll get his take on that
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:10.360]  coming up I said hey get that guy on and took him a couple weeks but he's on so
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:14.680]  I'm excited about that I'm really excited that unless they can launch a
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:19.360]  quick chemical attack and blame it on a side they're not gonna be able to really
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.560]  bring the country down I'm sorry I'm not rooting for Al Qaeda I know it means
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.220]  I'm not patriotic I can't believe I'm saying that that I have to like make
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:31.400]  excuses in front of everybody I'm sorry I'm not rooting for Al Qaeda and now I'm
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:36.040]  being called anti-Israel I'm sorry I'm just I'm not rooting for Al Qaeda and I
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:38.560]  know that a lot of people in Israel aren't either I mean I have people calling
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.400]  from Israel that are against what's happening but it doesn't matter they've
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:48.480]  got the media out saying I'm bad now if I don't want to root for Al Qaeda to blow
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.560]  up all the churches I just and I'm also been accused of being pro-military for
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.840]  Egypt because I'm against turning that country over to folks that are
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:01.400]  crucifying Christians in the streets it's just crazy but the good news is
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.160]  everybody's turning against this the bad news is the Empire is gonna probably
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.720]  try to strike back some way let's talk to good crisis good crisis so you're on
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:15.200]  the air yeah I was just calling in about you know Roman manuals don't let any

[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:25.600]  you know have Mr. Slick once every hour do a little you know
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:31.080]  piece on calling your congressmen about hydrofluorosalic acid in your water

[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:37.440]  international community is a positive development but it's only just that it's
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:40.360]  a development exactly you need to depopulate all of Syria it's really
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:46.640]  important to remember that Syria has an extremely extremely low level of
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:54.480]  credibility these guys have no credibility he's even having a collapse of
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:02:00.320]  credibility he's poisonous gases he's pie and I'm a cast as
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:07.240]  spirit area loves what's happening to those Christians the Assad regime must act

[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:16.720]  mills your action to you the guys that put Al Qaeda in charge of the action of
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:20.680]  the Senate he must prove to you because you're a well-known criminal any

[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:41.400]  open process even in the midst of the ongoing war well he's having trouble
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.520]  doing this no class these guys do not look like they're having fun doing it
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:50.080]  exactly where the chemical weapons are oh my gosh that's a quote from Rumsfeld
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.000]  they're into Crete they're in the area around
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.320]  bad agreement must hot this sir is I mean shut up you piece of trash that's

[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:17.960]  with a rapid response from this government oh do you hear that oh they're
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:21.720]  afraid they're gonna use chemicals will be a robust robust so now the thing is
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.440]  if you launch chemicals on Israel we're gonna attack you so of course they're
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.520]  gonna say it's not gonna do that now here let me slit my throat I've only held

[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:58.880]  saying and told the truth well there's no proof they have chemical weapons and
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:03.680]  I'm not sure he said no proofs they used them you lie and I'm sorry chemical

[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:27.760]  evidence is their rebels so launch the attack out that would be great and he
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.680]  wants to be an accomplice to it trust but verify yeah I'm gonna verify you liar

[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:28.960]  Nicholas Winding Reffen is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:36.000]  the maker of cans film festival winning films like drive and of course he just
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.680]  recently released only God forgives that I thought was a great film it got mixed
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:44.600]  reviews either like top of the chart reviews or horrible reviews people said
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:47.520]  they didn't get it I don't know how you could miss what the film was about but
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:50.720]  we'll see if I'm wrong because my analysis of it is the only one out there
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:54.200]  I've seen like this and the director has not said really what it means it's for
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:59.400]  you to figure out but I mean it's obvious what the movie's about we'll find out
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:06.440]  if I'm wrong coming up and it's another discussion of good versus evil so that
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:10.200]  is going to be discussed coming up here but let's go right back to your calls
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:14.160]  if stations just joined us or some listeners did the Russians have said
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:17.400]  they'll help get rid of any chemical weapons the public's been dumbed down
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:20.840]  that chemical weapons are illegal all major countries have them they've been
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:25.480]  using them since World War one clearly they've been set up by the jihadis now
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:30.080]  I was watching Harry Reid on a Senate resolution earlier saying if there's
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:33.480]  any more chemical attacks we're gonna have swift action so it's exactly what
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:38.000]  the Russians are saying it's up on info wars.com RT sources Syrian rebels plan
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:46.400]  Kim attack on Israel from Assad controlled territories and you can also go
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.720]  info wars.com with the different headlines that are up there a lot of
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:56.320]  important news NATO leaders Syria not to be trusted highly redacted documents
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:00.320]  confirm Michael Hastings under FBI investigation so what we told you has
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:06.040]  been confirmed the FBI lied is Assad being tricked into sacrificing Syria
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:11.640]  apologize of Watson article IAEA boss as Fukushima water leak urgent yeah no
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:16.520]  kidding a McCain and Graham sees on peace initiative to push war they say
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:20.600]  well we've got to stop the wars and then Assad says we'll do anything to
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:25.160]  prevent another crazy war and the media has not picked up on that from his TV
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:29.560]  appearance very interesting they've taken it what we said out of context also
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:33.920]  precious little girl dismembered while she is still alive by Obama's psychotic
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:39.240]  Syrian rebels can see that story if you dare and there's also another video at
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:43.360]  the bottom of the feature news area help kickstart World War three I just
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:47.880]  tweeted that out at real Alex Jones please retweet it a very dark satire
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:53.280]  that will certainly wake people up big time a stroke of genius by second
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.760]  shitty let's go to your phone calls right now Corey from the smallest but
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:01.160]  also one of the greatest states in the Union very beautiful place I've been
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:06.520]  there Rhode Island you're on the air sir oh hi Alex this is my first time
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:12.400]  calling so thanks for having me you bet I just actually wanted to call it there's
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:16.880]  a couple of things I had I was looking over some articles and I saw in the LA
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.360]  Times and talking about the projection that where to where we stand as 1500
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:25.320]  people died in Syria but you have like the British intelligence is talking
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:30.320]  about 350 people so my question is where are we getting this information from
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:35.120]  Asia's basically trying to you know make it sound worse so we can go to war
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:41.520]  absolutely and and now they're budding up against Russia and but they've been
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:45.040]  caught no one buys the propaganda anymore and everything they've said
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:50.120]  disintegrated and the giant war crime is now sitting there they need to be
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.080]  history's victors and get this over with because it's coming out now two and a
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:59.360]  half years later that they're funding al Qaeda in Libya and in Syria and in
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:04.600]  Egypt and calling them protesters as they commit these giant crimes so they
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.360]  have to change the subject away from all the war crimes they've committed and
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:12.760]  how they started this to carry saying anyone who doesn't support military
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:20.200]  expansion and air strikes you are to blame you are to blame I mean how
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:28.760]  outrageous they are to blame by every measurement they are the authors of this
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:34.040]  and that's the end of it and that's why it's outrageous and I just stopped for
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:38.880]  a moment because I was looking at a tile on info wars.com one of the photos of
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:46.040]  al Qaeda brigades in black jumpsuits with black al Qaeda flags and every time I
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.240]  see it I just get angry that our whole way of life's being taken the government's
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.040]  taken over all our liberties in the name of fighting al Qaeda when they run it of
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.760]  course they run it they use al Qaeda as the threat to take our liberty it's
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:04.000]  elementary and I'm sick of it and they run al Qaeda now and they all need to be
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.640]  arrested under common law and common sense and that's a no-brainer too that's
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.360]  not radical oh that talk show hostess they should be arrested they should be
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:17.920]  absolutely all arrested and we're just in the hands of a bunch of criminals
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:23.840]  that have nuclear weapons that run the public schools that run our children do
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.960]  you have the clip you know I said last hour that they promote on CBS News saying
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.640]  Mercury's good for your child's brain I've got a clip from ten years ago last
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:36.360]  year they came out again and said mercury is good for your brain and I just
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:41.360]  thought about that but by good they mean it brain damages you and makes you
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:45.900]  follow orders just like fluoride I mean we're living in a science fiction
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:50.800]  nightmare anything else Corey well yeah it just seems like common sense to me
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:55.040]  that you use a mercury in anything it's not going to do any good for us I
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.200]  actually had somebody that I was kind of arguing about how vaccines may be shown
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.800]  to cause autism and he's saying well show me the scientific evidence and
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:10.240]  actually linked study that came from info was which actually came through the
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.040]  scientists talking about how in monkeys are shown to be in a mall it has been
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:18.600]  shown to cause autism like symptoms and what did he do he went into the
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:23.480]  article and charity took one statement in it and said see those right there no
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:29.560]  inclusive evidence wasn't a conclusion though so this is basically the way
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:33.440]  people are mesmerized is that they don't pay attention what's going on around
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.720]  just believe the first thing that comes sure sure what they do is they buying
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:41.840]  into whatever lets them be lazy because they think if they just deny things it
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.320]  makes it okay I appreciate you calling in God bless you please spread the word
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:48.480]  about the broadcast there in Rhode Island by the way we have this clip this
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:53.320]  is now this is a talking point put out by the CBS broadcast center in Manhattan
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:58.760]  that is the model of Homeland Security and the EAS takeover the media where
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.160]  CBS is the original King Daddy of the New World War media they even prepared the
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.040]  news for Fox CNN a bunch of other major channels it's on record they they
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:13.560]  prepare video packages that are sent out with the teleprompter loaded so your
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:18.680]  local person can then read this but what you're hearing from Austin Texas was
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:24.400]  broadcast on every CBS affiliate in the country that carries these feeds so the
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:30.880]  video package is ready they roll over the top of it with the reporter saying it
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:35.120]  so it looks like it's local and it's credible this is the type of stuff we're
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:39.760]  under and I'm not gonna argue with people that Mercury is one of the most
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:44.880]  well-studied known heavy metals to cause electrochemical new a neuron
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:50.400]  destruction in fact Mercury other than cyanide is one of the most destructive
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:54.160]  things in the brain and there's so many studies on that just go look it up okay
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:58.600]  and yeah there are people that will debate this now and it said hey studies
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:03.040]  show the shots make you have better cognitive ability they mean more
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:10.160]  submissive you know it's like the only good commies a dead commie thing you
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:13.920]  know well the only good American is a brain-dead one that's the new world order
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:19.720]  board chemically attacking us through soft kill means they all need to be
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:24.400]  arrested for sodium fluoride hydrofluoresic acid all of it in the water
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:27.840]  mercury in the shots let's go to the clip
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:33.280]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:37.440]  in the journal pediatrics there have been wise by concerns that mercury based
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:40.920]  preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:45.080]  children these new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:52.040]  actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance so if
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:58.720]  I'm crazy trying to find a pen here if I'm crazy because I've read the studies
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:02.840]  and I'm informed that's fine imagine the dumbed-down masses of people that think
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:07.760]  it's cool out there to not be informed they think it's cool to not know what's
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:12.040]  going on I feel very very very very sorry for them by the way I'm sure you guys
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.800]  already did this and we pulled up the trailer to the film we're about to talk
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:20.800]  about and the IMDB and stuff so we can like kind of show some of the video while
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:25.000]  we talk to the director that's joining us here in a moment Nicholas winding
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.660]  Reffen let's go ahead and talk to Tanner in Texas you're on the air and you
[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:36.720]  better support carpet bombing Syria or your racist Tanner oh yeah I know yeah
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:42.040]  I'm calling in because you were talking yesterday about the big mass awakening
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.960]  that's going on and also about the fact that people are only allowed to be working
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:49.680]  20-hour weeks and I was just gonna ask you advice because you've been in the
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:54.280]  game for a good number of years what's the best way to get people like me I'm a
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:18:00.560]  young dude I'm 18 trying to work as much as I can and there's people like me out
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:03.480]  there that I want to get interested in research and it's on their own and get
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:06.760]  them interested in all this stuff that we're talking about but they don't have
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:11.480]  time because they're 20-hour work weeks that they're working double jobs to sit
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:15.360]  down and watch these two-hour documentaries that I watch about you know
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:19.320]  you know I think they're going to have to make being informed the number one
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:23.520]  thing in their life plus it'll make you monetarily successful this the globalists
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:26.760]  don't want people knowing how the world really works I mean even if you were a
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:31.760]  sociopath and just a mercenary you should listen to this show to to
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:35.240]  understand how things really work and I'm not bragging I mean but I mean we
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:40.080]  know what we're talking about this is a show not focused on Miley Cyrus bending
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:46.040]  over whatever a new name is Hannah Barbera or whatever her name is I know
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:51.520]  it's Hannah Montana the point is is that knowing how the stock market really
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.400]  works knowing how the drug war really works knowing your rights with police
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:02.200]  knowing the different power structures knowing trends is good knowing that most
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:07.760]  college degrees you get are going to be worthless and are going to bankrupt you
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.800]  before you ever even get out of college you know this this show is powerful
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:16.240]  knowledge is powerful the raft of incredible guests we have on are
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:21.000]  powerful so I think people's idea that they don't have time is why they never
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.400]  become successful is because they never get on the path to investing in reality
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:33.880]  instead of investing in fantasy and so that's what it comes down to people need
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:37.880]  to understand that they are living in the matrix basically and it's pretty darn
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:42.520]  cool to be aware of that and then to become a freedom fighter for reality
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:48.160]  and justice is that sound like a good answer there for you pretty good thank
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:51.760]  you sir you bet I mean I'd wake him up with this video we just sent out on real
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:57.040]  Alex Jones on Twitter with the liberal group calling for a Kickstarter program
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:01.960]  to start World War three it is gold satire
[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:10.360]  curious about what comes next next is the feeling of vulnerability you get
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:14.240]  after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:20.160]  fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV you asked for it we listened and
[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:24.720]  we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model the
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:29.360]  brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40 inch TV it simulates
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:34.760]  the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home and when burglars
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:38.440]  think someone is home watching television they're likely to pass your house
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:43.760]  and move on to an easier target the new brighter fake TV is only 39 95 and
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:50.960]  includes free shipping go to fake TV dot com or call 1-877-5 fake TV that's

[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:25.600]  stop using fertilizers the EM Bokashi food waste recycling system rather than

[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:10.120]  because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:14.000]  when we heat food to normal cooking temperatures we change the shape of the
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:18.760]  molecules into shapes the body cannot use the body now looks at them as toxins
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:22.600]  and allergens in an effort to protect itself from this irritant the body
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:26.560]  intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:30.240]  garbage collectors white blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged

[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:26.640]  Nicholas Linding Reffen is our guest and of course he's won the Cannes film
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:30.840]  festival for films like drive best director and about a month and a half
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:34.320]  ago when it premiered at the Alamo draft house here in Austin Texas I took the
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:37.840]  crew out to see it because it got such incredibly good reviews but also
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:43.360]  incredibly horrible reviews and I thought the cinematography was off the
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.120]  chart some of the best I'd ever seen I thought that it was really thought
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:51.480]  provoking an archetypal and I thought that I got what the film was about and
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:56.600]  then I went and looked at reviews and none of them basically had the same
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:00.920]  review that I had so I want to get the director's take on this who were honored
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:07.720]  to have joined us and then tell him what I think the film was about to get his
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:11.600]  take on it and I don't want to blow it for people that haven't seen it but a
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.920]  lot of people aren't seeing it because they're told it's so terrible I think
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:21.800]  it's the opposite so thanks for coming on with us today from New York I'm glad
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:27.760]  to be here this film has been a phenomenon but on both sides of
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:38.000]  paradox what do you think that is God I I don't know and maybe that's a good
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:52.640]  thing but I tend to enjoy different aspects of creativity and that you know
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:57.800]  to love something you have to hate it equally as much it's like being married
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:07.440]  and within those two parameters that's when it begins to get interesting what
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:11.760]  about the archetype Senate and the cinematography man I think a lot of it is
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:19.040]  about being born dying tell us about the cinematography how you were able to pull
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:24.920]  that off well I guess the whole idea was to make a movie that takes place in a
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:33.160]  vagina that's what I figured yeah and so you got that part yes that's what I was
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:39.840]  saying yeah have that been public yet because that's what I that's what I got
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:47.800]  from it no no I mean it's it's it really came at can when a when a German a
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:55.320]  Lilly German woman made that very clear statement to me and I my reaction to her
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:27:01.560]  was well you're absolutely right but I didn't know that when I was making it you
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:10.200]  know I approach filmmaking very much as a fetish it's it's all about what I would
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:18.200]  like to see what arouses me I don't question it or or or value it in the
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:27.280]  sense of what's good about or what's it worth I enjoy very much the act of and
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:36.200]  the result to me is almost like climaxing it's inevitable what it becomes so
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:43.160]  the journey is not the destination it's the journey itself true and it's like
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:52.000]  bit if you go to a gallery you you flip through a photographer if you go you go
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:58.720]  on a certain journey that takes you from A to B and every time you do that a
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:06.120]  different part of your life that experience will vary and I like that I
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:11.680]  think that you know the result in art is always the least interesting because
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:19.640]  then the experience is over essentially and art is an act of expressing and
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:27.920]  therefore the closer you can get to that experience I strongly believe the more
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:36.160]  of it of a trip it is well it did feel like I was having a hallucination at
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:42.280]  points the and again with the red inside the dojo obviously I was picking up
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:46.200]  that's him being born and then I confirmed I was right at the end when
[02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:51.160]  he's with his mother and she's been killed that he's trying to go back into
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:55.480]  her womb I mean that was all obvious on the archetypes very powerful I want to
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:29:03.440]  talk about the angel of of vengeance versus the demons that he's killing from
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:07.560]  my perspective when we come back in a moment but it's still in some theaters
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:14.200]  across the United States and it's also on cable now and where else can people
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:22.320]  see the film well it in America was also released on the day-in-day so you can
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:31.280]  even get it on iTunes and other VOD providers so as a cinema goer and a
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:37.920]  cinema lover and a synast the film very much as to all the spectrums of
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:44.960]  potentially viewing it either cinema on VOD or I'm very sure you can even buy it
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:49.040]  in a blu-ray absolutely I suggest people see it in high-def stay there

[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:37.480]  starring in many of his films Ryan Gosling who's also a great actor in
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:42.040]  his own right just watch for the one of his films this weekend with my wife have
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:47.040]  made some amazing films and I don't like just violent films but if it delivers
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:50.760]  the message and is there for a reason like full metal jacket or something then
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:54.800]  it's part of it but just you know mindless hacking up and killing no and
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:34:00.000]  and we've got the director on via Skype from New York with us let me just give
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.600]  you my take sir on it because I was correct about the whole birthing thing
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:07.000]  I think it's about that whole journey of life archetype it sounds like you kind
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.160]  of stream of consciousness right this and then direct it maybe even change it
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:14.720]  as you go I haven't followed you a ton I'm just a fan of your films but watching
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:18.560]  it had to go back a few days later to watch it again to make sure that I
[02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:22.560]  liked it as much as I thought I did and exactly as you said it's about the
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:27.320]  journey and about the conflicting issues but here's what I picked up you've got
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:32.520]  without giving it away the the police captain is like an archetypal loving
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:37.240]  good guy but he also comes off as incredibly vicious but he's basically
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:43.800]  psychic or like an angel he can tell who's guilty who's not and who's truly
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:49.080]  evil he kills those that have done bad but have repented they have to be
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:52.600]  punished and it shows that you don't get away with anything in this life and
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:57.240]  that only God forgives and that that's why the police captain is a
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:01.840]  representative of God's angel and he is able to forgive people but he also
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:08.840]  deals death now is that accurate I don't want to give away the movie
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:15.960]  yes well you can kind of say that the characters based on God in the Old
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:22.000]  Testament when he said you have to fear me as I will be cruel like you have to
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:29.160]  love me because I will be kind and it's a very primal instinct in our emotional
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:36.200]  understanding of our DNAs you know we are when we react purely on instinct it's
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:44.840]  either on a violent basis or on a loving basis and our whole DNA is built up on
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:50.200]  those two emotions always conflicting with each other wow what is your favorite
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:36:00.800]  sequence in the film I I have many favorite elements but it's hard to pin
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:07.080]  point one it's like asking which children do you like the most but I think that
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:14.720]  every movie which has a heart that pumps blood into all the other scenes like
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:21.600]  all the veins leads to this specific scene and it can vary it doesn't have to
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:27.880]  be in the beginning middle or the end it can come at any stage and you can say
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:35.280]  that in drive it was in the elevator scene and and only God forgives I would
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:42.200]  probably say it would be the scene where Ryan brings his potential girlfriend to
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:49.360]  meet his mother because the whole film is about a son being chained to the womb
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:51.960]  of his mother
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.320]  wow well that's exactly what I picked up from it we had big debates because I
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:02.880]  took the office or the TV crew into the film and we had debates about what the
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:06.960]  movie stood for and I don't want to think of myself as that smart I actually
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:10.440]  see it as the public being very unconscious because after I saw it I
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:15.280]  look for reviews and even people that liked it said they didn't understand it
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:18.960]  and I don't know how you couldn't understand that before the motorcycles
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:23.720]  get there the police captain's got up and is ready I mean he's obviously psychic
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:28.320]  I mean it's it's it's it's almost like out of the shining or something where
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:33.120]  the black guy has the telekinesis connection to the little white kid but
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.920]  then I guess it's beyond that it's almost like spiritual archetypes is one
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:42.160]  layer of it or I mean perhaps you just left it there for us to choose for
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:48.360]  ourselves well it's not so much it's not a multiple choice construction it's
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:58.320]  it's that experiencing art can mean many different things it at very different
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:05.960]  settings you know and we accept it very much with with paintings or abstract
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:12.800]  art forms and sometimes with also but it seems when it comes to film the fear
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:19.640]  of the experience can be frightening because everything has to be grounded in
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:28.160]  what we call accessibility and you know it's not always interesting knowing
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:36.200]  everything and the only way to really penetrate yourself with an experience to
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:41.400]  let the experience become part of you but you can only be part of you if you
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:47.120]  can plant a thought within you has to be able to play a thought in you you have
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:56.640]  to be open you have to be like yourself to be penetrated well your film your film
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:02.680]  I had dreams about it and it deeply affected me and so I just say
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:08.280]  congratulations you really have I mean a lot of I mean watching your film some of
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:12.680]  it goes beyond folks like Stanley Kubrick and I just want to say congratulations
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:18.680]  on what you've done thank you thank you very much how satisfying is it to put
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:22.960]  out works of art that are this this fulfilling or or do you find them
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.400]  fulfilling or or do you then see imperfections and want to make another
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:35.040]  one obviously I think that when I was younger I was making films for the wrong
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:43.640]  reasons because it was all about my ego and be perceived and then I got slapped
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:48.560]  around and I lost everything and I realized well if I just approach things
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:55.440]  like a pornographer that's where the real kick lies the act of expressing and
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:01.080]  not work very so much about the perception afterwards all the glamour
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:07.720]  that comes with the entertainment industry so it wasn't nice till I started
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:12.920]  making different kinds of films as they say this second fit a bit like when
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:20.880]  Charlie Brunson realized is that is an act of violence so now I'm very very
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:28.040]  content and I'm very very much enjoyed the process and I enjoyed to create a
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:34.000]  freedom of having to do what I can do but of course I have also great
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:42.280]  collaborators with me on these journeys and I've been very very lucky but there
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:50.760]  is an addiction to this high that just goes stronger and stronger so the need
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:41:01.760]  to do it again and again and again becomes about speed I can't stop I have
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:11.640]  to kick of mine and luckily I have kids who can ground me in reality it's the
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:15.600]  same way with news and politics the more you learn the more you don't know and
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:19.200]  the more you want to learn and then you can't stop thinking about it and then
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:22.880]  you rewire your brain when you've been doing it like I have 18 years to the
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:26.280]  point of you almost don't function as good as you did before at least on air
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:31.120]  because now things are so much more complex there's no way to express how
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:36.040]  really vibrant and multifaceted reality is and I think that's where the
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.760]  cinematography comes out because I could pick up so much more in the language
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:43.600]  of the richness tell us about the folks that did your cinematography how you
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:50.080]  directed it what Ryan Gosling's take is on this who you tell us about the police
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:59.320]  captain of this amazing this amazing cast well Ryan and I had of course made a
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:06.560]  film before called Drive which was a wonderful creative experience for us and
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:14.400]  I always say we became you know telekinetic there was a way to sometimes
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:21.560]  we wouldn't speak because we just react and it was very much in sync we're very
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:28.000]  similar in many ways so with only God forgives it was just a continuation of
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:37.160]  that process and and the Thai lieutenant which plays the so-called antagonist
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:51.000]  maybe protagonist slash was someone an unknown actor that I fang cock and he
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:57.720]  was 50s you just started acting he had been in a hangover part two and that was
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:08.040]  really and when I met him know what I was looking for so in a way when I saw
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:17.400]  that's when Chang kind of well the angel of a halt really defined itself when it
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:25.960]  comes to cinematography I was able to work again with Larry Smith who I had
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:34.840]  done Bronson with and he's a wonderful collaborator he's a full
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:46.360]  cameraman and I don't work I just show up and I see what arouses me and then we
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:56.520]  shoot it I shoot very much money so I was to be quick and out to move on and it's
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:44:02.680]  like you're living on a little cocoon and then Matt Newman where that's all my
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:09.000]  films is the main source of inspiration in terms of collaboration he's the one
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:15.480]  that I bring in at idea stage and he follows the process and the whole movie
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:23.760]  up until it's finished and then I chronologically order which means that
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:29.040]  the film falls every day and I change a lot depending on how I see the film
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:35.880]  becoming it's like Sherlock Holmes as when all options have been crossed off the
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:40.320]  list whatever is left is the right solution and that's how I like to make
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:44.400]  films well I wanted to get you on because I admire your work and of course
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:47.000]  I'm not the only person out there you're an amazing director but it really the
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.120]  film really touched me and again I just can't understand how people didn't
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:55.560]  completely get it right away because and I didn't see again any any reviews that
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:58.760]  got it even people that liked it and of course there's so much more that we
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:02.400]  haven't talked about in the film just a really thought-provoking I think that's
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:07.240]  what's important and it's funny that you mentioned telekinesis because I had
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:10.360]  forgotten in one of the reviews you talked about that connection that's what
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.080]  I picked up in the film that the police chief has and there's only a few people
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:20.840]  I know where I'm literally synced with them and is it a question of our brains
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:25.400]  work alike we've worked together for a while so we sink exactly on what needs
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:29.360]  to be done and that's such a great thing that it's frustrating when other people
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:34.720]  aren't like that it actually is enraging at times and then I actually almost
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:40.200]  lust after other people I can mind meld with so is it an electrochemical
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:45.960]  frequency in the in the fifth dimension or something or is it literally just
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:50.560]  electrochemical the brain's sinking do you think it's it's a radio wave type
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:58.440]  deal or do you think it's biological I think it's a combination I think that we
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:05.960]  have as an our individual audiences you see to love something you have to hate
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:13.040]  it and if you don't love it or hate it then how can you have an opinion about
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:18.560]  it and therefore I always find it interesting when people ask what's it
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:30.640]  like loving or hating and I say with that what God you know the idea that you
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:36.320]  can love or hate something automatically sends a life of emotions connect
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:41.960]  through the speed of light so you go through a process of experience and
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:53.080]  whether you're seeing it connects to you it can be very violent meaning you can
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:47:01.480]  shock you penetrate you with such a sheer that you become speechless you're
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:09.320]  almost you're lying on the floor can't move but it stays with the room or you
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:16.240]  can have experience being touched by God the beauty of something there are
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:21.240]  pieces of music that you can play that within the tenth of a second I will
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:26.520]  automatically start crying so not because I'm sad but because it touches
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:36.080]  something within me that connects my brain to emotional meltdown exactly
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:39.240]  exactly and that's what I picked up from your film and that's why it's so great
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:43.920]  that you were able to spend some time with us here today because I wanted to
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:48.160]  you know have you on because you did touch me with the film and I hope that
[02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:52.960]  other people will see it obviously it's not for children but compared to many
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:56.800]  movies it's not that violent it's that the way the violence is delivered is
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:02.000]  delivered emotionally like violence really is horrible and so that's why it
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:07.320]  upsets people instead of the sin of showing violence is funny and no big
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:13.240]  deal that desensitizes us your film I think actually sensitizes us and to a
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:23.920]  great level is actually anti-violence is that accurate very much I think that we
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:33.640]  we who have the ability to express art also comes great responsibility and I
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:39.880]  don't believe that art makes people violent but I believe art can show
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:50.200]  people how to act violently so it can initiate both but create the behavior
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:55.760]  and that's what it becomes tricky because every time something bad happens
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.480]  we're always looking for a reason why and then we're looking for a mechanical
[02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:06.360]  way to solve it but emotions you can never mechanize you can even
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:14.400]  chemilize it it's just who we are as people the DNA of our brain and I think
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:24.840]  that you know we must not forget that man was born that was violent to their
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:32.680]  body you know we were born with hands and teeth arms and legs we could move we
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:38.880]  could fight we could run we could chew it was a violent mechanics mechanics of
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:47.720]  our body but it was a necessity of self-preservation but as time went by
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:55.760]  and essentially religion came in and dominated morality and society was
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:03.680]  really created we no longer needed our physical violence because our need for
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:10.240]  taking care of our primal needs are fixed in today's lives so the violence
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:15.400]  becomes more sneaky and hidden and in a way more dangerous well it becomes it
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:21.760]  does mean that the impulse disappear it just has to be exercised or executed in
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:28.000]  a different way so now it becomes mind violence because our physical violence
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:34.720]  is no longer needed for us unless we react immorally amazing I have you ever

[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:21.640]  do overdrive as well into the fourth hour some stations carry it some don't
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:26.120]  info wars.com force last show to find the free video feed and podcast and all
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:32.080]  that if you want to continue listening live into the fourth hour but I've put
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:36.720]  out satire videos like Alex Jones joins the New World Order that we can put on
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:41.440]  screen for TV viewers anybody else can just search that and find it and it was
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:46.520]  a popular video but about a third of the people were genuinely mad at me and
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:51.000]  thought that it was real even though it said satire and thought that I was
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:54.920]  really making everybody buy their lunches here at the office and then I was
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:59.360]  really screaming at everyone and in fact people even use it on websites and
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:03.840]  news articles as evidence of how bad I am I mean it's clearly satire it's
[02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:08.840]  clearly meant to show how all over the country they're gonna make parents buy
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:14.880]  the school lunch and not pack the school lunch as part of total control and we
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:17.560]  also get into the TSA and how we're gonna grope everyone when they come to
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:21.400]  work in the morning they actually do that at some of the Sony plants and
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:25.840]  things here in the US and people really thought it was real when I did the
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:31.040]  Joker once to illustrate evil people really got freaked out by it and said
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:34.960]  man we're fundamentally freaked out by Alex Jones the truth is folks I like
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:39.400]  manifesting what I know evil to be I mean I could do a lot more hardcore
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:46.200]  stuff I did the that little short film based on Satan speaks not the book I
[02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:50.800]  called it Satan speaks in the trailer what did I call that a few months ago oh
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:56.880]  Homeland Security training video leaked let's pull that up and I put an iron
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:00.960]  helmet on and talked like the devil it was kind of like these screw tape
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:06.320]  letters by C.S. Lewis you know from the 50s where the word Satan is talking to
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:10.160]  one of his henchmen and people I mean we got hundreds of calls from Christians
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:16.720]  here at the office saying Alex is demonic I mean I guess C.S. Lewis had the
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:19.400]  ice queen playing the part of the devil does that mean C.S. Lewis was a devil
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:25.400]  worshipper I mean the public really doesn't get things that if you make a
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:31.040]  film to try to illustrate things it's meant to make you uncomfortable when I
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:34.240]  get up here and I say oh the new world order is gonna kill you haha it's so much
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:39.480]  pleasure for your children to die I'm trying to get you through satire to
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:43.600]  realize what's really going on I mean it's kind of like the second city video
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:50.000]  that's up on info wars.com where it's a pro start World War three kickstart
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:54.080]  campaign there are people on that YouTube who have real YouTube channels who
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:58.320]  are not joking some of them are saying I can't believe you've got this sick
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:04.040]  campaign I'm gonna try to shut it down and it's scary when you realize about a
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:10.240]  third of the public folks literally are mega stupid and they're getting
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:16.160]  stupider and I'm freaked out that I went probably read that's not exaggerate
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:24.760]  50 reviews when only God forgives came out and I went out and I read probably
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:30.360]  50 reviews trying to find someone that got it and no one got it Marcos
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:34.000]  Morales got that the guy was like an archangel good guy and was psychic Marcos
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:39.120]  Morales got the film I went with him one of our you know great TV directors back
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:42.920]  there and the graphics guys and then the crew got some of the other smart guys
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:48.200]  imagine the general public no wonder they didn't like it not one reviewer that
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:51.840]  you heard the director say yes no I've never said this yes you're right that's
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:55.680]  what it's about and yes unbelievable that's that's exactly what it is yes you
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:01.200]  you know the whole I mean because I know reality ladies and gentlemen I know
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:05.520]  archetypes I don't need to read Carl young to know them I was reading Carl
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:09.720]  young last night at my parents house at about ten o'clock because I went out
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:14.080]  with Dave Mustaine his wife it's good to see them but Dave's really in good
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:16.680]  shape man he's was ten years younger I don't know what he's doing I want some
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:22.160]  of it but the point is is no good living going to church Dave I say the
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:25.320]  Megadeth I'm only oh I'm telling that story and my name dropping the point is
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:28.640]  why I was back at my parents at night is my wife met me at my parents because it
[02:58:28.640 --> 02:58:31.520]  was near where we went to dinner so I was dropping off cars my mom said you got
[02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:35.920]  to read Carl young he talks about how the state doesn't want to God because
[02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:41.040]  they want to be God and I go but everybody knows that

[03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:24.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:39.240]  ladies and gentlemen we're taking your phone calls right now thanks for holding
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:46.760]  I didn't mean to have a filmmaking love fest earlier but that's what we just
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:50.080]  did but it's about the nature of reality I didn't mean to go off into a rant
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:55.600]  about doing satire and people not getting it when it says satire I did a
[03:00:55.600 --> 03:01:01.600]  satire about John Kerry being a reptoid and said this is a joke this is satire
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:05.400]  and they got like a hundred something thousand views and people flipping out
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:09.400]  over it saying he believes in reptoids now I mean it's just I don't or I'm
[03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:14.880]  really the Joker because I can do a Joker imitation it freaked people out I
[03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:22.440]  just don't understand it but let's go to a phone call here let's talk to Damon in
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:29.000]  New York City you're on the air sir hey you doing Alex I'm doing I actually and
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:34.080]  what I'm actually in Wilton New York hey you know don't mind all them Christians
[03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:38.400]  to call in and tell you that you know you're Satan and all that gotta remember
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:42.480]  with the things that we're going through in life and especially in this country
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:47.160]  and all around the world people are seeing things in reverse and people are
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:54.760]  also going through things that are you know really it's crimping almost you
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:58.720]  know it's it's it's you know yeah I think it's a combination between your mind
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:02.840]  body and soul so if they're trying to kill the soul or at least turn it off
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:08.520]  dumb it down it'll have it the effects on the mind and body no exactly and then
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:11.760]  anything that wakes them up they recoil from like when I yelled at Pierce Morgan
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:15.920]  that at first it was about 50% negative and then a few days later oh that was
[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:19.960]  wonderful and a few months later that's the greatest thing ever because people
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:23.440]  aren't used to hearing hey you're an enemy this isn't just some debate you're
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:28.560]  trying to take our guns watch it you're on notice they're not ready for that but
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:32.040]  down the road they they don't like anything that shocks them out of their
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:37.520]  comfort zone that that's because the government wants everybody to be calm so
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:43.040]  when they come and get you or they you know do whatever do whatever really
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:47.560]  they're gonna do and they'll do it soon trust me oh yeah no no I mean that's it
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:51.240]  it's elementary they want to stop style they want us passive we should be loving
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:55.080]  with our neighbors loving with our friends not quick to anger but when it
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:58.160]  comes to fighting tyranny Christ went in and beat the money changers with a whip
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:02.240]  when it came to standing up against evil you know Moses went in and stood up the
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:06.160]  Pharaoh and said no John the Baptist said no to Herod and the whole Bible is
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:10.320]  about saying no to tyrants but common sense is about that they teach in
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:13.880]  churches you're to follow Romans 13 they teach in churches I played the
[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:19.640]  national TV clips here where they say render under Caesar the Roman citizens
[03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:24.880]  that were thrown the lions for not worshiping Zeus or or Jupiter's the
[03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:29.320]  Romans those they were wrong they should have worshiped Zeus eat well what
[03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:34.280]  about the fiery furnace what about the lion's den it is diabolical these
[03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:39.200]  churches these are paid henchmen with trained voice training on how to
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:44.840]  mesmerize their flock to put them into a spiritual incinerator they are big fat
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:48.600]  devils and if you could see them spiritually they got 14 foot long
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:52.960]  for tails ladies and gentlemen I mean you go most these churches there's a big
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:58.360]  giant slobbering demon perched up there little glitter bug and I wish people
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:03.640]  could see it going to some of these churches you know I gotta go back to
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:09.640]  the Roman days when when the church was you know the actual Vatican was was put
[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:16.600]  on the map really what that was was Rome wanting to have a country or empire
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:22.360]  without borders and if they could control the mind and the spirit of the
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:26.200]  people all around the world they didn't have to rule them because they would
[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:29.840]  already control them well yeah I mean it's it's pretty complex when went back
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:34.360]  and forth in the first three years of Christianity but undoubtedly the the
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:38.880]  Visigoths and the Vandals and others came in and sacked Roman 410 finally it
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:43.960]  fell the Byzantine Empire the split of the Rome was left for a while but all
[03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:50.360]  that was left then was that was was that form of Christendom so it's it but it
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:53.880]  is very sophisticated it's undoubted that any big organized religion becomes
[03:04:53.880 --> 03:04:58.280]  a system of control that's why Christ said you know you have a relationship
[03:04:58.280 --> 03:05:03.840]  with God yourself not to the church introducing pro wine all of your

[03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:28.400]  insanity well it's not insane they'll then have a new war with those rebels
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:31.840]  later and sell weapons because it's they don't control them they open the door
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:36.920]  for them and fund them that's the inside job you know if I knew that somebody
[03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:39.840]  overheard this was trying to break into somebody's house and kill them and then
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:44.400]  I because I wanted the person dead you know say left the door open and left so
[03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:48.240]  my roommate could be killed easier I would be aiding and abetting in it I
[03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:53.760]  would be an accomplice in a conspiracy that's basically what they're doing and
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:11:00.920]  so it's on record they did this when the rebels attack Israel and try to blame or
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:07.120]  attack Turkey and try to blame Assad or when they stage an attack here in the
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:10.720]  US and try to blame Assad just remember who has the motive who has the history
[03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:14.760]  who's been behind this and the great part about seeing a collapse and
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:18.560]  confidence in the entire power structure from the media to the
[03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:23.880]  corporations to Obama and his henchmen and the Republican leadership the great
[03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:29.040]  part about seeing this history happen is this is before they do a fake EMP strike
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:32.320]  to shut down stuff or before they do a fake cyber attack and shut down the
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:36.120]  media the alternative media or before they set off a nuke in a major city in
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:41.720]  grandstand as our saviors the we need the awakening to happen big time to check
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:46.520]  them so that they can't then stage an event and check made us and we've got
[03:11:46.520 --> 03:11:51.600]  them in check and they've got us in check it's a very weird situation
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:57.080]  historically but we've got the next move and they've got the next move so I
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:12:03.080]  mean it's for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction and it's
[03:12:03.080 --> 03:12:07.880]  historically right now we are at the vortex this is such an amazing time to
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:12.640]  be alive I cannot stress how huge things are and again I'm not bragging I know
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:16.200]  history I've studied it I've been telling you for years but especially the
[03:12:16.200 --> 03:12:21.320]  last few weeks this is a Soviet Union level collapse it's kind of like your
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:26.000]  foundation shifts and starts to crack and they tell you well within a couple
[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:29.240]  years this is gonna fully crack and your house is gonna leak and your house is
[03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:35.440]  gonna then your chimney is gonna fall down and then sure enough later it does
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:40.360]  if you don't fix it the foundation of the New World Order has got giant cracks
[03:12:40.360 --> 03:12:45.040]  in it and they're I can watch them moving I mean they're moving fast it's
[03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:51.000]  they're in trouble and boy you're gonna see some circus stuff going on it's
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:56.320]  gonna look like you know a hundred monkeys trying to run a fire drill or
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:13:00.360]  something with a New World Order I mean they are running around right now and
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:04.560]  they're gonna pull out every stop and they're going to get more delusional and
[03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:10.200]  more out of control because they're the most mentally ill people out there I
[03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:15.680]  mean they are fundamentally screwed up ladies and gentlemen and I've evidenced
[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:20.080]  this with thousands of points but the fact that they would never use DU because
[03:13:20.080 --> 03:13:23.840]  it was a death sentence to our troops until 1990 they had it in the 40s they
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:27.840]  had it but the late 40s meant when I was about 46 they had it deployed as
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:32.640]  emergency backup in Western Europe but the point is there's white papers I
[03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:35.680]  don't always go back to that but the fact that they don't care if reactors
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:40.120]  melt down now in leaks that's not a big deal just smile at public service
[03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:43.440]  announcements just smile you'll be safe and culture seconds it yeah it's good
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:51.760]  for you we've got all this going on all this happening there's like so what of
[03:13:51.760 --> 03:13:57.320]  cancer rates are up 3,000% on average in the West yeah so what of autism shop from
[03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:01.920]  1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50 so what have you know have your families got some
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:06.120]  thing is gonna kill them now just ignore all that mercury's good for you yeah
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:10.640]  DU's good for you so don't worry about al-qaeda don't worry about the NSA
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:18.160]  spying on you without warrants and worry about it and it's it's it's it's the
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:21.480]  madness that emperors get and you've got all these narcissists that feel like
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.200]  they're part of the power structure they're all many means of the dark
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:29.480]  generals that run the New World Order and I don't care if they're an evil Chinese
[03:14:29.480 --> 03:14:35.040]  communist or an evil you know member of NATO from Norway or an evil member of the
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:38.840]  US government or an evil member of the Israeli government or an evil member of
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:43.840]  the Iranian government these spiders look the same act the same are the same
[03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:49.560]  people they're like agent Smith's in the matrix except they all look different
[03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:55.960]  and man I know these people I've spent 18 years dealing with them watching them
[03:14:55.960 --> 03:15:01.520]  and they're like slow-motion giant spiders grabbing and eating people
[03:15:01.520 --> 03:15:04.920]  politically and actually physically in some cases you know sucking everything
[03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:14.760]  out of them I mean I knew 17 years ago that it freaked me out that I discovered
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:18.760]  a program of when people had heart attacks or had cancer surgery that they
[03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:22.000]  would come with elder care grab the husband and wife out and steal their
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:25.520]  house and then their kids would call me or they would call me and say we've paid
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:30.480]  the property tax we don't know why and they'd have a secret auction and sell
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:34.240]  it to members of the county of the city and I found out about it and got I got
[03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:37.000]  death-threaded and stuff but we went down and covered it so they backed off for a
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:40.040]  while I'm told they do it again because I can't cover everything it's like
[03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:44.080]  whack-a-moles like there's 10 million moles popping up I can't hit them all I
[03:15:44.080 --> 03:15:48.240]  need you to start whacking moles you can take down one mole folks you know the
[03:15:48.240 --> 03:15:51.360]  whack-a-mole game I bet you can find a YouTube of a whack-a-mole game you guys
[03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:54.720]  pull it up and show the viewers I'm sure 95% of you know but for those that don't
[03:15:54.720 --> 03:15:59.080]  know the game where the mole pops up if you'll just take down one mole a little
[03:15:59.080 --> 03:16:03.680]  mole then you could take down bigger moles after that we will beat them find
[03:16:03.680 --> 03:16:09.960]  evil find corruption prosecuted what's evil anything the globalist are
[03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:13.560]  pushing is evil anything they're promoting may sound good on the surface
[03:16:13.560 --> 03:16:17.680]  it's bad I mean look if you don't be too intellectual to do this you can
[03:16:17.680 --> 03:16:21.320]  intellectually find why this is true but anything they're pushing you should be
[03:16:21.320 --> 03:16:28.520]  for the opposite they want your guns you should be against it if they want
[03:16:28.520 --> 03:16:34.960]  open borders you should be against it if they want to push sex education on
[03:16:34.960 --> 03:16:38.360]  five-year-olds you should be against it it's not sex education it's sexualizing
[03:16:38.360 --> 03:16:42.840]  your children if they want you to take shots you should be against it if they
[03:16:42.840 --> 03:16:49.080]  want I mean any of it it's all pure bull buy you Genesis that literally one up
[03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:54.520]  each other on how ruthless they are and I see them and the frustrating thing is
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:16:58.040]  they all write white papers bragging about what they've done you can see them
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:05.080]  to you just have to admit they're there I mean take one look at John McCain take
[03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:10.680]  one look at Lindsey Graham take one look at Barack Obama take one look at John
[03:17:10.680 --> 03:17:16.880]  Kerry take one look at all these people and they are the scum of the earth the
[03:17:16.880 --> 03:17:20.080]  British government is always at the tip of the spear warmongering why are they
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:23.520]  against this now and say we won't have further votes no matter what happens we're
[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:27.800]  not going to war because they have got the NSA their own system spying on the
[03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:33.720]  public and they know 98% of Brits are against it folks it isn't 91% of
[03:17:33.720 --> 03:17:38.240]  Americans that are against this it's like 95 and they're trying to convince
[03:17:38.240 --> 03:17:42.860]  people they may get it up to you know 15% the support it I mean it's over if we
[03:17:42.860 --> 03:17:48.800]  want it to be okay now now again we'll still be in a bad situation 10 years
[03:17:48.800 --> 03:17:56.520]  from now humanity is always fighting for survival just surviving is victory not
[03:17:56.520 --> 03:17:59.760]  being overtaken by the spirit of evil we're gonna go to the bottom of the
[03:17:59.760 --> 03:18:04.480]  hour and then in the transmission we're gonna skip this break just being aware
[03:18:04.480 --> 03:18:08.880]  just having your consciousness just not being overtaken and keeping your free
[03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:17.720]  will that is your greatest possession I love the analogy of what would a man
[03:18:18.840 --> 03:18:29.000]  give I mean what would you give to gain the whole world would you give
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:34.080]  everything and some people say yeah I'd give anything to rule the world
[03:18:34.080 --> 03:18:41.760]  anything okay how about your eyes you can rule the world but we're gonna we're
[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:46.120]  gonna surgically remove your eyeballs most people would say oh no way I want
[03:18:46.120 --> 03:18:52.320]  my eyes see being able to see and interpret things and smell and taste and
[03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:58.200]  have have communion with other people that's life and they know that you'd be
[03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:02.440]  fulfilled with that so they create the Madison Avenue situation where you feel
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:07.400]  unfulfilled because you're so you've had your soul sucked out of you and so you
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:12.600]  think you're gonna get your soul back by chasing after the New World Order most
[03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:18.600]  of you can still catch your soul even though it's down the block you can still
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:22.880]  run after it most of you now if you've committed to evil and you like destroying
[03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:25.560]  your soul and destroying other people's souls you've committed the ultimate sin
[03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:30.560]  of refusing the Holy Spirit and willfully saying you want to serve evil
[03:19:30.560 --> 03:19:37.840]  then you're gone and you are of your father so that's where yours that's what
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:43.520]  you're supposed to do that's who you are you were predestined you have free will
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:48.440]  but you were still predestined and that's a paradox but it's not a paradox if you
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:54.000]  study it and show that devil always tells those those of us that love
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:57.920]  liberty love life love justice look how bad you are look at the thoughts you
[03:19:57.920 --> 03:20:01.520]  just have look at what you're doing oh see you're not good oh you're not so so
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:06.560]  you obsess on that and then just say fine I don't care that's the devil's tool
[03:20:06.560 --> 03:20:13.280]  that's the Pharisees tool what matters is your heart getting your heart right
[03:20:13.280 --> 03:20:17.000]  deciding you want to have reality deciding you want justice and then saying
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:26.160]  I'm weak I have free will God come into my heart help me be good cuz see the New
[03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:30.200]  Order doesn't ask today will cheat to get control of you they want your
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:33.800]  consciousness so they can shut it off and take your free will but you have to
[03:20:33.800 --> 03:20:37.320]  the trick is you have to open the door to and be tricked to give them the keys
[03:20:37.320 --> 03:20:41.720]  to free will and then they work 24-7 to hammer it out of you and they can't
[03:20:41.720 --> 03:20:48.000]  stand that it's still in you but the seal of the Almighty God of the universe
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:54.320]  the Creator is on you they're trying to steal you and you just simply have to
[03:20:54.320 --> 03:21:02.520]  say I choose to have you help me give me discernment and give me the will and the
[03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:06.080]  courage and the strength and help me be a good person and then you will have a
[03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:14.320]  conscience but with that you will receive discernment now the question is can
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:18.400]  you handle the discernment I don't blame people that don't want to face
[03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:25.480]  reality because it is it is heavy it's big it's deep it's long it's unending
[03:21:25.480 --> 03:21:30.320]  and I've likened it to the spacewalk analogy you think being at the edge of
[03:21:30.320 --> 03:21:36.320]  the cliff and and seeing eternity there in front of you is is a powerful
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:41.200]  feeling imagine walking out spacewalking with no gravity looking down at the
[03:21:41.200 --> 03:21:48.040]  earth imagine that feeling of being hundreds of miles in the air and how
[03:21:48.040 --> 03:21:53.520]  that crushes your ego but within crushing your ego that then blows it out
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:22:00.240]  and connects you to the whole universe now the question is can you handle that
[03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:06.640]  I'll be honest if I don't have a couple glasses of wine at night or if I start
[03:22:06.640 --> 03:22:12.160]  really exercise and really get myself together I I cannot handle the level of
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:23.000]  intuition the level of discernment the level of of power that is reality the
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:29.440]  the hallucination that is consciousness is so extreme that that's why we all
[03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:34.000]  hurt ourselves and try to dumb ourselves down so the New World Order would
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:38.640]  say it's a gift that they're giving us dumbing us down but really it's not
[03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:43.800]  they're trying to rob us on that process being able to literally go to the
[03:22:43.800 --> 03:22:50.680]  next level but that we have to give into God's plan and so I do not judge
[03:22:50.680 --> 03:22:57.880]  anybody out there it's why they have statistical studies about people with
[03:22:57.880 --> 03:23:02.640]  higher IQs tend to drink more things like that because it's an escape from
[03:23:02.640 --> 03:23:08.600]  reality it's an escape to try to turn it off because there's so much of it the
[03:23:08.600 --> 03:23:12.640]  there's so much happening so much going on so of course people laugh at us when
[03:23:12.640 --> 03:23:15.600]  we warn them about things because they're insecure they're like this guy's
[03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:20.640]  talking fancy words he's trying to make me feel small so I'm gonna laugh at him
[03:23:20.640 --> 03:23:24.680]  and then you know try to act like I'm sure of myself because I'm so scared we
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:27.720]  ought to feel sorry for those people you know what I say when somebody does that
[03:23:27.720 --> 03:23:34.520]  I go I know reality scary I know you're scared I'm scared too sometimes but
[03:23:34.520 --> 03:23:38.720]  you're not gonna feel you're not gonna be fulfilled the path you're on and for
[03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:42.720]  God's sakes you and your wife are pregnant and your wife's pregnant you
[03:23:42.720 --> 03:23:46.680]  got a child coming you better look into vaccines and what they do to people it's
[03:23:46.680 --> 03:23:49.920]  not that vaccine technology couldn't be good it's that the people running it or
[03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:56.500]  bad you know about eugenics uh-huh and when I say eugenics is going on your
[03:23:56.500 --> 03:24:01.880]  first thought is that well there are too many people they're like yeah I am
[03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:05.320]  thinking that but you're not part of the establishment are you then they have
[03:24:05.320 --> 03:24:11.320]  that spark in their eye and they go oh they're like oh oh oh no again it's that
[03:24:11.320 --> 03:24:15.560]  human interaction of letting people in on what's going on and then they let you
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:19.480]  in on stuff that's going on and we help each other and then if somebody who's
[03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:24.280]  evil tries to crush us we we don't enjoy it but God gave us the tools to be more
[03:24:24.280 --> 03:24:28.680]  vicious than they are and so we we defeat them because that's what we've
[03:24:28.680 --> 03:24:32.760]  got to do to protect the innocence but we're not running around trying to attack
[03:24:32.760 --> 03:24:38.920]  the innocence we are designed to go up against the big bad guys folks and it's
[03:24:38.920 --> 03:24:42.640]  when you go up against the big bad guys that you actually go to the next level
[03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:46.680]  because then God's gonna give you the discernment and the energy and the
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:54.560]  protection and the angels you need to carry out that operation you know the
[03:24:54.560 --> 03:25:02.200]  new order calls on their dark angels of sin coming deep from within that's why
[03:25:02.200 --> 03:25:04.560]  they don't want you to know about this because they don't want you to call on
[03:25:04.560 --> 03:25:10.400]  God's angels that have been there from the moment you were formed in your
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:14.840]  mother's womb and and the enemy doesn't want you to know about the war going on
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:20.120]  all around us on this planet in space oh we're on a planet in space ladies and
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:24.160]  gentlemen every culture has known this every culture has described this because
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:29.200]  that's what's going on is a multi-dimensional war that you are in
[03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:34.680]  the middle of in a giant contest walk outside look at the clouds look at the
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:38.400]  Sun look at the birds look at it's just a fabulous incredible thing you're in the
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:44.840]  middle of your board I said I'd go to your calls and I'm just preaching Robin
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:50.320]  Illinois you're on the air welcome I had a couple points I wanted to go over real
[03:25:50.320 --> 03:25:55.400]  quick one of the problems with Syria is this 2010 they've been selling their
[03:25:55.400 --> 03:25:58.280]  gold reserves the globalists are a little afraid that they're going to drive the
[03:25:58.280 --> 03:26:03.520]  price of the gold down another thing to talk smoke down on the pipeline that's
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:08.260]  going from Saudi Arabia to Turkey in December of last year that's when in
[03:26:08.260 --> 03:26:13.240]  January that advised the plan for the chemical attacks and another thing if
[03:26:13.240 --> 03:26:18.160]  I'm not mistaken the Charter for the Federal Reserve is up in December of
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:21.520]  this year that's right and they need to get it all redone and get even more
[03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:25.000]  power and merge it with a new bank of the world and again we talk about how
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:29.280]  they script everything and target it for low-grade morons they've been saying
[03:26:29.280 --> 03:26:33.000]  for almost a year and a half that if there's chemical attacks we're going to
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:36.760]  invade you and then we catch 30 Hottie's doing it the whole thing's totally
[03:26:36.760 --> 03:26:41.760]  scripted out in the open they've been caught that we know that that's the case
[03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:45.520]  but the general public doesn't know that but we stopped this war in Syria here
[03:26:45.520 --> 03:26:50.600]  in just a couple of weeks why can't we stop this said Charter in December by
[03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:57.040]  starting now we've got a few months to stop this they actually reauthorized
[03:26:57.040 --> 03:27:01.240]  it about a decade ago so it's actually in perpetuity right now but the hundred
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:06.280]  year date is a good time to say get rid of it and to bring that up it's hard to
[03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:09.800]  chart is that the Charter's already been re-extended but it is a good time
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:16.040]  symbolically to bring it up God bless you great points Zach in Colorado you're
[03:27:16.040 --> 03:27:22.040]  on the year welcome hey how you doing today Alex I'm alright brother so I had
[03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:25.280]  the first thing I just want to say thank you to you and your crew for everything
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:30.560]  you guys do you guys are awesome the second thing last week you had Roddy
[03:27:30.560 --> 03:27:36.240]  Roddy Piper on and my comment goes into pre-destiny to fight the new world
[03:27:36.240 --> 03:27:41.800]  order um Roddy Roddy Piper of course you know then they live great movie and in
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:48.800]  the mid 90s in the middle of the WCW's popularity they started an
[03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:53.560]  organization called the New World Order I don't know if you recall that yeah I
[03:27:53.560 --> 03:28:00.000]  was with Hulk Hogan yeah yeah well I think it's interesting that those two
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:05.240]  come together you know Roddy Roddy Piper the WCW with the New World Order and
[03:28:05.240 --> 03:28:10.840]  now Roddy Roddy Piper is doing cameo appearance in a video game called
[03:28:10.840 --> 03:28:17.720]  Saints Row the Force and which he helps you fight an overlord which is holding
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:22.760]  the human population in a matrix type setup oh yeah no I should have talked
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:26.320]  to him about that video game no no that's what it's all about I've talked to
[03:28:26.320 --> 03:28:29.240]  people inside the whole wrestling deal they picked up on that cuz the George
[03:28:29.240 --> 03:28:32.920]  Bush senior bringing it up but yeah about how it's this global evil force
[03:28:32.920 --> 03:28:37.180]  New World Order but look at wrestling now where they actually have guys that say
[03:28:37.180 --> 03:28:43.600]  my name they go I don't like Mexicans but I like Alex Jones to like you create
[03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:47.680]  the idea that I'm racist or something if you don't want open borders you know
[03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:54.320]  you're a racist liar so so yeah the Vince McMahon massive propaganda going
[03:28:54.320 --> 03:28:59.040]  on in wrestling and that's what they do and you have to ask why are they doing
[03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:02.120]  that because they're worried about what we're doing here and again I don't say
[03:29:02.120 --> 03:29:05.840]  hey we're a big deal you know just say hey we're a big deal we're in danger
[03:29:05.840 --> 03:29:10.320]  folks but the good news is we're having a big effect thank God I appreciate your
