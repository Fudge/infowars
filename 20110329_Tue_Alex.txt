[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:31.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  Welcome, my friends, welcome, and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  It is Tuesday, the 29th day of March.
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  2011, we're going to be live here for at least the next three hours coming up in the next segment.
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  We're going to have Nigel Farage, a member of the European Union Parliament joining us,
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.000]  who has escoriated the head of the EU, Herman von Rumpi, for just back in December,
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  just three and a half months ago, hanging out with Muammar Gaddafi,
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  and the fact that the West has armed Gaddafi.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  Obviously, we've seen Obama's speech.
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.000]  The media is hailing Obama and the administration as the ones that initiated the rebels, which is actually true.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  The rebels are al-Qaeda-led, just like they used al-Qaeda against the Serbs,
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  just like they used al-Qaeda against the Russians, just like they used al-Qaeda against the American people,
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  so they could destroy the Republic and try to take all of our liberties,
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  stealing them away as fast as they can, and converting our once free Republic to this Panoptagon police state.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  So that is all coming up after the break.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  Then, when Nigel Farage leaves us at the bottom of the hour, I will shift into the biggest news,
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  and I am, of course, proud of the fact that we had this out in the Western media first yesterday
[01:58.000 --> 02:06.000]  at PrisonPlanet.com, meltdown plutonium found in soil and the water, as well, at Fukushima,
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  as cover-up continues. Steve Watson, that was out at noon yesterday,
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  deadly radioactive water leaking into soil, and the ocean was in the Japanese news,
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  but they hadn't made a big deal out of it yet.
[02:19.000 --> 02:28.000]  Well, now today, AFP, Associated Press, Japan on maximum alert over nuclear plant.
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.000]  Japan said today it is on maximum alert over a crippled nuclear plant where highly radioactive water,
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.000]  100,000 times safe levels, has halted repair work, it's so deadly, that if you spend five hours in there,
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.000]  you get 5,000 milliseverts, which the Washington Post reported will kill very quickly,
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  roughly half the people that come in contact with it.
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  It's so radioactive that if you get around it for five hours, you've got a 50-50 chance of it killing you
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  in just a few days or weeks, and obviously those that survive are going to have big problems.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  So they've had to halt repair work there.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  They've got four, excuse me, five of the six reactors that have either exploded or been on fire or are still smoking,
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  and this is pretty much out of the news now.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  You see some reported on it, but it's like, oh, that's in Japan, what are we worried about?
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  We have these reactors built by the same people, General Electric, 23 of the exact same MOCs,
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  Mark I reactors alone.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  The earthquake and tsunami that ravaged Japan's northeast coast, left around 28,000 dead or missing,
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  also knocked out reactor cooling systems at the Fukushima plant, which has leaked radiation into the air and sea.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  The Prime Minister conceded the situation at the coastal atomic power station,
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  remained unpredictable and pledged his government would tackle the problem while in a state of maximum alert,
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  maximum alert, so they're in the maximum crisis right now,
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  and a stop-gap measure contained the crisis at the plant, which they haven't contained.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  Crews have poured thousands of tons of water onto the reactors where fuel rods are thought to have partially melted,
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  that happened two weeks ago, and topped up pools of spent fuel rods.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  But the runoff of the operation has accumulated in the basements of the turbine rooms,
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  connected to three reactors and filled up tunnels,
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  making it too risky for workers to go near the repair cooling systems needed to stabilize the plant.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  You saw all those giant explosions.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  We told you a week and a half ago when they were trying to get power back in there.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  You saw those huge mushroom clouds and explosions.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  Fox News is still rolling footage of the plant before it ever had a problem,
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  like, oh look, it's happy birds are tweeting and singing.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  The place is a complete disaster zone, with hundreds of thousands of spent fuel rods thrown all over the place.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  Radioactive plutonium-laced water and uranium-laced water,
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  a bunch of other isotopes running into the ocean and the aquifer under it.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  It's just absolute bedlam. We'll go to Libya when we come back.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  You've heard me talk about Calden five-star soaps for years.

[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Thank you.
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  We've determined the most influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[07:24.000 --> 07:34.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[07:53.000 --> 08:13.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[08:13.000 --> 08:23.000]  Japan has now announced via their Prime Minister maximum alert uranium plutonium getting in to the groundwater supply.
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.000]  100,000 times safe levels, 1,000 millisieverts an hour, 5 hours of that.
[08:29.000 --> 08:37.000]  The Washington Post radiologist expert reported will roughly kill half the people within just a few weeks that come in contact with it.
[08:37.000 --> 08:47.000]  Just amazing information that's coming up at the end of our interview with Nigel Farage, British politician, former leader of the UK Independence Party,
[08:47.000 --> 08:57.000]  current member of the European Union Parliament from Southeast England, UKIP.org is the UK Independence Party website.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  It's kind of like the Ron Paul version of the anti-New World Order crowd over in England.
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  Great folks and Nigel Farage, I noticed last week, escoriated Herman von Roompi, we're going to play a clip of that coming up,
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  the head of the EU for back in December, holding hands and hugging on Muammar Gaddafi.
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  And we've seen countless other European and American politicians over there saying he was our gallant little ally the last six years after
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  former British Prime Minister at the time Tony Blair made deals with him.
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.000]  It's now in the London Telegraph, Associated Press, New York Times, that yes, the main contingent attacking Gaddafi from the east is al-Qaeda.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  But it's the good al-Qaeda, we're told, and if you're not for al-Qaeda now, you're anti-freedom.
[09:41.000 --> 09:49.000]  So just absolutely amazing and to break this down from the European Union perspective on the heels of Barack Obama's speech,
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  the Washington Post hailing Obama for basically quietly initiating the rebels and giving him the green light.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  British SAS on the ground, we now learn for over a month.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  It is confirmed 2,200 Marines preparing to ground invade, but it's not a war, it's kinetic military action.
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  And if it's a ground invasion, it's part of a humanitarian assistance.
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  So this is not a war, Nigel Farage, is it?
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  I'm afraid it could well be a war. You know, we've started something here, we've no idea where it's going to end.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  I mean, this idea that Gaddafi's a bad man. Look, Gaddafi's been a bad man for 42 years.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  But as you quite rightly say, six years ago, Mr Blair went and hugged him and Mr Berlusconi has been to meet him as well.
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  And our British Commissioner in Europe, Peter Mandelson, went pheasant shooting with his son.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  I mean, we welcome this guy in to the fold. We treated him as a friend and an ally.
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  And as recently as December, the President of the European Union was there, you know, holding hands and being all matey with him.
[10:51.000 --> 10:59.000]  And now we're being told, and Herman Van Rompuy and the British government and the French government are saying, this is all about regime change.
[10:59.000 --> 11:10.000]  We've got to get rid of Gaddafi and we are actively, militarily, supporting the rebels without having had a clue from the start who the rebels are or what their motivations are.
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  Now, if this is for humanitarian reasons, who is to say that if the rebels get to Tripoli that they won't massacre Gaddafi's people?
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  I mean, I just think we've got into something here. We haven't thought it through.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  It's not part of a bigger North African and Middle East strategy and I will seriously regret our actions so far.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  Well, it's confirmed that they lied and said through the British Foreign Ministry that he'd run to Venezuela to destabilize.
[11:38.000 --> 11:51.000]  It's confirmed that he didn't run to Zimbabwe. It's confirmed that he was not strafing crowds of people and they were actually armed groups.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  But we're not saying Gaddafi's a good guy. The point here is we've been told a lot of lies.
[11:56.000 --> 12:08.000]  And as you pointed out, a mainline even BBC has admitted that the rebels in the East are just grabbing people and lining them up and shooting their political enemies.
[12:08.000 --> 12:16.000]  And so this whole line about, oh, we've got to do this for humanitarian reasons. What's the real reason? You're in the EU Parliament.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  I mean, is this about a political distraction from what's happening?
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  Well, you've got to remember that as far as the European Union's concerned, we are in very, very deep crisis over here.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  Already in the space of the last year, we've had to bail out Greece whose presence in the euro wasn't working.
[12:33.000 --> 12:42.000]  We've had to bail out the Irish and we are within days, I would suspect, of having to bail out Portugal with the bigger worry that the Spanish economy,
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  which is about seven times the size of the Irish one, may need bailing out too.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  We're literally running out of money in the European Union to keep this crazy single currency project going.
[12:53.000 --> 13:04.000]  And I think it's been all through the years, you know, a marvelous thing for leaders when they're in real trouble and when public support is waning to head off and have foreign military adventures.
[13:04.000 --> 13:15.000]  And so I do see this as much as anything else as a diversionary tactic, as an attempt to whip up djingoistic support for our boys going into Libya and doing the right thing.
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  And initially, they appeared to have got away with it.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  I suspect, as you say, because they were telling us a pack of lies.
[13:23.000 --> 13:37.000]  But now, I mean, so much so, when the British Parliament, when the House of Commons had a vote on this, only 13 MPs out of 650 voted against military action.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  Such was that sort of lemming-like support amongst our politicians for this enterprise.
[13:43.000 --> 13:56.000]  But I suspect that now, today's report, that there is a presence of al-Qaeda amongst the rebels, the reports that actually, you know, both sides have committed atrocities and they will probably get worse as time goes on.
[13:56.000 --> 14:09.000]  I think that politicians that have launched this into this, thinking it'll increase their popularity, if we're going to send in ground troops as well, who's to say we're not getting ourselves into yet another Afghanistan?
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  And I think politically, this decision will backfire very badly on them.
[14:13.000 --> 14:28.000]  Well, I agree with you, but now we have Senator Lieberman and others saying, this sets a precedent that anytime people rebel in a country, whether it's a good country, bad, whatever, that now the UN will pass a resolution.
[14:28.000 --> 14:40.000]  And in less than 48 hours, the US military was firing cruise missiles, NATO members were dropping bombs, England and France and others.
[14:40.000 --> 14:57.000]  I mean, this is incredible that our Congress, at least in England, you guys had a vote on it, our Congress, I know the UK Independence Party is always talking about how 70 plus percent of the laws that govern England now, you don't even get to vote on in the British Parliament.
[14:57.000 --> 15:13.000]  Well, here, Obama didn't even consult Congress when the law says they've got to give a declaration of war or at least an authorization of force, and our own Congress barely even batted an eye at becoming vestigial or ceremonial.
[15:13.000 --> 15:27.000]  Well, I mean, you know, you are being very badly let down, aren't you, by your congressmen? I mean, they should be standing up and screaming and shouting. Their job is to represent people. Their job is to represent the democratic will.
[15:27.000 --> 15:37.000]  Their job is to have a check and a balance on the executive. And they're clearly, in America right at the moment, totally failing in their duty.
[15:37.000 --> 15:52.000]  And you know, this idea that we've got to support rebellions wherever they may be. But is anybody seriously suggesting that if there's a major uprising in Saudi Arabia and the Saudis shoot a couple of hundred, that we're going to start bombing Saudi Arabia?
[15:52.000 --> 16:10.000]  I mean, are we going to, are we about to launch our own version of Jihad against every regime, every Arab state? I mean, it's absolutely insane. And I cannot, I cannot for the life of me. I mean, I, you know, we've been in Afghanistan for over 10 years.
[16:10.000 --> 16:25.000]  There is no end in sight whatsoever. I cannot believe the public opinion will put up in Britain, America or France without getting involved in a whole series of military conflicts across the Middle East. I think the whole thing is absolutely crazy.
[16:25.000 --> 16:45.000]  Well, you're pointing out how just wild and out of control this is, this new military adventurism, but it's being hailed all over the European papers, U.S. papers, British papers as the new world order, that this is the new cover for, I guess, globalist imperialism,
[16:45.000 --> 16:58.000]  is that they quietly finance rebellions. They use al-Qaeda. They tell us al-Qaeda is now good right out of 1984. And now they're saying, yes, rise up against your government and we'll do a no fly zone.
[16:58.000 --> 17:14.000]  They're openly debating in our news, all over the news channels, how we need to go ahead and attack Syria. I mean, this is starting to look like the makings of a bigger than a regional war. This is, this looks like how World War One or World War Two started.
[17:14.000 --> 17:32.000]  Well, yeah, you know, it's odd, isn't it? You never quite know what will capitalize a bigger conflict. What I do know is that, you know, when World War One started, when World War Two started, the mass of populations in the countries supported the basic aims of the war.
[17:32.000 --> 17:56.000]  All right. Now, the point about this is, whatever the media is saying, whatever the mainstream media is saying, whatever our politicians in Westminster are voting for, however much your congressmen bury their own heads in the sand, you know, I've seen, I mean, there was an opinion poll out in Britain this morning that showed seven out of ten Britons are very worried about the Libyan adventure and deeply concerned that we shouldn't get ourselves further embroiled.
[17:56.000 --> 18:07.000]  So I just don't believe there's public support for this. And, you know, there comes a break point with this, doesn't there? I mean, governments can get away with a hell of a lot. They can lie to us. They can rob us. They can do all sorts of things.
[18:07.000 --> 18:24.000]  But in the end, in the end, they have to get, have consent of some kind. Otherwise, what we're going to see are rebellions of our own, in our own countries, and people will take to the streets and say, we do not wish to get embroiled in regional or possibly even global conflict.
[18:24.000 --> 18:45.000]  Well, that's my next point, Member of European Union Parliament Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party in England. Look, we have 30 million illegal aliens in this country. The Marxist Ford Foundation universities do teach the Southwest, bought from Mexico, from Texas to California is owned by Mexico.
[18:45.000 --> 18:58.000]  There are open calls for rebellion. I know there's giant immigrant populations in Europe that routinely burn large areas of the ground. What would happen under this new UN precedent if they rose up and began burning cities?
[18:58.000 --> 19:11.000]  Would we then see the Russians or the Chinese under the UN who are members come here into a no-fly zone and attack us? Now, obviously, that's absurd, but that's the precedent that's being set here.
[19:11.000 --> 19:25.000]  Yeah, I think that's right, and I think that, I mean, we have some very large Muslim populations in European countries. Mercifully, the vast majority of them are absolutely peaceful and democratic, but we have got some very dangerous minorities.
[19:25.000 --> 19:51.000]  My feeling is that by going to war in the Middle East, all we are likely to do is to give the extremists an excuse, and so you could see two types of demonstration going on in these countries. Firstly, you could see, as you say, Muslim extremists, you know, getting back, and we shouldn't forget that the last time we bombed the colonel back in the mid-80s, it wasn't very long before a 747 landed on the village of Locke.
[19:51.000 --> 20:01.000]  Tell you what, stay there. Final segment, Nigel Farage back in just a few minutes. That's the next point I want to cover. The media is saying, oh, Gaddafi may attack us, then they'll use that to take more of our liberties.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  Freedom, the blistering anti-globalist anthem from the rock band Ravelin.
[20:07.000 --> 20:13.000]  Back in Rome's have their tools.
[20:13.000 --> 20:19.000]  Slakes built empty with the oil.

[21:29.000 --> 21:40.000]  Could this really happen? Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career. He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[21:40.000 --> 21:52.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now. You may never think about America the same way again. You can find the free video at endofamerica3.com.

[22:21.000 --> 22:32.000]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have been reduced to old, relics politicians ignore, trample with their outlandish, overreaching policies. Your support of the Campaign for Liberty stands in the way of this insidious process.

This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency as a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[23:46.000 --> 24:02.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[24:02.000 --> 24:16.000]  Okay, we've only got five minutes left with the UK member of the EU parliament, Nigel Farage. By the way, the Liberty Movement, I was just talking to him during the break, is exploding all over Europe and not just England. Their party is expanding.
[24:16.000 --> 24:36.000]  On May 6 of last year, horrible, devastating plane crash. The pilot barely survived. Nigel was torn up really bad, but he's back. I tell you, talk about stiff upper lip. Nigel finishing up with the terror card. They've said, yes, we're bombarding Gaddafi and blowing up infrastructure.
[24:36.000 --> 24:51.000]  And if he fights back in any way, it's terrorism. And they're talking about that legitimizing a ground invasion if there's any type of terror attack. I wonder if some groups might allow crazies to do something or might open the door. Who knows?
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  Well, they do seem to be very keen to put in ground troops, don't they?
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  Yes.
[24:55.000 --> 25:07.000]  I mean, we've already had the FAS there for some time that we know for a fact. We've got the British Royal Marines getting ready to go. You've got a corps getting ready to go. It's almost as if our government's looking for an excuse to put in ground troops.
[25:07.000 --> 25:26.000]  And I think, you know, I really feel that we have got to put pressure on our politicians, real pressure on our politicians. And I think if there's any prospect of some major escalation of us getting involved in a huge, huge conflict across the Middle East, we've got to take to the streets.
[25:26.000 --> 25:44.000]  We've got to take to the streets millions of us. And we've got to march and we've got to say, not in my name, we do not give consent for endless war and endless conflict, especially because whether it's Al Qaeda and the rebels or Gaddafi, they may both be as bad as each other.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  And clearly, it's not in our national interest to get involved in these conflicts.
[25:49.000 --> 26:05.000]  But we're now hearing from Obama and others that this is a great moment for globalism, for the New World Order, where the UN gives the orders and our militaries go in. I mean, is this not more of this expansion of undemocratic power similar to how the EU runs England?
[26:05.000 --> 26:22.000]  It is a classic case of what we call the beneficial crisis. Whatever the crisis, it's used by big government, it's used by supranational, global government as an excuse to say, look, we're doing the right thing and to take more powers and to further rob us of our democracy.
[26:22.000 --> 26:38.000]  This perhaps what is happening now looks like the most extreme example of it that we've had to date. And we've got to resist. We've, as I said earlier, we've got to take to the streets. We've got to withdraw our democratic consent from politicians who were not prepared to stand up and fight this.
[26:38.000 --> 26:54.000]  Well, notice a few weeks ago, Obama didn't even want to give a speech or comment on Libya, and they reported that he had to give this speech last night and that it was, quote, a hard sell because people aren't for it. Then I saw a Reuters poll claiming that 60 plus percent supported it.
[26:54.000 --> 27:03.000]  But then I read the poll, it just asked, you know, what option you thought they should use in war. It didn't even let people have a decision to say no.
[27:03.000 --> 27:15.000]  Yeah, well, as I say, overnight in Britain, there's a poll out being conducted by one of our TV channels showing that seven out of 10 people in Britain are deeply worried and want no further escalation.
[27:15.000 --> 27:27.000]  And I would reckon that's a pretty accurate opinion poll amongst ordinary people. Sadly, amongst our so-called mainstream media and politicians, that message hasn't yet got through. It's got to.
[27:27.000 --> 27:39.000]  Nigel, I'm going to put on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers, for radio listeners that can just search the term Hermann von Rümpi, Muammar Gaddafi, and they'll see the photos of the hugging and the shaking hands and the rest of it.
[27:39.000 --> 27:52.000]  But politicians in England and other countries that were cozy to Hitler early on, they were excoriated and removed or just resigned, but we're not seeing resignations by Labour Party that's been lavishing Gaddafi in England.
[27:52.000 --> 28:05.000]  We're not seeing any of these EU pimps like Sarkozy or Rümpi stepping down. In fact, they're grandstanding and quite proud of the fact that just months ago they were lipped, locked with him.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  I mean, are you calling for them to resign?
[28:09.000 --> 28:27.000]  I am, of course I am. I mean, I think their hypocrisy beggars belief. But you know, sometimes these things take a bit longer. I mean, your comment about Hitler is, of course, right. I mean, virtually the entire upper class of Britain were taken in by Hitler, thought he was absolutely wonderful.
[28:27.000 --> 28:44.000]  The BBC thought he was terrific. Our King even went to visit him. Our Parliament thought he was wonderful. And Churchill, Winston Churchill, and about 20 backbench members of Parliament were derided as being insane, eccentric, warmongers.
[28:44.000 --> 28:53.000]  In the end, they were right. And in the end, the bad guys lost their jobs. And I think the same is going to happen again. It just may take a little bit longer than we'd like.
[28:53.000 --> 29:04.000]  Well, the comparison is certainly there. I mean, if they're going to say Gaddafi's this devil, but then be prancing around with him just months ago, they need to resign. I mean, this is outrageous.
[29:04.000 --> 29:26.000]  It is sickening hypocrisy in every way. At the moment, they're being allowed to get away with it. And I look at our mainstream news channels across here, and nobody is asking the right questions. It's all being presented on our TV screens as if we're doing some wonderful social good.
[29:26.000 --> 29:37.000]  The rebels are the good guys. Gaddafi's the bad guy. As we've learned today, it isn't as simple as that. And again, you know, to get changed, we've got to be prepared to stand up and share.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  Absolutely. UKIP.org. Nigel Farage, member of European Parliament. Thank you, sir.
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  We'll be back, folks.
[29:45.000 --> 29:57.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:00.000 --> 31:08.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[31:08.000 --> 31:16.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[31:16.000 --> 31:24.000]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.000]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[31:38.000 --> 31:47.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[32:31.000 --> 32:59.000]  Let's talk to the owner of 5starsope, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[33:02.000 --> 33:24.000]  Devastating globalist lies, exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine, tirelessly waging war on corruption, from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:24.000 --> 33:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:55.000 --> 34:19.000]  I want to go over what's happened in Libya, what this means for global government, what the clear strategy and deceptive strategy and gambit is designed to do after I play Senator Rand Paul's response to Obama last night.
[34:19.000 --> 34:34.000]  I'm going to shift gears into the nuclear disaster Japan on maximum alert confirming the news that came out two days ago of 100,000 times safe levels of radioactivity coming out, getting into the groundwater of Japan.
[34:34.000 --> 34:49.000]  And the evacuation of many areas of Japan is accelerating. The US military is quietly trying to force many Americans out of Japan. They are covering up. I mean, it's coming out in the mainstream media, but they're not focusing on it.
[34:49.000 --> 35:03.000]  And they're announcing how critical it is, but they're not pointing out to the general public and not giving the attention to it that it deserves. They're just calmly talking about it like it's no big deal.
[35:03.000 --> 35:13.000]  And it's a huge, huge issue to the economy, to the Japanese people. It's not just the economy of Japan, but worldwide. I've got a lot of police state news.
[35:13.000 --> 35:22.000]  I've got globalist bid to ban cars as part of planopolis agenda. They're already teaching school kids in Europe and the US that they're going to ban cars soon.
[35:22.000 --> 35:34.000]  The head of the transportation department last year did say in the New York Times that cars are the enemy, that all these agendas are anti-car, that they do want to increase fuel prices, that they do want to shut down our coal powered system.
[35:34.000 --> 35:43.000]  So we're completely dependent on the globalist Obama pushing to legalize the illegal aliens and continue the North American Union merger.
[35:43.000 --> 35:53.000]  The feds are moving to throw out Jesse Ventura's lawsuit against the TSA. He is scheduled to be on next week. We need to double confirm that because he's just now about to get back to the US from Mexico.
[35:53.000 --> 36:04.000]  All of that is coming up. And in the second and third hour today, we're going to have wide open telephones. But I don't want you to have to sit there on hold. At the start of the next hour, I will give the number out.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  Everybody's welcome to call in then with any item, any news story, anything you wish to discuss.
[36:08.000 --> 36:36.000]  But I wanted to, before I go into some of Obama's speech and things he said last night, I wanted to have Senator Rand Paul, who's trying to cut the spending by $500 billion when the rest are only pushing for $100 billion, who is pushing to abolish the Federal Reserve or at least audit it, who is against these new wars, who is really proving to be a chip off the old block from his father and quite frankly, out of the gates and even better speaker.
[36:36.000 --> 36:52.000]  So, a very exciting to see Rand Paul and the work that he's doing. Of course, he plays along a bit with the narrative about Al Qaeda and why are we backing Al Qaeda. They are backing Al Qaeda, but he's saying, well, these are the people that attacked us.
[36:52.000 --> 37:10.000]  Well, actually British SAS got caught in 2006. London Guardian reported dressed up as Al Qaeda shooting Shiites to get sectarian war going in Basra. Al Qaeda was used to attack the Serbs. Al Qaeda was used to attack, of course, the Russians.
[37:10.000 --> 37:29.000]  Al Qaeda, led by Amor Amalaki, is working for the Pentagon, AP Fox News, running all the major attacks in the U.S. and Europe. And he's always protected. Just like Rasheun Aswat was caught and was in the major British papers, being MI6 running the 7-7 attacks.
[37:29.000 --> 37:42.000]  See, a lot of times they have moron-level real jihadists who don't know they're working for globalists who are funding them and posing with their big beards and their turbines and giving them the money.
[37:42.000 --> 37:50.000]  In other cases, they think they're taking part in anti-terror drills. They're given satchels or they're told to do drills on aircraft and then you know the rest of the story.
[37:50.000 --> 38:08.000]  And that's come out time and time again. Operation Northwoods talks about how to frame patsies in bombings of U.S. cities, hijacked jets, shootings that the Pentagon would carry out with troops dressed up as foreign enemies as a pretext to basically destroy the Republic.
[38:08.000 --> 38:20.000]  You see, look at third-world countries. Look at Rome with Julius Caesar. Look at Hitler. They always use the military in the name of fighting an outside threat to take over.
[38:20.000 --> 38:41.000]  Burning their own Reichstag, February 27, 1933. 1939, Gliwitz to launch the attack on Poland in the German documents. The Germans on the Polish border took a few prisoners of a concentration camp, dressed them up in Polish uniforms, shot them, dressed a few up in German uniforms, shot them,
[38:41.000 --> 38:54.000]  and then shot newsreels at the Poles with their horse-drawn artillery had attacked the military communications base.
[38:54.000 --> 39:02.000]  And you know what happened next. See, people just think Hitler just attacked Poland. Go read the history. He attacked when the Poles launched a sneak attack.
[39:02.000 --> 39:14.000]  It's the oldest trick in the book. And the people running our country are the terrorists. They're not our government. They're not legitimate. They are doing everything they can to destroy this Republic.
[39:14.000 --> 39:31.000]  Don't forget that. And they are sifting through the military and police ranks and corporate ranks with InfraGuard and the clergy's ranks to find people that want to be anti-American spies, terrorists, controllers for the full martial law takeover that they're setting up.
[39:31.000 --> 39:47.000]  And if you don't think it can happen here, Major General Spendley Butler, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner who'd overthrown countless third-world countries for the gunboat diplomacy system that our country had then back in the 20s and 30s,
[39:47.000 --> 40:04.000]  he was approached by Prescott Bush, by the Harramans, by others. There were Congressional hearings on this to lead a group of 500,000 former and current military and police who'd already been recruited to overthrow the U.S. government and merge with Hitler.
[40:04.000 --> 40:11.000]  You just heard Nigel Farage, member of the European Union Parliament from England, talk about the majority of the British government wanted to merge with Hitler.
[40:11.000 --> 40:26.000]  This was a major move, but instead the equally bad socialist position themselves to then fight against Hitler when they'd actually been involved financing him from the beginning.
[40:26.000 --> 40:38.000]  This is the extremely sophisticated strategy of the New World Order. They call it full spectrum dominance. That doesn't just mean air, land, sea communications, but info war.
[40:38.000 --> 40:49.000]  But they use the weapon of lies. We use the far more powerful weapon of truth. But full spectrum dominance means controlling all sides, funding the foreign armies, funding the terrorists.
[40:49.000 --> 40:58.000]  It goes back to the Rothschilds and others, going back over 300 years, financing both sides in every major European conflict. Who wins, they do.
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  This is the system. And as soon as you figure that out, you understand it all. Then it makes perfect sense.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  Again, how long have I told you Al Qaeda works for the West? Now they're out in the open going, yeah, they're Al Qaeda. So what?
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  Yeah, Saudi Arabia ship it in weapons. So what? Forget about it. Move along. Nothing to see here.
[41:17.000 --> 41:30.000]  All right, here is Rand Paul's little five minute response to Obama's ridiculous, grandstanding speech. He's the big humanitarian with all these wars. Here it is.
[41:30.000 --> 41:39.000]  The president of the United States often faces unforeseeable dilemmas that demand tough decisions based on reliable intelligence.
[41:39.000 --> 41:52.000]  The recent events in Libya presented President Obama with such a scenario. But how our commander in chief chose to handle this new dilemma raises serious questions about his understanding of constitutional checks and balances.
[41:52.000 --> 42:03.000]  Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi is every bit the madman Ronald Reagan once said he was. But are the rebels adherence to Jeffersonian democracy or bin Laden's radical jihad?
[42:03.000 --> 42:19.000]  In 2007, then candidate Obama said that the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.
[42:19.000 --> 42:33.000]  I agree with the candidate Obama. Unfortunately, President Obama has failed to heed his own advice. He has ignored our Constitution and engaged us in a military conflict without congressional debate and approval.
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  What imminent threat did Gaddafi or Libya pose to the United States?
[42:37.000 --> 42:49.000]  Obviously, the decision to take military action of this magnitude is something that should not be taken lightly and should first require determining whether it is in the United States' vital national interest.
[42:49.000 --> 42:56.000]  Over the weekend, even Defense Secretary Robert Gates admitted that America has no vital interest in Libya.
[42:56.000 --> 43:09.000]  Our brave men and women in uniform are patriotic defenders of our nation. They are members of the greatest military in the world, and in times of war, I am confident of their willingness and ability to ensure that our vital interests are protected.
[43:09.000 --> 43:20.000]  But they should not be asked to be nation builders or the world's policemen, and they should serve in wars authorized and called for by the United States Congress, not the United Nations.
[43:20.000 --> 43:35.000]  At the moment, there are uprisings taking place across the Middle East. The problem with sending U.S. military to help rebels in Libya or anywhere else is that we are taking sides in a conflict and on behalf of a people whom we know nothing about.
[43:35.000 --> 43:44.000]  When or if there is regime change in Libya, what kind of leadership exactly will replace Gaddafi? Who are the Libyan rebels exactly?
[43:44.000 --> 43:53.000]  The Daily Telegraph reported over the weekend that some Libyan rebel leaders now claim they have members of al Qaeda within their ranks and are glad to have them.
[43:53.000 --> 44:03.000]  Why do we have American soldiers, our best and bravest, helping people in Libya who may be the very same people we ask our military to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq?
[44:03.000 --> 44:14.000]  Intervening in a civil war in a tribal society in which our government admits that we have no vital interest to help people we do not know simply does not make any sense.
[44:14.000 --> 44:30.000]  Libyan society is complicated and we simply do not know enough about the potential outcomes or leaders to know if this will end up in the interest of the United States or if we are in fact helping to install a radical Islamic government in place of a secular dictatorship.
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  Of even more lasting concern is how our troops were committed to this battle by President Obama.
[44:35.000 --> 44:44.000]  The founding fathers understood the seriousness of war and thus included in our Constitution a provision stating that only Congress can declare war.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  The decision to wage war should not be taken cavalierly.
[44:47.000 --> 44:59.000]  As Madison wrote, the Constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war and most prone to it.
[44:59.000 --> 45:05.000]  It has accordingly, with studied care, vested the question of war in the legislature.
[45:05.000 --> 45:16.000]  If President Obama had consulted Congress, as our Constitution requires him to do, perhaps we could have debated these questions before hastily involving ourselves in yet another Middle Eastern conflict.
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.000]  While the President is the commander of our armed forces, he is not a king.
[45:21.000 --> 45:30.000]  He may involve those forces in military conflict only when authorized by Congress or in response to an imminent threat. Neither was the case here.
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  We are already in two wars that we are not paying for.
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.000]  We are waging war across the Middle East on a credit card, one whose limit is rapidly approaching.
[45:40.000 --> 45:46.000]  We already borrow money from countries like China to pay for our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.000]  Should we continue borrowing money and saddling future generations with debt to pay for our current actions in Libya?
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.000]  The subtext to the President's speech concerning Libya tonight was, what if we had done nothing?
[45:59.000 --> 46:05.000]  But a better question might be, what if helping Libya's interests actually hurts America's interests?
[46:05.000 --> 46:11.000]  What if we are sending our military to places where we might actually be helping the same terrorists we fight in other countries?
[46:11.000 --> 46:20.000]  It's time that we re-examine these policies, but once again consulting the Constitution on such matters and the common sense principles that made this country great.
[46:20.000 --> 46:29.000]  We can no longer afford to spend what we don't have, and we can't afford to address every other nation's problems before we address our own.
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.000]  Over the coming days and weeks, Congress will force President Obama to confront these questions.
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.000]  Our brave young men and women have answered the call of duty time and time again over the past decade.
[46:41.000 --> 46:54.000]  Our soldiers deserve, at the very least, that before we send them into a third war, that Congress, the People's House, deliberate, debate, and decide whether this war is in our vital national interest.
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.000]  Thank you for listening tonight, and God bless the United States of America.
[46:59.000 --> 47:10.000]  All right, that's Senator Rand Paul laying it all out. Here are some of the headlines Washington Times Anti-Genocide Advocate Credits Obama for Libyan Uprising.
[47:10.000 --> 47:15.000]  Well, no kidding, Western powers run by the bankers, went in there, and started this whole thing.
[47:15.000 --> 47:21.000]  It's like they admit they started Egypt to kick out their old dictator, and now they've completely banned all protesting.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  The Financial Times of London has reported, and they're reportedly raping the women.
[47:26.000 --> 47:35.000]  Just like they kick Saddam, their old propped up dictator out, and put in new corrupt systems that are enslaving the people of Iraq.
[47:35.000 --> 47:43.000]  The globalists don't want liberty or freedom in place, and they've lied to us and said this isn't a war, it's a kinetic military action.
[47:43.000 --> 47:52.000]  They've said, oh, we don't want ground troops who want a humanitarian force on the ground, as British Marines mass in ships, and U.S. Marines mass in ships.
[47:52.000 --> 48:01.000]  And the Marines have gotten the internal memo and haven't even been told to lie. Their officers have come out even a week ago and again today and said, yeah, we're preparing the land.
[48:01.000 --> 48:11.000]  We're preparing to go in. They're massing troops off the coast and still telling you it's not a war as they bomb the daylights out of the country every single day.
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  Now, you think about that, even if you're for this war, they're lying to you. I mean, do you like being lied to?
[48:17.000 --> 48:24.000]  This is about global government and setting the precedent that the globalists can institute a rebellion with their operatives in a country.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  Sure, a lot of the folks are mad, have a reason to be angry, they join in, and the globalists can then take over country after country.
[48:31.000 --> 48:44.000]  And here's what's in the news today. The globalists have already in the east set up a new central bank controlled by the IMF and World Bank, and a new oil company to basically give the globalists the oil, to then fund the ongoing rebel operations.
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.000]  They're all ready doing it. When the Serbs got bombed into submission, they then accepted a foreign central bank.
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  They then accepted the loan sharking loans to get them into debt. Whether these countries are good, bad, whatever they are.
[48:59.000 --> 49:12.000]  The issue is the global imperium is going in and taking over every sovereign country left on earth, marching towards Damascus and Syria, openly talking about no fly zones and invasions there in the south,
[49:12.000 --> 49:26.000]  openly talking about going into Iran. Two and a half years ago, the globalists admittedly launched those rebellions in Iran, trying to overthrow that government, hoping that that government would then launch military attacks back or terror attacks,
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  so they could take more of our liberties here and launch a bigger war. I mean, you can see how the new world order is going to take over countries now.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  They just fund some rebels, then say they're humanitarians, they could even be al-Qaeda. We're told they're the good guys.
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.000]  If you're not for al-Qaeda, you're with the terrorists. This is how crazy this is. This is how unconstitutional this is.
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.000]  This is how dumb the system thinks you are. But Obama last night again strongly defended the military action.
[49:53.000 --> 49:59.000]  The Associated Press calls it a war that's been launched. I thought it's a kinetic military action.
[49:59.000 --> 50:07.000]  Obama says Libyan civilian massacre would have stained world conscience, kind of like the UN organized massacre we now learn.
[50:07.000 --> 50:14.000]  They didn't just stand by. They ran it in Rwanda to get rid of the Christians. You mean like that one? Hundreds of thousands dead.
[50:14.000 --> 50:22.000]  Again, here's Reuters. US says Libyan rebels may sell oil. They're setting up their new globalist-run oil company. Here's another one.
[50:22.000 --> 50:31.000]  Wow, that was fast by the Economic Collapse blog at infowars.com. Libyan rebels have already established a new central bank of Libya.
[50:31.000 --> 50:39.000]  Oh, guess what? Qaddafi had their own government run bank. It wasn't run by foreign bankers. Oh, look at Ireland. It's been taken over by foreign banks now.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  The head of their Federal Reserve said it was good to, quote, be run by foreign banks. Yes, it's good.
[50:44.000 --> 50:53.000]  Radiation's good for you. Tyranny's good for you. TSA sticking their hands down your pants is good for you. Not having freedom is good for you.
[50:53.000 --> 51:01.000]  Having foreign banks own you is good for you. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break to get into the reactors.
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  Could this really happen? Well the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[52:34.000 --> 52:40.000]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[52:40.000 --> 52:46.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now.

[54:16.000 --> 54:31.000]  Your own personal Jesus, someone to hear your prayers, someone who cares.
[54:31.000 --> 54:47.000]  So bottom line, this entire invasion is the new world order globalist model to invade and take countries over. If they can't have rebels overthrow the government outright and that fails, then they back it up with military action.
[54:47.000 --> 55:06.000]  And that's all that's happening here and it's a huge destabilization program and it sets the precedent for other countries, not just what happened with Serbia, but the United States, you name it, if the UN says, hey, we like these rebels, even if they're al-Qaeda or illegal aliens, whatever the case is, we're going to support this happening
[55:06.000 --> 55:19.000]  and your government has no authority. It is a huge, huge development and on top of it, we have the president not even consulting the Congress. Just amazing that this is happening.
[55:19.000 --> 55:31.000]  We're going to have open phones on Libya, on the dollar, on George Soros, openly announcing a new Bretton Woods 2 at the original hotel resort where the dollar was set up as the World Reserve Currency.
[55:31.000 --> 55:38.000]  We're having all the big banking ads come to decide how to move away from the dollar. That's in the Wall Street Journal, you name it.
[55:38.000 --> 55:47.000]  This is openly happening. The war is being used as a distraction for the imploding economy. We've got all that news and information we're going to be covering.
[55:47.000 --> 56:08.000]  And going back to what is currently unfolding in Japan, and now 17 days into this crisis, Japan on maximum alert over nuclear plant, their prime minister has come out and said that they are on maximum alert because of 100,000 times safe levels of uranium, plutonium,
[56:08.000 --> 56:18.000]  now getting into the ground and groundwater, just horrible news. But we knew this weeks ago, they're pumping in seawater on top of these five reactors.
[56:18.000 --> 56:28.000]  They can't get electricity hooked back up because even though they ran a new electricity line that was knocked over by the tsunami and earthquake, that the pumps are all smashed.
[56:28.000 --> 56:40.000]  They've now had to again pull back the workers because the radiation is so high that you get a lethal dose in five hours. You get 1,000 millisieverts an hour. That's 5,000 in five hours.
[56:40.000 --> 56:55.000]  This situation is out of control. And if you've got five reactors that have partially melted down or exploded and fuel rods thrown in every different direction, what do you think is going to happen if they can't even get the crews in there to try to even dump concrete on it?
[56:55.000 --> 57:14.000]  And besides below that is the groundwater table. Large areas of Japan are going to be uninhabitable. And you criticize it. George Monbiot, the big liberal world population reduction rock star comes out and says you're an idiot and that he loves nuclear power now.
[57:14.000 --> 57:26.000]  Just nonsensical in your face. No intellectual debate. He's the boss. You must do what he says. And culture on the fake right. Same thing. It's good for you. Shut up. You're crazy. You won't get cancer now.
[57:26.000 --> 57:38.000]  Yeah, five hours of this and you've got a 50% chance of dying in just a few weeks, even the Washington Post admits. But let's just forget all that because and culture and the nuclear lobby and Monbiot on the left, they say it's fine.
[57:38.000 --> 57:51.000]  They wave their magic wand. And if you don't like radiation now, if you think do use bad for the troops, if you don't want the military to have a shooting range outside your town using it and getting into your groundwater, you're bad.
[57:51.000 --> 58:05.000]  You're bad. You're bad for being informed. You're bad for caring. You're bad for actually doing research. Just sit down. Shut up. Breathe deeply. Give water to your kids filled with radiation. It's fun. It's nutritious.
[58:05.000 --> 58:21.000]  Let the TSA put you in their baking machines, their, their, their, their microwave machines. Doesn't matter if they lied about the radiation levels as well. Doesn't matter if it's leaking out and splattering the people that work at the TSA. Just magic wand. It's good for you.

[58:51.000 --> 59:06.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[59:06.000 --> 59:24.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[59:24.000 --> 59:42.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  And so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  We are now live into our number two. We're going to be taking your phone calls. And then coming up, more on Obama's speech last night and how they're hailing war's invasions, imperial takeovers as good.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  They have rebels that the globalist finance attack. And if they're unable to overthrow the country like they were Egypt, they invade. They start bombing and then they invade.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  And then they lie and say it's not a war when we're bombing them. We're not going to invade with ground troops, but we do want to have a humanitarian ground force. The Marines are standing by.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  That's how stupid they think you are. The latest on what's happening in Fukushima 100,000 times. Safe levels of radiation. Maximum alert, the prime minister says. Also, globalist bid to ban cars.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Part of a plantopolis agenda. The EU's openly announced they will begin banning cars. You cannot make this stuff up. It's so incredible.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  TSA moves against Jesse Ventura's suit against them trying to have a thrown out of court. That's all coming up. The Syrian cabinet has resigned amid huge protest.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Remember when Haji Mubarak wouldn't resign after a month long globalist orchestrated protest. He just suddenly had a stroke and we've never seen again. Who knows if he's even alive.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  You got to love that works well. So we're going to take a lot of your phone calls right now and then the bottom of the hour get back into some of the other news we haven't covered yet.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air. Alex, are you sir? Good. Alex, I'm calling about your interview with Larry Pratt yesterday. You know, the Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry down in Arizona, that was basically murdered.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  That family should file murder charges on the ATF. That's right. It's reportedly guns that ATF shipped into Mexico allowed to be shipped in that were then used to kill him.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Exactly. And that family should like file charges or murder charges against the ATF, man. And that's just, I mean, that that's that's wrong, brother.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And what they did and what he did standing up for Obama last night, that was pathetic, trying to look like a real American. You know, our boys die because Alex, I was in Marine Corps and we were when we were sent down to Panama.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  And that was all over Noriega and drug deals and cartels. And they're doing the same thing. And they claimed it was to save two college girls.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  And when they finally got him, they said we weren't held captive. It was all made up. Yes, sir. But anyway, it's just, I think they should file murder charges on the ATF along with a couple other agents that's been killed down there.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  And because my daughter's in the Border Patrol, bilingual, and, you know, I think they should file murder charges on them or at least call Congressman representatives and get it underway.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  I know Larry and his group, gun owners, is trying to do it, but we need to just stay on top of them and God bless you for your work, Alex.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Well, very well said, Joe. Thank you. We hope your daughter's safe down there doing something that's actually constitutional under the federal government's auspices. The feds do everything they're not supposed to do under the Constitution,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  including following UN orders, and then won't allow the three things the federal government has purview to engage in for that to be properly carried out.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  And it's because they want to merge the U.S. with Mexico and Canada, and it has been confirmed now, it's all over the mainstream news, Ottawa Citizen, you name it, that they've signed deals with the Pentagon and foreign governments to use, quote,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  foreign troops from Canada and Mexico to, quote, deal with insurrection and civil unrest with the American people. I mean, it's just unbelievably, incredibly treasonous things are going on out in the open, and it doesn't happen where the bang,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  it happens with a whimper. It's like people email me constantly. It's one of these false memes out there of Alex. Where's the martial law?
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  Well, I don't know, when the banks steal the veteran's death benefits secretly, and it comes out, nobody gets in trouble, and 27, 23.7 trillion plus has been stolen.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  They won't say where the money went, and they've got TSA running checkpoints on the highways, and the federal government, the ATFs ordering gun dealers to not do certain sales, even though there's no law.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  I mean, that's what martial law is, but they never announce it. They just slowly unfold these systems.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  Close the doors and shut them down tomorrow. I'm looking for America.

[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Land on the free and the home of the brave. Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone. Long gone. But I know in my heart it's still a little bit.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Again, go to busit.com forward slash America today.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Alex has told you about the terrible perfect storm of rising food prices. The Japanese tragedy proves how important food is. Our own gas prices are driving food costs through the roof.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  The huge population countries are buying up American unprotected exports of food. The falling dollars inflating food prices.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Ethanol subsidies are driving fuel and food costs to all-time highs. We are experiencing the greatest explosion of food shortages and food prices America has ever seen.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  Folks, you have to freeze the cost and availability of your food now.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Through March 31st, eFoodsDirect has free shipping on all orders. You can freeze the cost and availability of your food and have it shipped free. Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  Free shipping ends March 31st 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  What's happening is the system is keeping the people in the dark. They call a military bombardment, kinetic military action. They say it's not a war.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  U.S. and British Marines massing by the thousands in troop landing ships off the coast of Tripoli in the Mediterranean and the Marines openly saying they're preparing to invade.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  That's not a ground force. That's a peace force. See the U.N. is all about peace when they kill hundreds of thousands of Christians in Rwanda and set up checkpoints not letting the Christian people out.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  So that the Hutus could come in and kill them. This is how the U.N. operates all over the world because it's just a receivership arm created by the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, openly.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  David Rockefeller's bragged about this in his memoirs. In fact, IIMG, this morning, I quote by David Rockefeller. We actually have his book back there somewhere about how he admits world government and that's what he wants.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  And that, you know, he's guilty as charged. We've read it many times on air, but it's always important to read it again because that's what this system is.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  The U.N. is a corporate, piratical receivership arm to take over this planet. We're going to continue to cover the latest developments in the economy, the TSA, the police state, globalist bid to ban cars as part of
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  planopolis agenda. BBC reports UK rejects EU call for city center ban on petrol cars, but the EU is going ahead with it saying that their parliament is under their control.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  This is their goal. A post-industrial world shutting down civilization. The bankers are waging war against the real economy, against real wealth.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  They want you as destitute people they can control. Let's go back to your calls.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  Victoria in Montana. Victoria, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Thank you. What I wanted to say was I think that the main reason why the Federal Reserve is trying to enslave the people of the world is because they know that they get their power and money from the United States mostly.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  In 2012, their contract expires that Woodrow Wilson signed into law in 1913, selling us down the river as a country.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  That's right. Let me stop you. It's totally key. The Federal Reserve 100-year anniversary is coming up in just about a year from now.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  Of course, 1913. And they know that that is basically running out at the end of 2012 in about a year and three quarters.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  They know that's coming to an end. That's why they've set up Bretton Woods too with George Soros running it, openly announcing that they want to get rid of the dollar.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  And then the dollar is the only thing we have left in this fiat system to keep buying all the international goods we need. And if folks think the depression is bad now and 44 million Americans on food stamps is bad now, they haven't seen anything yet.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  These globalists have got us completely like a boa constrictor, captures a little piglet, wrapped up in their coils, and we've got to get out of it. Go ahead.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  That's right. And they know that the American people will never allow them to renew that kind of tyranny again since you and people like G. Edward Griffin and other people have exposed them.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  So they're trying to push us into a one-world bank and in one-world order so they can keep their control over the whole planet. And that's why they're attacking, like you said.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  And by the way, they're openly announcing that everywhere. They're admitting world government run by private bankers. You'll pay all these excise taxes. You'll pay national sales taxes, VAT. You'll pay carbon taxes to the private crux.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  I mean, it's so incredible how naked it is, how ridiculously corrupt and fraudulent. And if we just get the word out, they're going to fail.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  That's right. That's right because there are nothing but a bunch of parasitical criminals that feeds off honest people that work and do what's right. And the United Nations, there are nothing but criminals that attack people.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  Well, look at that. The UN gets caught running white slavery rings worldwide. Every time I say white slavery, I get emails saying, what about black slavery?
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  Those white slavery is sexual slavery, okay? Sex slaves. The UN, it isn't about color, has been caught. Every country they're in doing it, loading the little kids and women up that are kidnapped on jets, flying them to Saudi Arabia,
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Israel's big into it, Indonesia, a bunch of other countries are involved in it, Thailand. I mean, these people have gotten away with murder, with the most wicked things you can imagine.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  Dincor, Halliburton, Chicago Tribune, white slavery rings. Everywhere the UN goes, they're caught murdering, massacring, torturing. I mean, their armies are just an army of murderous trash.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  I mean, it is the most wicked, quasi-mercenary group you can imagine. The UN's sent into Africa routinely. If some African nation tries to mine their own diamonds, they call them blood diamonds and make movies about how horrible it is.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  It isn't part of the De Beers Oppenheimer monopoly. And they send in UN troops to bomb and slaughter everyone. I mean, they send in French troops. I mean, it's private megabanks that run our armies.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  It's very simple. And now they're signing the deals. They're official to use foreign troops in America, AP, Ottawa citizen, Pentagon press releases, FEMA press releases.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  We show them here. We cover them. And it's so huge. It's so over the top. People don't even know how to respond, Victoria. Anything else?
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  It's just terrible. What I think is that we need to bring all of our troops home and we need to make Ron Paul president so we can get our country back.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  Exactly. I appreciate your call. And what they're doing is setting the president first, oh, we don't declare war anymore, even though that's illegal.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Then, oh, we get at least a resolution for force. Now we don't do that. Now the president says, Lord UN, what do I do? You attack. Yes, sir. Boom. Launch the attack.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  Boom. I mean, world government is here. The World Trigger Organization has all the power now over our trade. Congress has signed it away.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  The Congress is just a bunch of crooks by and large collecting big payoffs and their wives and husbands and children, you know, get half million dollar a year salaries at the defense contractors, you know, that they sit on the committees for to get them the money.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  I mean, it's just wall to wall corruption, bankrupting everything, because that's towards the end game to make the money while they're bankrupting us.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  Then once they bankrupt as they hold this hostage and say, we're going to raise your taxes, you're going to live under austerity. It's for the earth. Everything goes to us now.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  And then they use the bankruptcy as a way to bring the country into receivership, just like Germany at the end of World War One, the Versailles Treaty.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Stephen in North Carolina, you're on the air. Good afternoon, Alex. How are you doing? I'm doing all right. I just wanted to make a quick statement and then I had a question for if that'd be all right.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  Yes.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  I just want to say anyone that supports this military action in Libya has got to be out of their mind because if they think if one day we should finally get up the nerve to stand up against our federal government.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  Do they think the UN is going to come in and back us up to overthrow them? Absolutely not. That was my statement and I was just wondering.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  In the worst case scenario, the nuclear power plant in Japan is to melt down completely. All hands off the deck, it's over.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  It's already worse than Chernobyl. If you count the five of them that had at least partially melted down, now at least two of the cores open leaking, it's already past Chernobyl.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  But yes, they could continue to have even bigger meltdowns and it could get even worse. Go ahead.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  Well, what do you think the end game would it be over here in America? What do you think the government is going to do with all the radiation and everything else coming this way?
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Are they going to continue to whitewash it or are they going to eventually admit yes?
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  No, they're telling us each seafood out of the Pacific. They're saying, yes, some radiation detectors are showing higher levels all over the US, even Europe.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  Show what it's not bad for you. And a lot of people are saying, well, this is a globalist plan. They might have blown up the first reactor or something.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  No, it was the tsunami and earthquake folks as a way to shut down nuclear power, just like they want to shut down coal.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  No, the globalists are clearly signifying and they're big fake environmentalist groups that they want to shut down coal because that's not controlled by the big oil companies.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  They're owned by the big banks and they're going to go ahead with more nuclear reactors, not less.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  And so I just see them whitewashing the whole thing and it's just like the 300 plus above ground, 500 plus with all countries involved, but 300 plus with the US alone above ground nuclear tests.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  So what if cancer rates go up? So what if fertility goes down?
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  Remember, the globalist mine phosphate for fertilizer production out of limestone deposits that have different radioactive isotopes in it.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  It's where they also mine for uranium and they put that in your water and call it sodium fluoride.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  So remember when I had Dr. Buzz beyond and he said, many of my colleagues, of course, he's a top chemical physicist, top radiation expert in its effects.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  He said, yes, many of my colleagues actually believe this is on purpose because the sperm count is dropped by 87% in fertility.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Radioactive isotopes are key to reducing fertility. I just don't know, but it doesn't matter.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  The fact is fertility in every region where nuclear power is used and where nuclear systems are, official material is purified.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  Fertility is dropping regardless. It is destroying the human species.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  Then you have a eugenicist like Mambiat running around saying more reactors, build them everywhere. Oh, I love it. Fluoride in the water, you know, this is what they want.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  And so you can't get around the fact. And you heard me right, folks.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  All over the US, they put radioactive isotopes in your water in the cocktail of 150 to 300 plus, depending on what company they buy it from, chemicals in your water.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  Amongst them, different radioactive isotopes. And I showed the mainstream news articles again.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  I just calmly go, yeah, the government covered up radiation in your water at high levels.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  They don't say why they covered it up and no one asked why is it there. It's just, it's there and it's not going to stop.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  We're just letting you know now. And yes, cell phones give you brain cancer, but aren't they fun? Go ahead and give them to your kids.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  Does that answer your question, my friend?
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  Yes, it does. So in the grand scheme, things just plays into world depopulation and eugenics.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  Absolutely. It plays into the fact that the globalists have a spirit of death and destruction, like their father, and this is what they do.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  I mean, you can, you can ascribe to it whatever reason you think they're doing it, but they're doing it.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  No one can deny debate that these people, until 1991, wouldn't let troops use DU, now they use it everywhere.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  It ignites when they fire it out the end of the barrel.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  The troops are getting deadly dosages of it that will reduce their lifespan by decades every time they fire a DU round and they don't care.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  What does that tell you about the New World Order?
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  Okay, what does that tell you?
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Dust might resist it, and best of all, machine washable and dryable.

[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America, the Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  Daddy, I'm hungry.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  That little girl will get fed, for now.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  But what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face?
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  If the US dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency, prices on the things you need most will skyrocket.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Food may be unaffordable, or worse, unavailable.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Earthquakes, economic turmoil, continuing unemployment, rampant inflation, and even threats of terrorism
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  are all reasons to let the experts at Ready Reserve Foods help you with a long-term food storage plan.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier of long-term storage foods for 37 years.

[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  Harry in Michigan, you're on the air, sir. Thank you for holding.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  Are you there? Hey.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  It's great to talk to you again, man, and thank you for all the work you're doing, and God bless you,
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  and keep up to good work.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  My first deal is that I have been a long-time listener to you for almost 16 years.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  Thank you.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  I heard you in Katie, Texas about 16, 17 years ago.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  My eyes have been open since about 1980 when I was taught that the trilateral commission in the United Nations
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  were a bunch of scum-sucking bottom-fears.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  I have been a piper. I've been working on nuclear plants since about 1971 in the world.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  And people in this country do not know the severity of what has happened to them in Japan.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  And what's going on in this country is just making me sick.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Now, they've sent the precedent to have five reactors on fire exploding, 600,000 spent fuel rods,
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  open reactors with live uranium, plutonium, and off-gassing blowing to the U.S.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  And our media is like, hey, this isn't bad for you. In fact, it's good for you.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Well, yeah, the same culture. I mean, this woman needs to be hung.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  I mean, what a lying piece of scum she is.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  And all these global scum are, this is a slow kill.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  And I see this coming across the United States and around the world.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  All I see is a slow kill down the road.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  And the more people you try to wake up to this,
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  luckily I woke up three people so far this month.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  So what's going on with this?
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  Oh, yeah, that's the exciting thing, and we've got to make lemonade out of lemons,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  is that people are ready to wake up now.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  We've got the truth. We've got the facts, the globalists don't admissions.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  A lot of people, tens of millions of people in the U.S. alone,
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  remember myself and many others telling them the truth for decades,
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  now they see it all coming true, our credibility continues to rise.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  Exactly. And when Lindsay Williams, who was on the show last time talking about the day of the rage,
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  I went in and told people right after that happened, and when it did happen on the 11th,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  and all this stuff went down, the nuclear job going down,
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  and this white washing of what's going on over in the East.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  I mean, people come up to me and said, you know, how did you know this?
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  And I said, well, you've got to be informed.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  You people have got to wake up, your seat, listen there, Alex Jones,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  you shall info wars, prison planet, you know?
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  Well, by the way, Harry, and it's spreading the word is key now,
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  because folks are, again, finally ready to be awakened,
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  because the facts are now in their face, not over the next hill.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  We haven't even pointed out, and I got an email about this last night.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  It makes a lot of sense.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  I mean, I don't want to say this was an inside job, but maybe 11s are unlucky.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  You had the 777 attack, you had the 311 attack in Madrid.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  We've had all these other 11 attacks, 9-11.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  You notice it was 3-11-11, 3-11-11, when this Japanese earthquake tsunami happened.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  I tell you, folks, that is really strange, isn't it?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  Yes, it is, Alex.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  And it all falls back to these globalists' belief in their religion and the numerology involved in this.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Well, I remember a lady calling me last year on air when I saw this email.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  I remember the call.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  She goes, Alex, you've got to listen to me.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  3-11-11, they're going to hit.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  You know, there's going to be earthquakes, and I'm like, okay, thank you, ma'am.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I guess you must have been psychic or something.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  I mean, I don't get into things that we can't prove, but that is a little weird, isn't it?
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Yes, it most certainly is, and I'm beginning to believe it.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  They do work in this number system, 9-11, and their belief system, it's definitely a Luciferian belief system that they're in.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  And this has got to stop.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  The American people have got to make a stand.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  They've got to draw that line in the sand.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  Travis said, we've got to stand up and fight these people.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  And it's my passion for years of being laughed at and scorned that this day was going to happen.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Absolutely.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  Harry, it's beautiful that you were listening in Texas.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  Must have been 989, 16, 17, 16 and a half years ago, and imagine the tens of millions of others.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  I've done thousands of radio interviews, hundreds and hundreds of TV interviews, internationally and nationally.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  I have, you know, we've put out thousands and thousands of stories, 25 plus films, thousands of videos.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  Think about that Woodpecker effect of just doing it over and over and over again, and all those millions and millions and millions,
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  really hundreds of millions, that have heard the information I've put out doggedly, steadfastly, and the effect it's had.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  And think of all the people you personally warned and all of the other listeners warned who got laughed at,
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  the hundreds of millions you got to worldwide, and now the globalists can see the growth curve, they can see how fast we're waking up.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  So they're going to implode economy, start war, stage terror attacks, you name it.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  The irony is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Run on for a long time.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  We are in the clutches of the globalist. And they are ruthless.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  They know how to socially engineer. They know how to manipulate. They know how to lie.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  But no matter how sophisticated they are, if you're aware of their program, which is very simple overall,
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  their manipulation is complex, it's all over for them.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  And it doesn't work anymore for them to just call as conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  It doesn't work anymore when you say, I don't trust the government raising my taxes.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  I don't like what the foreign banks are doing, not saying where the trillions went.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  I don't like the TSA violating states' rights, setting up checkpoints, not just in airports, but all over highways.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  I don't like these foreign troop agreements to use troops in our country.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  I don't like the UN telling our president what to do, and him in a servile fashion going along with it in Congress illegally,
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  because Congress is now involved in treason. Every member of Congress, other than Ron Paul, Rand Paul, the senator,
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  and a few Democrats, other than them, are engaged. They should all be impeached.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  I'm calling for the whole Congress who's laying there doing nothing to be impeached.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  They're all part of this treason.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  They don't use treason lightly, signing the North American Union Agreement six years ago in secret,
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  and then it came out two years later to have corporations telling our governments what to do,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  wanting to set up toll roads on 84 interstate highways to fund the new North American Union.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  Congress not involved, and still they're following North American integration?
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  I mean, it's all going on. Again, 2007, four years ago, you can just go to YouTube and type in
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  50-year anniversary of EU celebrations. In fact, let's just do it ourselves.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  50-year show ahead news headlines, we'll show photos.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  50-year anniversary of the EU. How do they have a 50th anniversary in 2007?
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  The EU, we're all told, started in 2000. 15 members, then 20, then 25.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  Countries being gobbled up by this criminal organization, so they could then be bankrupted and put into receivership,
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  and then the richer European nations would, quote, bail them out, meaning paying the bankers their loan sharking rates.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  How did they have a 50th anniversary? Because the Treaty of Rome, as I show and cover in in-game
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  blueprint for global enslavement, and the EU and the UN brag about this,
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  the Treaty of Rome, 1957, established the European Union under a trade deal like NAFTA and GATT.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  We're in the North American Union. It's treason. Real treason.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Don't just use that word lightly. Systemic treason, these private corporations set up international bodies
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  and then have Congress and the legislatures who are under, first the feds take over the states,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  then the feds sign over to the foreign banks, and they run the planet.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  And Congress does what they're told, because they're bought and paid for.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Now, there's a headline. The European Union celebrates its 50th anniversary on the 25th of April, 2007.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  You notice the 25th of April is when they ratified the Treaty of Rome.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  And they say 50 years ago, the leaders of six European countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy,
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  and the Netherlands, signed the treaties of Rome, which established the modern-day European Union co-cooperation,
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  started with the coal and steel, and has become an unprecedented success in creating a political and economic union
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  between 27 member states, first 15, then 25, then 27 and growing.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  What publication was that from, or was that an actual EU press release? Press release by the EU.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  And by the way, all over Europe, no one came out to the lavish taxpayer-funded parades and fireworks displays.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  There were just police blocking the barricades and almost no one out there.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  The few that were there were booing it, kind of like the French when the Nazis came into Paris.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  They turned their backs on them. Couldn't arrest them all. They don't care.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Okay? And if they win, down the road, they'll announce the anniversary of the North American Union.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  They may say it was 1994, NAFTA and GATT. They may say it was 2005 with the SPP signing.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  The point is, they say we're now in it. You understand? I'm not just saying this.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  I tell high-powered reporters from Nightline and Rolling Stone and New York Magazine and Wall Street Journal,
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  when they come here, I go, can I give you the actual global documents from the UN, from the IMF?
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  Can I show you where David Rockefeller says that he's guilty as charged, wanting a world government?
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  Can I show you New York Times article with David Rockefeller praising Mao Zedong?
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  And they say, no, I don't want to look at it. This is your opinion.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  And they go, write articles that I'm crazy making this stuff up. Okay. I'm crazy.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  This is from David Rockefeller's book. In fact, we'll put it back up on screen.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  I forget the title. What's the title of the book? I own it. Oh, here it is. Here it is. They got it.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Here it is. I can show folks watching President Planet.TV.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  We've got bookshelf after bookshelf out there. David Rockefeller memoirs with an afterward by the author.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  This is his authorized New York Times bestseller that what came out in 2005.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Let me even check the publication date to be absolutely precise and test my memory, which is, excuse me, excuse me.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  First published in 2002. And then I got it with a reprint in 2004.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  And this is in memory of Abbey Aldrich Rockefeller and my wife, Peggy Rockefeller.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  And it's bookmarked here in the book because the press likes to roll their eyes when I show this to them.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Proud internationalist. That means not international brotherhood, but that means bankers.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  And here's quotes where he says, I want international bankers to run things versus free states.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  And we have the quote here. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interest of the United States,
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  characterizing my family and me as internationalist and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated, global, political and economic structure.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  One world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty and I am proud of it.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  And they've got all these low-level camp followers who run around and say that, oh, it's about brotherhood and peace.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  Yeah, you see the peace of the UN and the bankers.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  I mean, I've seen top globalists in the EU bragging in major newspapers.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  We've read the quotes here where, in fact, you can even search the term,
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  founders of EU admit that it is a takeover arm for sovereign states, for bankers.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  And I mean, they just brag thinking you're stupid and you don't read their own books, they write.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  In fact, I actually found it out of the book itself.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Here's the full quote. In fact, zoom in on this so folks will actually see it out of the book if they're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, right here on page 405.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  Populous paranoia. Now, he goes on here to say we're paranoid because we don't like this.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  See, this is what globalists do. Then we're going back to your calls.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  They admit they're setting up world government, but then if you don't like it, you're insane and it doesn't exist.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  And he shows this arrogant mind control spin in this full paragraph.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  He says, for more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  folks that don't want to be slaves to unelected foreign bureaucracies created by private banks.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  I'm sorry, I'm interrupting him. Let me just read his quote here.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well publicized incidents,
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  Let me see. I've seen Rockefeller on C-SPAN with world leaders introducing him saying he set up the world order with his family,
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  donated the land for the UN, and founded every major private globalist organization in every major country,
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  and they have constant meetings to coordinate it. But oh, he's not involved in that.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Continuing, some even believe we're part of a secret cabal working against the best interest of the United States.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  Well, look what's happening to the bankrupt republic.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Characterizing my family and me as internationalist and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  One world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I'm proud of it.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  The anti-Rockefeller focus of these otherwise incomparable political positions owes much to populism.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  Oh, that dirty, dirty thing. Populists believe in conspiracies.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  He just admitted he wants world government, and there's countless documents where they break down exactly how it's going to work,
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  post-industrial, one-child policies.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  Rockefeller Foundation funded papers on sterilence and vaccines.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  We've got all those documents on infowars.com.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  In case there's new viewers or listeners, type in Rockefeller Foundation documents, fund sterilence and vaccines.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Rockefeller Foundation sterilenceandvaccinesinfowars.com, and then you go, that's infowars.com.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  Now, we have links to mainstream articles and then the actual documents that we wrote last year in one month, one of our great writers,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  10 different articles on it, 10, 10.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  Oh, but we're populist conspiracy theorists because we know how to go to major libraries and pull Rockefeller Foundation documents from 1966.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  And the UN was caught with the exact program.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  They talked about vaccinating people and sterilizing them.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  There it is.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction, and then you scroll down.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  Oh, oh, what's on the site?
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  Links to the actual PDFs.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  Oh, we know how to read.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  We're evil conspiracy theorists. Let me go back.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  The anti-rockefeller focus of these otherwise incomparable, who can comprehend people that know how to read their own documents?
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  These anti-rockefeller focus of these otherwise incomparable political positions owes much to populism.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  Populists believe in conspiracies.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  You mean in powerful people manipulating and wanting more power?
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  You mean we believe in history and reality?
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  Populists believe in conspiracies.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  And one of the most endearing is that a secret group of international bankers and capitalist and their minions control the world's economy.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  Because of my name and prominence at the head of Chase for many years, I have earned the distinction as a conspirator-in-chief from some of these people.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  Populists and isolationists.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  We're not isolationists.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  We don't like China having tariffs on us because you just moved your factories over there.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  We don't have tariffs on them.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  We don't like your insiders that wrote the healthcare bill all getting waivers for their companies to get healthcare, but I've got to buy it, even though my employees don't want it.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  We don't like your unfair trade advantage, punk.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  And it just goes on.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  And all these are code words.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  All we want in the United States as a result of global trade, oh look how good that's been, so-called global trade,
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  improved communications, so we're deindustrialized, they're spying on all of us,
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  and the heightened interaction of people from different cultures, bringing groups in so we all fight with each other.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  Populists rarely mention these positive consequences, oh yes, it's like the positive consequences of gonorrhea,
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  nor can they cogently explain, oh we can't do that, how they would have sustained American economic growth and the expansion of our political power without them.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  You mean your political power using the United States as your evil juggernaut.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  Again, oh boy, it is really hard to respond to this level of throwing it in your face.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  These people are tyrants.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  This is a man who in the New York Times, we went to the microfilm at UT and have an in-game, the date, everything and praise, Chinese control,
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  and what Mao did and what do you see in the news all the time from the CFR that he helped set up with his father.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  How China's the model, how they're great, how they're not bad, what do Google and Yahoo do?
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  One of the big telecommunications giants do, they help China censor their people,
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  and then our own government and the Australian and British government then come out with headlines,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  we're going to use the Chinese model of censorship.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  Pull that up, that was first in Australia three years ago, headline.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  Just show everybody, here on air.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  This is not, this is my opinion, it's all right here.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  I studied this, you can study it.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  That's what's so effective about this show.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  Boom, show you everything.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  Tell you that Rockefeller show you his book.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  Tell you about the New York Times article, tell you where you can look at it for free online.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  What is the endgame.com?
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  Full bibliography of the film, every minute of the film with a link and a time code and the links to the documents.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  Boom.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  Oh, I can't cogently break it down here, Rockefeller, huh?
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  And what you've done.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  There it is, Australia Enforced Mandatory Chinese Style Internet Censorship.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  Yeah, that's an infowars.com.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  Try it, I believe it was The Age and the City Morning Herald had it.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  Go with their articles, just say Australia Implementing Chinese Style Web, that was it.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  Herald's son, but the page not found, he found the link, but they've moved the page.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  Take me back to Google then, let's show them that under that search term it did lead to the Australian news.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Point is, you know this has all been announced and our article will have quotes in it.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  That's why we write articles about stuff that's already in mainstream news, so there's a record of it when they put it behind a wall or movement or get rid of it.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  But who can deny they're calling for internet kill switches?
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Who can deny?
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  You know about that.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  Let's go ahead now and talk to John in Michigan, then Kyle Keith, Richard Bluestar, and others, you're on the air.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  Pretty good.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Hey, two things, a reference to Obama's address last night and to the war in Libya.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  Yes, not a war conspiracy theorist.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  Remember Carl Rove, pull me up the Carl Rove clip, I'm on fire here, I'm going to go to you John.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  Pull up Carl Rove, tells press we control reality, Carl Rove's we control reality, and they said it doesn't matter what real reality is, we will tell you.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  And so they said this is not a war, it's a kinetic military action, it is not a war, you are a conspiracy theorist, this is not a war.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  Do you understand that John?
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  Yes sir, kinetic military action.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  Yes.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Yeah, our dear leader referenced Bosnia, the 78 days we bombed Serbia with a brain that depleted uranium.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  Yes, very loving.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  And their burnt effects have gone up fourfold.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Yes, very loving.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  Since you brought up Al Qaeda backing the KLA, not just today, but back in martial law, I was hoping you could go into a little detail and refresh the public's memory on how the Mujahideen was used to stir the pop-up.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  Sure, in my 2005 film, Martial Law, 911 Rise the Police State, a three hour treatise, I think it's one of my best films, and it's available on DVD at infowars.com if folks want to get it, or it's free all over the web, but you might want to put some change in the kitty here, folks.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  Plus have it on high quality for your archives and to share and make copies from.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  But we just show all the mainstream news admitting Al Qaeda's wonderful and they're attacking the Serbs, and when the Serbs fought back, it's evil, so they had to bomb the entire country in their water treatment and power plants and TV stations with giant DU bombs.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  And why not?
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  It's good for our troops.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  It must be good for the Serbs.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  It's like dropping flowers on them.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  And then turned out the UN report even admitted, not saying the Serbs were good, it was ethnic cleansing, that the Croats and Muslims killed around double in the 10 years of war before that, what the Serbs did.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  They said the Serbs were the bad guys.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  They had one third of their land taken, basically given as a satellite to the drug running Albania, Al Qaeda run, and they admitted Al Qaeda was there and it was CIA run, and if you don't like Al Qaeda, you're bad.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  I mean, what else do you say?
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  Al Qaeda is the good guys.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  I don't agree with that, so I'm an un-American piece of trash.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  I thought I'd point out too last night there was a line of truth that came out from King Obama, and that was he said some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  The United States of America is different, and he's right.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  He's not turning a blind eye.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  He's defining the atrocities.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  Now, dropping DU all over the Libyans is good.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  Man, you are sick.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  This is not a war.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  DU is good.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  Fukushima is good.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  Shut up.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  This is not a war.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  This is not a war.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  This is not a war.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  This is not a war.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  This is not a war.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  This is not a war.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  This is not a war.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  This is not a war.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  This is not a war.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  This is not a war.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  This is not a war.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  This is not a war.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  This is not a war.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  This is not a war.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  This is not a war.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  This is not a war.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  This is not a war.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  This is not a war.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  This is not a war.
[01:59:42.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  This is not a war.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  This is not a war.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  This is not a war.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  This is not a war.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  This is not a war.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  This is not a war.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  This is not a war.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  This is not a war.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  This is not a war.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  This is not a war.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  This is not a war.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  This is not a war.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  This is not a war.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  This is not a war.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  This is not a war.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  This is not a war.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  This is not a war.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  This is not a war.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  This is not a war.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  This is not a war.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  This is not a war.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  This is not a war.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  This is not a war.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  This is not a war.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  Here's another globalist quote out of the New York Times magazine.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  It is a lengthy 15-page article, and here is the cover of it, if you are a prisonplanet.tv viewer.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  If not, just search the term faith, certainty, and the presidency of George W. Bush.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  And then you turn to page 10 in New York magazine.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  And it's the New York Times, the Washington Post, and a coterie of super-high-powered reporters.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  And they're talking to them, and they're saying, this is written a few years after the invasion of Iraq.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  It's actually about a year after October 17, 2004, a little more than a year, 16 months or so.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  And they're sitting there talking to Carl Roe, and they're going, but yeah, you guys lie.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  This is a private discussion. You're constantly lying.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  And it goes on. In the summer of 2002, after I'd written an article in Esquire's from the New York Times,
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  that the White House didn't like about Bush's former communications director, Karen Hughes,
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  I had a meeting with a senior advisor at Bush. He expressed the White House's displeasure,
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  and then told me something that at the time I didn't fully comprehend,
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  that which I now believe gets to the very heart of the presidency.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  Now, see, the New York Times claims this is a recorded meeting.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  But then a bunch of other reporters said, well, the same thing was said at the cocktail party.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  So I guess they were either recording that. So there was also a debate about this,
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  but Carl Roe then went on to confirm that he indeed had said this and said this many times.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  So he goes on to say, but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  Yeah, like Bush saying, it isn't illegal when the president says do it.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  That's what Nixon said. Oh, I can order lying and stealing and breaking into people's houses
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  and wiretapping without warrants, because when the president does it, it isn't illegal.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  Now, listen to what Carl Roe told New York Times writer Ron Susskind.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  Okay. The aid said these guys like me, and he's not saying Carl Roe at the time.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  It later came out, it was Carl Roe. The aid said that guys like me were, quote,
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  in what we call the reality-based community. So Carl Roe says you're in the reality-based community.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  Remember Matt Drudge a few months ago took my quote live on air where I said there's no rest
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  for those of us that live in reality, those of us that work in reality.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  Will you guys go to his Twitter and get me my actual quote?
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  Because it was better than that. The point is I said there's no rest for those of us that live and work in reality.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  But again, Carl Roe says to the New York Times reporter, in what we call the reality-based community,
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  he says the aid said that guys like me were in what we call the reality-based community.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  So Carl Roe's saying, well, you're living in reality, pal. See, they're psychological warfare experts.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  They know when they say DU is good for you and Fukushima is good for you,
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  and they have the left and right say it, that it confuses people.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  And Bill Wilders you, and instead of you having the moral high ground and everybody admitting a fact,
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  they just go, we pretend it doesn't exist. It's like Bill Clinton saying it depends on what the word is, is.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  On the definition of is. People like what? He goes, oh, you're not smart enough to get it.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  No, I get it, you're a con artist.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  And what we call the reality-based community, which he defined as people who quote,
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  So he says you people are what we call the reality-based community. Quote,
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  you believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  See, that's what I do. History, reality, globalist documents, they're public plans.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  See, I believe, I do believe, I am in the reality-based community,
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  I nodded, the New York Times reporter said, and murmured something about enlightenment principles and things being empirical.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  He cut me off. He cut me off. That's not the way the world really works anymore, said Carl Roevey continued.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  See, this is what happens to people that have total power and can get away with anything they want.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  Dincor and Halliburton can publicly run giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  It can come out in Houston Chronicle, Chicago Tribune, nobody gets in trouble.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  I go tell Austin cops, I'm walking out of P.F. Chang's a few years ago,
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  Dincor is across the street, they're laughing at me, I look at Alex Jones, one of them's a commander,
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  and I walk over to the big cop and the other little cops, big giant cop, and I said,
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  you know, officer, that Dincor facility, that's one of their head offices, they're in mainstream news running kidnapping rings,
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  and he smiled at me and he said, I know Alex, I work for them, and they all started you little laughing.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  Whether he worked for them or not, the point is it was all funny.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  See, you're not in the reality-based community.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  You know this spirit of gibbering, demonic, servile, giving yourself over to delusions, just like Nero did.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  Nero burned Rome because he wanted, part of it, because he wanted to expand his palace, then blame it on the Christians.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  Nero got so crazy, he believed he was a god, and that he couldn't die if he committed suicide, of course he died.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  See, for the most powerful, they go crazy, and then death and destruction.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  They reported that Hitler would sit for hours on the Polish front, looking through a telescope,
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  watching bombs and burning, like it was the greatest show on earth, and stuka bombers, dive bombing.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  Burning cities, dead children, fire, they love it.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  And see, they just giggle, they giggle and enjoy it.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  I nodded and murmured something about Enlightenment principles.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  He cut me off. That's not the way the world really works anymore, Carl Rove continued.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  And while you're studying that reality judiciously, oh, you actually study reality, I don't care.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  You're judicious. Look at you. You can think for yourself.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  It doesn't matter if you think for yourself. Resistance is futile, which it really isn't.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  This is a con artist's gibbering game. He's a little gross, sniveling, unconcernative demon.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  And while you're studying that reality judiciously, and you will listen to him, you will.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  We'll act again, creating our own other new realities.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  Again, and while you're studying that reality judiciously, as you will,
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  See, he's saying it doesn't matter what you do, and that's how things will sort out.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  And he goes on with the other reporters, completely shocked by the statement.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  But see, the smart ones, the smart ones, like a Joe Hagan.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  We're going to come back and go to Aaron after the break.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  The smart ones, like a New York magazine writer, the smart ones, like a media matters rolling stone writer.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  They know how, when they come to my office and I go, here's all the globalist documents,
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  here's their books, do you want these? No, no, no, thank you.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  Do you want me to show you the Rockefeller documents where they put the sterile into the vaccines?
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  Would you like to see a bunch of quotes on video of them calling for world government and a one-shot policy?
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  No, no, no, thank you.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  Why? Because you're just going to, oh, you're just reporting on me, the phenomenon.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  Well, let's not talk about Alex Jones. Let's talk about what I stand for.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  But instead of just give little crazy sounding bullet points, hoping people don't look deeper.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  And I'm saying this is a big, deep reservoir of corruption and death and destruction.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  And history shows it, and here's the globalist admitting it.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  Please look, please for your own family's future. I'm getting chills right now.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  And the yuppies in all of them flowing from this spiritual blindness, whatever you want to call it,
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  they just giggle and smirk and say, the people of Fukushima should be happy.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  This is going to be good for them.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  George Monbiot, I might have been on the fence before, now I believe in nuclear power.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  People like that doesn't make sense.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  I control reality. I've got the backing of the power structure.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  I'm George Monbiot. I go to globalist Bilderberg meetings.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  I openly write for world government.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  But then I write articles saying you're crazy if you believe in world government,
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  just like David Rockefeller did in his memoirs that we read last hour.
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  He said, yeah, we're setting up world government, but there's these crazy populists who believe we're setting up a world government and they're nuts.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  So we are. Now let me talk about the Bilderberg group he goes on.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  I mean, years after this memoir was written, I would still have the New York Times and others say, Jones is insane.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  He believes that they call the Bilderberg group exist.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  And I call the reporter and I go, don't you want their own minutes that have been leaked?
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  Don't you want to have their own?
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  They're like, no, I don't. Alex, I got to go.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  By the way, you're going to lose. Bam, slam the phone down.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  I get one of the head of the Naval War College people on who openly calls and says,
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  your works for foreign banks and world government.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  And I set him up for an interview, but then he figured out who I was.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  He thought he was coming on Alex S. Jones radio show.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  And I called him up when they couldn't get him on the line.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  My producers couldn't.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  And he said, I'm not coming on your show during the three minute break.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  He said, no, I will not gratify you.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  And I said, but you're calling for world government.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  He goes, you're going to lose.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  You're going to lose.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  And I said, no, you're going to lose.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  And he went, never, never and hung up.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  He didn't say I was a liar.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  Well, Thomas Barnett, he just said, you're going to lose.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  You're going to lose.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  We control reality now.

[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:34.000]  How men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.

[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  So what the globalists do is they put a lie out to reporters, to corporate leaders and they say,
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  look, suspend all moral judgments, suspend critical thinking, cover anything we want, lie,
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  just be our servant and we might give you some chicken feed.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  And anyone that comes forward with an argument, a moral argument or someone who stands up and says,
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  I want to be free, I don't want to go under your tyrannical system, they then just laugh at you and say,
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  you don't have a stake in reality, we control reality, we're God.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  And that's what this power trip stems from.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  And going back into David Rockefeller's memoirs, published 2002, we already last hour read the quote where he admitted,
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  yes, he wants global government, that yes, the populist are a bunch of conspiracy theorists,
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  but basically they're right, but he's going to defeat them.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  Aaron, go over some of that.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  Yeah, that whole book is very tongue-in-cheek because he opens with kind of mocking the little people
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  who are against the world government, the so-called populists and so forth,
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  but then he breaks down his little personal accounts of the council on foreign relations,
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  of the Bilderberg group and of some of the other groups.
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  No, wait, they say that doesn't exist, but he's allowed to talk about it because he's for it.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  He controls reality. Sometimes it exists, sometimes it doesn't.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  No, that's totally...
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  This is their philosophy, folks.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  And notice here how he mocks people but still admits Bilderberg exists.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  If the council on foreign relations raises the hackles of conspiracy theorists,
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  the Bilderberg meetings must induce apocalyptic visions of omnipotent international bankers
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  plotting with unscrupulous government officials to impose cunning schemes on an ignorant
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  and unsuspecting world. See how tongue-in-cheek that is.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  Is he telling you what he's doing?
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  Yeah, but...
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000]  We've got internal quotes that have been confirmed where he says things like that.
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  It would have been impossible to do this if the media hadn't worked with us.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  We want to thank the Washington Times, the Washington Post, the New York Times.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  He didn't say Washington Times. Go ahead.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  He's playing upon our ignorance and I'm sure he's familiar with all the denial about these kind of groups going on.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  But deeper into this chapter, you know, there's this perception that Bilderberg are kind of untouchable people.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  They're such lofty bankers and militarists and so forth that they can't be touched.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  But then he explains how in 1976 the group had to shut down for a year, how its founder, Prince Bernhardt,
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  nearly had to step down from the council and, you know, almost was in criminal trouble.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  You know, I don't know if that all would have happened if he would have actually gone to prison.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  But reading from David Rockefeller in 1976, Bilderberg faced a scandal that almost resulted in its collapse.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  That's David Rockefeller admitting it.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  Early that year in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it was alleged that Prince Bernhardt had approached
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  the Lockheed Corporation with an offer to use his official position to influence Dutch defense procurement's policies
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  in exchange for significant financial consideration.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  As the year wore on, evidence against Bernhardt accumulated, including indications that he had met with intermediaries during Bilderberg events.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  They always claimed they don't set any policy there, that they don't even discuss policy.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  And here they are admitting that Prince Bernhardt was carrying on part of this Lockheed Martin scheme.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  Yeah, Obama and Hillary in 2008 show up at the secret meeting where they're telling the media they're there.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  The media's all looking for them. It says we're not going to go look there.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  And they decide that Hillary's going to step down at that meeting.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  Yeah, and we know from all the things Tucker brings out that later become true,
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  that there's definitely very important stuff going on at the meeting.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  But Rockefeller goes on to explain how in 1976 the conference was canceled
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  and it appeared for a time Bilderberg was finished.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  Now, of course, they would have continued under some other name.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:50.000]  But the point is they aren't beyond the reach of accountability of public scrutiny.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  And all these populists who've been criticizing them, that does bear a pressure on them.
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  And of course, Prince Bernhardt was not only a Nazi SS officer,
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  he also worked with the London RAF during World War II.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  He was playing both sides while he was sitting on the IG Farben Council or board or what have you.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  He was also one of the founders of the World Wildlife Fund,
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  along with the Eugenesis Prince Philip and the Eugenesis Julian Huxley.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  And was caught smuggling elephant tusk out.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  They run the wildlife ops so they can get the goods themselves.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  And it plays into Agenda 21, of course, as well.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  And they use those wildlife preserves.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  This has now been declassified as military bases to set up rebels to overthrow countries.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  Yeah.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  It just shows you just a small indicator of how deep Prince Bernhardt's influence goes.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  But yet, he was not beyond the reach of the...
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  And his daughter today, the Queen of the Netherlands,
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  is the unofficial head above the puppet head of Bilderberg.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  Yeah. And of course, he was the founder along with Joseph Redinger,
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.000]  who more or less kind of entrusted him with the idea to form the group.
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  And to account Etienne Davignon is the current head.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  Yeah.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  And as we know, Bilderberg did more than just talk.
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  They set up the European Union by stealth and, you know...
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  They brag about that.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  But again, that's no big deal. They don't have any power.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  What do you think about the bizarre Karl Rove statement?
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  That really says it all about how they control reality.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  It's evil, but it's deep.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  You know, it's a mix of the Emperor wears no clothes and kind of the Matrix.
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  Like, your reality will be what we dictate to you.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  It's kind of mind boggling.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  And these reporters, they just love it.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  They feel like they've joined the power.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  And so they just dive in.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  Oh, reality means nothing. I'm part of the power.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  And then you watch society being destroyed,
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  because the globalists are such sadomasochistic, murdering scumbags,
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  and we have all the proof of their lust for death and destruction.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  You people sold your souls cheaply, didn't you?
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:55.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:42.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.000]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:28.000]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:32.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:47.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  That's End of America 3.com.

[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:14.000]  Alright, now I'm taking calls and hitting some other key news in the last half hour of this worldwide transmission.
[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000]  Kyle, Richard, Blue Star, Alex, Bruce, we're going to get to all of you and more.
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  Briefly, we carry the best books, the best videos, not just the films and books that I've written,
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  but other films and books that I believe are extremely informative.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  You get tools that will further enlighten and inform you that you can then pass forward to friends and family
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  or have public viewings or private viewings.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  It's all about getting the information out and it's all about the info warriors, the people that are awake worldwide,
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  taking action and exposing the globalist and the false reality they've tried to basically set up.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  And the yuppies and other servants that have been taught it's trendy to be conned.
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  It's trendy to not know what's going on.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  They're finally getting hurt bad enough by the New World Order that a lot of them are waking up,
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  but then they're being led off by neocons and fake liberals and other globalist foundation-controlled minions.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  Now, we're almost out of this book and then it's going to be out of print for a while while he reprints.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  We've only got a very few copies left of strategic relocation, North American Guide to Save Places.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  We sold out last week.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  Just got a few hundred more in and then that's it.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  Joel is out.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.000]  Strategic relocation, North American Guide to Save Places.
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  Third edition.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  Excellent information to think about security.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  Very well written.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  The new book, only available at infowars.com.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  Big Brother.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  They're a well-earned nightmare.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.000]  Come True.
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  Buy Mark Dice.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  Getting into how the Big Brother system is here.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  The surveillance, the spine, the control grid.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  Excellent new book.
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  We've also got a Big Brother t-shirt we designed that you can get discounted when you get it with the book or alone.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  Available at infowars.com.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  A great discussion piece.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  What's that shirt mean?
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  Well, it's this.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  It's got infowars.com on it.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  You'll meet like-minded people.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  Also, we are just about ready to be able to ship these out because it officially comes out in just a few days.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  We, of course, have had these for a month sitting on them, but now they're going out.
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  But the fact started today.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  New York Times bestselling author Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  Very easy read.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  Full of documents.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  Full of photos.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  Full of information.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  This is my favorite type of book.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  A great coffee table book.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  A great gift to give people just to give them a primer on how they're being lied to.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  But it's also very sophisticated, but at the same time a very easy read.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  There's the stand down.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  We're chaining order to stand down on 9-11.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  Chairman John Jesus Staff under Cheney's directive.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  I mean, just look at these documents.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  This book, I think, each one gets better as he gets more informed and does more research and works with a great researcher, Dick Russell.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  Jesse Ventura, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  You buy it from us.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  You support everything we're doing.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  Also, what in the world are they spraying excellent film dealing with chemtrails?
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  And I just had another mainstream news article they gave me where the government is admitting that comtrails
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  warm the world more than aviation emissions.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  And it turns out most of these so-called contrails are having barium salts, aluminum dioxide added into the jet fuel.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  And so it's being dispersed out and causing nuclei.
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  But Holder's public program, John P. Holdren, he says they're doing test chemtrailing to cool the earth.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  But all the meteorologists we've had on it and astrophysicists and others have pointed out this will heat the earth, not cool it.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  And there it is out of the new scientists.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  But that's what in the world are they spraying.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  Again, it's how they control reality.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  They put uranium and radium and other things in our water, mined out of limestone, mixed in with sodium fluoride.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  They call it sodium fluoride.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  It comes out in the news.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  They're doing it all over the country.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  But there's no debate, no discussion, no question.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  Why are they doing it?
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  No discussion of taking it out of the water.
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  Just, okay, we're doing this to you.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  Yeah, we covered it up.
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  Yeah, people went public inside the water districts.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  So what?
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  We're going to keep doing it.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  See, I mean, it's just, it'd be like body snatcher green aliens running around in the street sucking people's brains out.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  And the news saying they're friendly visitors.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  They're nice.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  They want to help you.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  If you see a green alien running down the street, pull over.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  They have a large straw.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  Help them stick it in your brain and suck your brain.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  Now, of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  Lynn Bickel probably take that out of context and say that I'm believing green aliens sucking your brain.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  It's as crazy as green aliens sucking your brain and the media is saying it's normal and good to go.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  Yeah, we're doing some chemtrailing, but don't worry about.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  Yeah, we're putting uranium in your water.
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  No big deal.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  Yeah, we're taking the veterans' death benefits.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  It's in the news, but so what?
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  Nobody's going to get in trouble.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  Yeah, the government's running giant child kidnapping ranks.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  Comes out in the news, comes out congressional hearings.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  Rumsfeld says they're allowed to do it because he controls reality because you let the con artists run wild
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  and have them play this game of I'm in a suit and I'm an old distinguished looking old man.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  Sit down and shut up.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  What did people booing Cheney at CPAC do?
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  He just said, now shut up.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  And the minions laughed.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  Shut up.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  I'm the boss.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  I do whatever I want.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  There's nothing you can do to me.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  I'm all powerful.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  Let me tell you, how did I sneak into Bohemian Grove?
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  Well, I snuck around past the checkpoints into the parking lot through a swamp.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  And then once I got in, I just strutted around.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  That's what the globalists do.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  I mean, the average little people, when they go up to pay with a credit card, they get all nervous.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  It might not go through or when they go up to get a hotel thing.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  You know, they, I've seen people I've traveled with.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  They get kind of nervous and the people ask questions and act weird.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  I just walk up.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  I'm polite and I'm totally confident and an instant service red carpets.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  Oh, you're confident.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  Here, everything's yours.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  But see the globalist, it's the same thing with women.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  A lot of guys try to act confident.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000]  Okay.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  And women pick up on that and they really don't like it.
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  Some women like kind of the goofy, cute, real guy who isn't confident over a fake guy who acts confident.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  But on average, women like really confident men.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  I mean, you're confident and I'm not saying it's a good lifestyle or whatever,
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  but you take the girl out on a couple of dates and you're just point blank baby.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  I think you're just unbelievably gorgeous.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  Let's rock and roll.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  Boom.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  But you're all hesitant about it.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  Ain't going to happen.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  And I'm not trying to get into that.
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  The point is, is that it's an analogy on life.
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  The globalists just take that to the thousands degree and just, hey, uranium's good.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  We're blowing everybody up.
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  It's peace.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  It's not a war.
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  And the banks are stealing everything.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  I, what are you going to do about it?
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  All right.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  I said I'd go to your calls and I said I'd plug these videos,
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  but I went off into a rampage.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  The point is, get the books and videos at infowars.com.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  You vote with your dollars supporting us.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  Plus, and most importantly, you get a powerful tool to wake folks up.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  All this talk about world government, UN, all this stuff.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  Endgame, still the preeminent film, available at infowars.com.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  Police state for the rise of FEMA for the total martial law takeover enemy program.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  Every police department should see this,
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  because then they'll realize how they're being covertly federalized incrementally.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  Everybody needs this.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  Everybody in infra-guard needs it.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  Your pastors need it.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  Chances are that they're already on government payroll secretly.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  This will wake them up.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  That's why when you try to give it to them, they're like, oh, whoa, I don't want terrorist stuff.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  Yeah, I know about Alex Jones.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  Whoa, whoa.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  That's why they send out memos to them.
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  Don't watch it.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  We're reading your email, pastor.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  You're part of our secret team now, but don't watch Alex Jones.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  A lot of police chiefs try to give him this.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  Like, oh, whoa, whoa, that's like a deadly venomous cobra.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  No, no, not the video.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  Oh, please, not that.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  I heard about him.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  Remember all those internal memos they give the police?
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  Don't watch Alex Jones.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  He's really evil.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  He's really manipulative.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  He'll actually read our quotes.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  He'll actually show us saying it.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  Oh, don't, don't, don't watch him.
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:54.000]  He'll show you internal FEMA training manual saying the founding fathers are bad.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  Actual video.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  I'm nobody.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  Folks, I got the truth.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  I got history.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  I'm not bamboozled by these people.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  I can see them.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  They live.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  I got the sunglasses.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  And what does Rowdy Piper got to do to his buddy?
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  He's got to beat him up to get him to put him on.
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  He's like, put these on.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  The guy's like, I'm not putting them on.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  That's an allegory of the general public.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  And he's, Piper's like, all right, it's going down right now.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  You're putting them on.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  That's what I do.
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  I don't come up and apologize to people this information.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  I know it sounds cookie, but there's a world government.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  I'm like, listen, there's an emergency situation.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  History's repeating itself.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  Global private corporations are taking over the planet.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  They want a one child policy.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  They've already taken over the planet.
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  So they feel like you're rats or cockroaches eating their grain.
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  They want you out of the way.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  They're setting up a planetary control grid as a means to an end.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  Do you understand?
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  Here's the information you've been warned.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  Ah, and lastly, Invisible Empire, directed by Jason Bermas.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  Excellent film.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  The New World Order defined.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  It covers the whole spectrum of the history of the New World Order.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  Very important film in full wars.com.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  Or 888-253-33139, 888-2533139.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  Or you can write to us, P.O. Box, 19549, Austin, Tejas, 78760.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  Okay, let's go to Kyle in Iowa.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  You're on the air, evil person who...
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  Wait, wait, let me get the exact Carl Rove quote.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  Where did my New York Times magazine Carl Rove thing?
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  Because I want to announce for the rest of the day these callers as what Carl Rove called
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  in what we call the reality-based community.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  You guys ever find my drudge quote he used?
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  Office Twitter.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  Well, just Alex Jones quote,
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  for those of us living in reality, there is no rest.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  For those of us living in reality, I want to get the exact quote.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  I don't think that's it.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  But see, that's the counter to Carl Rove.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  We live in reality.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  He says, in what we call the reality-based community.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  So let's talk to somebody in the reality-based community,
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  or he may disagree with reality.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  Kyle in Iowa, what community are you in?
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  The deception, believe the lie, gullible, giggle reality of the slaves?
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  Or do you believe in reality?
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  I choose both.
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  Alex, I got some hardcore reality for you.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  I don't know if you heard about this, but there was recently a quote-unquote
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  canceled martial law drill again here in Iowa.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  And it was due to them claiming that patriots were death-threading a school,
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  because they were running some martial law drill to go round up a white supremacist
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000]  who was against illegal immigration.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  Yeah, they've had those all over the country where they say the group
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  and camouflage cops under federal grants come in and say,
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  we're groups against public schools for homeschooling.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  We're going to kill you and the little kids cry,
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  and they do a horrible crime against them, but do it in plain view and say,
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  we control reality.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  And then they have other drills where it's a white supremacist against open borders,
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  meaning if you're against open borders, you're a white supremacist.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  And then, two years ago, it's in the new police fore-rise of FEMA.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  We have the Colonel on. It was in the newspaper.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  Yeah, we're going to practice confiscating guns around the town.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  We're going to do it and practice arresting the gun shop owners.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  And then I got him on, and the Colonel said, well, yeah, we were going to do that drill,
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  but it's not very nice how you say it's for America.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  This was for overseas.
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  And I said, Colonel, I've been to the drills, the role-players,
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  and the citizens you hire at these. It's for America.
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  And then they go, well, it's for America with the role-players, but not really for America.
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  And I'm like, oh, was New Orleans for America?
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  Taking the guns there, and he goes, well, I don't want to discuss that, eh, boy.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  See, because they're all about psych warfare, and he's like, wow, this guy,
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  he tries this Obi-Wan Kenobi thing on me as these aren't the droids you're looking for.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  And I go, yeah, these are the droids I'm looking for.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:00.000]  I'm not moving along here, pal. Get out of the car, because I'm a defender of the Republic.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  I'm the real cop. I'm the real sheriff in town. And so is every other sovereign American.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.000]  So I know what you are. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  Give me a news headline. I remember seeing an AP, but that may have been another one
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  where they were doing the anti-immigration attack on the school and then teaching the kids.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.000]  Now, it's not that the cops came in and terrorized your little kids unannounced.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  That's not a crime. The crime is we had to do it,
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  because the pro-gun group is the terrorist in the drill.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  And the parents are all like those dirty gun owners, those dirty men.
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:34.000]  See how simple and mentally ill that psych warfare system is?
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  But then you've got to admit that the authority figure is wrong.
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:42.000]  So the average person goes, okay, it is good you terrorized my seven-year-old. Thank you.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  It's kind of like, well, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  Well, I don't have an article in front of me because I'm on the road right now,
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  but it just happened. It was just from the Des Moines Register.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  And basically, they said that people were calling in saying,
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  if you run this drill, we're actually going to come in and make this, you know,
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.000]  we're actually going to come in and shoot the place up for real.
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  And they just, in the article, they just made it up.
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  Yeah, that's just the feds probably merging it with their own program
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  and actually calling that in themselves because they like to start
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  in these giant reeducation camp drills.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  The whole country's been being turned into one to then add reality to then cause even more hysteria.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  Yeah, that's what it seemed like to me.
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  The thing that blew my mind, and it didn't surprise me at the same time,
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  was the fact that they were just like, someone actually depth-readed you.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  I had a friend in high school who called in a bomb threat just because he wanted to get out of a test.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  This was before 9-11. This was like 1997 or something, you know,
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  and he was just some stupid kid, but, you know, he's a felon because of that.
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  And he's really a harmless, you know, do-nothing type of guy.
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  Well, he probably should be, he should have a record for that
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000]  because that can really cause a lot of problems.
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  I appreciate your call, but good to hear from you, Kyle.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  You know, sometimes I'm out in public, and usually I got to go somewhere,
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  but I was gasping up my car a few days ago when a guy came over
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  and said, Alex, want to thank you for everything?
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  He goes back in, gets something, he's coming back out, and I said, hey, come here and talk to me.
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000]  How long have you been a listener?
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  And he looked like a former military type guy, and he was there with one of his friends.
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:16.000]  They were, you know, working, he said.
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000]  And I said, how'd you start listening?
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  He goes, well, listen, years ago.
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  And then I went in the Army.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  He said he'd been listening about 10 years, and I went in the Army.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  And then I got out, and I've got all these, you know, disabilities and things, you know, from the war.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  And he said, then I started smoking marijuana, and I got caught with a little bit of it,
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  and I fought it because it was medical marijuana, and I had my medical marijuana card,
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  and he said they put me in jail for two years.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  And he said, but they were releasing carjackers and all these other criminals after months.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  And see, but that's true.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  You look at the statistics, you get caught with some marijuana in places like Texas.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  A lot of times they throw the book at you.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  He's a veteran, now a felon, two years in jail.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  He was, I think, 70-something days in the county jail before he went to prison fighting it.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  Because he fought it, they just kept him in jail, because he's a good worker.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  See, he'll make nice license plates and nice furniture.
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  He'll do a good job for him.
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  Sir, I really appreciate your call.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  Send me some info on that Iowa situation.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  I remember reading about it, but I forget the headline.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  Richard in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  Yeah, I'll tell you what I'm doing.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:30.000]  I just watched your film, The Republic Against Mint.
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  Very good.
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  Very well done.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  I'll catch you on the back for that.
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  What do you have on there?
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  You can do a eugenics film.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  I was just wondering if you're still planning on doing that, because I love your movies.
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  Man, I want to see another one.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  Yeah, here's the problem.
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  I do multiple radio interviews every day.
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  I'm running everything here in the office.
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  I got a bunch of new projects we're doing.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  And I am doing multiple TV interviews today.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  And I kind of was behind the scenes on, and it kind of got me out of my rhythm of always turning one out every six months.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  Because I kind of oversaw Burma's thing that took about a year longer than it was supposed to.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  We did a great job, just we took longer because I wasn't haunchoing it.
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  And then I kind of halfway haunchoed Police State 4.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  I mean, I didn't really make those films.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  Burma's directed one, I kind of quasi-helped on it.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  And my editors were taken away from the editors.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  We hired for him, and they did it.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  Aaron and Jacobson.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  And then I just kind of got out of my rhythm.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  And then I've kind of gotten into actually seeing my children about two hours a day.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  An hour in the morning, an hour or two at night.
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:36.000]  And so I just started seeing my children.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  I mean, there were whole years where I might just see them on one day on the weekend and a little bit on Sunday.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  And I don't know how long I'm going to be alive.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  And so I just, the magicness of being with my children, I just dream about quitting every day.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  I don't want the acclaim, the renown.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  I don't want all this attention, but it's a mission.
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  I go deeper into danger every day.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  And I'm just totally sick of everything.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  And my understanding, expanding so fast, I can hardly even explain the information.
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  But yes, sir, I've got like three films I started and never finished.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  I'm just all over the map.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  So we've shifted into a system of all these dozens of incredible interviews we've gotten flying around the country
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  and putting those out with some documentation as kind of presentation films on PrismPlanet.tv.
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  And they're being seen by millions in the aggregate, so we're still having the same effect on that front.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  But the films are so time intensive because I sit over every edit, every document, every voiceover
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  that when I make a film for months and months and months, I am up here till two in the morning
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  with big black circles around my eyes eating pizza and then becoming slovenly.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  And so I would certainly hope, Richard, to be able to get more of that done for you.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  Blue Star, Alex, Bruce, Justin and others, you're called straight ahead. Stay with us every minute, folks.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.000]  I want to run to the South Pacific. Every minute I want to punch out of here.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:04.000]  Normal blood pressure, naturally. How would that make you feel?
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:08.000]  I'm Don from New Mexico. January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  Then my real health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  and I really wasn't sleeping well. I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:20.000]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:25.000]  I started taking heart and body extract and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized and my sleep really did improve.
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of heart and body extract.

[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:53.000]  Folks, I did not expect this at all. By the 7th, 8th and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking heart and body extract.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 or heart and body extract.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:20.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  It stops free radicals, keeps sales young and reduces inflammation.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  One World Way protein powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:38.000]  One World Way is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass fed cows.
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:45.000]  All other quote cold processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.

[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:20.000]  There is no rest when you are involved in reality.
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  Alex Jones, Austin, Texas, 2211 does urgent radio six days a week web DVDs.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Blue Star in Canada. Blue Star, you're on the air.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:42.000]  I've got an amazing story that you might want to have this gentleman on your show, but it's got several points of interest.
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  For anybody that's going for closure, about three weeks ago I did an interview with Wico Girón.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  He was running for sheriff in New Mexico and he has taken up, he sued the IRS on racketeering charges and won.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  The main point right now where he's at is that he paid his mortgage in full.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  The mortgage company gave it to lawyers, which there was no lawyer's judgments.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  He has now told the local sheriff that he is going, not going to leave his property alive, standing up for his and our constitutional rights.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:22.000]  If you want to do a little bit more research on him, his site is Wico or Sheriff.com.
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  Alright, we'll check it out. Blue Star, very interesting.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  More and more people are drawing their line in the sand. Thank you for that information.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000]  That's what the globalists can't stand.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  Alex in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  Hello, Mr. Girón. Thank you for this is a chance to speak to the world of Info Warriors.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  I just want to say, see something, say something. It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:50.000]  It's completely exploiting one of the most observable errors in social psychology called fundamental attribution error,
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  where you overestimate situational attributes to be applying to the personality.
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  What I'm saying the public are the terrorists. It's saying don't trust anyone but the government.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  Yeah, exactly. If somebody pulls out in front of you, you say, oh, that man must be a bad driver.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  Well, no, that man's two-year-old just drank chlorine and he's rushing into the hospital.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  You can't make these assumptions on people.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  Well, it's like the realtors every week.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  I see articles where they see guns in a house and call the police where guns are legal because they don't live in reality.
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  They watch dramas based in New York where you're not allowed to own guns or Chicago.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  And they think that or they see reloading equipment and think it's bombs because it's advertised that it's like winning the lottery to find a terrorist.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  So it's a false reality they've been given.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  Yeah, I'm just waiting to get pulled over for my Ruger pride with an American flag sticker on my car.
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  The second thing I want to say, kind of unrelated, but I don't know if you've ever heard of a squid.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  It's called squid superconducting quantum interference device. It essentially measures very minute magnets or gravitational magnetic field.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  And I had a research or a teacher who was able to figure out that when you have two people in a room and one in person is on the other side of the room,
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  this machine can measure the other person's heartbeat inside yourself from across the room because it has an electrical field through the heartbeat.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  Just going to show that reality isn't what it seems. We are so...
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  Well, I remember eight years ago at four test airports, including Boston Logan,
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  CBS reported they put passive MRIs that scan your brainwaves from a distance and now they've announced they're going to start rolling these out on the streets.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  And then that's quackery. They just say, well, it shows you're a terrorist. The brainwave, bye-bye.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:54.000]  They've already disproven the old quackery of the lie detector test, sending hundreds of thousands of innocents to prison some to the lethal injection gas chamber electric chair.
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:58:02.000]  And so now they just go, we have new fangled equipment or we train our TSA people to be able to tell by your eye movements and your facial expressions of you're a terrorist.
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  And then these guys just constantly freaking out thinking they're Superman. It's all just made up.
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  As a psychologist myself, it makes me sick.
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  Well, your point about how they say, you know, a man's speeding, a lot of cops now pull somebody over, their dog's dying, their wife's dying.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  They'll go ahead and arrest them anyways and say, I'm calling for an ambulance.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  And the wife's dying of a heart attack. The dog's dying. There's been a lot of famous cases.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  And they get off in the jury trial and the cops are already mad that they were speeding. So the cop's got to be right.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  And citizens too, look at him speeding.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  Meanwhile, his wife's next to him dying in the car. The husband is.
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  Re-transmission starts now at FullWars.com.
