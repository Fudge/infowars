[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:09.000 --> 00:17.000]  The war was lost, the treaty signed, it was not cut across the land.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, so many tried.
[00:22.000 --> 00:40.000]  Britain's top so-called anti-terrorism expert came out as we all know on Monday and said that they have seen a 80 plus percent increases in MERS in the country and most of that is jihadist terrorists who are basically refugees of the Syrian war.
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.000]  Now this is the very government that's brought all of these individuals in that then says you should give up your liberties, but it gets better.
[00:47.000 --> 01:02.000]  This is on NewsWars.com. A top UK terrorism watchdog has asserted that some British jihadists returning from fighting with ISIS in the Middle East do not warrant prosecution due to their naivete.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  Oh wow, you only joined ISIS, al-Qaeda and should instead be reintegrated into society without penalty.
[01:07.000 --> 01:15.000]  That's the same thing going on in Sweden and in Germany and in Denmark and other areas. This is an admitted plan.
[01:15.000 --> 01:30.000]  Here's another one, DHS warns ISIS and al-Qaeda are planning 9-11 style attacks in the west, but that's okay that we have al-Aqbar attacks every day in the US, Europe, you name it.
[01:30.000 --> 01:39.000]  There's a new TV drama Star depicts white racist harassing Muslims dumping BLM activists out of a wheelchair.
[01:39.000 --> 01:48.000]  So see, we don't have real attacks on Muslims in this country or real attacks on BLM folks. They're the ones out killing cops and the rest of it are yelling al-Aqbar and killing people.
[01:48.000 --> 02:02.000]  So we just create simulations of it and put it on Fox News and then just show the imaginary evil white people and then real BLM goes out and attacks and kills white people and cops.
[02:02.000 --> 02:11.000]  Because, well, they saw it on television. Oh, there's an alliance. The poor black guy has the poor little Muslim lady wearing a burqa at the store.
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  He takes care of her from the evil whites, even though statistically whites are the second lowest crime rate out there.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  Asians are the lowest crime rate than whites.
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.000]  Blacks have tenfold the murder rate on average of whites and I'm not bashing black folks. That's still a small minority of blacks doing it.
[02:27.000 --> 02:38.000]  The point is, everywhere. This is Fox Television. They're telling you that whites are the scourge of total criminal evil and that, you know, we've all got to apologize.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  Well, it's not a hate crime that whites exist. Western civilization is not a hate crime.
[02:45.000 --> 02:55.000]  In fact, Western civilization, historians from China to you name it have said has been the open and most free experiment the last 500 years.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  That was just as barbarous as everybody else before that. But something special happened in the West and that's why the globalists want to demonize it and discredit it.
[03:02.000 --> 03:10.000]  Because the new modern world government authoritarianism is in direct competition with free market Western values.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  Because it cannot compete.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  So, jihadists returning from ISIS should reintegrate into society says Britain's top anti-terrorism official.
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  But don't worry. We've got lots of simulated TV programs where the poor Muslims are being attacked.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  I thought I would just lead with that because I'm not against Muslims in general.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  But I'm against Muslims being protected when they commit crimes, brought in, unvetted, allowed to attack people, seeing it statistically covered up.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  Instead of Muslim, let's shoot six people, kill three of them in Maryland, got almost no coverage.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  Just two days ago, this is happening constantly.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  And then if you're concerned about it, you're a bigot.
[03:50.000 --> 04:01.000]  Well, guess what? I have stacks of news articles here where people are being executed or people are being put in prison because they get caught kissing their girlfriend in public.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  I mean, those are news articles I've got today. That's intolerant. That's absolutely dangerous.
[04:08.000 --> 04:17.000]  I'm not going to sit here and watch it use as a political tool to beat me over the head all day in the name of tolerance, except intolerance.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  It's an oxy moron.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  Got a lot of news that's very informative coming up and very positive.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  There's the headline on drudgerport.com. It's also up on newswords.com.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  Tax cuts gain momentum.
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  Rand Paul all in saying it's a great plan to cut spending, to cut taxes at the same time and give Americans more money to get the economy back on.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  I'm very excited to see him also behind the repeal plan that we have there.
[04:42.000 --> 04:50.000]  We've got a director, a producer in studio of the award-winning film exposing Hollywood pedophilia in studio with us next hour.
[04:50.000 --> 05:07.000]  The masses of other news as well will be back in 60 seconds to kick off the main transmission. Please spread the word.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  99.99% ultra-pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[05:25.000 --> 05:33.000]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[05:33.000 --> 05:40.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[06:16.000 --> 06:29.000]  You have found it, the tip of the spear, the front line of the ever-expanding renaissance, the great enlightenment, great human empowerment,
[06:29.000 --> 06:39.000]  that the eclectocratic global technocrats, the authoritarians, hate more than anything else in the universe is free will.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  We are the defense of free will.
[06:42.000 --> 06:55.000]  We are the info war. And as you see, we promote freedom and family and success and honor and duty and set that up against globalism that is dishonor and enslavement.
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.000]  The whole world says we want the renaissance. We want the American dream.
[07:01.000 --> 07:11.000]  We want what has never been fully realized but even partially realized was incontrovertibly light years better than any other human system.
[07:11.000 --> 07:19.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the 20th day of October, 2017. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  We're going to be here live the next four hours.
[07:22.000 --> 07:29.000]  Roger Stone had a conversation yesterday with someone very, very close to the president.
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.000]  I'll just leave it at that. We'll see how much he wants to get into some very important news at the bottom of the hour.
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  And another little bird I know also had a conversation with the president today.
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  And I learned some information from that report I got from the person that had a conversation with the president.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  So I'll be relaying that to you. I don't know how much I'm going to get into.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  I still got to think about it because the call happened about an hour ago and give me the latest intel on that front.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Now let's get to some of the negative news first before I get to all the good news.
[08:01.000 --> 08:09.000]  North Korea warns U.S. it will respond with fire, with fire, saying U.N. sanctions would be attempted to declare war.
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  They basically say, if you put more sanctions on us, we're going to attack you.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  So we're going to be getting into all of that as well.
[08:17.000 --> 08:25.000]  A lot of science and tech news, they have found a giant lunar cave that is just amazing.
[08:25.000 --> 08:33.000]  Japanese scientists have discovered the massive cave on the moon that can one day serve as a shelter for astronauts, colonizing a rocky neighbor.
[08:33.000 --> 08:45.000]  According to the reports, it is 30 miles long, 330 feet wide, which is a lot of what folks at NASA have told me was already discovered by NASA but has been kept secret.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  I was told that by Buzz Aldrin in a conversation I've talked about.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  He's been on air before, but in a conversation out in Los Angeles where he told me a lot of interesting things.
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  I thought he was putting me on, but I was walking through an airport almost a year later and what he told me was on the cover of USA Today.
[09:02.000 --> 09:23.000]  That the Indians had crashed a probe by design at thousands of miles an hour to the surface of the moon with another probe that popped off the back so that it could then fly back around and pick up the jet of particles from the explosion and analyze whether there was water.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  They found that it was basically pure water at a certain depth.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  Buzz Aldrin told me that and laughed about how they discovered it by the early 70s, that they would have the Indians announce it within the year.
[09:34.000 --> 09:48.000]  Just amazing the breakaway civilization. Let me tell you, of course you know Stephen Bannon worked in secret NASA programs and on terra-farming projects as well at the highest levels, but you never hear about that in the news, do you?
[09:48.000 --> 09:57.000]  No. I'm going to leave it at that and let people figure it out for themselves. Okay, let's go ahead now and move into the other big news.
[09:57.000 --> 10:17.000]  This dovetails with the fact that Trump is moving to have the new federal trade commission head be a anti-monopoly expert who successfully taken on monopolies in the past and a look at busting up Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others that do operate as oligopolies and brag of their corporate documents.
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  That would really free up our economy in a lot of big ways, especially of Google, Facebook, and Twitter while operating as monopolies then censor.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  The only censorship that works is a monopoly and it is the plague of free societies.
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  That ties into this juicy tidbit for the New York Post. Failure on tax cuts really could tank the markets.
[10:39.000 --> 10:50.000]  And you've got the big ratings companies and the Federal Reserve run by Janet Yellen raising interest rates. They're saying for a fifth time coming up soon, 25 basis points.
[10:50.000 --> 11:01.000]  If it goes any higher, experts across the board say it will tank the market and even though it's a bubble, it'll tank other real main street markets and it's not a good idea to say the least.
[11:01.000 --> 11:09.000]  The answer is to get the tax cuts free spending, paying down the debt, and let people have more of the discretionary income. That is the model, the Americana model.
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  They know it works, but it's not a good command and control model to centralize control. The globalists don't like it.
[11:15.000 --> 11:24.000]  So here's the big report out of Reuters. Trump tax cuts gain momentum as Rand Paul goes all in. Rand Paul's looked at the numbers.
[11:24.000 --> 11:33.000]  A man of great integrity, like his father, and said just like his father said a few months ago here on air, that Trump's doing good on what he's trying with the economy.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  They just don't know if he'll be successful, the Democrat-Republican parties standing in the way.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  Use Republican Senator Rand Paul on Friday appeared to back Trump's administration sweeping tax cut plan saying he was all in for massive tax cuts.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  He was the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  But many experts say that it's gaining a lot of momentum. Here it is.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  Republicans urge only some reform this year. That's out of McClatchy.
[11:58.000 --> 12:05.000]  Oh, look, IRS to block and suspend tax returns that lack Obamacare disclosures.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  Then they're going to claim criminal penalties against you saying you're a non-filer.
[12:09.000 --> 12:18.000]  There's no law you have to take vaccines, but we'll kick your child out if they don't have them, even though that's not a law, then call the truancy officer on you.
[12:18.000 --> 12:28.000]  And fraud upon fraud. Remember just four years ago, Alex Jones is a liar, quote, deeply racist because he doesn't like Obamacare, MSNBC.
[12:28.000 --> 12:36.000]  And Matt Drudge was a liar, led a fact, all of them, saying there's no fines or fees and the IRS isn't over Obamacare.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  No, it was just in the bill. And then the Supreme Court ruled months after it was law that it was a tax.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  And so they had the power to do it. Even though it was a tax paid to private multinational corporations.
[12:50.000 --> 12:57.000]  Boy, if that in colonialism, if that in the IMF World Bank model of looting third world countries, nothing is.
[12:57.000 --> 13:09.000]  But there it is. The average fine in 2017 is $2,000. If you don't go get so-called Obamacare, some people paying up to $5,000, that's individually.
[13:09.000 --> 13:18.000]  Business owners that don't get it, who have more than 50 employees, because we're in that little net, get to pay more than $5,000.
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.000]  And then the employee pays it as well, up to $2,000. But there's no, remember, it's a conspiracy theory.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  In fact, just search engine, Matt Drudge lies about Obama penalty.
[13:30.000 --> 13:40.000]  And Drudge said, I'm not getting it, I'm not getting rid of all the insurance, which they're going to force me to do, and then go get this thing in the so-called market.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  I'm just going to take the fine. And there were the headlines everywhere. He's a liar.
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  Media wrongly attacked Drudge after he admits paying Obamacare penalty.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  That's even another twisting of the facts, unless he paid it later. I know he was saying he wasn't going to.
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  So there you go. Drudge exposes another Obamacare lie, pays liberty tax.
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  So there you go, saying he'd take the fine.
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  The point is, they then came out and said he was a liar, it didn't exist, hoping you were idiots.
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  Hoping you were morons, mainstream media told you, there's no fines, there's no fees, the IRS isn't involved.
[14:19.000 --> 14:28.000]  Well, here it is, CNBC, IRS to block suspend tax returns that lack Obamacare disclosures.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  Isn't that just cute? I'm going to ask Roger Stone about this when he joins us.
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  Trump offers support to GOP senators in Bannon's crosshairs. That is pure good cop, bad cop from my research.
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.000]  Oh, meanwhile, two former presidents from both parties blasts the state of American politics in unprecedented day.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  Ooh, the discredited master conspiracy theorists that lied about WMDs in Iraq.
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  George W. Bush crawls out from under his rock to also talk about bigoted America and Senator Obama.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  Too globalist, mad that there's a new sheriff in town. Here it is.
[15:03.000 --> 15:13.000]  Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  There are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself is waned, especially among the young
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  who never experienced the galvanizing moral clarity of the Cold War
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  or never focused on the ruin of entire nations by socialist central planning.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  Stop right there. At least Bush knocked socialist central planning, that's a known nightmare,
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  but then the rest is he's the guy that helped expand all that
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  and helped empower the U.N. with his father, Mr. New World Order.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  And then we're the conspiracy theorists, we're the bigots, but you don't give any examples.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's more hot air, don't we? Come back. We're going to destroy.
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  I mean, destroy this congresswoman lying about what Trump does in phone calls to troops.
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty, center cut presidential bacon. Savory and delicious.
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  I buy some, I use some, I store some. Awesome.

[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.

[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  Infowarslife.com
[19:57.000 --> 20:04.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[20:04.000 --> 20:09.000]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on your mind.
[20:09.000 --> 20:18.000]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on your mind.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on your mind.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on your mind.
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  Congresswoman Fredrica Wilson now calls herself a rockstar,
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  after she uses the deaths of US soldiers,
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.000]  the deaths of her constituents' family members as a red shirt to wave at Trump
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  and act like he hates our military or hates America.
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  So they're now attacking Trump on his strong points.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  They've tried to say he's a Russian agent, a racist, a rapist, none of it's true, none of it's stuck.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  So now they're moving on to the next phase to claim he hates our military.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  So, say what you want about General Kelly.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  He lost his son, a Marine in Iraq, and he was really, really upset when he defended the president,
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  who he's seen make many of the phone calls to the grieving families.
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  I personally have gotten nice phone calls when I got remarried by the president.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  He's super gracious, and the idea that he's not is simply incredible.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  So here is General Kelly.
[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  We'll get to a phone call that a family recorded of Trump calling him that was just released today by one of the families.
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  And then we'll play Fredrica Wilson laughing about how she pulled this stunt.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  Here is General Kelly, Chief of Staff at the White House.
[21:42.000 --> 21:53.000]  I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning, brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing.
[21:53.000 --> 22:00.000]  A member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the President of the United States to a young wife.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  And in his way tried to express that opinion.
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  He's a brave man, a fallen hero.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  He knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted, there's no reason on one list, he enlisted.
[22:14.000 --> 22:22.000]  And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  That was the message, that was the message that was transmitted.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  Absolutely stuns me.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  And I thought, at least that was sacred.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  You know, as a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  That's obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  Life, the dignity of life, was sacred, that's gone.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  Religion, that seems to be gone as well.
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  Gold star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer.
[23:04.000 --> 23:13.000]  I just thought the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die in the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred.
[23:13.000 --> 23:20.000]  And when I listened to this woman and what she was saying, and what she was doing on TV,
[23:20.000 --> 23:28.000]  the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this earth.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  And you can always find them because they're in our Lincoln National Cemetery.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  Went over there for an hour and a half, walked among the stones, some of whom I put there,
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.
[23:42.000 --> 23:47.000]  That's really hard felt for him because there's a video he did at a Marine Corps banquet after his son had died
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  and he basically said the same thing that Trump said in that phone call.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  That's why Kelly so touched is that it's very similar to what Kelly has said about the loss of his son
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  and what he says when he calls the families of Marines that have died.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  Trump does the just exactly right thing to do and they turn all that around and call it evil.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  It's truly sickening. That's why I get a lot more respect for Kelly now.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  She and him do things like this. Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  Here's an actual phone call that's on infowars.com from the Daily Caller got it.
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  It's also on dredgerport.com with a family getting a call from the president about their son that's been killed in combat.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  Here it is.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  Yes, sir.
[24:28.000 --> 24:42.000]  I am so sorry to hear about the whole situation. One of the hardest things except that he's an unbelievable hero and you know all the people who served with him say how incredible he was.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  He's just an amazing guy and I'm scared.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  Kelly's a great hero.
[24:50.000 --> 24:58.000]  Thank you President Trump. Those words are very kind. He was an amazing man, an amazing husband and an amazing soldier.
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.000]  I couldn't be more proud of my husband than I am right now so to be honest with you.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  It's what my husband wanted to be.
[25:08.000 --> 25:20.000]  He was the leader and he was the boss. He was the special guy. Go ahead.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  Yes, he's just an all around guy and I'm glad that you got to get to know a little bit about him and get to hear a little bit about him, sir.
[25:27.000 --> 25:39.000]  My husband is, to me, he was already my hero to be honest with you. We've been together 15 years, 5 children, run down real quick 2017, 15, 12, and 4.
[25:39.000 --> 25:49.000]  My son is currently in college in Missouri playing football so when I say all around a hero, yes, and for now it's like the world gets to know he is an American hero so thank you.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  I really, really appreciate it. I really do, sir. Thank you.
[25:53.000 --> 26:05.000]  That is so amazing. I'll tell you, when you're around, if you could, you know the people to deal with, but if you're around in Washington, you come over and see me at the Oval Office, okay?
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  Yes, sir.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  You just come over and see me because you are just the kind of family. This is what we want.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  And now, sir, I've been a football player as your son at Missouri. You've got to be pretty good. That's a good team.
[26:18.000 --> 26:27.000]  Yes, sir. He's cornerback. He's been playing since he was 5 and he got a full academic scholarship when we were stationed in Hawaii, school field barracks, sir.
[26:27.000 --> 26:37.000]  So it's his life. That's what he always wants to do. You know, he's doing it, sir. He's making me proud and he's making his father proud in heaven so I have no complaints. I really don't.
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  I'm a proud woman.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  He's got an academic scholarship.
[26:41.000 --> 26:50.000]  Not a sports scholarship. Not a sports scholarship. It was academic. He's had a 3.7 and above, sir, since the grades could from kindergarten all the way up to 12th grade.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  Man, my husband, we never had to worry and never had to stress on him doing it and just to add that he loves football on it first.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  There are no words, sir, to tell you how proud I am of my son. He's 20.
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  He's 20.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  Oh, God, yes. It's like a...
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  Are your other kids all outstanding? Yes.
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  We got some soccer players. You know, they're always a couple in the group here and I have...
[27:17.000 --> 27:27.000]  We have soccer players, cheerleaders, singers. It's a roundabout of talent and they all have their special ways and their own ways. You know, they're all truly amazing kids. So, yeah.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  We are truly blessed. Yes, we are.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  But you just take care of yourself. Yes, sir.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  When you're in Washington and say hello to your children and tell them their father was a great hero that I respected and just...
[27:41.000 --> 27:50.000]  I learned a lot. Before I made the call, I'd like to learn and to make the kind of a guy you were. So, just tell them I said your father was a great hero.
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.000]  And take care of yourself this time. You know that. It's going to be the next time.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  Thank you so much.
[27:59.000 --> 28:07.000]  I'm honored to talk to you. Thank you, sir. And to you the same, okay? I really appreciate it, sir. And thank you. Thank you very much.
[28:07.000 --> 28:14.000]  Thank myself and family. Thank you. Thank you very much, darling. You take care of yourself. You too, sir. Bye.
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.000]  It makes me get tears in my eyes to think that the mainstream media and this Congresswoman would lie about that recording and put out this info.
[28:20.000 --> 28:28.000]  There is nothing they won't do. They have no decency. They are evil. Here is the Congresswoman, Fredrica Wilson. Let's fade down the music.

[28:32.000 --> 28:45.000]  You mean to tell me that I have become so important? That the White House is following me in my work? This is amazing. This is amazing.
[28:45.000 --> 28:54.000]  That is absolutely phenomenal. I have to tell my kids that I'm a rock star now. I'm a rock star now. I'm a rock star now.

[34:47.320 --> 34:53.320]  America is sexy, America is cool, and America is back.
[34:53.320 --> 34:55.320]  They tried to demoralize this.
[34:55.320 --> 34:58.320]  They thought they'd beaten us into submission.
[34:58.320 --> 35:05.320]  The sleeping giant was only in a coma, but their attacks have now risen the phoenix back into the air.
[35:05.320 --> 35:07.320]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[35:07.320 --> 35:09.320]  We got a little bit of this segment, longer segment coming up.
[35:09.320 --> 35:12.320]  We're getting into a lot of news with Roger Stone, some big breaking stuff here in just a moment.
[35:12.320 --> 35:19.320]  But I am fired up because the globalists in their own internal publications are admitting they'll never put this back together again.
[35:19.320 --> 35:23.320]  Even their race war, scorched earth policies won't work.
[35:23.320 --> 35:29.320]  He's gone from giving 500 million a year to overthrow the U.S. to putting 18 million in, Soros.
[35:29.320 --> 35:31.320]  I mean, this is just full panic alert.
[35:31.320 --> 35:38.320]  He's just like, battle the bulge, Hitler, Zeb Dietrich ordering him to launch everything the Germans had at once to stop us.
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.320]  It's desperation. Launch everything you've got. Launch it all. I love it.
[35:42.320 --> 35:44.320]  More targets, baby. Let's go.
[35:44.320 --> 35:49.320]  We have the superior ideology, and America's awake now, you piece of filth.
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.320]  Excuse me. Stop right there.
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.320]  I'm telling you, you can feel the victory rising.
[35:56.320 --> 36:02.320]  That means the enemy's not gonna strike back, but as long as we're ready to ram heads with these people in this game of chicken, we're gonna win.
[36:02.320 --> 36:05.320]  One way or the other, we're gonna run these globalists down.
[36:05.320 --> 36:07.320]  Now, let me just stop there.
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.320]  We're listed, supported. I've been running 50% off on all our best-selling products.
[36:11.320 --> 36:15.320]  Not because I can't sell them, but because they've been selling out discounted.
[36:15.320 --> 36:21.320]  I thought I'll increase orders massively, and then I'll 50% off them.
[36:21.320 --> 36:26.320]  It's been wildly successful, but we are about to sell out in the next week or two.
[36:26.320 --> 36:31.320]  I might get more in for over a month and a half of our best-selling Neutropic brain force.
[36:31.320 --> 36:34.320]  Now, 20% more that never even asked Roger Stone to plug it.
[36:34.320 --> 36:36.320]  He loves it. It's one of the best Neutropics out there.
[36:36.320 --> 36:38.320]  Similar formulas are $70 to $80.
[36:38.320 --> 36:44.320]  Ours is $39 usually. It's $19.96 right now, because I want you to try it if you haven't.
[36:44.320 --> 36:49.320]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or triple-A2533139.
[36:49.320 --> 36:56.320]  I've got to end it because, again, I don't want to be sold out for another month and a half until we get more in in the middle of December.
[36:56.320 --> 36:58.320]  So, Brain Force Plus, thank you all for your support.

[37:44.320 --> 37:46.320]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[37:49.320 --> 37:51.320]  There is a lot happening.
[37:51.320 --> 37:53.320]  Trump's got Rand Paul on board for the tax cuts.
[37:53.320 --> 37:55.320]  That'll really put the economy into turbo charge.
[37:55.320 --> 38:02.320]  Trump's putting in a federal trade commission head who is anti-globalist, anti-trust, anti-Google.
[38:02.320 --> 38:04.320]  That is amazing positive news.
[38:04.320 --> 38:07.320]  We have got Hollywood collapsing.
[38:07.320 --> 38:11.320]  The pedophile scandal is about to break next hour with the producer, the award-winning film,
[38:11.320 --> 38:15.320]  an open secret that's forced mainstream media to report on the giant pedophile rings.
[38:15.320 --> 38:18.320]  We've got breaking news, breaking evidence next hour.
[38:18.320 --> 38:20.320]  We've got so much to get into.
[38:20.320 --> 38:27.320]  The Clinton Foundation has been caught red-handed not reporting secret meetings with Uranium One with Vladimir Putin.
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.320]  I mean, everything they said about Trump and Stone and myself, it was them.
[38:31.320 --> 38:33.320]  Of course, it's like the old spy movie.
[38:33.320 --> 38:36.320]  You catch the spy, they go, no, he's the spy, he's the spy.
[38:36.320 --> 38:37.320]  We have them now.
[38:37.320 --> 38:39.320]  I mean, this is incredible.
[38:39.320 --> 38:40.320]  Mueller's in trouble.
[38:40.320 --> 38:44.320]  Even the left's turning against him as we now learn he's confirmed the bag man with Uranium,
[38:44.320 --> 38:45.320]  literally delivering it.
[38:45.320 --> 38:46.320]  So that's all there.
[38:46.320 --> 38:55.320]  But joining us now, Roger Stone, a former head of the Trump campaign, back in 2000 and in 2015, 2016,
[38:55.320 --> 38:58.320]  you now got some intel from El Presidente.
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.320]  I don't know how far you want to go, but some interesting things on the radar screen that will come back in the next segment
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.320]  and get into Russiagate now completely flipped back on the Democrats.
[39:07.320 --> 39:11.320]  So this is just quite a turn of events.
[39:11.320 --> 39:15.320]  So Roger, front and center, what's happening right now?
[39:15.320 --> 39:22.320]  Well, Alex, yesterday I had the opportunity to make the case directly to the president of the United States by phone.
[39:22.320 --> 39:34.320]  As to why I believe it is essential that he release the balance of the currently redacted and classified JFK assassination documents.
[39:34.320 --> 39:45.320]  As you know, back in the 90s, the JFK Document Release Act mandated that the documents would be released over time to the American people,
[39:45.320 --> 39:55.320]  unless at some juncture, the president of the United States has the express specific authority to postpone one of those releases,
[39:55.320 --> 39:58.320]  in which case it is put off for 25 years.
[39:58.320 --> 40:05.320]  Now, a very good White House source, not the president, told me that the Central Intelligence Agency,
[40:05.320 --> 40:14.320]  specifically CIA Director Mike Pompeo, has been lobbying the president furiously not to release these documents.
[40:14.320 --> 40:23.320]  Why? Because I believe they show that Oswald was trained, nurtured and put in place by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[40:23.320 --> 40:30.320]  It sheds very bad light on the deep state, the same characters trying to take down our president right now.
[40:30.320 --> 40:36.320]  So I had a very good opportunity to speak with the president only yesterday.
[40:36.320 --> 40:40.320]  I made the case in a very organized and cogent way.
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.320]  He did not tip off his current decision.
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.320]  We're going to have to wait, I guess, now six days before we learn.
[40:48.320 --> 40:56.320]  But he was all ears, and I can tell you, as a guiding philosophy, Alex, he believes in transparency.
[40:56.320 --> 40:59.320]  He believes in the people's right to know.
[40:59.320 --> 41:03.320]  I am optimistic that the president is going to do the right thing.
[41:03.320 --> 41:05.320]  He didn't tell me what his decision would be.
[41:05.320 --> 41:06.320]  I want to stress that.
[41:06.320 --> 41:14.320]  He took it all in, but just based on his general comments and his long history of supporting transparency,
[41:14.320 --> 41:16.320]  I think he's going to do the right thing.
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.320]  Now, you've written several bestselling books on the Kennedy assassination, New York Times bestsellers,
[41:21.320 --> 41:29.320]  and what, 20 years after they were supposed to declassify it, then 40 years after, now, we're way past that,
[41:29.320 --> 41:38.320]  but 1963 being so long ago, when's the next time he should be declassified if President Trump doesn't release him?
[41:38.320 --> 41:46.320]  Well, under the JFK assassination act, we've already had two data dumps once under Bill Clinton.
[41:46.320 --> 41:54.320]  That makes sense, because unlike the Bushes, he had no involvement or culpability on November 22, 1963.
[41:54.320 --> 42:04.320]  This last tranche of documents, 3100 files, includes a psychological profile on Lee Harvey Oswald conducted by the CIA.
[42:04.320 --> 42:13.320]  It includes a classified testimony before the Congress by both top officials at the CIA and the FBI.
[42:13.320 --> 42:21.320]  It includes all the government records about Oswald's mysterious trip to Mexico City,
[42:21.320 --> 42:29.320]  which there's been many historical questions about, and it includes the secret diaries of E. Howard Hunt,
[42:29.320 --> 42:36.320]  famous CIA operative, and later, Watergate burglar. His son, St. John Hunt, knows what's in these documents.
[42:36.320 --> 42:42.320]  Hold on, this is too sensational. Roger Stone, just talked to the president, we'll be right back to break this down.
[42:42.320 --> 42:46.320]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones. If you're watching or listening, you are the resistance.
[42:46.320 --> 42:54.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[42:57.320 --> 43:01.320]  The Left is proposing new Orwellian efforts to combat fake news.
[43:01.320 --> 43:06.320]  A proposal called Fool Me Once, the case for government regulation of fake news,
[43:06.320 --> 43:14.320]  hopes to squash the spread of information on social media platforms by threatening libel suits to anyone who thinks of sharing or retweeting some wrongthink.
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.320]  Now, there's no solid definition of what's considered disinformation other than what the Left says,
[43:19.320 --> 43:28.320]  but radical Democrats would like to see regulation in the form of pop-ups that would remind a user of libel laws before they decide to share an article in dispute.
[43:28.320 --> 43:35.320]  Sites like Info Wars and the Drudge Report would immediately be targeted, discouraging users from sharing articles.
[43:35.320 --> 43:42.320]  Ironically, George W. Bush reemerged this week to insult the American people for their obsession with conspiracy theories.
[43:42.320 --> 43:46.320]  This coming from the man who peddled the most devastating conspiracy theory of the modern era,
[43:46.320 --> 43:54.320]  the weapons of mass destruction lie that was dutifully spread by the deep state intelligence agencies and the mainstream media as the indisputable truth.

[45:37.320 --> 45:46.320]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[45:46.320 --> 45:50.320]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[45:50.320 --> 45:54.320]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[47:25.320 --> 47:38.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[47:38.320 --> 47:44.320]  It's been about 20 years. I've been on there 22 and a half. I've been saying we're the Resistance to the Globalist.
[47:44.320 --> 47:49.320]  And my old friend, big director, I'm going to call him the Texas director, not a Hollywood director.
[47:49.320 --> 47:56.320]  Rick Linkletter was in a big BuzzFeed article this week saying, I like Alex. He's a smart guy. He means well.
[47:56.320 --> 48:00.320]  But I thought he's anti-establishment. Why is he so pro-Trump?
[48:00.320 --> 48:05.320]  Well, I mean, Trump's a beachhead for Americana. Look at the economy. Look at the jobs.
[48:05.320 --> 48:07.320]  Look at the veterans getting taken care of.
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.320]  Look at how we're trying to get factories back here. We've had one-sided deals.
[48:12.320 --> 48:20.320]  So if you ask why, I want to take America back. I want to expose unelected globalism.
[48:20.320 --> 48:22.320]  Trump just killed the TPP.
[48:22.320 --> 48:29.320]  Trump is doing, I'd say, 90% of the things I would do. Rand Paul's behind him on his tax cuts.
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.320]  They're Kennedy tax cuts where you double the revenue that comes in when you cut taxes because people spend more money.
[48:35.320 --> 48:38.320]  It's already happening just on the idea it may happen.
[48:38.320 --> 48:45.320]  So while, you know, normally, Roger won't talk about phone calls with the president because he becomes a big media circus,
[48:45.320 --> 48:51.320]  and he'd rather just, you know, be able to talk to the president about important issues like Sheriff Arpaio or things like that.
[48:51.320 --> 49:00.320]  But this is big. JFK, all these decades after what happened back in 1963 in Dealey Plaza in my own hometown of Dallas, Texas,
[49:00.320 --> 49:05.320]  there's old Kennedy die in the same hospital I was born in.
[49:05.320 --> 49:08.320]  People come out of the world. They come into the world.
[49:08.320 --> 49:13.320]  But here's Roger Stone rarely gets in his discussions with POTUS, but he's doing it.
[49:13.320 --> 49:18.320]  And Roger, normally you don't like to get into, you just say sources. You have a lot of sources that aren't the president.
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.320]  Why now are you talking about your conversation with the president? Because this is going to be all over the news.
[49:23.320 --> 49:30.320]  Well, Alex, because in this case, the president didn't reveal to me what he's going to do.
[49:30.320 --> 49:40.320]  It was a fairly one-sided conversation. By the way, as to those media reports last week about the president being depressed or confused
[49:40.320 --> 49:49.320]  or disgusted or feeling negative about how things are going, I didn't detect any of that at all.
[49:49.320 --> 49:54.320]  He was upbeat. He was a bullion. He was friendly. He said to me, and I quote,
[49:54.320 --> 50:02.320]  you see, we're going to turbocharge this economy. You haven't seen anything yet. He's deeply committed to these tax cuts
[50:02.320 --> 50:08.320]  that will give America economic growth like nothing we've ever seen before.
[50:08.320 --> 50:13.320]  I feel okay about this because the issue is very good and it's very important.
[50:13.320 --> 50:22.320]  And I was able to make my case in a comprehensive way to the president as to why the JFK documents should be released.
[50:22.320 --> 50:28.320]  I guarantee you that he's heard the other side of this argument from the Central Intelligence Agency
[50:28.320 --> 50:34.320]  that they don't want their methods exposed. They don't want their track record exposed.
[50:34.320 --> 50:41.320]  I think we know why they're opposed to the release of these documents mandated by law back in the 90s.
[50:41.320 --> 50:51.320]  And that's because they're likely to show that Lee Harvey Oswald was trained, nurtured and put in place by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[50:51.320 --> 50:57.320]  A number of JFK research scholars have thought this for some time. There's a lot of anecdotal proof of it.
[50:57.320 --> 51:05.320]  I think that these documents will nail it. Everybody involved, with the exception of George H.W. Bush, is now dead.
[51:05.320 --> 51:10.320]  Alex, there's no reason why the American people shouldn't know the truth.
[51:10.320 --> 51:14.320]  In my gut, I think the president's going to do the right thing.
[51:14.320 --> 51:21.320]  Well, George H.W. Bush said he became director of the CIA in the early 1970s, never being in the CIA, but then later it came out in CIA documents.
[51:21.320 --> 51:31.320]  He was in Texas. He had sapata oil. He was involved in the Bay of Pigs. They were using the oil companies and offshore drilling rigs as their fronts.
[51:31.320 --> 51:37.320]  It's kind of an open secret around here in Texas. I'm not going to get into it, but let's just say I don't need to read about it in history books.
[51:37.320 --> 51:46.320]  And all of this was going on. All of this was happening. And we know that he's already, CIA documents have come out.
[51:46.320 --> 51:56.320]  So when more, thousands of pages come out, there's a reason they're trying to keep us suppressed because it will validate and vindicate everything we've ever talked about.
[51:56.320 --> 52:05.320]  No, that's exactly right. The last time we had a data dump like this, we found a memo from J. Edgar Hoover to the head of the FBI office in Dallas, Texas,
[52:05.320 --> 52:14.320]  instructing him to brief George Bush of the CIA regarding the activities of anti-Castro Cubans in the Dallas area.
[52:14.320 --> 52:29.320]  Now, as you point out, George Bush denies that he was working for the CIA in 1963, meaning he perjured himself before the United States Senate in the 70s when he was appointed the director of central intelligence.
[52:29.320 --> 52:41.320]  Only yesterday, George W. Bush really took my breath away. He attacked the president for conspiracy theories, his immigration policy, and his trade policies.
[52:41.320 --> 52:54.320]  Let me get this straight. George W. Bush, who lied our way into war costing American lives and hundreds of millions over non-existent weapons of mass destruction
[52:54.320 --> 53:05.320]  and yellow cake uranium that he claimed was in the possession of Saddam Hussein, George W. Bush, who crashed our economy worse than any president in modern history,
[53:05.320 --> 53:18.320]  George W. Bush, who covered up the fact that his immigration policies allowed 940s to sneak into the country and attack this country on 9-11, he's got room to talk about Donald Trump.
[53:18.320 --> 53:30.320]  That's right. And since you mentioned that, here he is. Here's the former president, Obama, attacked on the same day, acting saying there's bigotry going on, just with no evidence,
[53:30.320 --> 53:41.320]  and then saying that he's sick of these conspiracy theories. He means people questioning known liars like him that achieve conspiracy theorists. Here it is.
[53:41.320 --> 53:57.320]  Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication. There are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself is waned, especially among the young.
[53:57.320 --> 54:10.320]  That's good. So, here he is saying people are emboldened. Yes, we're emboldened, we're awake, we're aware of what's going on. Roger Stone, presidents don't normally attack other presidents.
[54:10.320 --> 54:24.320]  The fact that Obama and Bush came out yesterday when they're both so loathed by the base, this is a good thing. Don't they get that we've fully broken with them, that we don't like the establishment, that America's getting back to truly being independent?
[54:24.320 --> 54:39.320]  That's what I don't think your friend, the director, Link Letter, understands. Donald Trump is the epitome of the anti-establishment. If you want to know what the establishment thinks, you've got Obama and Bush when they have to roll Bush out to attack Trump.
[54:39.320 --> 54:54.320]  Bush was loathed by the American people. He destroyed our economy and he literally killed thousands of Americans in an unjust war that he lied us into. Where does he have the room, the place to talk about anything involving this president?
[54:54.320 --> 55:03.320]  As far as I'm concerned, George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush, should both be prosecuted for their lies and crimes against the United States.
[55:03.320 --> 55:14.320]  These people, the hotspot is amazing, just breathtaking. They don't understand, they're discredited, they're despised and no one believes a word they say, Alex.
[55:14.320 --> 55:32.320]  Shifting years now, if you go to newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, we have mainline reports, documents, congressional hearings now, admitting that the Clintons both illegally met when she was Secretary of State and Bill Clinton was floating around with Putin, with Russians, with Uranium One, when it was under FBI investigation.
[55:32.320 --> 55:44.320]  That then got killed. I mean, they are literally caught with the smoking gun, bags in their hands illegally doing all of this. Wow. I mean, the worm has turned here, Roger.
[55:44.320 --> 56:02.320]  Well, here is some major breaking news, Alex. I have just learned from a very reliable FBI source that the FBI has opened an investigation between the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile, and Harvey Weinstein.
[56:02.320 --> 56:18.320]  In a meeting close buddy of Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton was on his private plane, the Lolita Express, 23 times, visited his private Orgy Island. We now learn that Epstein was supplying underage girls to Weinstein.
[56:18.320 --> 56:29.320]  That is the subject of a new investigation by the FBI. And of course this leads to Bill Clinton. What do they have in common? The answer would be Bill Clinton.
[56:29.320 --> 56:35.320]  What is Bill Clinton doing on Orgy Island? What is Bill Clinton doing on that plane? The American people demand to know.
[56:35.320 --> 56:41.320]  Well, this is so bombshell, and I know there's more you talk about with the President and your sources, so do five more minutes with us.
[56:41.320 --> 56:50.320]  But just briefly, because you've got great FBI sources, you're exclusively breaking here that there is a Justice Department criminal investigation of Weinstein and Epstein.
[56:50.320 --> 57:02.320]  And we know Weinstein had 17-year-old girls and others, and he tried to reportedly rape. That's been basically confirmed. And that's where we knew this was going next. You're saying exclusively that your sources say a criminal investigation has opened up into that.
[57:02.320 --> 57:18.320]  Yes, they're now investigating the connection between Epstein and Weinstein, and whether Epstein, the discredited convicted pedophile who was running a major New York hedge fund, running buddy of Bill Clinton,
[57:18.320 --> 57:30.320]  was supplying underage girls for Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. What do they have in common? Who brought them together? William Jefferson Clinton.
[57:30.320 --> 57:39.320]  Wow. So we knew the whole Hollywood pedophile scam was about to emerge, about to break the surface massively, but it's happening quicker than we thought.
[57:39.320 --> 57:47.320]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with Roger Stone. Then we have the producer of the top film exposing the Hollywood pedophile crime rings.
[57:47.320 --> 58:09.320]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic. We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[58:58.320 --> 59:12.320]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com. Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[59:12.320 --> 59:23.320]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50. Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[59:23.320 --> 59:31.320]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[59:31.320 --> 59:44.320]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature in infowarslife.com, this is a sure win. 10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[59:44.320 --> 01:00:03.320]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:43.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, our intrepid crew of researchers are so on target that as soon as Roger Stone five minutes ago broke that Harvey Weinstein is under criminal investigation by the FBI and Justice Department for connections to Jerry Epstein and the Lolita Express
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.320]  child kidnapping aircraft operation with Bill Clinton, they were able to go wait.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:01:05.320]  We just saw that clip that got no attention from a major award show a few years ago where Weinstein was bragging that he was the chief projectionist for eight years at the White House and traveled with Bill Clinton everywhere while the Epstein flights were taking place.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:15.320]  This is big and that's what my law enforcement sources told me, some of which have been involved in these big raids you've seen in the news catching all these kidnappers and kids just hundreds of days it's happening.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.320]  But the mainstream media won't report on it's only in local news.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.320]  They've been telling me that this is exactly what was about to happen.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.320]  We've got the producer of one of the big films about to join us but let's play this clip and then get Roger Stone's take on it.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:38.320]  Here he is at the GLAAD Awards with Jennifer Lawrence now who is really disgusting to me, fawning, I heard she casting cows caught a bit with him, fawning over her lord and savior, Mr. Epstein.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.320]  So I guess she's a little too old for him. Here it is.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.320]  And I just wanted to tell you that how I really got to know the president really well.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.320]  Some of you don't know because there wasn't a Senate confirmation hearing this was done rather privately.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:02:01.320]  I was the chief projectionist at the White House from 1992 to 2000 and I'm going to tell you the president and I saw so many movies together.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.320]  I'm not kidding, by the way, we saw so many movies together.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.320]  Some of mine like Goodwill Hunting and I remember seeing the harmonists and so many great films with the president.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.320]  We even built a little on vacation, we even built a little portable screening room for the president.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.320]  I can tell you, you know, I mean that that's a little Pleasure Island, maybe.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:29.320]  Wow, Roger, the three minutes we have left amazing breaking news here for Info Wars, not just your POTUS conversation yesterday, but now this.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.320]  What else can you tell us about the bombshell you just dropped?
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  Well, great research there by the Info Wars research team.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.320]  Look, what kind of movies were they watching?
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:49.320]  It sounds like porn to me. Look, we know that Bill Clinton was on Jeffrey Epstein's plane 23 separate times.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:03:02.320]  We know that according to the testimony of Virginia Roberts, he was on Orgy Island for private parties with a lot of underage girls and very few adult men on numerous occasions.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.320]  Little did we know that Harvey Weinstein may have been the link here.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:14.320]  And we are examining whether Weinstein also visited the island.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:24.320]  I understand the FBI is also looking into whether Weinstein was on the plane contemporaneously with Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:36.320]  Look, the entire Hollywood pedophile network is about to crash down around the knees of Bill Clinton.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.320]  And now you know other fighting so hard.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:45.320]  In the minute we have with Roger Stone, InfoWars.com investigative journalist and amazing political operative for America.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:51.320]  What do you make of Trump saying this week, McCain better watch it because when I take the gloves off, I hit hard basically.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.320]  He said, I'm getting ready to really smack you hard.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.320]  I mean, that's an open message, isn't it?
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320]  I think so.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:07.320]  As I said last night on the war room, the fact that John McCain is even still in the United States Senate is at the suffrage of candidate Donald Trump.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:17.320]  They were both on the ballot the same year, the same month in Arizona last year during the presidential after Trump had swept the early and middle primaries.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  Arizona is among the latest.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  Had Donald Trump not supported John McCain, he would already be in retirement.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.320]  This man is bitter.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  He is mentally confused.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.320]  His temper tantrums, his red face fits.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.320]  His public meltdowns are now things of legend.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:42.320]  I must seriously question Alex whether he is mentally fit to be in the U.S. Senate.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.320]  This latest speech he got attacking American patriotism.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.320]  He looks like he's got two feet in the grave.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320]  Roger Stone, thank you so much. Amazing intel.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  Thank you.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320]  Great to be here.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:56.320]  We're going down the Hollywood pedophile rat hole. Right now we come back. Tell everybody to tune in.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:30.320]  The pure organic plant extracts are concentrated containing antibacterial properties that work well to help tone gum and freshen your breath.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.320]  His antiseptic mouthwash is a concentrated formula.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.320]  You will need to dilute one part mouthwash to 10 parts water.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:42.320]  Immrix Essentials mouthwash is a great addition to your daily brushing routine.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.320]  It is effective yet gentle enough for the most sensitive gums and canker sores.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320]  Go organic today with Immrix Essentials.

[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]  This is me.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320]  I'm so good with my people.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:12.320]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:19.320]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.320]  I hereby declare this to be unlawful assembly.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.320]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.320]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.320]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.320]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:41.320]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.320]  The guns will be taken and no one will be able to be armed.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320]  We will take all weapons.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.320]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.320]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.320]  Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:59.320]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.320]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:10.320]  NSKSLA News 12 Jeff Farrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.320]  Us.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.320]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.320]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.320]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.320]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:31.320]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.320]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.320]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:54.320]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.320]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.320]  I am inside.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.320]  I have two words for you.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.320]  Predator gloves.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.320]  You will never see it coming.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.320]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.320]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:20.320]  and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.320]  They let them in the area.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.320]  They told them they could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:30.320]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.320]  If you want a commentator.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.320]  We are on the march.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.320]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:44.320]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.320]  The revolution is my death.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:50.320]  Do they stop too far?
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.320]  Live in the world and we have to live.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.320]  Live in all the hate that's left in this house.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.320]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:15.320]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.320]  I think every little kid dreams about being famous and being in movies.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320]  This is California.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320]  This is where you make it.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.320]  This is where it all starts.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.320]  You'll get signed by a label.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.320]  You can star on Disney Channel.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.320]  What kid wouldn't want that, right?
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:35.320]  I remember you asked me after I ever did anything with the guy before.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.320]  I was not interested at 12.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.320]  Hollywood doesn't have any system in place to protect anybody.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.320]  And children are way down on the list.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:50.320]  Children need management just like everybody else.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.320]  Everybody liked him.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.320]  He became part of the family.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.320]  In the beginning it was happy and then things started changing.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.320]  They found people who they know would be victims.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.320]  You have an adult who is manipulating the child.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.320]  He's getting hired on the spot like that.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.320]  That had never happened before.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.320]  It was obvious that something was going on.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.320]  The party made me feel uncomfortable.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.320]  There were lots of drugs available and there were young teenage boys.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.320]  I remember being scared.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.320]  He just told me this is what you have to do.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.320]  Young boys told me to point the gun at them just like that.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.320]  He said, do you not understand the power I have?
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.320]  I remember sitting in my room and crying my eyes out.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.320]  He said, what would you do?
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.320]  That happened to me.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.320]  A lot of investors completely denied that anything was going on.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.320]  Clearly the studio didn't want an investigation.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.320]  I hated when you tried to have me sleep in your bed and touch me.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  I don't know anything about that.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.320]  There will always be a steady stream of kids who want to be famous.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.320]  We're absolutely talking about the tip of an iceberg.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.320]  It wasn't uncommon. Let's put it that way.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's even been in mainstream news last week
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.320]  that Harvey Weinstein hired a convicted pedophile
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.320]  who raped a 12-year-old boy on a previous set of a Disney film
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.320]  to come direct another film.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.320]  That's just one example.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.320]  It's been said that one man dies.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.320]  It's a tragedy. 10,000 die. It's a statistic.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.320]  Well, if you find out about one child that's been kidnapped
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320]  or one child that's been raped, it's a tragedy.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.320]  It's an outrage. If it's 10,000 or a million, it's just a statistic.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.320]  Gabe Hoffman, I've been hearing about this film in production for years.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.320]  And from even law enforcement sources, and Hollywood tried to block
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.320]  the film from coming out.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.320]  But just days ago, he released it, and it's got over a million views.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320]  It's free. It needs to have 100 million views.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.320]  But we know Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others try to block it.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.320]  They've been doing that. So it's up on Vimeo.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.320]  I'm having it posted as we speak to infowars.com
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.320]  and to newswars.com. And I'm going to have Paul Watson retweet it.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.320]  He's got one of the top Twitter accounts for actual engagement.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.320]  We're going to sit down on Paul's Twitter at Prison Planet as well.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.320]  Gabe Hoffman is the producer.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.320]  He is a successful producer and a philanthropist
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.320]  who put a lot of his money into this very professional groundbreaking film.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.320]  Facebook.com, an open secret documentary.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.320]  An open secret at Twitter. Everybody should follow it.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.320]  And this is a short segment because I played the trailer.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.320]  But tell people a little bit about yourself.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.320]  We're going to go down the rabbit hole here into this den of vipers.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.320]  And then we're going to contemporary, you have a statement to read to the pedophile elite
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.320]  on there kind of a challenge at the end of the interview.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:46.320]  And we also have all the big breaking stings just this week of 277 arrest
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.320]  of pedophiles reportedly and kidnapped children in Florida.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:53.320]  17 arrested this week in Colorado and Wyoming.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.320]  As young as three months old being sold to be raped.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320]  I mean, this is mainstream news here.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.320]  So the media tries to act like this isn't happening.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.320]  Local news covers it. National news pretty much ignores it.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.320]  So Gabe, tell us about yourself.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.320]  And they've been a successful producer in films and other things,
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.320]  but and also in capital management.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.320]  But what made you take on this?
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.320]  One of the most evil things in the world. Thanks for joining us.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.320]  Thanks. Thanks. Great to be here with you, Alex.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.320]  You know, I'm a hedge fund manager.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.320]  I've been a hedge fund manager when I was 23 years old back in 2000.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320]  I was the youngest hedge fund manager on Wall Street.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.320]  Started my own firm, been blessed, very successful, very fortunate.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.320]  My buddy Matt Valentinas knew from NYU undergrad.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.320]  He went to film school. He worked in Hollywood for 15 years.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.320]  And we were talking about how to do good and things like that.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.320]  And he said, look, I know Hollywood has a big pedophile problem.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  It just needs to be exposed.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.320]  I said, well, I'm not a film guy. Never done that.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.320]  Let's get the research.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.320]  So with this arming films, we wrote just a research contract.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.320]  We didn't know that there would be enough to make a film.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.320]  Or at least I didn't know that at the time.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.320]  A few months later, after disarming films, private investigators and all that,
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.320]  we had two binders of Hollywood convicted pedophiles.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.320]  They're victims, sometimes in many cases,
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.320]  actually getting hired by their pedophile buddies afterwards
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.320]  to go work on film sets, raping and abusing kids on film sets.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.320]  It was unbelievable.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.320]  And I said, gosh, this is the easiest check I'll ever write to fund making this film.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.320]  And it's an over-million-and-a-half budget, full-featured documentary
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.320]  with an Oscar-nominated director for her work in another area.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.320]  You know, it's funny, Amy Berg, our director,
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.320]  she got an Oscar nomination when she exposed pedophilia in the Catholic Church
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.320]  a few years earlier.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320]  That's right.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320]  But she exposes it.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]  I forgot to say she's super famous for that.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320]  Yeah.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.320]  And even back then, they denied it was going on.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.320]  Right.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.320]  But then in Hollywood, when she does it, all of a sudden they don't care.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.320]  So go figure.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.320]  I forgot that your director, she's the famous Amy Berg,
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.320]  one of the biggest chinks in the corrupt Vatican's armor.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.320]  And now the deputy pope, the number two guy,
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:11.320]  has been arrested for over 100 young boys, kidnapped, trafficked, raped.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320]  I mean, it's massive.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.320]  Absolutely.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.320]  And I'm so pleased exclusively with you on InfoWars to announce
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.320]  we had made this free on Vimeo through the 22nd.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.320]  Again, it's got over a million views already in a week.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.320]  We are going to make it free through October 31st for everybody to celebrate
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.320]  all these Hollywood pedophiles getting exposed just this week.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.320]  Wow.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.320]  Awesome.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.320]  Again, folks, on all our Twitter accounts, on Paul Watson's, on yours, all of you,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.320]  we can get around them because YouTube and Google and all of them, they are censoring,
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.320]  especially this.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.320]  They do not want these powerful, I mean, they even took one of the top stars off Twitter
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.320]  because she said that Weinstein raped her.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.320]  Even though Weinstein settled with her, they were blocking her.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.320]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.320]  Thank you.

[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.320]  identified with more pigments, and held even more land on board
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.320]  than just the four burner charges filed today.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.320]  This is some of the symptoms before you feel better.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:52.320]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:21:06.320]  You'll see a 5-6-fold increase of pedophiles from local TV stations from Florida to Colorado to California.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:12.320]  Just this week, with hundreds of kids here, 88 kids here, 27 kids here, 14 kids there.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:18.320]  In actual sex slavery, but it never hits big national news, it's incredible.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.320]  We've been telling you this whole Weinstein thing is a controlled demolition.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.320]  They know this is all coming out.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.320]  The Lolita Express, as you just heard, he's under investigation for flying around with Jerry Epstein and Bill Clinton.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:34.320]  On that plane, they flew the young girls, we're talking 10, 11, 12 years old, to this island.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320]  That's what we know of.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.320]  They're going to have to be loading girls that young on planes with them.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.320]  You know how in the Caribbean there's even crazier stuff going on.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320]  So Gabe Hoffman, amazing.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.320]  Investigating this is a very successful capital management firm.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320]  You start investigating it.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.320]  You go down the rabbit hole, just recapping, and found all these cases of convicted Hollywood pedophiles.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.320]  And as you mentioned, in the film, now there's new cases.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.320]  During Weinstein years, Disney hired child molesters to direct film who raped and was convicted.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.320]  A 12-year-old boy on the set to be around children again.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.320]  So this is how the rabbit hole began.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:16.320]  You stop the floor now, get into the film, which you're offering free right now, to everybody until Halloween at infowars.com
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320]  because they tried to suppress it and tried to block it.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.320]  You put a million and a half dollars of your own money into this with your great crew.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320]  That's why you're a hero.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.320]  They tried to block it.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.320]  Well, they're not going to block it.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.320]  It's free, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.320]  It's up to you to get this out.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.320]  So again, I want to commend you.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:38.320]  You know, the real heroes are the brave survivors and victims who came forward on our show, on our film.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.320]  We didn't pay them a dime.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.320]  We didn't black out their faces.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.320]  We didn't hide their names.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320]  Nothing.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:50.320]  It was the highest standards journalism and they had to name their accusers and there had to be actual proof.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:23:00.320]  Or, in one case, we actually unmasked a pedophile who was one of the biggest child managers in Hollywood over the last 30, 40 years
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.320]  and he fesses up on camera in an open secret.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.320]  You know, there was just a major breaking news last night.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320]  The mainstream media hasn't picked it up yet.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:22.320]  Tyler Gresham, he's a major, major representative of young stars and a young man named Blaise Littman, you know, came out on Facebook and otherwise,
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.320]  accusing him of drugging him and raping him when he was underage.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.320]  This is just the tip of the iceberg, like we say in the film.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:34.320]  So the women having the courage to go public, now we're learning with Weinstein, it goes into 17, 16, Roman Polanski,
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:42.320]  raping ain't only a 13-year-old girl, media covers it up, then Meryl Streep gives him standing ovations and says he did nothing wrong.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.320]  Oh, it's amazing.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.320]  I mean, I've got a 13-year-old daughter.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.320]  You rape her.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320]  I'm going to kill you.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.320]  It's amazing.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:55.320]  You see those Hollywood award shows where Roman Polanski, they give him awards and they put it on screen.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.320]  And the place is, you know, standing ovation.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.320]  And he's not even there to get the award in person because he's not allowed back in the country.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.320]  He was convicted and he fled.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.320]  That's just Hollywood.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.320]  And Weinstein has, you notice, run to Europe as well.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.320]  Absolutely.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:16.320]  And we have a rumor that we'll talk about later that a major Hollywood figure may have already just run to Europe.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.320]  Hopefully the info or spokes can help track it down on the Internet.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.320]  Please continue because you've got these binders over here.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.320]  Let's just begin. Hundreds and hundreds of convicted pedophiles over the years, super high level, covered up in the media.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.320]  Then they're rehired with kids again.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.320]  Absolutely.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.320]  And what you were talking about earlier is Victor Salva.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.320]  Everybody's heard of the Jeepers Creepers franchise.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.320]  That's Victor Salva.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320]  He's the director of it.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.320]  And Jeepers Creepers 3 was just out this year.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320]  Oh, funny.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.320]  He's into demon clowns.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.320]  He's into demon clowns.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]  Absolutely.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]  You got it.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:59.320]  So we have exclusively at InfoWars the open secret internal Hollywood pedophile map because there are just connections with these pedophiles.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.320]  And by the way, we're going to add that map to the film that we're about to post infowars.com.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.320]  But let's put it on screen.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  The pedophile map.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.320]  There it is.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.320]  How they're all friends.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:08.320]  They know each other.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  They manage the same children.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:15.320]  They put, you know, a manager who's a pedophile will put it, put the child on the pedophile show.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.320]  They will hire each other even after their convictions.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:25.320]  I mean, it's not just, you know, Brian Peck working on Charlie Sheen's show anger management 10 years after his conviction.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.320]  It's Brian Peck working on big things like Jack in the Beanstalk.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.320]  It's just amazing how convicted pedophiles are actually still working in Hollywood today.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.320]  And we have to put a stop to it.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.320]  This never happened in Hollywood with Charlie Sheen over the years.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320]  And I knew him before he went wild again.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.320]  But with other Hollywood folks or at major TV production studios, they would just sit there and go,
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.320]  by the way, are you a devil worshipper?
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320]  Because we worship the devil.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.320]  And I thought it was just a mess with me.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.320]  But then later it's like, well, you might want to come to this party because there might be some young girls here.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.320]  And that's, of course, it's just messing with you to see if you're into it.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.320]  It's like an entrance exam.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.320]  It's like a rite of passage.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:06.320]  And that's something that, you know, you're getting to a great point because it's something that we show in an open secret.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.320]  You know, it's not just about exposing the Hollywood pedophiles.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.320]  It's about doing good in your community, helping you to make your children safe.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.320]  We get you into the mind of the pedophile.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.320]  They speak themselves.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.320]  You learn what their justifications are.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:27.320]  And we even show home videos where if you're looking closely, you can see the pedophile hanging out with a good American family
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.320]  and subtle, little, increasing sexualization here and there.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.320]  You learn about their tactics.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.320]  You learn about their tools.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.320]  You learn about how to protect your children from them in your community.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320]  Because they engage in testing.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320]  They engage in training.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.320]  They engage in all of this.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:51.320]  And there are subtle, little signs of the sexualization in terms of language and other things that we teach you about in an open secret to learn to, you know, figure it out.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:56.320]  And by the way, the film, you can't stop watching it even though it's so horrifying because it empowers you.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.320]  And notice, they've got cruddy films all over cable, all over Netflix, everywhere.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320]  But not with you guys.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.320]  A real film.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.320]  How many years in the making?
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.320]  I remember hearing about this film years ago.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.320]  And then now you just release it for free because they're blocking it.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.320]  Yeah, they blocked it for two years, Alex, and they thought that we were going to go away.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320]  No.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.320]  But notice the blocking seemed to only bring it out now right when the world's ready.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.320]  Well, we just waited for this Harvey Weinstein moment.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.320]  We knew this was going to come.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.320]  High five.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  Something like this.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.320]  They would come.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.320]  Well, keep going.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.320]  And so that's what we did.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:34.320]  But you bring up a great point about the film, and that is that Amy did such a great job at telling the story.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:40.320]  And it's PG-13, but I'll tell you what, you see worse things on network TV at 9 o'clock.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.320]  Everyone should show their children.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.320]  I would say as young as eight or nine this, so they understand predators.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.320]  You're not scaring them.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:48.320]  You're showing them, you know, if you were somebody a thousand years ago in Eastern Europe,
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.320]  and there were wolves that were eating kids, you'd tell them, don't go out in the woods by yourself.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.320]  I mean, people need to know about this danger.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.320]  Right.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.320]  But they don't use gross out language.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.320]  That's the beauty of it.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.320]  They tell their tale, and you know what happened, but they don't get into explicit details.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.320]  You just know that something bad happened.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.320]  And children need to know how these predators operate.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.320]  Absolutely.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320]  Absolutely.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:14.320]  And one of the survivors talks about how the predator lured him in, what could have,
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.320]  right before he was first just raped, you know, the language they were using,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320]  and the examples and the discussions they would have.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:23.320]  And then how they guilt you and threaten you and control you after.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320]  Exactly.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320]  And they tell you that it's normal.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.320]  You know, we've gotten in America, look, certain groups, certain beliefs, more normalized, fine,
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.320]  but the pedophiles want to be next.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  And now we learn at the UN everywhere, they're the ones behind it all pushing the normalization
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.320]  because that's what they want finally for them is no limits.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.320]  We're under UN law.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.320]  They're asking to come to your door and demand to date your five-year-old daughter.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.320]  I mean, that's literally the kind of stuff that Salon and others are pushing,
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.320]  the normalization, the coming out of the pedophiles.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.320]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.320]  A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:04.320]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors,

[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.320]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.320]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.320]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:12.320]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:16.320]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:21.320]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:27.320]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.320]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.320]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.320]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.320]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.320]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.320]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.320]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:54.320]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.320]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.320]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:10.320]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:16.320]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.320]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.320]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:29.320]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:33.320]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:42.320]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:48.320]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.320]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.320]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:57.320]  And it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:03.320]  We're not just going to have to end in the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:12.320]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman, ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.320]  Concentrate. You talk about next level meal replacement, next level compared to whey.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.320]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.320]  It's incredible. My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:25.320]  It's bigger than I am already. 15, incredible. It is amazing.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:30.320]  infowarslife.com 50% off caveman, but only a few days left.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:34.320]  It's about to end. And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:40.320]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless. We're bold because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.320]  The globalists win. We're all slaves. So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.320]  I want to thank you. We're all in this together.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:51.320]  And when you get the great Molan lobby t-shirts, you get the great books and videos, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:56.320]  Again, visit infowarstore.com today and commit to helping the info war.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.320]  Radio Network
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.320]  Anybody that tunes in on a regular basis knows I don't hype stuff.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.320]  And I've been saying the last year, Trump's going to start bringing down the pedophile network.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:39.320]  And that just means green lighting, law enforcement, citizens and others to have courage to do it,
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.320]  knowing he's going to try to back them as much as he can.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:46.320]  And he's tweeted that child rapist should be killed.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:51.320]  And of course, you've got Eric Prince, say what you want about the owner of Blackwater.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:56.320]  He has a lot of intelligence sources and I can tell you it's an open secret and the government's going to let you know.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.320]  He's been part of the leaks that have exposed the globalist along with other patriots. It wasn't the Russians.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:06.320]  That's now coming out. He's exposed the pedophile network from behind the scenes and has been fighting that.
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:15.320]  So have we. And I've given $100,000 of the money you've given us to a team of former law enforcement people
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:21.320]  to steal team six folks and others to actually go out and document some of these big raids you're hearing about
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.320]  that national news won't cover. And of course, I don't have a position in the films they're making.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:32.320]  I don't care about the money. The money you send us when you buy products, t-shirts, books, films, supplements,
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.320]  goes back in. We're talking 95% of it to building and expanding this operation against the globalist.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:46.320]  And the rest goes into backup when they sue us and come after us and everything to hold the course and be able to weather the storm.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:54.320]  So we need you to go to infowarstore.com today and commit to buy the high quality supplements like Caveman and Anthroplex
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:58.320]  and Super Mill Vitality, 50% off Anthroplex. Just wait till you try it.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.320]  The stem of the libido, the energy, it gives me is amazing.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:08.320]  We're about to end in the next few days. The special on the nutraceutical brain force that's 50% off.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.320]  We've never done that before. It's our best seller.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.320]  But I wanted to see if I lowered the price even more close to cost.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.320]  It would cause this phenomenal ordering and it has.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:24.320]  We got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation in 1996 when leading competitors with a similar formula are $60 to $70.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:31.320]  Let's say good deal at $39. It's unbelievable in 1996, infowarstore.com. Let me stop right there.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:38.320]  I know what it's like to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of time to make a film.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:48.320]  And then to have it all uploaded properly and to have YouTube say you can't put it up or to have Apple say, re-encode this and then refuse it.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.320]  Then send it to a firm and they say, no, this is all to their specs. They're just refusing it.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:36:01.320]  After they took tens of thousands of my dollars just to pay to have them do the quote conversion and upload to iTunes.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.320]  And they do this to libertarian conservatives. It's come out in the news.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.320]  You've seen the undercover video of YouTube executives saying their main job is to block info wars.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.320]  They mean the type of guest we have on.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:16.320]  The fact that we are a frontline operation that continues to kick their butt.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.320]  A place they don't control.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:27.320]  And it's very frustrating to see that happen. But imagine being Gabe Hoffman, a successful Wall Street strategist and capital manager,
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:33.320]  putting a million plus dollars of his own money into an open secret being produced over the last five years.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:39.320]  Two years ago, it's ready. Hollywood won't take it. They block it everywhere.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:44.320]  Well, now he's just put it out for free. He's been waiting for that to happen. It's free.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.320]  Posted it to info wars.com. It's free through the 31st.
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.320]  Now you had to put it on Vimeo because they don't censor like YouTube and Google do as much.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.320]  Oh yeah, Google and YouTube are really censoring.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:02.320]  That's why you've got to share it with everybody you know. You've got to stop them.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.320]  Okay, a million views in a couple days is great the last week or so.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.320]  I want to see 10 million by next Monday, folks.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:13.320]  We do videos all the time that get 20, 30, 40, 50 million views.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:19.320]  This is a film with blood, sweat and tears for the children, the victims, and to help and stop other victims.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:23.320]  We've got to expose this and we are. We're on the march. The empire is on the run.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.320]  It's posted to info wars.com. I just tweeted it at real Alex Jones.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.320]  Please retweet it right now. Let's scroll back to the top.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:38.320]  I'm going to give folks the name of the article that I need you to send to local radio stations, local TV stations and say interview.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:43.320]  Gabe Hoffman, the rest is crew. He flew on his own dime when we wanted to get him on last week.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.320]  He said no, I'll just fly there next Friday. He did it.
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.320]  Didn't want us to pay for anything. He's a rich, successful guy.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:55.320]  He's doing this because he actually cares because his friends knew about this who were in Hollywood and said it was horrible.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  So again, an open secret on Twitter. Be sure and follow him there.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:04.320]  Spread it. The headline on info wars.com is Hollywood is trying to suppress this film. Get it out.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.320]  See the groundbreaking film that exposes Hollywood pedophilia.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.320]  The secret Hollywood doesn't want you to know.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.320]  Posted here absolutely free for the victims and to stop future crimes.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.320]  It's a million and a half dollar gift to you.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.320]  Now again, this is the put in theaters. It could have made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.320]  The directors already got nominated for an Oscar with her film.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.320]  What was it a decade ago? First exposing the Vatican and all the sex crimes here in the U.S.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:37.320]  All proven right. It isn't about the money. The satisfaction is knowing these scumbags are being brought to justice.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.320]  So you've got the floor in this segment and the next because I just wanted to break that down.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:47.320]  But I wanted to ask the listeners to come together as humans of every race, color and creed who are one race, the human race,
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.320]  and say no to the exploitation attacks on children, women, men, you name it,
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.320]  by these barbarous elite cults around the world, Hollywood just being one of them.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:03.320]  But it's the sacrament of these aggressive power cults that they are all about hurting the innocent,
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.320]  whether it be women, children, you name it.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:10.320]  So Gabe Hoffman, the producer that put his money where his mouth was right now putting this film out for free.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.320]  That is such a beautiful thing you've done.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:16.320]  Well, thanks so much. I mean, again, it's for the real, you know, the real heroes and all that.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:23.320]  But so imagine Alex, you make a film, you hire an Oscar nominated director and all that,
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:29.320]  and then you take it to the mainstream, the mainstream liberal leaning media for the reviews.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  New York Times, Variety, all that.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:39.320]  And your film gets a 93% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:42.320]  93%, that's almost unprecedented.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.320]  93%.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.320]  They say Rotten Tomatoes is ruining Hollywood because they give such low ones.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.320]  But the human population gives you an unprecedented 93%.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.320]  Right, so we get a 93% and we're thinking, okay, well, we'll go to film festivals because, hey,
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.320]  that's the next step in the process to try to sell something, right?
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.320]  So, okay, film festivals are easy to get into.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.320]  You pay a small registration fee and even, you know, look, if you had three kids that got 20 grand together,
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.320]  they'll put them in a documentary corner somewhere, maybe not on the main screen.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.320]  But they're pretty easy, especially when you've got something as legitimate as this snowbrainer.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:23.320]  The first three film festivals, Alex, that we tried to go to, LA, Toronto, and London.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.320]  You know what happened?
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:30.320]  The lower level people who reviewed the film for quality thought, okay, great, we're going to put it up there.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.320]  In fact, in a place of prominence.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.320]  Then each time, a couple weeks later, guess what happened?
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:41.320]  The higher ups learned about it through their Hollywood connected pedophiles,
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.320]  and they disinvited us from those festivals.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  And that shows you who's in charge.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.320]  Absolutely.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.320]  So, of course, that didn't stop us.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.320]  We went to festivals anyway.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:51.320]  We went to Cannes.
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.320]  We went to Doc NYC.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:58.320]  And when we went to Doc NYC, it sold out a 500-person theater on two days' notice,
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.320]  and Drudge put it up on the top, the top of the page that the sex abuse...
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:09.320]  Isn't he just a hero for taking stuff that they're suppressing and punching it out there?
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:12.320]  Well, you know, Dan Gable, famous wrestling coach,
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:15.320]  he said, once you've wrestled in life, everything else is easy.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:16.320]  And this sure is.
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:21.320]  You know, fighting a financial fraud and biotech fraud and scientific fraud for years and years.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.320]  I'm used to a fight.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.320]  Hasn't it made you stronger?
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.320]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.320]  People think avoiding fights makes them, you know, stronger.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.320]  No, getting anyone is the right fight.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:33.320]  Well, when you get inspired by the brave survivors that you've seen in Open Secret,
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.320]  you see what they and their family have gone through.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.320]  And when they put their lives on camera, you know,
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.320]  just bare their souls, literally, and you see that in the film,
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.320]  you'd be inspired to fight for them, too.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.320]  You know, I tell you, it is crazy.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.320]  And years ago, I would start covering this, the lawsuit threats, you name it, death threats.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.320]  I mean, I know how real it is, just experiencing the threats,
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.320]  and I can't imagine what you guys went through trying to make this film
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.320]  much less of the victims themselves.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.320]  Absolutely.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.320]  And, you know, Dan, the digital entertainment network, we can get into that,
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.320]  but that was amazing.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:15.320]  That was basically a front for pedophiles to lure in
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.320]  and rape and drug young boys, fly them in from all over the country,
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:25.320]  have them live at the mansion that they bought with $150 million of investor dollars,
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.320]  much of it from Hollywood Elite, and that was really big.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:33.320]  Well, you know, I remember now, Drudge, pushing the film,
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.320]  and I heard about it from law enforcement and others that you guys were doing something really important.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:39.320]  They were going to come out and get you on and promote it,
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.320]  but I forgot how Drudge was one of the guys to finally break through.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.320]  Drudge did that for us.
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:47.320]  I mean, he's just, the whole Liberty Movement has to absolutely think that, Drudge.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:50.320]  We'll be back, folks, newswars.com, infowars.com.

[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  It's gotta be satisfying, even though they suppressed your film for two years,
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.320]  that now you're releasing it, right as it's all starting to come out and pedophiles
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  not just people with child porn but actual pedophiles with kids and cages being busted all over the country.
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.320]  But, again, never in the national news.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:19.320]  No, it's amazing you know with this digital entertainment network that we expose,
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.060]  our film actually bought out of bankruptcy somebody who had all the den
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.280]  footage
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.500]  you get to see how look we're not saying that brian singer is a pedophile
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:32.040]  we're not saying that david gevin is a pedophile we don't do any accusations we
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.400]  stick to facts what we do show you is that convicted pedophiles have close
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.720]  relationships with very powerful people like that for example michael
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.320]  hoffington invested millions of dollars in den david gevin hundreds of
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:51.200]  thousand dollars brian singer invested in den brian singer came and hung out at
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.480]  den and did their little clips and have you you've seen the movie grease right
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.080]  yes okay so it was directed by somebody named randall klyzer i had no idea who
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:07.120]  randall klyzer was none whatsoever one day we get an email from this big big
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.080]  hollywood lawyer because they come michael donaldson owns his own firm says
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:17.000]  that this randall klyzer is in our in our trailer for one second and he
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.360]  objects to it unlike wow turns out randall klyzer directed a bunch of the
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.160]  den shows when den was around so randall klyzer was hanging out with a bunch of
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:30.400]  pedophiles i'm not saying that he was one but he had a bunch of pedophile
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:34.920]  friends that ended up getting convicted and so we said great we'll just tag him
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:39.600]  in the film so everybody knows who he is so the more that they come after us the
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:43.560]  harder we hit back because the truth is on our side well they got to be in
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:48.360]  panic mode now because the fbi we exclusively broke with roger stone who
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.800]  talked to the president just yesterday the fbi is investigating winestein not
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:57.240]  just for fleeing the country under trump's direction but also for jerry
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:03.680]  epstein and the lolita child kidnapping express well absolutely and in fact they
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.680]  have sent their stalkers their buddies their cronies have admitted to being their
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:13.400]  friends in public they've actually sent them after us to stalk and and harass us
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:17.560]  and everything like that for the last two or three years believe me i mean i'm
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.520]  gonna against the pedophiles forever but as i've been beating the drum harder
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:23.640]  the last four years my life i mean it only made me stronger everything but
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.760]  everything bad turned into something good i've learned just god is such a
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.360]  blessing it's like an experience of job not as bad but you know approaching it
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:34.000]  in some aspects and but it's just how god always has come through it's very
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.960]  humbling but for some of these kids you know they dig up in shallow graves you
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:41.400]  know really it's their cries to god that are coming through through you my friend
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.480]  well thank you i mean there's one in particular his name is greg schneider
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:49.720]  that's spelled with two g's and we have the hollywood reporter piece where he
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:55.080]  talks about publicly being friends with a few people that somebody accused the
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.160]  film doesn't accuse them but somebody in the film accused them separately and
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:02.840]  he's he says he's friends with brian singer garth ancier david newman and
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:08.680]  greg goddard we've also got for you exclusively here behind the scenes
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:15.080]  greg schneider went to x-men and he's he's there behind the scenes we have
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:18.440]  thanksgiving after the case was dropped after the eagan case was dropped against
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:21.800]  brian singer he's over there this is from brian
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:27.320]  singer's instagram thanksgiving 2015 at brian singer's house for
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:34.280]  thanksgiving so brian singer's creepy friend has been stalking not only us
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:38.760]  but people who didn't have anything to do with their quarrel with mike eagan
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.760]  which is separate from our film they came and they stalked us
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:46.440]  personally on our personal facebook's on our personal
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:49.800]  emails this guy all over the internet heck

[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:57.400]  you know you can go talk to him well here's the bottom line
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.200]  here's the bottom line we're not scared any of these people whatever's going to
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:02.680]  happen is going to happen we're going up against the globalist george soros the
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:06.120]  nazi collaborator all of them and we've studied these people and their spirit
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:09.720]  cooking all the things the globalists do and they're all into evil
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:13.000]  they're all into their own sick twisted forms of power
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  and the good news is all the intimidation that weinstein others tried bill
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.520]  clinton tried a lot of folks got killed by the clinton's exposing his sex crimes
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.240]  it didn't work anymore and all the chickens are coming home to roost what's
[01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:26.360]  that like for you it's just an amazing feeling and i know
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.080]  we're only at the beginning of this i know you're going to see
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:32.680]  big hollywood pedophile rings broken in hollywood because now
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:36.200]  the survivors the victims are realizing that you know what
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:39.640]  they can't stop us and we don't have to be afraid of them and we can
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:43.720]  show them the example and even mainstream news is now reporting on your film
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:46.120]  they're being forced because you put it out for free saying wow
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.560]  you know is that the next big shoot a drop it's already dropping in fact
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.880]  you're going to come back a few minutes and do your big statement here
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:55.640]  then leon macadoo joins us but during weinstein's years
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:53:00.280]  disney hired child molester to direct film and that's mainstream news
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:03.320]  guy that raped a 12 year old sex sting this is just yesterday
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:07.800]  leads to 277 arrests in florida uh people that had kidnapped children and
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.800]  we're selling them for sex slavery that's u.s news this is just yesterday
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:15.160]  here's another one trafficking sting recover 17 kids in colorada
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.720]  wyoming
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.480]  sex trafficking sting rescues colorada infant and five-year-old sister who are
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:25.560]  being sold out to be uh raped that's that's that's uh
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.920]  most of most of that pedophile map by the way those convictions if you if you
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:31.720]  look them up and we're going to get that the the actual specifics of them out
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:35.960]  there later but most of them are on children's shows
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.440]  nicolodian and disney well we know there's this actualization
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:43.800]  of children on nicolodian they admit all that and and you just see it
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:46.760]  everywhere what do you think about salon and and the new york times coming out
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:50.440]  like saying pedophilia is not bad you know it's just it's just a preference
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:53.160]  right like it's a preference or a condition like it's somehow normal and
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.360]  that's the same thing that the nambla people want to do they want to bring
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.080]  that somehow into the mainstream is an accepted thing
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:02.280]  and uh we have to be here to stop it as the last line of defense that's right
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:05.560]  if you're a radio listener we're putting everything my guest is saying we're just
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:08.520]  putting up for mainstream news even on the screen again just a few years ago
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.640]  you wouldn't even see this 474 arrested 28 sexually
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:15.080]  exploited children rescued during statewide human trafficking ktla but no
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.720]  coverage since then of that some of them in cages
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.040]  putting women uh tampa 84 children recovered 120 arrested nationwide sex
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:26.680]  trafficking probe that's yesterday 10 disturbing stories about hollywood's
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:30.600]  pedophile problem big story uh right there that goes
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:33.880]  over all of those will cover some more coming up hollywood's other open secret
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:38.360]  spides harvey weinstein praying on young boys and and it's some young girls
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:43.480]  like roman polanski like to rape do you have any numbers or estimation what is
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:47.800]  about 80 boys something like that and and what we do know
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:51.000]  is that unfortunately there are so many like kory
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.360]  heyman others that are dead whether drug overdose or
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:58.360]  suicide or or things like that and their voices can't be heard
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.960]  and evan rachel's coming out hollywood pedophilia is the next damn
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.280]  to break yep the daily beast
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:09.800]  what's gonna happen is everything we've talked about comes out
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:12.600]  well you can't hide the truth you ultimately can't hide the truth
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.960]  and the american people know what the truth is and they get on the side of
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:18.840]  the truth but that's why hollywood and the vatican
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:22.360]  all these groups have been racing to demoralize people get rid of morals
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:26.040]  and normalize this and make us immoral they've been racing as a rearguard
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:29.880]  actually try to get us like them but i'm sorry you just can't grab kids out of
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:32.200]  the backs of yards and take them to rape them you just can't
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.840]  you know take them to satanic ceremonies because you get off on
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:39.640]  you know torturing them because listen the next floor beneath this that's my
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.920]  next big question did you run into the occultism the satanism
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:47.080]  the bondage the abuse of children that was something that we didn't actually
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.200]  run into believe it or not but we only scratched the surface i mean
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:55.400]  out of two binders out of literally 50 abuse children you know we weren't going
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:58.120]  to try to out victims we only wanted that pedophiles and
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:01.720]  look not everybody was as brave as the five brave souls that
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:07.000]  you know showed up on an open secret but look at history every culture goes
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.200]  into a decadent cycle whether it was mesoamerica or europe or
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.400]  where china is today or africa they would get elites that got into
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:16.360]  kids they'd have human sacrifice and they would say you know sacrifice the
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:20.360]  virgins that means the young people i mean there's some sick psychopath system
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:23.400]  where they kind of get control throughout history and they manifest
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:28.200]  the same system psychologically we see it in sociology anthropology and
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.120]  archaeology oh absolutely and they try to push their values
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:35.400]  on america and with you and the info wars folks out there
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.440]  they're rejecting it i mean hollywood is afraid right now you've seen all the
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:43.160]  headlines of how movie ticket sales are at something like a 20 or 25 year low
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:47.880]  let's see how low they go after this has come out that's right and then look at
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:51.720]  john wane gasey was a guy that liked to grab young men and torture them and
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.080]  kill them and then they go well don't don't bash him he was gay oh so he wanted
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:59.320]  to just kill people as part of his extra fund and they like you're anti-gay if
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:02.680]  you're against john wane gasey it just gets weirder and weirder and really it's
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:06.680]  just like they're using the tolerance of an open society to now say pedophilia
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.960]  and killing people's okay well abuse is abuse is abuse
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.880]  and abuse isn't a straight or gay thing it's an everything whether it's a
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:17.880]  a guy abusing a girl heck a girl abusing and i totally agree there are men
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.920]  there are men abusing women like weinstein and young women but but
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:25.560]  statistically i mean what we keep seeing is is it like 70 80 percent though
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:29.960]  men against boys absolutely absolutely i mean even
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:33.400]  the tom johnson's come out and said he had guys basically first got his career
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:36.680]  producers and stuff trying to make him you know do it and again and for me it's
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:39.880]  about power it's beta males want to dominate other men i think that's what
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:42.600]  it's really all about we'll be back stay with us ladies and gentlemen this is

[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.760]  you said it was michael jackson all people wanted
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:41.960]  so there's kory felvin who has a lot of courage he's been speaking out about
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.720]  this for years years ago we were in talks to have him on but just dealing with
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:49.400]  his his you know producer and people i just said look if you want to do it do
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:54.520]  it if not you know not but i'm i'm just glad that he's gone public
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:57.480]  i don't think the view is the place i just the view admitted it i turned them
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.960]  down a few months ago to go on i said i'm not going on your show i've been on it
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:03.560]  before i mean you got a bunch of morons that watch it but at least he did that
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.920]  there but look at barbara walters trying to defend hollywood when she's been all
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.360]  over hollywood she used to be the 60 minutes reporter that went out and a
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:12.760]  bunch of other channels and you know interviewed the hollywood folks
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:16.360]  so watching that old spider defend the spider hall
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:19.640]  when when he's warning people watch getting your kids involved in this
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:23.240]  i couldn't think of a worse place to put your children than show business
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:27.080]  absolutely absolutely there is a message that i'd like to send
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:29.560]  we're going to come back in the next break because we got in here late and do
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.720]  that but just go ahead and make your point there and then we'll come back in
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:34.840]  the next segment leon mackey you can have the floor and make your statement
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:39.320]  okay i'll just wait for that well just any other points you're making points
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.360]  by watching that whole view piece well it shows you the tone deafness
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.880]  of hollywood i mean that's a standard reaction and that's why it's gone viral
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:50.760]  is is barbara walters really embodies what the
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:54.040]  hollywood reaction has been you know every single time that one of these has
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:56.680]  come out or there have been all these convictions that we've
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.080]  showed in the film how hollywood just kind of puts it aside in other words
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:05.720]  there's more to protect dogs that appear on set in terms of water and not
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.800]  petting them and all that than there are for kids a convicted pedophile like
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:14.120]  brian peck can work on a film set with kids all
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.800]  around him as long as he's not one-on-one but yet a convicted sex
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:20.840]  offender in most states they can't get within a
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:23.640]  thousand feet of the school they can't live on your street
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:27.400]  exactly exactly so it hollywood does not do enough
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.720]  to protect children and we need people need to vote with their dollars
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:36.520]  their entertainment dollars to decide look we want to see in hollywood
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:39.960]  you really change things we want to see you put protections i mean
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:44.040]  if i'm hiring a secretary an assistant at my office
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:49.240]  i spend 1995 and i do a background check why can't hollywood do that with
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.880]  people they hire on their set but they know these are convicted people that
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:54.600]  are their buddies it's all a big sick club
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.920]  absolutely absolutely well we were told by high up sources that the wine scene
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:01.480]  thing was just a cover for all the pedophile stuff it was about to get
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:05.160]  into that and now stones that earlier now it's breaking in mainstream news
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.600]  actually that he is under investigation with wine scene for being with children
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:12.600]  no that they can't stop it and in fact california statute
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:16.360]  says that all these confidentiality agreements because harvey wine scene was
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:20.440]  not the only one with confidentiality agreements that kept a lot of people
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.680]  down but california statute says that you cannot enforce
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.360]  confidentiality when there's a settlement and it applies to
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:31.560]  kids or it applies to her that's right it doesn't cover criminal activity
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:36.600]  and let's expose that wine scene we now know had 17 year old girls in that had
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:38.920]  to run away not going to call him a pedophile but did
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.920]  he ever get fingered by any of your sources we didn't even get into wine
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:45.960]  scene we were just sticking with what was what we had on our plate it was too
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:48.360]  much oh okay wow there was so many convicted ones
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:55.000]  and everything else we'll be right back with his statement stay with us
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.840]  the left is proposing new orwellian efforts to combat fake news
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:03.480]  a proposal called fool me once the case for government regulation of fake news
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:07.080]  hopes to squash the spread of information on social media platforms
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:11.240]  by threatening libel suits to anyone who thinks of sharing or retweeting
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:14.520]  some wrong think now there's no solid definition of what's considered
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:18.360]  disinformation other than what the left says but radical democrats would like
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:23.240]  to see regulation in the form of pop-ups that would remind a user of libel laws
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:27.560]  before they decide to share an article in dispute sites like info wars and the
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:31.400]  drudge report would immediately be targeted discouraging users from
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:35.720]  sharing articles ironically george w bush reemerged this week to
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:39.640]  insult the american people for their obsession with conspiracy theories
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.080]  this coming from the man who peddled the most devastating conspiracy theory of
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.800]  the modern era the weapons of mass destruction lie that was
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.640]  dutifully spread by the deep state intelligence agencies and the mainstream
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:53.720]  media as the indisputable truth leon macadoo for info wars

[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:36.440]  hollywood and their cronies when we wanted to make an open secret we decided
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:40.600]  to follow the facts wherever they may lead we hired the private investigators
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:44.600]  we had months of meticulous work done we got an oscar nominated director
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:47.560]  we spent over a million and a half dollars but it's only the tip of the
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:51.400]  iceberg the professional critics have weighed in
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:55.800]  93 positive rating on rotten tomatoes
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:59.320]  you conspired with your hollywood elite to keep us out of some film festivals
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:03.720]  but we wouldn't stop that wouldn't stop us drudge report
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:07.960]  alex jones all these other folks we unmasked in an open secret
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:11.480]  one of the most prominent child acting coaches in hollywood
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:15.880]  as a pedophile we got him to confess on camera
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:20.440]  we found five brave survivors who are willing to go on camera
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:25.000]  and bear their souls and we defend them we defend them
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  some of the proven pedophiles the convicted pedophiles
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.280]  are your friends you invested in their company den
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:35.800]  which was a front for pedophiles you went to their
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:39.560]  den parties at the mansion that chug night used to live in
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:43.320]  bought with your investment dollars where young underage boys
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:47.640]  were forced with drugs and alcohol so they wouldn't fight your sick
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:54.040]  pedophile deviant immoral sexual abuse you hired convicted pedophiles to work
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:59.880]  on sets in some cases even after after multiple convictions
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:02.680]  your pedophile friends got exposed for the first time
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:06.600]  in our documentary film an open secret you started to get nervous
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:10.360]  you knew we were getting closer to exposing you so you made sure
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:14.280]  that it wouldn't get a single offer from hollywood not anything not a little
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:17.720]  money we got nothing we didn't even get a no money down
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:22.200]  percentage deal absolutely anything but that wouldn't stop us
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:27.160]  we launched it independently ourselves the american people started to see it
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:31.880]  so once again we waited we knew this day would come
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:36.760]  and we released it on the internet the one thing you and your rich powerful
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.520]  hollywood cronies can't control for free
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.360]  because you see there are some things more important than money
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:48.440]  a concept that you obviously do not understand
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:52.520]  the american people now can see it exposing hollywood pedophile misdeeds
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:57.960]  and make up their own minds in just a week over one million views

[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.520]  it'll no longer be swept under the rug by the hollywood elites
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:57.720]  and finally and finally hollywood elites

[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:56.040]  are we in this process a leaky dam or is it breaking partially broken
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:00.360]  i hope that it completely breaks i hope that these defenders are just sticking
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:04.120]  there sticking their fingers in the dyke we we really don't know
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:07.400]  it depends on how courageous brave survivors are
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.480]  that we know signed confidential settlements
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:15.560]  for underage sexual abuse with big power for hollywood people
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:20.200]  it's up to you to continue to come forward if you want to do it anonymously
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:24.600]  that's fine go to a mainstream publication show them show them
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:28.360]  show them your your your settlement and just ask that they don't use your name
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.960]  and you'll get the big votes exposed do it any way you have to
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.640]  but please please keep doing it it's time to bring down hollywood bring down the
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:37.160]  globalists they want to bring down america
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:43.080]  guess what we're fighting back um looking at this
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:46.120]  as we pull back from it there's no way they're gonna stop this
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:49.400]  at the vatican you i mean the deputy popes in jail basically
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:52.680]  uh for a hundred kids grabbed and groomed it's all collapsing
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:56.600]  and it's just worse and worse than we thought and but it really makes sense why
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:00.120]  these people hate just normal folks so much
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:03.240]  it's you can look at hollywood so many different ways
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:08.040]  and a lot of elite big institutions that that gather power a lot of different
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.160]  ways and it's obvious that they try to push their
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:16.120]  values on average folks but they're not succeeding we're fighting back
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:19.880]  there you go top advisors with deputy pope charged with sexual assault since
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.080]  is the best friend of the pope and it's even one in guardian they used
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:26.680]  pedophile scandals with the last pope never had two popes at the same time
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:31.640]  to step down and be moved to gandalf castle gandalfus can't make that up
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:36.200]  and they use that to take him down
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:39.720]  i mean this is why they do it also it's it it it's like gangs that make you go
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:42.520]  out and rob a liquor store become a member or shoot an old lady
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:47.080]  well here you got to be a pedophile or basically you don't get let in

[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:37.240]  he isn't the convenient 10 minutes of hate 1984
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:43.560]  boogie man up to 50 years after napoleon bonaparte was dead the
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:47.320]  british would still say oh there was a carriage wreck or a ship ran
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:50.840]  a rocks you know coming in and fog it must have been
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:55.320]  must have been the old bonaparte bony as they called him
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:59.960]  no with soros when law firms sue us it's soros funding it when media matters
[02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:03.400]  comes after us and makes stuff up it's soros

[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:20.760]  and then my grandfather's great men are dead and this demon's still running around
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:25.800]  and the adl he funds calls me a nazi and cnn says he never said he worked for the
[02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:30.040]  nazis he said he was proud of it but i'm gonna stop right there
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:33.480]  you talk about censorship how hollywood wouldn't put out an award-winning film
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:37.480]  by an oscar nominated lady that exposed the whole vatican thing with her
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:41.240]  first documentary on sex crimes
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:45.320]  but now it's been put out for free we were just covering an open secret it's on
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:49.480]  info wars dot com but the next move is to go after us what do you think when
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:53.160]  soros gave a billion dollars of his stolen money most of its stolen they
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:56.120]  admit that from currency speculation inside our trading to overthrow
[02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:58.360]  ukraine a few years ago he bragged about it
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:00.840]  he matched basically the state department money
[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:05.000]  now he's put 18 billion into overthrow the u.s but hillary had almost three
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.360]  billion it couldn't be trump once we're aware of them it's game over
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:11.160]  but leon wanted to get into this and i wanted to have her on about it
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.160]  this is out of the washington examiner fec federal election commission
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:18.760]  she called for me to be arrested a few months ago and drudge who tried to
[02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:23.880]  muzzle drudge now on payroll on soros payroll the former chair one of the
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.080]  federal elections commission who famously i'd regulating the political
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:29.640]  conservative outlets like drudge report she mentioned drudge and me
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:34.600]  specifically had joined an advocacy group funded by soros and run by his son
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:38.040]  so he was in the witchy league saying we want to have the u n take over the
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:42.760]  internet we want to muzzle the tea party and the nationalist and alonso
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:46.040]  so they want to muzzle us so we don't show you
[02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:49.560]  the alistar crowdy rituals and the pedophile garbage and all of it
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:52.600]  so when you understand that spreading our links spreading our articles praying
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:57.400]  for us financially supporting us is key it's absolutely key
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.080]  we are the tip of the spear i'm so deep into this i'm not complaining like i'm
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:05.480]  the tip of the spear please support us i'm i'm mocked 500 hair on fire
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:11.000]  i'm going in like a precision guided munition against the globalist but when
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.400]  you pray for us fund this and spread the articles
[02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:17.000]  our payload gets bigger and bigger as we go in for main impact
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.040]  everything we've done so far is punching a hole for their defenses
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:23.480]  now we got the all-seeing eye targeted we're ready to go
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:27.000]  we don't intend to probably make it out of this at least i don't i don't want to
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.800]  but i'm ready to go i'm fully committed i don't want to die but i'm
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:33.880]  committed kamikaze baby i'm going in through and beyond
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:36.680]  and i'm just trusting in god and i'm not even asking god to protect me just
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:41.800]  whatever god's will is just do it i want to fight these people because my
[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:45.000]  soul is against the enemy not because i'm a hero when you realize you're facing
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.800]  satanic child kidnapping pedophile armies
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:51.080]  who literally want to enslave humanity you realize there's nothing left but to
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:54.600]  resist and as we begin to resist we see the tide begin to turn
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:57.560]  we have the power leah and mackadoog great to have you
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:01.240]  hear whether she wanted to get into this it's just sensational
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:05.800]  how soros is literally like the devil every time we turn over a rock
[02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:11.000]  it's him behind it this this man who who who said in the in the 90s that he
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.160]  believed he was christ that he believed he was the messianic
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:20.280]  world leader he he he isn't what he thought he'd be but let me tell you
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:23.960]  he's as close to the devil as i've ever seen go ahead
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:27.080]  well think about it i mean we all can take one look at him and see he doesn't
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:32.520]  have much longer but he's got his son now running his his advocacy groups so
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:36.200]  it's not as if everything that he's built up this empire all the
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:39.480]  all the little uh chess pieces that he's positioned on the board
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:43.240]  it's not as if those are just going to be wiped away when he is dead and gone he
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:47.960]  his son's following in his footsteps and uh they've they've got this advocacy
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:51.160]  group new america with where they are propping up
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:55.560]  the change makers who of course are the people who are going to go and change
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:59.480]  the united states into a more progressive socialist
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:04.360]  country and so this this woman and ravel she's the former democratic chair of

[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:27.480]  mic saying yes i'll do everything i can to help you uh with the german
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:31.720]  leader there bringing more muslims yeah yeah we'll we'll help you we'll we'll
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:35.320]  control what's going on and now they want us to face libel suits
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:40.360]  uh what's your well the good thing is there's slap back in those states this
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:43.560]  is all just intimidation well the thing is is that
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:46.920]  there are a lot of democrats that are really pushing for internet regulations
[02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:50.680]  because they're they're just pushing that conspiracy theory
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:53.720]  that it was facebook and these political ads
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:57.480]  hundred thousand dollars mind you that were bought in political ads from foreign
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:01.720]  governments um to to target hillary clinton
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.600]  they're they're putting out this conspiracy theory that that
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:09.080]  was what was able to stop the 1.4 billion at least
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:12.920]  that was behind the hillary clinton campaign really one point four billion
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:17.000]  register but you had all the packs together it's like 2.8
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.520]  yeah i mean it's a ridiculous amount of money the most anyone has ever spent
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:23.480]  and she's still lost it's like you said in the last segment it's because the
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:26.600]  truth is on our side and they realize that's not working
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:30.200]  anymore and how powerful the drudge report how much of an effect of the
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:33.960]  drudge report info wars all these sites people were sharing our articles like
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:38.360]  wildfire and it's successful because the truth is on our side
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:41.800]  and so they have got to do everything to shut that down they see
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:46.040]  wow we had all this power behind hillary clinton that still wasn't enough
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:49.800]  now we just have got to shut them down so and ravel she was there
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:53.000]  formerly sitting as the chair on the fec thank god
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.160]  but she's not she's not done so here she is working with one of george soros's
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:00.840]  advocacy groups she also lectures at berkeley law
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:05.640]  big surprise there but she is now putting out this new proposal
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.400]  to regulate the internet even further and what this
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:14.520]  what this let me pull it up it is called it is called
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:20.120]  full me once the case for government regulation of fake news and what they
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.480]  want again they define what's fake that means regulating free speech that means
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.240]  the case for soviet style or chinese communist style
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:31.960]  is censorship exactly they want to intimidate the american people
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:36.280]  from sharing or retweeting articles so what they're going to do is the woman
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:39.880]  that literally wanted me and drudge criminally investigated
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:43.480]  absolutely and so now what they're going to do since they can't come after you
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.080]  because your platform is too big and it'll just be too much of a red
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.640]  flag people will say whoa it's you know this stuff is really hit the fan now
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:55.400]  now they're going to go directly target any americans who might want to
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:59.080]  share something off of facebook or twitter and so what it'll do it's going
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:02.280]  to pop up kind of a warning before you hit that
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:06.680]  tweet button and it'll say hey here are the libel laws in your state
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:10.520]  if you send that you know you could get sued are you sure this is true

[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:19.080]  facebook twitter but it only seems to be
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:22.280]  waking people up even faster i mean i don't want to be overly positive you
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:25.240]  you tell me three years ago you know in the hallway please be more
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:28.840]  positive it's it's depressing sometimes i was just telling folks how bad it was
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:32.840]  but we're seeing a lot of really positive things happen right now
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:38.120]  on so many fronts absolutely i mean even just the last guest you had gape
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:42.760]  hoffman who who gave that really moving speech directly to the hollywood elites
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:47.160]  and everyone out there who's protecting these dark forces
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:51.320]  it is a wake-up call and we really are starting to see the house of cards
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:55.320]  tumble across the board that's exciting that's what people need to focus on
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:00.200]  yes it's it's dark what's being uncovered but there's so much good
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:04.600]  when the there's light it's shining on this darkness it's exposing it and we
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:09.160]  really are at the tipping point when the the dark forces they don't have
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:12.840]  anywhere else to hide they're being they're being called out
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:16.680]  and when more people are able to step forward and band together you see the
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:20.200]  power in numbers with all these women coming forward now
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:23.640]  that's what they're so frightened of that's why they're the divide and conquer
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.400]  is powerful in the in order to control people because there is such power in
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:31.480]  numbers so imagine now you know watching the clip you played with
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:34.840]  quarry feldman when he was there on the view and just how these women
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:39.080]  it's hard enough for people to come forward and report sexual assault
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:43.000]  imagine now a guy having to step forward and and talk about how rampant it is
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.800]  against young men and the way they treated him there
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.640]  the way he's putting his life career everything on the line to come out and
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:53.800]  say this and they just treat him like oh come on you know
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:56.840]  there's lots of parents that want to get their kids in there
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:01.320]  like no yeah what i want to say to you is there's a lot of freaking pedophilia
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:05.080]  going on watch your kids protect your children and they're just kind of
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:09.960]  pulling him off i mean oh that just it it outrage they're all defending it like
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:13.640]  this is a great place for kids to go and oh come on even though they know there's
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:18.360]  been hundreds of convictions here are these old creepy women defending it
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:21.720]  right exactly and that's what that's what people need to understand people that did
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:24.600]  this to both me and quarry that are still working
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:27.480]  they're still out there and there's some of the richest most powerful people in
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:30.760]  this business and they are trying to not want me saying what i'm saying we're
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:34.360]  going to go to break and come back with the rest of it but continually in
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:38.600]  right it's just so outrageous so disgusting and what the people who think
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:42.760]  they're they're protected still because they've been protected for decades
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:46.920]  they must really be petrified right now because the amount of disgust
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:50.440]  that people feel in their hearts right now for the enablers and the media
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:53.720]  outlets out there that have protected these people who have been raping and
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:57.640]  abusing women for decades imagine that amount
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:01.400]  of fire and vitriol that's going to be pointed at these people
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:05.000]  when they find out who is sexually abusing children and by the way there's
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.960]  so many articles lian just out today with major
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:11.320]  hollywood starlets and it's mainly women saying look
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:14.520]  it's mainly men getting raped and and little boys
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:17.880]  it's bad for women but it's it's mainly boys and i had the producer and he said
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:21.800]  it's about 80 percent boys and men being targeted as an
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:24.920]  act of power but again men see it as shameful and
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:27.880]  men aren't supposed to come forward they're supposed to suck it up but we've
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:32.520]  seen a 16 times increase in the military now of men
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:36.440]  being raped and it being reported now i mean what is going on lian
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:40.920]  right i mean it's traumatizing i speak from experience it is traumatizing
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:45.160]  and it is it's a power thing and and if you come from a place where you don't
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:47.880]  have any power you're feeling vulnerable and then someone
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:51.160]  takes advantage of you like that it's even sucks the power out of you even
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:54.600]  more so it's traumatizing so i can imagine
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:59.400]  how a young boy might feel and and you are powerless
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:02.840]  jennifer lorence came out and said when she had faced this abuse
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:06.600]  and early days of her career she didn't have the power to take down
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:10.200]  some big wig in the entertainment industry she's just a lowly girl no one
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:13.720]  cares about her and that's how they treat people in these industries music
[02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:17.560]  industry politics as well uh hollywood entertainment i mean it's
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:21.480]  across the board they're thrown away they their voice doesn't matter

[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:20.440]  you are me but they the globalists sell that
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:24.680]  collectivism like they are the collective when we the
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:27.960]  people are the collective but we're individuals who make individual
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:31.240]  choices for the great mind of the collective we are
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:35.480]  individuals but we're also a colony organism
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:40.760]  we've got genetic information we pass on genetic memories we pass on
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:45.720]  and then there's a spirit compound within that everything's so more
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:49.160]  fantastic than you can imagine and they're trying to jack into that and
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:52.760]  trying to control it and all they're doing is activating
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:56.280]  our next level now a lot of people are falling to the side and
[02:49:56.280 --> 02:49:59.480]  falling to the you know going into the screen sickness
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:02.840]  television sicknesses i call it but for every person that falls
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:07.880]  psychically and you can measure this into a dream state others are breaking
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:10.200]  through it's kind of like bugs you're spraying
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:14.360]  with poison some become immune most die and i just want to see this get really
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:17.560]  rough for most people okay because once you
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:20.200]  realize there's an attack and you actually deal with it competently
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:23.560]  from a position of victory you just get stronger
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:27.080]  if you if you know the attack will feel beaten down you lose
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:30.360]  but if you're unaware of the attack you will fall leon i know i'm kind of
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:34.280]  getting metaphysical here but the enemy knows that's what this is
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:37.800]  so lee is metaphysical and that's why they can put so
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:41.560]  much money behind someone like hillary clinton and she can still
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:45.560]  fail because that's not what it's about anymore the truth is becoming much more
[02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:48.520]  powerful than the darkness and the lies and it
[02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:51.720]  doesn't matter how much programming they put out there it doesn't matter how
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:55.560]  many times they try to pass internet regulations to stop the free flow of
[02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:59.320]  information they're gonna fail we will find a way to conquer them
[02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:01.640]  always and and we have reached the tipping point
[02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:05.160]  they know that that's why they're so afraid that's why they're scrambling
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.240]  pumping money into these social justice warrior causes and trying to
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:12.680]  say that they're the resistance we're on the wrong side
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:16.120]  we're on the winning side and that completely shocked them
[02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:19.400]  that you know we were we're on the winning side that trump got elected
[02:51:19.400 --> 02:51:23.320]  nobody saw that coming you know we have to forgive people and have compassion for
[02:51:23.320 --> 02:51:27.960]  them truly because they are everyone lives in a bubble of their own making
[02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:31.720]  but the left the democrats they really have been living in this
[02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:37.080]  bubble because of the media and the news everything it's it's on their side
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:40.120]  putting everything through the filter they like to see
[02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:42.920]  so everything that disagrees with their paradigm
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:46.600]  must be fake news that's why these new regulations that they're proposing
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:50.680]  are so dangerous because they're the ones who get to say
[02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:53.880]  what's in dispute or what's fake news and it totally proves they're the
[02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:58.280]  authoritarians whoever calls for this is clearly the loser
[02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:01.160]  right and and think about that the other night when
[02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:04.760]  when the uranium one story broke now obviously peter schweiser who you've
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:08.520]  had had on the show he first talked about this uranium one deal
[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:11.480]  and how it implicated the clinton's and the clinton foundation
[02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:14.280]  but the latest bombshell that came out this week
[02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:18.840]  implicated just about the big everyone in the obama administration
[02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:21.560]  and robert miller who's overseeing the russia
[02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:26.120]  trump investigation you know total improprieties there so this is a huge
[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:29.720]  story so i went to my mom's house typically like i go
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:32.840]  visit my grandma they are always watching abc news
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:36.760]  because that's the more fair and balanced of the big three
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:40.280]  their top stories were a shooting in chicago
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:43.960]  a shooting in an office space and then trump's phone call with
[02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:49.160]  the uh the gold star widow so there was nothing and still has been
[02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:53.480]  absolutely nothing on the biggest story about russia
[02:52:53.480 --> 02:52:57.960]  to come out in the last year that's actual true actual documentation with
[02:52:57.960 --> 02:53:02.440]  government documents government sources government witnesses
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:07.880]  and total silence so just taking a huge bombshell story like that
[02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:11.640]  imagine that is now something labeled in dispute
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:15.480]  that no one is allowed to now share on their social media because it hasn't
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:20.520]  been vetted by cnn or by abc soros hasn't authorized you
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:24.440]  to see congressional hearings with fbi informants and all the evidence that
[02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:27.240]  the clinton's met secretly when she was state department had
[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:30.520]  they got uranium money even though it was under criminal investigation
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:33.960]  total proof that everything they said trump was doing they'd done which is
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:37.240]  their tactic which is what potesta knew they had to do early on during the
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:40.360]  campaign and i want to be clear even if trump isn't perfect and i'm not saying
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:42.600]  anybody is the referendum against the
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:46.040]  establishment when the whole media the money
[02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:49.080]  was all against him showed we're going against him and so far
[02:53:49.080 --> 02:53:51.800]  on the economy and so many issues he has delivered
[02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:56.600]  as best in his own you know kind of conservative libertarian populist way
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:53:59.640]  he's 71 years old you know this kind of old-fashioned new york stuff
[02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:03.560]  he really believes he's doing good and it's that spirit they hate of him
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:07.320]  actually being president and these offshore elites not having full control
[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:09.960]  and they get more horrified by the minute as the stock market
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:13.400]  and the economy begins to come back they just get more and more desperate they
[02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:16.200]  don't understand he's only a manifestation
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:20.440]  he's only a surfer on the wave bigger waves are coming in sweethearts
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:23.960]  don't you understand you cannot stop the signal
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:28.200]  right and they're not going to be able to stop this wave of information
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:31.080]  this russia scandal you're going to see that the whole
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:34.280]  russia stuff is just going to kind of slip into the darkness they're just
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:37.720]  going to let it slowly die out it's going to be a non-story
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:41.560]  there there's been nothing on on it on networks because it continues to come
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:44.920]  back around and implicate the democrats and the obama administration
[02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:47.560]  not the guy they thought it was going to implicate
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:50.840]  president trump so they're just gonna let that story die out no one's ever
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:54.360]  going to get any answers and that's what's so frustrating to me is that you
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:57.720]  what you see the only things they're promoting on the big networks
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:01.880]  are these stories that continue to create the division in this country that
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:05.800]  continue to cause the infighting between family members that's because we
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:08.680]  have elite offshore megabanks wiki leaks says it
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:12.520]  creating culture war between men women black white all of it
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:15.800]  as an admitted cold-blooded plan doesn't mean there aren't real differences in
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:19.880]  real problems the point is that outside global force is manipulating it
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:23.640]  that is a fact and when you buy into it you're a chump
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:28.040]  it doesn't mean you don't still respond you know to tv programs saying whites
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:31.800]  are inherently evil and point out that's not true or you know
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:35.880]  families are bad you still pointed out but you're the average duke
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:38.920]  picked up and it going along with it is not your enemy
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:42.760]  they just believe mainstream media is still king and so many of the old folks
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:46.040]  still on capitol hill they still believe mainstream media is king
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:49.320]  they still believe that's the gold standard they don't understand with
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:52.840]  most young people and middle-aged and old folks that are
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:57.240]  awake that it is the standard of pravda just like in 1985
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:01.240]  if something was in pravda you didn't believe it well now we've got the new
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:03.800]  pravda and that's our that's our mainstream media
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:07.000]  that is a husk of itself and there's no putting
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:12.040]  the Humpty Dumpty back together again absolutely there really isn't and now
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:14.600]  that we're starting to see like you said the the dam
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:18.440]  it's got so many holes in it they're not able to plug it up anymore it is gonna
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:21.880]  break if it hasn't already just begin to totally crack and
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:25.960]  about to flood the world with the truth the light is finally
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:29.320]  breaking through people are sick of this and all of these entities that have
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:32.680]  been covering four people like harvey weinstein i mean think
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:36.520]  about that alex they were ready to take him down back in 2004
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:39.800]  but then they stopped the feds are ready to had a sting operation on him ready
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.720]  to take him down in 2015 but they let him go on to assault
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:48.360]  women abuse women for two more years why because he goes to the because he goes
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:50.920]  to both democrat administrations obama and clinton
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:54.840]  and watches movies and gets on the pedophile express plane reportedly
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:58.120]  and he's the biggest democratic donor he's the one that's able to get all the
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:01.720]  a-list celebrities to come and donate to hillary clinton's campaign he's
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:06.760]  throwing a brothel manager of the men women and children that the pervs want
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:10.760]  right and so just imagine that's why you see these outlets now calling out the
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:13.240]  pedophile is the next big shoe to drop there in
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:15.800]  hollywood because they know they're not going to cover this up anymore because
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:19.480]  people are going to call them out on their complicity they're
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:23.720]  complicit in that incredible job leon macadoo we really appreciate

[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:51.640]  because we you and i the we do this so much our
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:55.000]  nose is so close to the grindstone i just want listeners understand
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:00.600]  because of them and everybody together good against evil we are having epic
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:02.920]  victories there's also bad stuff happening but
[03:01:02.920 --> 03:01:06.600]  we really should be celebrating the victories we're having
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:12.280]  and they've been at a high cost because you know the tide is turning leon
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:15.880]  it really is and that's what i think is is difficult for people
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:19.960]  what we really have to struggle to do is focus on those victories and focus on
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:22.760]  the fact you want to get caught up in the fact
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:26.360]  that the news is still denying the uranium one story
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:29.720]  they're still hiding these sexual predators in hollywood but you can't
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:33.480]  you got to focus on the victories focus on the fact that harvey winestein he's
[03:01:33.480 --> 03:01:36.440]  just their first and that you're able to spread the news and you're able to
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:40.040]  gather the news yourself you are you are the resistance you are the
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:43.400]  victory we are alive at such a great time right
[03:01:43.400 --> 03:01:47.240]  now where we really can play a major role in
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:50.760]  shifting the consciousness on this planet i think it's already begun
[03:01:50.760 --> 03:01:55.240]  even just realizing that this um all these sexual predatory nature there
[03:01:55.240 --> 03:01:58.040]  that these women with the whole me too campaign
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:01.800]  a lot of people are seeing that it's it's every woman most women i won't say
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:05.480]  every woman but it's it's very prevalent it's not a partisan issue
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:09.320]  it's everywhere and i think that that's really helping to shift the consciousness
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:13.400]  of you know quality men out there who are starting to say
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:17.000]  yeah you know this is this is something and we're not going to be complicit in
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:20.520]  allowing women to continue to be treated like this now let's do something
[03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:24.360]  about the children that we've been ignoring for quite some time
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:28.360]  i mean what kind of a sick person you know i don't want to get back into those
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:32.040]  pedestrian emails but i mean what kind of a sick person is thinking
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:36.120]  yeah i want to have a hat go to an adult party with kids around i mean that's the
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:38.920]  last you know we're gonna have kids in the hot tub for your entertainment you
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:42.520]  know these kids know what to do but you know they can still be kids the kids
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:45.560]  know what to do and sixty four thousand dollars in
[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:49.160]  succulent hot dogs yeah i mean it's just
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:53.080]  something's fishy in denmark i think the saying is and
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:57.080]  there you know that it's it's well look at him put desks as his number one
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:03:01.080]  enemies are it's it's it's info wars he's literally
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:06.280]  obsessed with info wars and and trying to shut us down i wonder why
[03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:10.120]  right people who allow someone to come on and speak
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:13.800]  speak their mind we don't edit the interviews well yeah we might put out
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:17.160]  some highlight clips but then we'll put the entire interview out in full so
[03:03:17.160 --> 03:03:19.880]  people know that we're not taking them out of context
[03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:22.600]  or feeding them lines or telling them what to say
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:27.480]  i mean i mean 90 90 what we do lian's live
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:32.280]  exactly teleprompter free so it's that's frightening to them that they can see
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:34.760]  people are are just speaking from the heart and speaking
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:38.440]  truthfully and not being fed these lines that's what i think when i look at the
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:42.760]  news anchor on the abc nightly news i mean he seems like a great guy
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:46.680]  i wonder what if he truly is in such a bubble that he doesn't realize
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:49.320]  that he's not giving their selfish even if they're not even
[03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:53.320]  ever they're just so selfish on their own little career
[03:03:53.320 --> 03:03:56.920]  and becoming you know the head guy and keeping that position
[03:03:56.920 --> 03:03:59.320]  that that they're just thinking about themselves because people have been
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:04.200]  taught think about yourself you get ahead uh no not not at the end of a
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:07.560]  whole time period not in the new turning this is the time
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:11.160]  where you want to wait till you die to be punished if you choose wrong during
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:13.640]  this great turning that's happening you're going to get punished in this
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:16.840]  life as well right and that's something that i've been just
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:20.600]  kind of thinking about a lot lately a lot of these powerful people
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:23.800]  truly believed that well first of all they i'm sure they don't believe in god
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:27.080]  so they don't believe in heaven or hell they think you know what whatever oh
[03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:29.320]  sure yeah i'll deal with it in the afterlife
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:33.800]  haha they're getting theirs right now and they are going to have to deal with
[03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:36.440]  the consequences of all the evil that they have done
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:40.120]  it's exciting by the way i haven't even seen that news put us the email saying

[03:06:13.560 --> 03:06:23.560]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live jack pacific naval
[03:06:23.560 --> 03:06:26.440]  intelligence and one of the biggest trump groups in the country great
[03:06:26.440 --> 03:06:30.120]  investigative journalist is going to be taking over but right now i wanted to
[03:06:30.120 --> 03:06:32.920]  finish up with some of the biggest news of the day
[03:06:32.920 --> 03:06:37.800]  vladimir putin is known for having these three four five six hour
[03:06:37.800 --> 03:06:40.680]  pressers where they let the entire international press in including people
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:43.560]  like meghan kelly people that are adversarial to ask him questions and
[03:06:43.560 --> 03:06:48.040]  he gives long-form complex answers and his latest
[03:06:48.040 --> 03:06:51.000]  breakdown yesterday was particularly informative
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:58.040]  putin hillary behind russian collusion hysteria and elites disrespect voters
[03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:02.040]  that's a kit daniel's article here's another one putin vows to respond
[03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:06.440]  immediately and systematically of us leaves cold war nuke treating
[03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:09.240]  so let's go ahead and play some of these clips
[03:07:09.240 --> 03:07:12.600]  so we can get the perspective uh from russia that doesn't mean we're on the
[03:07:12.600 --> 03:07:16.040]  russian payroll it means we're getting russia's perspective
[03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:19.960]  which the globalists don't want us to have but it's more important than that
[03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:22.920]  putin met secretly with bill clinton and hillary
[03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:26.280]  he did the uranium one deal that got him a third of the u.s uranium a good move
[03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:29.080]  for russia very treasonous though by the clinton's
[03:07:29.080 --> 03:07:33.160]  so putin knows a lot and there's been quite a bit of talk about
[03:07:33.160 --> 03:07:36.440]  information coming out soon about the clinton's and who was really working with
[03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:39.720]  the russians and anybody else that would pay him
[03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:43.720]  that's why they were so desperate to go after trump and his supporters saying
[03:07:43.720 --> 03:07:46.520]  we were russian agents with no proof because that's how you
[03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:50.040]  change the subject if you're john podesta and his brother getting money
[03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:54.680]  from the russians uranium one so who's eating uh the old you know what now
[03:07:54.680 --> 03:07:59.160]  mr podesta uh let's go ahead here uh and get to this clip
[03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:02.360]  putin hillary behind russia collusion hysteria
[03:08:02.360 --> 03:08:06.120]  and elites disrespect trump voters oh yeah they hate trump because they
[03:08:06.120 --> 03:08:09.080]  hate you flyover country
[03:08:09.080 --> 03:08:13.480]  first of all is for the critical
[03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:17.000]  critical things and critical things that i mentioned i would like to draw
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.880]  your attention to the fact that in the united states you of course you know
[03:08:19.880 --> 03:08:23.880]  this there was an unprecedented anti russian campaign
[03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:28.680]  being waged in the united states from the outgoing administration of mr
[03:08:28.680 --> 03:08:33.160]  abama and now it's not over still why are you
[03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:37.320]  surprised with my critical attitude towards
[03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:40.760]  previous and today's administration i just don't understand this
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:46.280]  because the u.s has these unprecedented russian campaign which has not been
[03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:50.440]  provoked by anything someone has lost the elections to mr trump
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:54.840]  and russia was blamed for this and then they
[03:08:54.840 --> 03:09:01.160]  unfold this anti russian hysteria any issue any
[03:09:01.160 --> 03:09:05.080]  failure is linked with russia
[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:10.600]  isn't that it's a true yes yes this is how it is
[03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:17.480]  on any issue you can find russian meddling and they find this meddling
[03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:20.200]  now let's go to the next clip where he goes more into this russian president
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:24.440]  believes trump supporters deserve more respect well no no no they're all
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:28.040]  deplorables they're all races they're all kkk think about how
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:31.720]  weaponized that liars in fact even bloomberg had to admit if he did a
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:35.000]  breakdown of who put trump over the top it
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.720]  was the very same voting block that voted for obama
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:41.160]  we just want change we want prosperity we want unity
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:44.200]  and that's what trumps really been calling for but first we've got to admit
[03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:47.320]  we've got a country if that's going to be the case
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:50.440]  because the globalists want to say oh no surrender get rid of the idea of
[03:09:50.440 --> 03:09:54.600]  sovereignty or even having jobs give into our political correctness and then
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:58.520]  we'll let you have a future so here it is russia president believes trump
[03:09:58.520 --> 03:10:02.600]  supporters deserve more respect among all the major powers russia
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:09.320]  united states china india japan or germany or great britain
[03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:14.280]  almost every major power has a competent and the capable leaders like yourself
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:18.840]  except the number one power united states we happen to have a president
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:23.240]  unfortunately that needs to be managed although it remains to be saying if
[03:10:23.240 --> 03:10:28.840]  he's manageable enough and you have the inverse hit pause for a minute
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:32.920]  so you've got this journalist uh from some state run-off fit
[03:10:32.920 --> 03:10:39.560]  i guess it's china uh coming up saying we need trump to be managed
[03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:42.600]  oh you're a great leader putin but you know trump needs to be managed and then
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:46.120]  this is how a putin responds so you need to respect the voters of the united
[03:10:46.120 --> 03:10:48.920]  states wow no wonder our media doesn't play
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:54.760]  clubs what putin actually says here it is has a senior president if you're asked
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:11:00.360]  to give advice to mr donald trump how to be a good president a president
[03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:04.360]  i'll make a positive contribution to this transition y'all try not to be good
[03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:09.480]  what are you going to say to him thank you how come to sending
[03:11:12.600 --> 03:11:16.120]  well i think that your question is incorrect
[03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:19.960]  and maybe even implied because mr trump was elected by
[03:11:19.960 --> 03:11:24.840]  american people and this is why we have to pay respect
[03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:28.600]  towards him even if we are not agree with some of
[03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:33.880]  his positions of use inside the country
[03:11:33.880 --> 03:11:38.920]  he's not being respected this is sad this is a negative components of american
[03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:44.120]  political system we can argue but we have to pay respect
[03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:49.880]  even not towards him personally but towards the people who voted for him
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:53.240]  it's the first thing and the second thing i've already mentioned this and i
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:57.160]  think that the u.s president doesn't need any advice
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:03.480]  at all because in order to be elected even without for example an
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:08.520]  administrative experience one should possess a talent and to go
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:13.320]  through all these ordeals and he has done this and he has won
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:17.560]  he has done this honestly
[03:12:17.560 --> 03:12:20.280]  then he goes on to the final clip i'm going to play and then passob is coming
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:22.600]  up trump is unpredictable because inside the
[03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:25.560]  us he's unable to implement any of his plans
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:29.080]  that's partially true but just cutting regulations
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:34.040]  and just calling for tax cuts has brought many of the markets and jobs
[03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:37.480]  back failure on tax cuts really could tank the
[03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:41.400]  markets new york post reports trump tax cuts gains momentum
[03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:45.960]  as rand paul goes all in top republicans are trying to block
[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:49.320]  that basically and only have modest cuts uh they know what they're doing they
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:52.600]  want to consolidate and control but again remember
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:57.080]  everything you heard about trump has now been put back on the other foot
[03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:00.760]  with the democrats and there's a media blockade on this a controlled corporate
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:04.520]  media but they can't hold it very long because we're the real media
[03:13:04.520 --> 03:13:08.280]  you're the real media you have a voice you have an email
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:11.880]  you have a telephone you have a facebook you have a twitter you can visit info
[03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:17.000]  wars you can call c span you can't be stopped and you're not being stopped
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:21.080]  so you're winning to the point they have to admit they openly want to censor us
[03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:25.080]  now putin trump is unpredictable uh here it is
[03:13:25.080 --> 03:13:28.120]  in last october you have to come by the perspective
[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:31.880]  prospects of uh presidential candidate donald trump you said that you're
[03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:36.120]  ready to work with any american president and you don't know
[03:13:36.120 --> 03:13:41.640]  what kind of president mr trump will be and now we have the impression that
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:47.560]  trump is so unpredictable and it seems that with hillary clinton you could
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:51.640]  have had more clear interaction what's your opinion on this
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:55.000]  well you know how we say if you think something
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:58.680]  you have to put a cross on yourself well this just seems
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:03.960]  you better think twice we don't know what would be the reality you know
[03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:08.600]  as for the president of the united states donald trump
[03:14:08.600 --> 03:14:12.120]  i can repeat what i've mentioned one year ago
[03:14:12.120 --> 03:14:15.480]  i said that we will be working and now i said that we are working with the
[03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:18.280]  president elected by the people of the united states
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:25.560]  he's unpredictable because there is a great because
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:29.960]  inside of the country he is not able to implement
[03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:34.280]  any of his plans for example in the health care
[03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:37.960]  there's a great resistance to his activity for example he adopts a
[03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:42.040]  decision about migrants and then the court blocks his
[03:14:42.040 --> 03:14:46.280]  decision and it happens all the time so we cannot say that
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:49.480]  he's unpredictable unpredictable only because of his
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:53.160]  of himself it will be incorrect it happens because of the american
[03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:56.440]  political system will be worth it that's good there's more clips up on

[03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:09.640]  they have been able to manipulate trump into being hardline on russia for no
[03:15:09.640 --> 03:15:13.240]  reason when we should be aligned an ally with russia on so many issues as a
[03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:17.400]  christian nation reforming itself we need to be reformed as well
[03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:21.000]  but by hyping all the fake russia stuff he's been bullied into going along with
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:24.120]  all this once we expose and annihilate clinton's
[03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:27.240]  and the globalists for their crimes with the chinese the russians everybody
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:31.080]  else then we can move forward with the next big human

[03:18:09.640 --> 03:18:12.920]  some wrong think now there's no solid definition of what's considered
[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:16.760]  disinformation other than what the left says but radical democrats would like
[03:18:16.760 --> 03:18:21.080]  to see regulation in the form of pop-ups that would remind a user of libel
[03:18:21.080 --> 03:18:23.880]  laws before they decide to share an article in

[03:20:56.520 --> 03:21:00.440]  of the mainstream media and the false narratives and disinformation
[03:21:00.440 --> 03:21:06.760]  that they perpetuate so this week we've been talking so much and
[03:21:06.760 --> 03:21:10.200]  washington dc internally if not externally
[03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:14.920]  is talking and reeling about the fact that the fbi
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:19.480]  actually investigated the clinton's and the clinton foundation
[03:21:19.480 --> 03:21:26.520]  for their ties 145 million dollar payment from russian
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:31.320]  uh oligarchs to the from putin to the clinton's
[03:21:31.320 --> 03:21:35.640]  now with the new news that's coming out and it is it's incredible because it's
[03:21:35.640 --> 03:21:41.160]  probably the buried lead of the century uh buried lead means when there's a
[03:21:41.160 --> 03:21:45.080]  subject a title on a on an article you see the headline
[03:21:45.080 --> 03:21:48.440]  there it says bill clinton sought state department's permission to meet with
[03:21:48.440 --> 03:21:52.200]  russian nuclear official so you read that headline you
[03:21:52.200 --> 03:21:55.720]  say okay that's interesting he he he saw the state department's permission but
[03:21:55.720 --> 03:21:59.400]  if you scroll way way down into the article and alex has been hitting this
[03:21:59.400 --> 03:22:04.600]  up uh so much today we actually find that bill clinton
[03:22:04.600 --> 03:22:08.360]  instead of meeting with the nuclear officials had a secret
[03:22:08.360 --> 03:22:12.760]  meeting with vladimir putin at his private
[03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:19.640]  home his dacha out there uh in russia so instead of uh this this innocuous
[03:22:19.640 --> 03:22:22.120]  headline that says oh we saw permission to meet with a
[03:22:22.120 --> 03:22:24.600]  with some some officials who had like didn't happen
[03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:28.680]  actually he met with vladimir putin prior to the payment
[03:22:28.680 --> 03:22:35.320]  145 million dollars so that is the sort of thing that we have to do here on the
[03:22:35.320 --> 03:22:40.680]  show is explain to people that the headline and the content
[03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:44.120]  frequently do not match when you are reading mainstream
[03:22:44.120 --> 03:22:49.160]  media articles it is a dissection of these media articles that we have to
[03:22:49.160 --> 03:22:53.160]  we have to do now newsweek i was very surprised that they actually allowed
[03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:56.760]  this headline to run but it did go come out earlier this morning
[03:22:56.760 --> 03:23:00.520]  that newsweek did put up the headline that bill clinton
[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:05.080]  met with putin during this uranium deal similar to how
[03:23:05.080 --> 03:23:08.760]  he met with loretta lynch on the tarmac i'm sure that he and putin simply
[03:23:08.760 --> 03:23:12.680]  talked about grandchildren and uh what was it yoga
[03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:16.920]  yoga planning like yoga and wedding planning like in hillary's emails right
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:21.240]  so after a year and a half of supposed investigation
[03:23:21.240 --> 03:23:27.080]  into donald trump and his ties to putin we actually find that it's already been
[03:23:27.080 --> 03:23:30.200]  known all along that bill clinton met with
[03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:34.920]  vladimir putin and this money came out so one thing that i wanted to do today
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:39.640]  is backtrack a little bit and cover some ground that we've already covered
[03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:43.960]  before and the info wars has done such a great job of covering in the past
[03:23:43.960 --> 03:23:48.040]  but go back and look at it break down this uranium one deal
[03:23:48.040 --> 03:23:52.600]  a little bit more in light of this new information that they were under fbi
[03:23:52.600 --> 03:23:57.480]  investigation seemingly the entire time now i want to go back to the panama
[03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:00.440]  papers the panama papers were released early
[03:24:00.440 --> 03:24:06.040]  2016 it was a leak of massive funding secret accounts in the cayman
[03:24:06.040 --> 03:24:09.800]  islands held by the elites and through those we found
[03:24:09.800 --> 03:24:13.560]  connections from john and tony podesta yes
[03:24:13.560 --> 03:24:21.000]  the podesta group taking money directly from spur bank now spur bank is
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:26.680]  russia's largest bank it is very much tied to the russian state
[03:24:26.680 --> 03:24:32.360]  and in many cases they have been alleged and many cases they've been tied to
[03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:37.720]  russian intelligence specifically the svr which is essentially russia's
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:43.400]  version of the cia spur bank has been noted as a potential
[03:24:43.400 --> 03:24:48.840]  front group for svr operations with their branches throughout the world so
[03:24:48.840 --> 03:24:51.400]  where we see a branch of spur bank people
[03:24:51.400 --> 03:24:57.640]  allege that it may also be a front organization for the svr to run
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:25:01.080]  operations out of clandestine operations to collect intelligence
[03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:04.840]  and we know that russian intelligence is operating throughout the
[03:25:04.840 --> 03:25:07.880]  throughout the west in much the same way that american intelligence
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:11.560]  is operating in russia and many other places so
[03:25:11.560 --> 03:25:15.160]  the money that they took from at the podesta group
[03:25:15.160 --> 03:25:18.200]  while this uranium deal was going on now of course
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:21.560]  john podesta an advisor to president obama
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:24.760]  and the chairman of the hillary clinton campaign
[03:25:24.760 --> 03:25:29.240]  the highest levels of the clinton organization
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:34.040]  and the democrat party are taking millions of dollars
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:37.880]  from the russians they're tied to these russian intelligence actually spur
[03:25:37.880 --> 03:25:41.880]  bank or svr if you go back a little bit into their
[03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:47.640]  history you can actually find accusations of the funding of terrorist acts
[03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:51.160]  and false flags by ukraine in the run-up
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:54.920]  to the ukraine invasion in 2014 the Crimea invasion
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:26:00.040]  the russians are known for being people who potentially invented
[03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:03.800]  the entire concept of false flag attacks during the czarist days
[03:26:03.800 --> 03:26:06.920]  essentially they would commit an attack and they would then blame it on

[03:34:05.560 --> 03:34:09.960]  headlines and we are going to explain the truth of the actual
[03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:17.720]  russia collusion not between donald trump the kremlin did not hack the election
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:21.320]  to change the vote totals in the machines
[03:34:21.320 --> 03:34:25.320]  and trick people into going out into trump rallies
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:30.120]  no that was a ground swell of support of trump voters
[03:34:30.120 --> 03:34:33.480]  and trump enthusiasts who wanted to take back
[03:34:33.480 --> 03:34:41.320]  their country to reject reject the globalist policies of
[03:34:41.320 --> 03:34:45.800]  barack obama and george w bush to get off of that road
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:50.440]  to surf them to an international system and actually regain the sovereignty of
[03:34:50.440 --> 03:34:54.040]  the united states be able to make decisions for ourselves
[03:34:54.040 --> 03:34:57.480]  be able to help the working men and women of this country
[03:34:57.480 --> 03:35:01.480]  to retain our liberties to retain our civil rights
[03:35:01.480 --> 03:35:06.440]  and to maintain our american way of life that is why donald trump
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:11.080]  won the election it is not it is it's simple it's been stated a million times
[03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:13.560]  but the mainstream media refuses to believe it
[03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:17.320]  hillary clinton refuses to believe it as evidenced again and again and again
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:21.480]  in her endless stream of interviews and walks in the woods that she seems to
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:24.840]  keep having uh with with herself where she always
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:28.920]  seems to be found by someone where they can take a picture of her so
[03:35:28.920 --> 03:35:32.920]  funny how that works she's able to find out all these people in the woods
[03:35:32.920 --> 03:35:37.640]  but when it really comes down to is for some reason the mainstream media cares
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:41.640]  more about someone in russia playing pokemon go
[03:35:41.640 --> 03:35:47.960]  with a couple of internet accounts rather than millions of dollars
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:54.600]  and uranium a a a key component in any nuclear program being funneled
[03:35:54.600 --> 03:35:58.440]  through the clinton's money going to the clinton foundation
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:01.800]  and there's uranium deals going from the united states
[03:36:01.800 --> 03:36:05.560]  to russia keep in mind that the united states used to make
[03:36:05.560 --> 03:36:09.640]  huge decisions and actually spend uh so many
[03:36:09.640 --> 03:36:13.480]  man hours of our intelligence community tracking what was going on with
[03:36:13.480 --> 03:36:18.440]  any nuclear related substance any nuclear related material
[03:36:18.440 --> 03:36:22.600]  but in this case the uranium it seems to have gone completely
[03:36:22.600 --> 03:36:25.640]  unnoticed by most of the mainstream media so what we're going to have to do
[03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:28.760]  now is retread a little bit of ground and we're
[03:36:28.760 --> 03:36:33.800]  going to go back to 2012 when john podesta's brother
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:41.080]  tony podesta bagged 180 thousand dollars from
[03:36:41.080 --> 03:36:47.880]  putin's uranium company so three times this organization
[03:36:47.880 --> 03:36:51.400]  known as the podesta group was reached they are a lobbying firm here in
[03:36:51.400 --> 03:36:54.760]  washington dc they were and this actually has to their
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:36:59.720]  credit was reported at least once in the new york times
[03:36:59.720 --> 03:37:04.360]  it was then subsequently dropped apparently as a line of inquiry
[03:37:04.360 --> 03:37:09.080]  they were retained three times by urain the uranium one company which was
[03:37:09.080 --> 03:37:14.920]  purchased by russia to work on their behalf in terms of
[03:37:14.920 --> 03:37:18.840]  this deal so how was it who was it that suggested
[03:37:18.840 --> 03:37:23.320]  that the podesta brothers be the ones who work with the russian uranium
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:27.480]  company who was it that set up that deal and more importantly
[03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:30.440]  why was it these are the basic simple questions
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:35.400]  that any investigative journalist or any starting out intelligence officer
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:39.480]  entry-level intelligence analyst is taught ask the who
[03:37:39.480 --> 03:37:44.040]  what where when and why right the five w's and then how
[03:37:44.040 --> 03:37:47.720]  of any situation and key in terms of all of this
[03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:53.000]  is follow the rubles when it comes to russia you've got to
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:55.960]  follow the rubles right so we're following the rubles as
[03:37:55.960 --> 03:37:59.000]  they trickle out or in this case spill out of
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:03.000]  moscow directly into the pocket of the clinton foundation
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:07.320]  and in this case tony podesta the brother of john podesta the chairman of
[03:38:07.320 --> 03:38:09.640]  hillary clinton's campaign and we're not talking about something
[03:38:09.640 --> 03:38:13.640]  that happened decades ago we're not talking about something that happened
[03:38:13.640 --> 03:38:19.560]  many many years ago 2012 2014 and 2015 while the clintons were getting ready
[03:38:19.560 --> 03:38:26.040]  for the election campaign in 2016 they were accepting money from the russians
[03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:29.880]  the exact same lobbying firm now this was mentioned
[03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:33.560]  in peter schweiger's meticulously drawn out book clinton cash
[03:38:33.560 --> 03:38:37.320]  this was mentioned by by the new york times at least once
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:41.400]  that vladimir putin was attempting to control
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:46.120]  much of the united states uranium supply and much of the united states uranium
[03:38:46.120 --> 03:38:51.320]  supply chain he was able to do so through a series
[03:38:51.320 --> 03:38:55.720]  of of influences a series of deals that were connected
[03:38:55.720 --> 03:38:59.080]  throughout the obama while the obama administration was in power
[03:38:59.080 --> 03:39:03.160]  while eric holder and then loretta lynch had them under
[03:39:03.160 --> 03:39:07.640]  uh different levels of investigation but apparently as usual when the clintons
[03:39:07.640 --> 03:39:12.360]  are under investigation no evidence of wrongdoing is found
[03:39:12.360 --> 03:39:17.400]  no evidence that she had any part in any of this was really coming down so here's
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:20.680]  an article we've got up from forbes is russia gait really
[03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:25.160]  hillary gait and again this was published back in june in 2017
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:29.800]  why will the mainstream media pay so much attention
[03:39:29.800 --> 03:39:35.640]  to uh a facebook group that we've that has has been tied to russia or one
[03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:40.040]  singular twitter account which was tied to russia right they'll pay so much
[03:39:40.040 --> 03:39:44.280]  attention to that but there's 145 million
[03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:48.680]  uh dollars in terms of funding that they refuse to pay attention to
[03:39:48.680 --> 03:39:53.000]  that they refuse to give much ink to they why they would paper this over as
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:56.040]  saying oh well hillary clinton didn't have much to do with it
[03:39:56.040 --> 03:39:59.480]  or she says she wasn't involved so therefore she wasn't
[03:39:59.480 --> 03:40:05.080]  involved and bear this in mind many people on the left and i've talked to
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:08.600]  people here in washington dc i've talked to my sources and i do have sources in
[03:40:08.600 --> 03:40:11.960]  the democrat party in fact i have people that i talked to on a
[03:40:11.960 --> 03:40:14.840]  regular basis in the democrat party and on the left
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:19.000]  because you need to be able to do that to understand what these people are up to
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.960]  and what these people are doing so when i have these conversations
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:25.560]  i'll ask them i say guys what do you think about this this is really makes
[03:40:25.560 --> 03:40:29.000]  sense do you see there being any political
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:33.640]  risk any political uh footfalls here for the democrat party writ large
[03:40:33.640 --> 03:40:36.680]  based on what the clintons were up to and they say they'll say this will look
[03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:40.360]  jack that was just the clintons and if the clintons were
[03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:44.360]  involved in it at least they're not running anymore for office at
[03:40:44.360 --> 03:40:47.240]  least not they're not out there uh we're done with them we don't want
[03:40:47.240 --> 03:40:51.080]  anything to do with them well that's just not true
[03:40:51.080 --> 03:40:54.920]  because of barack obama was president loretta lynch
[03:40:54.920 --> 03:41:00.200]  was uh attorney general eric holder prior to her these are people that were at
[03:41:00.200 --> 03:41:04.120]  the absolute heart of the democrat party these are people who are still rolled
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:07.240]  out barack obama joe biden are brought out for endorsements they're
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:12.360]  brought out for speeches they're brought out for all sorts of um
[03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:16.040]  speaking out on trump every time they want to they are the de facto
[03:41:16.040 --> 03:41:20.440]  heads of the democrat party chairman emeritus if you will as a former president
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:26.360]  so this is completely tied to the democrat party writ large until they start
[03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:29.800]  to bring this out until they call for hearings and if they're going to be
[03:41:29.800 --> 03:41:33.080]  intellectually honest if they're going to be politically
[03:41:33.080 --> 03:41:37.880]  astute then all of the same accusations that they've made against
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:42.120]  donald trump and they've made against trump supporters
[03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:45.800]  adam schiff has been at the head of so much of this uh the house intelligence
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:41:49.000]  committee why is he not calling for hearings on
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:52.680]  uranium one why is he not bringing the pedestal brothers
[03:41:52.680 --> 03:41:56.440]  to testify before the committee to give the public
[03:41:56.440 --> 03:42:02.040]  a direct record why are they letting fusion gps get away with not providing
[03:42:02.040 --> 03:42:07.160]  any information whatsoever on their involvement with the democrats their
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:10.360]  involvement with the dnc the hacking which they covered up which there may
[03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:14.760]  have may not been any hacking whatsoever this is where the democrats
[03:42:14.760 --> 03:42:18.680]  fall into a political footfall because they've set up a russia trap
[03:42:18.680 --> 03:42:22.360]  for themselves one that i would suspect russian intelligence
[03:42:22.360 --> 03:42:27.080]  possibly laid for them that is the state of play today in

[03:50:52.040 --> 03:50:55.800]  hungary this week and we know that hungary and
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:50:59.480]  poland have really been the focus of what
[03:50:59.480 --> 03:51:03.960]  george soros and many of the globalists and the eu have been pushing against and
[03:51:03.960 --> 03:51:09.560]  this is a huge statement hungary fears soros influence in their election
[03:51:09.560 --> 03:51:14.920]  after soros injected 18 billion dollars 18 billion dollars
[03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:20.440]  into his open source uh open border as he called the open society foundation
[03:51:20.440 --> 03:51:24.200]  this organization there there is a member of parliament now this
[03:51:24.200 --> 03:51:27.880]  is not this is not just an activist this is not someone
[03:51:27.880 --> 03:51:31.320]  who is you know saying this on a blog somewhere this is actually a member
[03:51:31.320 --> 03:51:34.280]  of parliament in hungary it's von hollick
[03:51:34.280 --> 03:51:37.720]  fears that soros is going to be using his foundation
[03:51:37.720 --> 03:51:41.720]  to tear down the ruling party in hungary
[03:51:41.720 --> 03:51:46.200]  victor orban to tear down his party to tear down the border fence that they
[03:51:46.200 --> 03:51:49.720]  did set up around hungary and and to implement the
[03:51:49.720 --> 03:51:53.640]  soros plan which they have actually dubbed and this is this is a quote from
[03:51:53.640 --> 03:51:57.880]  them the satanic soros plan to flood
[03:51:57.880 --> 03:52:01.960]  hungary and europe with one million third world
[03:52:01.960 --> 03:52:05.000]  migrants annually this is coming out of the hungarian
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:09.160]  times this is what members of parliament in hungary are saying
[03:52:09.160 --> 03:52:12.680]  this is what soros's plan is they satanic
[03:52:12.680 --> 03:52:17.880]  soros plan for europe now we know that soros has been involved
[03:52:17.880 --> 03:52:21.560]  in elections and other operations funding antifa
[03:52:21.560 --> 03:52:25.000]  funding the resistance here in the united states they are going
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:28.680]  absolutely political in europe they are going for this and soros
[03:52:28.680 --> 03:52:31.800]  specifically has stated on numerous occasions
[03:52:31.800 --> 03:52:36.360]  that national borders are the obstacle it's kind of an oxymoron because
[03:52:36.360 --> 03:52:39.640]  obviously a border should be an obstacle that's actually the definition of the
[03:52:39.640 --> 03:52:41.960]  word mr soros i don't know if you've ever seen a
[03:52:41.960 --> 03:52:47.400]  dictionary in your 87 years but with uh with open borders
[03:52:47.400 --> 03:52:51.400]  he's able then to move these migrants out of
[03:52:51.400 --> 03:52:55.560]  africa out of syria out of different parts of the middle east
[03:52:55.560 --> 03:52:59.800]  and bring them into europe this is the open and admitted
[03:52:59.800 --> 03:53:05.240]  plan of george soros now poland is one country that's taken a stand against
[03:53:05.240 --> 03:53:07.880]  this along with hungary hungary is built
[03:53:07.880 --> 03:53:11.960]  their border wall poland just set up they had a day of prayer
[03:53:11.960 --> 03:53:15.640]  which the bbc called controversial where they actually set up
[03:53:15.640 --> 03:53:19.320]  a human border chain around the entire country
[03:53:19.320 --> 03:53:22.520]  praying for their country praying for peace
[03:53:22.520 --> 03:53:26.760]  as they stood with their borders a massive show of support in their country
[03:53:26.760 --> 03:53:33.080]  and poland is actually going and sending volunteers now this is not official
[03:53:33.080 --> 03:53:36.600]  polis troops but poland is even has volunteer troops
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:41.000]  that are going down into raqqa that are fighting alongside
[03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:44.600]  the syrian defense forces fighting alongside the Kurds they are fighting to
[03:53:44.600 --> 03:53:47.560]  liberate raqqa there's so much that these polis
[03:53:47.560 --> 03:53:51.400]  groups are doing down there so poland is standing strong
[03:53:51.400 --> 03:53:56.200]  at home and abroad there are volunteers of poland going into syria
[03:53:56.200 --> 03:53:59.640]  now there are many american volunteers as well actually that have gone into syria
[03:53:59.640 --> 03:54:03.800]  on their own dime people who are veterans people who are in special forces
[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:06.920]  that have decided to take up arms of their own
[03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:12.280]  outside of u.s military outside of official or even special forces
[03:54:12.280 --> 03:54:16.600]  uh deployments to go to syria because they believe it's the right thing to do
[03:54:16.600 --> 03:54:20.360]  because they want to end the threat of what's going on in syria
[03:54:20.360 --> 03:54:24.680]  to actually end this crisis before it gets worse before these
[03:54:24.680 --> 03:54:28.440]  million migrants a year are able to come so you see
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:35.080]  the syrian conflict goes hand in hand with the migrant crisis
[03:54:35.080 --> 03:54:39.560]  if there's no war in syria if isis isn't fighting to take over syria
[03:54:39.560 --> 03:54:42.600]  and we've seen the massive reductions in land
[03:54:42.600 --> 03:54:46.600]  that they have suffered since donald trump's election since he loosened
[03:54:46.600 --> 03:54:50.600]  the rules of engagement at the dod since he's been able to allow the military to
[03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:54.440]  actually fight isis we've seen this very much in iraq
[03:54:54.440 --> 03:54:59.240]  we're now seeing a ton of it going on in uh in syria in the cut in the capital
[03:54:59.240 --> 03:55:02.520]  so raqqa was essentially the de facto capital
[03:55:02.520 --> 03:55:06.840]  of isis in syria it's it's basically their de facto capital writ large
[03:55:06.840 --> 03:55:10.280]  i haven't had much intel from the ground just yet as to where they've
[03:55:10.280 --> 03:55:14.040]  relocated to because the fall really the fall of raqqa or i should say the
[03:55:14.040 --> 03:55:19.400]  liberation of raqqa in this case only just took place this week isis forces
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:23.560]  have now been able to move on but they are rapidly shrinking
[03:55:23.560 --> 03:55:26.760]  they are put being pushed back on from both ends
[03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:31.160]  the east and the west from syria and iraq they're being pushed basically into
[03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:36.440]  that really um undeveloped deserted area at the
[03:55:36.440 --> 03:55:41.400]  deserted border area between iraq and syria this these major military
[03:55:41.400 --> 03:55:44.600]  operations they've been declared over just two days ago
[03:55:44.600 --> 03:55:50.680]  so many flags going up over over the liberated city of raqqa and it was
[03:55:50.680 --> 03:55:53.480]  make no mistake the mainstream media is going to try to pin all this on trump
[03:55:53.480 --> 03:55:55.800]  they say though well well they had to use the military
[03:55:55.800 --> 03:55:59.160]  to get isis out of there and these these uh military forces
[03:55:59.160 --> 03:56:02.600]  they were they had to conduct so much damage and destruction to the city to
[03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:05.560]  get isis out of there well yeah that's unfortunately
[03:56:05.560 --> 03:56:11.240]  how you have to liberate a city that is why the mainstream media is against
[03:56:11.240 --> 03:56:15.160]  trump there because trump is actually able and willing
[03:56:15.160 --> 03:56:19.400]  to go in and defeat our enemies to make good on his promise to
[03:56:19.400 --> 03:56:24.760]  bomb the hell out of isis quote end quote and actually go take the fight to
[03:56:24.760 --> 03:56:28.360]  them instead of them taking the fight to us and thank god
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:32.120]  there haven't been any wide-scale isis attacks
[03:56:32.120 --> 03:56:37.720]  in the united states since trumps inauguration thank god at least proven
[03:56:37.720 --> 03:56:41.320]  right any wide-scale isis attacks in the united
[03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:45.160]  states since trumps inauguration and i pray to god that it stays the same i
[03:56:45.160 --> 03:56:48.680]  pray that it stays the same forever here in the united states
[03:56:48.680 --> 03:56:52.200]  that we fight our enemies i'm getting married in 16 days here
[03:56:52.200 --> 03:56:55.960]  and i'm going to be raising my family i know alex has his family and so many of
[03:56:55.960 --> 03:57:00.200]  you out in our listening audience have families as well we want safety
[03:57:00.200 --> 03:57:03.560]  for our families for our wives our children
[03:57:03.560 --> 03:57:07.000]  we want safety for our people we want safety for our future
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:10.200]  that is what we want here in america and that is why
[03:57:10.200 --> 03:57:13.960]  donald trump was elected president it was not part of some kremlin scheme
[03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:18.680]  it was not part of some anyone scheme because donald trump's election was the
[03:57:18.680 --> 03:57:22.360]  exact opposite of what so many in the establishment wanted
[03:57:22.360 --> 03:57:25.400]  thanks so much for paying attention thanks so much for tuning in
