[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:22.000 --> 00:38.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:38.000 --> 01:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07.000 --> 01:22.000]  FBI agent William Aldenburg, who served as John Durham's lead investigator, is suing Alex Jones because he is traumatized as a result of things said on the show by former guest of the show, Wolfgang Halbig.
[01:22.000 --> 01:35.000]  Alex Jones and his company, these are very powerful people, and I'm not anybody. So someone like me, you just can't defend yourself, you just have to, at some point you have to accept it.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  He admits that Jones did nothing other than allow a platform for others to lawfully speak.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  How many times did Jones call you?
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  He didn't call me, sir.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  Did you ever see this photograph to 89 on Infowars?
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  I didn't know, sir.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  Do you know whether he ever talked about you on Infowars?
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  I don't know.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  If Halbig appears as a guest on a talk show, does that make him affiliated with the talk show?
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  To me, it does.
[02:08.000 --> 02:17.000]  The judge, who is noticeably the most emotionally charged in the courtroom, is triggered when Jones' attorney, Norm Pattis, pursues the truth.
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  Who are the powerful people that Mr. Jones has affiliated with?
[02:23.000 --> 02:33.000]  I'm sorry?
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  For example, I don't know who a guy named Joe Rogan is. He's a podcaster, a guy named Joe Rogan.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  Joe Rogan harassing you, too?
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  No, not at all. No, I'm just saying, in fact, I can answer the question.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  If he can answer the question, instead he can call off.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  Just one second, gentlemen.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  All right, why don't we...
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  No, I now lost the question because...
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  The question was, was Joe Rogan...
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  I'll withdraw and ask another.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  No, wait a second.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  No, no, that's all right. So why don't we...
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  I guess he doesn't like the answer.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  No.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  All right, so counsel, let's just...
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  Sir, who are the powerful people that Mr. Jones has affiliated with?
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  Well, that was asked and answered. That was Mr. Rogan.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  No, counsel, sidebar.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  Patis questions the political nature of the trial.
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  How 15 people waited over five years until 2018 to file lawsuits on the same day and in the same office.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  But the judge gets noticeably upset because Patis isn't playing along with their kangaroo court
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  and forbids him from mentioning the name Clinton and others.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  Well, if you did the Hillary Clinton, now we did the Megyn Kelly.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  Should we address what's coming next?
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  No.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  Well, I think it might make sense.
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  Judge, I'm not responsible for giving my adversaries a preview of what's to come anymore
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  and apparently they were responsible for telling me what witnesses they were going to call today.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  The plaintiff complains that Alex is going to try and defend himself
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  and admits they have agreed to lie to the jury.
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.000]  But he's injected this idea that Alex Jones was merely questioning when the jury is going to be instructing the court
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  to determine that he intentionally inflicted emotional stress, that he intentionally lied, that he acted with Malice.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  These clowns actually thought that a man who has dedicated his entire life to freedom of speech
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  would stay silent while they destroy him in court with lies meant to attack the First Amendment.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  And if they succeed, then any random federal agent can sue you into oblivion
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  over hurt feelings from the Internet.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  All right, it's Friday live, September 16, 2022.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, wait till what we cover in 60 seconds. Just get ready.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  InfoWars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  And today is do or die time.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  If InfoWars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year, we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever.
[05:15.000 --> 05:22.000]  But if we don't, I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  I've done my work. I've put everything into it. I'm leaving it all in the field.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  But I believe at a gut level, you're going to come through.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  Plus, you're going to get great products that your family already need.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  So don't procrastinate. Show InfoWars. You want us to stay on the air.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com where we got three great products back in stock.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  Vitamin C and zinc, highest quality, super strong back in stock.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  Vitamin D3 and calcium, and of course, DNA Force Plus.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack or 40% off individually.
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  So the great products you already need for your immune system and we need the money to stay on air.
[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  So please take action now. Thank you.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  And just cover it in a very calm way so it really sinks in for everybody.
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  Because I tend to overprepare for the broadcast for the 50 incredible video clips,
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  more than 300 news articles that I have gone over last night and this morning.
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  At least six hours of preparation and then we get up here for a four hour show and it's just like, whoa, where to start?
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  And I have to sit here right before I go on air and go write the headline for the live broadcast and try to decide
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  what is the most critical out of all these concerted, coordinated, admitted attacks.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  And that's the key today. That's the big theme.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  Let's put the live show headline on screen please.
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  This is an emergency broadcast. Every broadcast we do is an emergency.
[07:17.000 --> 07:24.000]  But the emergency is deepening and is accelerating and there's not much time to even mitigate
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  how bad this crash is going to get.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  So if you go to infowars.com, you'll see the live show headline.
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  And it says emergency Friday broadcast.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  And it deals with FedEx.
[07:42.000 --> 07:50.000]  And FedEx is seen as an absolutely key indicator
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  of what's happening not just here but in the world economy.
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  Now FedEx is telling the world what I've told you in the last month
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  because I know people in industry, not just conservatives, not just nationalists.
[08:07.000 --> 08:13.000]  I know people in a lot of areas of infrastructure.
[08:13.000 --> 08:21.000]  And basically the economy is flatlining.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  And this has all been done by design.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  So here are some of the headlines.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  Massive FedEx shares plunge.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  The Dow Jones and every other industry is way down right now.
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  FedEx shares plunge by 70% after company says it's going to get worse.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  We're going into a worldwide recession.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  FedEx CEO warns numbers don't pretend very well.
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.000]  A stunned Wall Street reacts to FedEx's biggest plunge ever.
[08:55.000 --> 09:04.000]  Futures crater as FedEx ushers in the global recession on 3.2 trillion triple which day.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  Those are market terms.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  IMF chief harsh winner may spark social unrest in EU.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  I'm at energy crisis.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  And it goes on from there.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  We'll be covering this all coming up at the bottom of the hour in great detail.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  But this is a design collapse we specifically told you two and a half years ago
[09:24.000 --> 09:38.000]  that the lockdowns were meant to completely destroy the world infrastructure.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  But this is a designed operation.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  The technocrats flip the switches to do this while telling you there's no inflation or there's no recession.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  This is not a recession.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  This is depression with high inflation stagflation.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  And so I tell the audience that because you need to get ready.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  Look, I know the audience already knows that.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  We can see the numbers.
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.000]  We know what's happening.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  The audience is exploded in the last six months.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  Revenue has gone way down to funder operation.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  So I can see that myself.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Then I can talk to every other major talk show host out there.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  The biggest and they're getting the same numbers.
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  The biggest down to of the top 10 podcasters. I know four of them.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  I've talked to them all the last two weeks at dinner with a couple of them.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  And they're seeing the same thing we're seeing.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  So I mean, I told you, I said, it's in freefall.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  And now it's here.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  They cannot ignore this.
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  They cannot hide this.
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.000]  It is just incredibly, incredibly important.
[10:57.000 --> 11:10.000]  Now that said, now Harvard has come out with a study confirming what the British Medical Journal already said two weeks ago,
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  that you have a 90 plus percent chance of dying or getting sick or being hospitalized.
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  If you've had these shots, what a scandal of scandals, the mother of all scandals.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  And it's not even a blip on the radar screen.
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  And if you try to post this information on Facebook or other places, you get censored.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  That's all coming up.
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  And that ties in to these three stacks that I've got right here.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  But again, one of these three stacks, we can do the whole show on incredible.
[11:46.000 --> 11:56.000]  Biden had a summit with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL and Big Tech yesterday declaring war on free speech,
[11:56.000 --> 12:05.000]  calling all their opposition Nazis and defining white supremacism as questioning elections, open borders or lockdowns,
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  which they've been doing for a year and a half.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  But now it's official.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  I mean, the magnitude of this.
[12:13.000 --> 12:26.000]  Meanwhile, they had hearings in the Senate where the corporate representative of Facebook admitted to live time coordination with the Democratic Party in the White House,
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  censoring anybody that questions the official COVID narrative or other narratives.
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  Now, we already knew that, but that's completely and totally illegal.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  But they just admit it.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  That's coming up as well this hour.
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.000]  And then we've got the chink in their armor pointing out their hypocrisy.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  And it's incredible as well.
[12:53.000 --> 13:03.000]  All DeSantis did was ship 100 illegal aliens out of Florida by plane to most elite area on the East Coast,
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  Virginia where all these globalists live and the left started bitching and whining and complaining and this is a crisis.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  This is terrible.
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.000]  We're not a border town.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  We're not Texas.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  We're not California.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  We don't want these people here.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  They've already bust them out.
[13:19.000 --> 13:28.000]  And we've got the footage in front of the Naval Observatory where Kamala Harris that cackling witch lives with their fence.
[13:28.000 --> 13:35.000]  They get back from the fence and carting the illegals off that Governor Abbott dumped off in front.
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.000]  Now, they may think they can get rid of 100 people a day, but if Texas and Florida start shipping 1,000 a day,
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  which is very easy in their budget, it's game over, folks.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  You have to put pressure on the globalist in a nonviolent way.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  You have to give them their own medicine.
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  You have to expose them and get in their face legally and lawfully everywhere and they'll go away.
[13:57.000 --> 14:04.000]  But as long as they can pull the strings and run their operations and we sit here like a bunch of idiots putting up with it, they're going to win.
[14:04.000 --> 14:13.000]  That said, we're going to go to break and come back with all this news, the military news, the economy news and so much more and how to mitigate this.
[14:13.000 --> 14:21.000]  But I just want listeners to understand that info wars is literally at a critical juncture and so are you.
[14:21.000 --> 14:30.000]  And I want to commend and thank everyone that has supported us over the years by prayer, by word of mouth, by financial support at infowars.com and supporting our sponsors.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  And all the work we've done over the years is now very pregnant, nine months pregnant with the work that's really about to be done.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  We're about to hit the most important phase of our operation.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  That means you, you are this operation.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  You are the tip of the spear and I salute you and I thank you.
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.000]  And I know there are countless people that have supported us and bought great products that enrich your life at infowars.com.
[14:50.000 --> 15:04.000]  But we need the vast majority of you that sit on the fence that have never gone to infowars.com and never gotten a t-shirt or a book or a film or DNA Force Plus or vitamin C with zinc or the vitamin D3 gummies with calcium.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  So critical going into this fall and winter with the things that are going on for your immune system.
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.000]  50% off as a combo immunity supercharger or individually 40% off infowars.com.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  It's a decision you have to make.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  Has info wars fought for liberty? Has info wars nine times out of 10 broke the big story first?
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  Have we been the tip of the spear? Have we hit the barbed wire? The answer is absolutely.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  If you want to keep this dog in the fight, I need your support now.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  Contrate all the fake national headlines I'm swimming and money on my children. That's not true.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  We are very close to being crippled or imploding.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  So now is the time for the cavalry. You are the cavalry.
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  If you want to help progress today, go to infowars.com right now and get the immune boosting combo.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  Go to 1776coin.com. Get the limited edition man the arena, Teddy Roosevelt coin.
[15:54.000 --> 16:17.000]  Stay with us and I think of your support.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  All three do different things.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  Brain force plus is a long term acting clean.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  Neutropic thing creates incredible clarity but doesn't last very long.
[16:45.000 --> 16:52.000]  They're all three different formulas and finally back in stock massively discounted brain force ultra is available
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  Brain force ultra back in stock infowarstore.com.
[16:59.000 --> 17:05.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year and I believe the most powerful.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  The man in the arena coin Teddy Roosevelt.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  Citizen of a republic. The man in the arena.
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence in the world. It will never be made again.
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.000]  It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against the globalist.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren. This is something you want to own.
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very quickly.
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to patriotcollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the info war.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  Man in the arena coin Teddy Roosevelt, 1776coin.com.
[17:59.000 --> 18:06.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  Fortune and Money magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[18:15.000 --> 18:21.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show.
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  You wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com.
[18:47.000 --> 19:07.000]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285. 833-904-285.
[19:33.000 --> 19:40.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[19:44.000 --> 19:53.000]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[19:53.000 --> 20:18.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[20:23.000 --> 20:31.000]  It's a new type of warfare. It's an old system, siege, and psychological warfare, economic war,
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  but it's being done at levels never before seen.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  It is the megacorporations of the world waging war against prosperity,
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  against the individuals, against small businesses.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Emergency Friday broadcast.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  FedEx confirms global economy in freefall.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  Tune in and learn how to stop the great reset before it's too late.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  And it's already too late to stop how bad it's going to be,
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  but it's not too late to bring the globalists that are orchestrating and engineering all of this to justice,
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  because if they get the blame for what they've engineered, they're going to go to prison,
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.000]  and their future operations to totally depopulate us once the collapse takes place will be stopped.
[21:13.000 --> 21:21.000]  So this is absolutely life-saving, critical, most important information in the world right now.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  It's why this broadcast still being on air keeps the New World Order,
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  people like Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and King Charles awake at night.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  And that's not a boast. They attack us.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  They spend their time and energy trying to shut us down.
[21:36.000 --> 21:42.000]  They have emergency summits at the White House yesterday calling us white supremacists,
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  because we're willing to stand up and fight them.
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  We're willing to expose them.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  We're willing to be true to humanity and to God and our families and our children.
[21:51.000 --> 22:01.000]  So I cannot stress to you enough what FedEx means, as I've been telling you the last few months.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  There are so many issues happening, but they train people for several years not to work,
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  so a lot of employees don't want to work hard or don't come to work.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  You have supply chain break now.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  You have massive crime exploding.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  And you had all these trillions of dollars of stimulus money
[22:18.000 --> 22:25.000]  that basically used up any of the backup supplies in the economy in the last two and a half years
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  while the raw materials and the infrastructure itself was being destroyed.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  And the real grassroots economy was being burned to the ground.
[22:34.000 --> 22:42.000]  And so when FedEx announces that, hey, we're seeing record low shipments, record low business,
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  that's the real indicator.
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  So with all the inflation, there being such a huge problem, on top of that,
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  you're not supposed to have massive inflation while you have an imploding economy.
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  They didn't believe that could happen till the 7th.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  It's just called stagflation.
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.000]  And so this is completely artificial, as Klaus Schwab and them said.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  How did I know two and a half years ago it would cause a worldwide depression?
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  How did I know it would destroy the supply chains?
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  How did I know it would cause mass starvation?
[23:08.000 --> 23:14.000]  Because they brag about it and then out of the angry world that he talks about,
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  where more than half your income spent on food and energy,
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  wants any country, doesn't matter if they're black people or brown people or white people,
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.000]  any country where the majority of the population spends half their paycheck
[23:28.000 --> 23:36.000]  or their money they get on food and energy, you get explosions, you get revolutions.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  And then you've got the corporate media trying to steer that into a leftist revolution
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  of debt forgiveness and universal basic incomes and the straight jacket, the chains going on,
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  where as you see populists getting elected saying, no, let's stop the new world order,
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  that's actually the long-term solution and answer.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  But the general public likes a quick, easy one.
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  Two and a half years of stimulus money and getting paid to stay home and all this stuff
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  destroys the real economy and then they want to have a bunch of fear and a bunch of panicking
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  and then the leftist politicians run by the IMF and World Bank, their front group,
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  the World Economic Forum, will then propose a solution which they're already proposing everywhere.
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  More money being handed out, more bailouts, more garbage to themselves,
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  and then maybe 10% gets down to the general public.
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  This is an economic warfare takeover.
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  This is worldwide war. We've got videos pouring in out of Ukraine of what I already know
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  because I know some of the guys that are over there.
[24:39.000 --> 24:45.000]  U.S. Special Forces, U.S. Army Special Forces predominantly, Navy SEALs, you name it,
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  leading Ukrainians in this offensive attacking the Russians.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  The U.S. is at war with Russia and that's just icing on the cake
[24:55.000 --> 25:03.000]  with how reckless and dangerous and out of control this is U.S. troops
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  removing mines on the Russian-held area so that Ukrainian armor can go in.
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  And they've got any tank weapons, they've got any aircraft weapons,
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  strapped to their backs and they are there killing Russians.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  A lot of folks go, whoa, whoa, yeah, great, kick their ass.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  This is only going to escalate, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:27.000 --> 25:38.000]  And so we're going into a worldwide recession FedEx CEO warns numbers don't pretend well.
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.000]  A stunned Wall Street reacts to FedEx's biggest plunge ever.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  This is ushering in the global collapse.
[25:51.000 --> 25:58.000]  Massive inflation while there's no goods and services and things are running out.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  You probably noticed eggs are smaller.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Bacon packages are smaller.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  You probably noticed everything's not as quality as it used to be,
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  but you pay twice or three times more.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  That's just the beginning.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  Wait till it all runs out, which is already doing in Europe and Africa
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  and the Middle East and Asia.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  And what comes out of this, what do governments do once their public turns against them?
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  What do they always do?
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  They start a big, fat war.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  And the globalist already started that by pushing troops in and pushing up to the Russian border
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  and wiping out Russian troops that have been in a proxy war with NATO in the United States
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  for eight years in Ukraine, almost nine years now.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  Whether you like the war, hate the war, whether you're for, quote, NATO or the Russians,
[26:43.000 --> 26:54.000]  this is hurting everybody and it's causing a worldwide acceleration of the financial collapse.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000]  So what do we do about this?
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  Our hope doesn't just lie with populist and conservatives and Christians,
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  though that's the main hope, being vocal, standing up, speaking out,
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  good governors telling the truth like the Santas and others,
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  good members of Congress raising these issues, pointing it out.
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  But it's also with people that serve the system.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  If you work for Big Tech or you work for any other establishment group,
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  you really think you're being patted on the head and organized to do these things
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  you're part of, the surveillance, the censorship, the control.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  You really think you're doing all of that and somehow you're getting ahead.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  You will be destroyed in the future by your masters.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  You will be unemployed.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  You will be thrown to the side.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  You will, in many cases, starve to death and you'll look back on this moment and wish
[27:42.000 --> 27:49.000]  that you hadn't thrown away your birthright and hadn't thrown away the social safety net
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  and the social contract that was there.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  So I've talked about the economy.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  I've got more on that coming up.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  I'm going to set that aside.
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.000]  But the big issue is the official announcement of the power structure
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  trying to outlaw their political opposition.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  I told you this a year and a half ago in June or more than a year and a half ago
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.000]  when Biden put out the National Directive on Terrorism saying it's not MS-13,
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  it's not al-Qaeda, it's conservatives.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  It's the American people.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  And he listed the things that are terrorist.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Open borders don't like that, question elections, question lockdowns,
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  question force injections, you're a terrorist.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  They said white supremacism is the main threat and white supremacists do this.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  They'll probably say white supremacists don't like inflation next.
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  And then he had a big summit yesterday and all the surrogates are out there saying
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  it's imminent the right wing is going to start shooting and killing people and bombing things.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  Now obviously that means they're going to do it and blame us.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  So it's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  It's all going on right now.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  This is the war for the world.
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  This is the great reset and only knowledge of the enemy can stop them.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  The best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  written by Alex Jones.
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  But the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.000]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  and got a million people killed.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  So they lied about his book.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  The historic book that lays out the plans of the Great Reset Death Star
[29:34.000 --> 29:40.000]  and exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.000]  Get your copy now at Amazon.com to keep the book at number one
[29:45.000 --> 29:50.000]  and InfowarsStore.com to help keep Infowars on the air.
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.000]  Now, number one in the world.
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  Ultimate Fish Oil is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  What does ultimate mean?

[30:09.000 --> 30:15.000]  What this concentrated anchovy oil, pure arctic krill oil
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  and high quality wild caught salmon oil does for your brain,
[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  your heart, your cardiovascular system and for your entire body's functions
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.000]  is insane.
[30:25.000 --> 30:30.000]  Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  This is the highest grade and it's not been pasteurized.

[31:03.000 --> 31:08.000]  for your cardiovascular system, for your brain, for every part of your body.
[31:08.000 --> 31:16.000]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[31:16.000 --> 31:17.000]  It certainly does for me.
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed,
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[31:23.000 --> 31:29.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.

[33:26.000 --> 33:31.000]  Well, Kyrie Irving, famous basketball player, is in hot water.
[33:31.000 --> 33:35.000]  He dared put out a 20-year-old clip that's gotten literally tens of millions of years
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  in the last few months, certainly laying around the Internet,
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  where in a minute and a half I predict the exact future.
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  But I didn't predict it.
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  I had the enemy battle plan.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  I was actually reading books by Zabrinsky, by the New World Order,
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  That's why I know all this.
[33:50.000 --> 33:51.000]  It's why I'm so dangerous.
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  You learn about it, you're dangerous to tyranny as well.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  It's like a rattlesnake bite you, they give you the antivenom, you don't get sick.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  This is not rocket science, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.000]  I just so happened to get interested in this as a child because I had family that was aware of it.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  Extremely aware of it.
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  Because they'd been recruited by it, but got out of it.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  And not everybody that does that lives.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  So I'm going to leave it at that.
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  So this is 100% real, as real as a heart attack, as real as cancer.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  And people are going to figure that out now and mitigate the situation or later.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  So we've got that viral clip coming up at the start of the hour that he put out.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  There's actually like a three-minute one that's even better,
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  but the one that gets all the attention's about a minute and a half long.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  When I say tens of millions of years, I mean tens of billions of years.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  Because they keep taking it down as fast as they put it up, so you'll see it.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  One day with two million views, it's gone.
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  With one million views, it's gone.
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  Three million views, it's gone.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  Half a million views, it's gone.
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  Four million views, it's gone.
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  And people just re-upload it faster than they can take it down.
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  Yeah, that's the raw clip.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  The guys found the raw clip.
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  What I want is the one that Irving put out, because they added a bunch of graphics and things to it.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  Yeah, it's got to be about a minute and a half long,
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  because most of the versions I see everybody getting are like little bit short ones.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  So yeah, that's all coming up.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  So, why do I raise that?
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  Because if the public gets this and we're inches away, it's game over.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  I mean, this is the purposeful cutting off of the energy, imploding of the borders,
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  shipping and fentanyl, promoting pedophilia, promoting the collapse of civilization.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  This is official.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  I'm going to play a clip with a prominent emomb who made a great point.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  What he's saying is true about what the globalists feed us through their social filters
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  and what China feeds us through their social filters versus what they feed themselves.
[35:53.000 --> 36:01.000]  Putin and China feed the exact same opposite of the messages we get here,
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  working with big tech, particularly China.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  They promote family and strength and being professional and being serious.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  Here, it's how to act like a fool and be a moron by design to literally take you out of the game.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's your lackadaisical, decadent slob that could be taken down.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  And for those of us that aren't in a coma, well, we're being declared terrorist.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  Well, that's quite the elephant to eat.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  Good luck, New World Order.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  Your death by a thousand cuts is only waking us up.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  I want to air this incredible clip by a hero, Tucker Carlson, last night,
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  where he's the only person in mainstream dominant media with the number one show
[36:45.000 --> 36:51.000]  in the United States, probably the world, tens of millions of viewers,
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  saying the quiet part out loud that the government is declaring you a terrorist,
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  the government is openly organizing it and openly trying to outlaw its political opposition.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  How many times you heard me say that?
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  Probably about 2,000 times the last couple years.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Every day.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  I can show you lots of interesting clips and oh, look at this plane crashing
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  or look at this monkey driving a car or whatever or this dog driving a car.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  Oh, look at this giant squid attack a ship.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  That's all really interesting.
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  And believe me, I'd rather be focused on that or what's going on with the Dallas Cowboys.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  I'd love to be sitting there eating nachos and drinking beer at a Dallas Cowboys game next Sunday,
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  but I'll be here fighting because there's no damn future if we don't do it.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  You don't think I don't like hot dogs and nachos and cold beer?
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  I'll drink your ass under the table.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  The point is we can't be screwing around, folks.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  This isn't a game.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  Here's Tucker Carlson knocking out of the park with the criminal government declaring war on us.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Man, things are moving fast.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  So much is going on as we often say that it's very easy to lose track of the big things,
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  the things that matter, the things that will define history and the lives of our children and grandchildren.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  But Joe Biden's now famous blood-red speech of September 1st certainly qualifies as one of the big things.
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  In that speech, Biden announced that not only is his program the best for this country,
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  that's conventional.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  Presidents always say that.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  Biden told us that going forward, his program is the only program allowed in this country.
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  Competing programs are not allowed anymore.
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  They're illegitimate.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  In fact, they're dangerous, Biden said.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  They're a threat to the republic itself.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  With an election just months away, Joe Biden declared that his political opponents are enemies of the state.
[38:31.000 --> 38:39.000]  They're terrorists, in fact, comparable as his vice president later explained to NBC News to Al Qaeda on 9-11.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  Now, Biden Harris said this.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  They didn't say it in private, grousing bitterly to aides in the Oval Office looking at their declining poll numbers.
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  They said it in public on television and they didn't even flinch as they did.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  So you have to think about the implications of this.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  The United States is a two-party political system has for our whole lifetimes.
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.000]  If the leader of one party, who happens to be the president, redefines the other party,
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  not as a political party, but as a criminal organization, what is he doing?
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  Well, of course, he is demanding a one-party state.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  And that's what Biden is doing and he's using federal law enforcement to make it happen.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  So the question is, how is he getting away with it?
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  And he's getting away with it by changing the terms.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  You can't just say openly, I want one party state with me at the head.
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  No, you have to make the other side unacceptable.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  So when Biden talks about Trump voters, he doesn't talk about voters or Americans.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  He describes an insurgency.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  He implies an armed rebellion, not unlike the Confederate army.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  Trump voters, Biden tells us, aren't just wrong.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  They tried to overthrow the U.S. government and you can't debate people like that.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  You have to crush them.
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  Democratic leaders across the board appear to believe this.
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  Tim Ryan, who's running for the Senate as a Democrat from Ohio just yesterday,
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  told Morning Joe and MSNBC, quote, we've got to kill and confront that movement,
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  not defeat it, kill it.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  That's how dangerous populist Republicans are according to the Biden White House.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  This is the language of totalitarianism.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  It's very obvious.
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  And in a functioning system that wanted to remain democratic, people in power would push back against it.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  The media, business, any responsible person would say, no, you can't do that.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  That's too much power.
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  We can't vest all the power in one political party.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  That's the road to something awful.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  But no one's pushing back.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  In fact, daily, the media reinforced the message.
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  Daily, the media remind us that anyone who has questions about the outcome of the last election
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  isn't a disgruntled voter, that person's a criminal.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  That person has embraced the big lie.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  You see it in every news story, the big lie.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  People like that are irrational and dangerous, and they will be punished and rightly so.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  And now they are being punished.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  Yesterday afternoon, FBI agents apprehended a man called Mike Lindell
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  at a Hardee's drive-through in Minnesota, and they seized his personal cell phone,
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  the one he does business on.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Mike Lindell is not a wanted criminal.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  He's not even a public official.
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.000]  Mike Lindell, as you likely know, sells pillows, especially on this channel.
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  So why would the FBI, armed FBI agents, be apprehending Mike Lindell?
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  Because he questioned the outcome of the last election.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  He participated in the big lie.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  He's a threat to the system.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  That is the consensus view in Washington now.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  This is a very big change.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  In a free society, by definition, all questions are allowed.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  You can't have a democracy unless you are allowed to discuss its mechanics.
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  Free speech is a prerequisite for a democratic system, obviously.
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  And until very recently, everyone in America unquestioningly understood that
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  dissent was not a crime, it was a patriotic act.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  And people committed it at scale, especially Democrats.
[41:53.000 --> 41:59.000]  For years after the 2000 election, Democrats claimed that George W. Bush was not the legitimate president.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  Some still say it. They may believe it.
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.000]  And then in 2016, the entire Democratic Party rejected the outcome of the presidential election.
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  A foreign power got Donald Trump elected.
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.000]  Democrats said that, and they continued to say it every single day of Donald Trump's term.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  They impeached him over it.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  They hamstrung the executive branch of the U.S. government with an investigation into Russian influence,
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  and in the end turned up nothing.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  What would you call that?
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  You would call that election denial. You would call that the big lie.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  But no one was punished for it.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  No judge removed Adam Schiff from office for doubting the election results.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  The FBI didn't raid CNN's biggest advertisers.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  Everyone just moved on.
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  You may have hated the Russia hoax, and we certainly did.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  But there was never any question that all American citizens have an absolute,
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  constitutionally protected right to question election outcomes.
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.000]  America is occupied by globalist forces.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  Info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  And today is do or die time.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  If info wars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year,
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever.
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  But if we don't, I respect your decision,
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  I've done my work. I've put everything into it.
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.000]  I'm leaving it all in the field.
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  But I believe at a gut level, you're going to come through.
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  Plus, you're going to get great products that your family already need.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  So don't procrastinate.
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  Show info wars.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  You want us to stay on the air.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  Go to infowarstore.com where you got three great products back in stock.
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  Vitamin C and zinc, highest quality, super strong back in stock.
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  Vitamin D3 and calcium, and of course, DNA Force Plus.
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack,
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  or 40% off individually.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  So the great products you already need for your immune system,
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  and we need the money to stay on air.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  So please take action now. Thank you.
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.000]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  They financed major universities.
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.000]  They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  at the New York Times, other major newspapers.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  That the family, as we know it, is a bad thing and must be ended.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter,
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.000]  my four natural daughter.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times.
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  But I like to make it as well.
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.000]  I love to make breakfast.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family
[44:39.000 --> 44:44.000]  and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding,
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  They really are.
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  Sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  and turn us into lab rats.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  We cannot let this continue.
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.000]  in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come.
[45:08.000 --> 45:13.000]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.000]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  and building our own society.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[45:37.000 --> 45:44.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  to keep us strong and at the ready.

[46:09.000 --> 46:15.000]  What this concentrated anchovy oil, pure Arctic krill oil
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  and high quality wild caught salmon oil does for your brain, your heart,
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.000]  your cardiovascular system and for your entire body's functions is insane.
[46:25.000 --> 46:31.000]  Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  This is the highest grade and it's not been pasteurized, it's not been boiled,
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  so it has its original effects intact.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit infowarstore.com today
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  and get ultimate fish oil finally back in stock for 50% off.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  For our regular fans and our big supporters, you're going to love it.
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  You already know how great it is.
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  But for folks that have been on the fence, experience ultimate fish oil for yourself.
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  Try taking some before bedtime and see what happens with your dreams.
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Welcome back to the tip of the spear.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, very honored to have you here.
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  Next hour is going to be particularly important and believe me,
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  I've got a lot to cover and I like to talk,
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  but I've got to play the whole seven minute exchange with Josh Hawley,
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  Senator Josh Hawley and the spokesperson,
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  the corporate rep in hearings yesterday on tech censorship.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  I mean, it is the smoking gun of criminal activity and they just hide it in blame view
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  just like Mark Zuckerberg did three weeks ago with Joe Rogan.
[48:14.000 --> 48:21.000]  And then another Senator Ron Johnson in a shorter clip nails their ass
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  because they are suppressing that the vaccines are killing people,
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  they're suppressing all the real treatments.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  So they were putting lies out while suppressing the truth,
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  all part of a coordinated plan and they have the emails.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  This should be the top story in the country.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  But it's not, that's coming up next hour.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  But let's look at the other piece of the equation.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  Big tech boost censorship after Biden's speech in FullWars.com as the report.
[48:50.000 --> 48:56.000]  Less than 24 hours after Biden asked Congress to end social media immunity at White House Summit
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  due to hate, fueled violence.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  So big tech is following orders in live time responding in 30, 40 seconds.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  You'll see that in testimony.
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  You direct orders by the Biden White House to take anybody they want off,
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  pay anybody they want in live time.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  The government with corporations saying silence this person, ban this person,
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  totally illegal, and then they come back and say,
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  well, we're still going to take you over.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  You've done a good enough job.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  You didn't jump high enough when we said so.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  Meanwhile, FBI agent, we have more people assigned to investigate white supremacist
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  than there are actual white supremacists in the United States.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  It's almost nonexistent.
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  That's all coming up.
[49:38.000 --> 49:44.000]  I mean, this is so huge because they're doing all this ahead of whatever it is they're about to stage,
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  try to outlaw their political opposition.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  That's part of what we're hitting next hour.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  And listen, I'm just going to say this now.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  It's a real opportunity for everybody on so many fronts.
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  Supporting this broadcast is an incredible opportunity
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  because you look at the incredible work we've done together.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  It's changed the world.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  And when you fund this place, you're just as important as I am.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  Plus, you get incredible products.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  So I'm not going to belabor this.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  I'm not going to bitch and complain.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  A lot of our products have finally come back into stock.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  We put everything we had into buying these products to get them in.
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.000]  And then FedEx comes out and tells you what I told you a month ago.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  The real economy's flatlining.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  So I know people run out of money.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  I know the economy's dead.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  I know they're a great reset and their lockdowns was designed to trigger this.
[50:29.000 --> 50:37.000]  But you must absolutely look in your life and decide what is most critical.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  Taking care of yourself, your family, getting right with God,
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  speaking out, saying no to the new world order,
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  because it only gets worse the more we submit,
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  being engaged, and keeping the tip of the spear on the ear.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  So you see all these cherry-picked things and these fake show trials
[50:53.000 --> 50:58.000]  and all these fake headlines that I've got $100 million or $50 million or $500 million.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  It's all lies.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  It's all crap.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  It's all absolute BS.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  They'll go, oh, look, one day two years ago,
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.000]  they sold $800,000 worth of food
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  because we would sell the food in bunches
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  and then that order would go through at one time
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  when we had them drop ship it and then that would show up in our account.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  Then we made 30% on it.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  But the point is, it's okay to make money.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  I wish I had a billion dollars to fight these people,
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  but we don't have it.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  We barely have enough to make payroll.
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  We barely have enough in the Chapter 5 bankruptcy to be solvent,
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  which is in the next six weeks going to be decided.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.000]  So we need to go strong into these hearings, not on empty.
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  So it is the most critical time in info wars history for you to support the broadcast.
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  It's your decision.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  I'm not complaining.
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  If God doesn't move you to do it or you think it's not important, then don't.
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  But if you do think it's important, take action.
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  And it's not like you're betting on a horse that doesn't win these damn races
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  because you are the horse, I'm the horse too.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  You are the info war.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  Number one book in the world.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  Number one beating Stephen King's new release, all of them.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  And yeah, the next few months, we'll get a few million dollars off of this.
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  Great.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  I'm going to dump it into this operation
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  because the ban with the loan will cost that the next few months and all the expenses.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  But yeah, there's a lot of good stuff coming in the future, but it ain't here yet.
[52:11.000 --> 52:18.000]  So get your unsigned or signed, which is a fundraiser of the great reset in the war for the world.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  I want to thank all of you that have at infowarstored.com.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  I want to thank those of you that are going to take action now
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  and go to infowarstored.com and get the signed or unsigned copy.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  The signed is, again, a fundraiser.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  We need the support.
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.000]  And I need you to also realize that we have the fourth coin,
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  the man in the arena, Teddy Roosevelt coin.
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.000]  The first three coins are founding member coins.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  You get discounts on products.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  You get all sorts of...
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  We're going to launch a bunch of new stuff very, very soon.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  You'll get exclusive free access to it.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  Films, special shows, events.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  Finally, all the stuff that's six months behind is about to launch very, very soon.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  It's almost done.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  But I'm fighting hard.
[52:57.000 --> 53:03.000]  Get the Teddy Roosevelt coin at 1776coin.com or patrickcollectibles.com.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  But whatever you do, take action.
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  And then separately, all of these products, in some cases, sold out for a year,
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  like green fiber, strongest, highest quality, green fiber for your body,
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  healthy immune system, everything, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  Vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better uploading your body,
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  total immune system support, and so much more.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  It's 50% off when you get it in the combo deal or 40% off by itself.
[53:32.000 --> 53:39.000]  The combo deal is DNA Force Plus, vitamin C and zinc with rose hips.
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  All three of these are 50% off together or 40% off individually.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  And I'm not going to spend time on this.
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  This is the Linus Pauling formula he won the Nobel Prize for.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  It's the dose he said, and it's what he said to have it with,
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  so it's uploaded into the body.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  It is over 1,000% what you need of vitamin C, and it's the organic, high quality type.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  You want to be safe and healthy and want to be strong this fall and winter.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  Fortify yourself now.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  This is the trifecta pack.
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  You need the immune system, turbo charge special.
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  50% off, also back in stock.
[54:17.000 --> 54:22.000]  Diet Force, natural compounds that speed up your metabolism to lose weight.
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  I'm still overweight, but my wife's like, my God, I'm standing straight up.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  I don't look fat.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  I got a big torso, so I look fat when I'm sitting down because I got a big chest.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  I got a 52 inch chest and everything.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  But I'm standing up naked, coming out of the shower, and I was like, damn,
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  we look like a gorilla.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  But the point is I've lost 44 pounds with this.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  It finally came back into stock.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  DietForceInforce.com, 40% off.
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  Brainforce Ultra, Brainforce Plus back in stock, all discounted.
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  Just go to the site.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  You need the products.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  I know we're in a depression.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  I knew this was all coming.
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  I've been thinking for years, how am I to fund our operation when this is going down?
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  Well, we got a few tricks up our sleeves very, very soon.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  But in the meantime, the next six weeks, it is beyond critical that you go to
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  infowarstore.com today.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  It's not like we're just some talk show exposing this stuff and having a little effect.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  We are, and I never, I mean, I'm very humbled by this.
[55:17.000 --> 55:23.000]  We are literally like kryptonite to Superman, but kryptonite to the New World Order.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  We're like garlic in high noon to vampires.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  I mean, this, for whatever reason, God blessed this whole operation and sent you to us and
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  sent me to you, but it's been incredible.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  So just don't wait.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  I need to see funds coming in, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  Look, I got $80,000 from the first month of sales in royalties in two days ago.
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.000]  And I said, I'm going to donate all of that into info wars.
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  And my accountant came back and said, you know, courts ruled, bankruptcy courts ruled,
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  you got to pay for your own security, your own trip, and your own legal.
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  You need money, Alex.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  And I said, okay, give me $20,000 of that.
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  That's going right to legal bills.
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.000]  And look, I'm just saying I'm all in, but $60,000, $80,000, boom, from national sales,
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  the book is in.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  And I'm told another $80,000 will come in next month or $90,000 or $100,000.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  That's great.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  This is a war.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  I lost a lot of money to do this.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  You want somebody to stand up?
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  You want somebody to take action?
[56:16.000 --> 56:24.000]  I don't want to spend all day up here fundraising, but I will do it because I don't want to shut down.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  I will never give up.
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  I will never give in.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  You put a gun to my head.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  They basically have.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  They told me and they don't even care we talk about it.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  They said, come out against the second amendment a year ago and then again six months ago,
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  then again two months ago, come out against the second amendment and we'll drop all these
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  lawsuits and all this against you.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  Burn in hell.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  I will never do that.
[56:48.000 --> 56:55.000]  But then it makes me so angry that they could still win if you don't realize how critical this is.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.000]  I want to see a million dollars under today because we're almost in the red again.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  Damn it.
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  And I'm not bitching at you.
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  I am fighting for you.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  I love you.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  And I appreciate you.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  I appreciate you, but believe me, believe me, I will do whatever it takes to never back down
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  these people, but I can't do it without you.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  I am in your hands.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  You are in my hands together.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  Go to 1776 coin right now.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  1776coin.com and support this broadcast because I love this team and Harrison Smith and Owen
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  Troyer and the rest of these badasses like Greg Reese and Darren McBree and everybody else
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  and I need your help.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  You need my help, we're in this together.

[59:46.160 --> 59:56.720]  InfoWareStore.com. Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:59.440 --> 1:00:06.880]  I'll be back live next second. The globalists are in grave danger. Their New World Order is not
[1:00:06.880 --> 1:00:13.760]  going well. Humanity is waking up to them all over the planet. There are populist parties,
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:22.160]  nationalist parties, anti-world economic forum parties coming to power. The new conservative
[1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:26.160]  leader in Canada is completely anti-New World Order and just won the leadership of this party.
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:31.040]  They held elections today. Justin Trudeau would be removed as the leader of Canada.
[1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:42.880]  But why is it so important that we're on the air? Why is it so important your backing of the few
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:50.560]  LACs of truth and freedom? Because as things get worse and worse, as the New World Order comes out
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:54.720]  in the open, people are hungering for the truth more than ever and the globalists know if we
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:01:00.080]  stay on air and others stay on air, we will dominate the culture war. We will win. They will go to
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:17.600]  prison. They will be defeated. That's why it is critical, beyond critical, essential that you
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:22.160]  continue in the face of censorship and everything is going on by word of mouth, by text message,
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.560]  by email, by the side of your barn, the back of your car, calling you to talk radio, calling you
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:34.160]  to sea-span. Frankly, what I'm focused on today is building the United Front against what, and this
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:39.600]  is not hyper-belief, what to me is US fascism. Let's chat with a few callers. John's up first
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:46.400]  out of Austin, Texas, independent. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah, I'm listening to Mr. Mitchell
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:53.760]  here and this as an American and I'm wondering how it is that Trump is a cult and the Democratic
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:02:00.320]  Party isn't a cult when they've already instituted socialism, they've flirted with communism,
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:07.200]  and you talk about fascism, we can talk a lot about the Democratic Party and their neo-fascist
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:14.640]  views. So why is it that you want to bring the country together yet you want to take this extreme
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:21.760]  side? The Republican Party has been captured by a political cult. I don't use those words
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:26.960]  lightly. Aligning to cult things. We can go back to Obama administration, but I would also go more
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:32.160]  recent history. You've got the Black Lives Matter, the Antifa siding with Democrats, the cities were
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:37.200]  burned down, people were murdered. It seems very cult-like. We've got the Biden administration
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:43.040]  with pharmaceutical companies spending billions of dollars on vaccines that went from 100%
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:49.680]  efficacy to 40% efficacy and they're making billions of dollars. We've had free speech taken away.
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:53.280]  Plymouth, Michigan, this is Janice, Line for Republicans. Good morning.
[1:02:54.400 --> 1:03:03.040]  Good morning, Mr. Mitchell. There are none so blind as those who cannot see. Let me give you a
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:10.720]  little piece of advice. You will never succeed in your goal by insulting half the country and calling
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:19.840]  them fascists, racists, ultra maga. So that's political violence that you're talking about
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:27.280]  that Republicans and ultra magas are doing. It doesn't exist. It's a lie. It is a lie.
[1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:34.320]  There was political violence in our country in the summer of 2020. Wherever you can be heard,
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:38.640]  know whether it's by five people or a thousand or a hundred thousand or a million,
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:44.720]  you're gonna win the fight. Meanwhile, Democrat Senator compares 9-11 terrorists to January
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:51.280]  6 rioters. The stunning thing to me is here we are 20 years later and the attack on the symbol
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:56.560]  of our democracy was not coming from terrorists, but it came from literally insurgents attacking
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:04:02.000]  the Capitol on January 6. Some of those answers will come from Republicans. It's not the extremists
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  that we're dealing with every single day. We've got to kill and confront that movement. What is
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:12.160]  this semi-fascist? Most people in America know that it is not helpful to our country when we have
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:18.240]  people who are denying elections or trying to obstruct the outcome of an election. We are seeing
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.440]  an emerging threat, of course, over the last several years of the domestic violent extremist,
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:29.920]  the individual here in the United States radicalized violence by a foreign terrorist ideology,
[1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:37.200]  but also an ideology of hate, anti-government sentiment, false narratives propagated on online
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:42.000]  platforms, even personal grievances. But then they're going to start, though, with Alex Jones.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.760]  Oh, we're just going to censor Alex Jones, and then Donald Trump, and then well everybody, and
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:50.560]  well, now it's a social credit score through the banks that tracks what you buy and what you do.
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:52.720]  This is all being rolled out worldwide. It's here now.
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:05:01.920]  Power for Report unleashed the Info War. The rage for more than a decade
[1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:08.480]  have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients that are
[1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:15.680]  known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant, and to defend our immune systems. Now over a year
[1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:20.640]  and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced, top of the line, as good as
[1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:25.360]  it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:32.080]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle jam-packed, is back in stock for a limited time
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:38.240]  at infowarstore.com, 30% off. This limited time left time to go into all the great things it does

[1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:49.120]  and see how amazing it is. And what's just as amazing is it funds the info war and keeps us
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:53.200]  on air. We're all under globalist attack. They don't want you to have these essential
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:06:19.680]  nutrients that are in this product. Get yours today at 25% off at infowarstore.com. Now back in stock.
[1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:45.840]  You have the official talking point, we saw them put into US doctrine a year and a half ago,
[1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:48.720]  that any opposition to the Democratic Party and the Great Research Terrorist
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:54.960]  are now becoming official with every talking head on every program you can imagine. Hundreds of clips
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:07:03.680]  a day, I'm saying that anybody that's against communism or the New World Order or open borders
[1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:11.520]  or inflation is a terrorist and that our populist movement must be killed. These are quotes.
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:16.880]  If you think a blood red background and the president up there with trips behind him declaring
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:23.280]  war on the people was bad, now we know it wasn't a mistake. It wasn't some fluke. This is all done
[1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:29.040]  by design and we sit back and go, this is historically tyranny. This is what tyrants do.
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:33.520]  I mean, this is ridiculous. I mean, she's wearing a military uniform with an armband on.
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:39.760]  Well, most of the time in history, that's what corrupt systems do. Dictatorships and authoritarianism
[1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:47.600]  is more common than freedom. So I want to play this incredible clip of Senator Josh Hawley
[1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:57.200]  annihilating the deep state spokesperson in hearings yesterday in the Senate from Facebook,
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:01.680]  where they just calmly go, yeah, big deal. We get direct orders on what to censor,
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:09.040]  but they're the ones that lied about the COVID shot or COVID itself and its origins and the
[1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:14.160]  masking and the lockdowns. Everything they did, they now admits a lie. Oh, but we're going to
[1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:18.480]  censor you for your own good. It's continuing on every front, on the borders and on currency
[1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:24.880]  and on denying manmade climate change. Any of this, you get censored. And then Biden has a big
[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:29.040]  summit yesterday with the ADL and Southern Property Law Center literally saying, we're going to just
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:34.480]  take over big tech in America if they don't get behind us when they're already totally behind them.
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:41.280]  What a moment. What a time to be alive. This is true fascism, true authoritarianism,
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:46.160]  coming to America. But the good news is, finally, people are waking up. Here's the report.
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:51.200]  Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cox,
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:58.800]  I know that Facebook has said in the past that it's their position as a private company. You're
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:05.680]  not subject to the First Amendment. I assume that hasn't changed. Is that right? That's correct,
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:10.400]  Senator. But the United States government is subject to the First Amendment. I think we can
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:14.800]  probably all agree on. Hopefully we can. Hopefully that's still true in this country.
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:21.360]  Is it appropriate for Facebook to work with the United States government to
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:25.280]  avoid the First Amendment, help the U.S. government avoid the First Amendment?
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:34.240]  Senator, we do think it is sometimes appropriate to be in contact with government
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:38.320]  and with government organizations to help them avoid the First Amendment.
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:42.640]  Senator, I'm not sure what specifically you're referring to.
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:47.680]  Well, let me ask you this. Do you think it's appropriate to work with the United States
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:56.240]  government to target private individual speech that is constitutionally protected? Senator,
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:07.440]  I'm not aware of that. Well, let me educate you. On July 16, 2021, an employee at Facebook wrote to
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:11.920]  the Department of Health and Human Services saying, and I quote, I know our teams met today
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:16.880]  to better understand the scope of what the White House expects from us on this information going
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:24.560]  forward. On July 23, 2021, a Facebook employee thanked HHS, quote, for taking the time to meet
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:29.840]  earlier today and wanted to make sure you saw the steps we just took this past week to adjust
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:34.640]  policies and what we are removing with respect to misinformation. This included, and I'm still
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:40.320]  quoting, increasing the strength of our demotions for COVID and vaccine-related content.
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:47.040]  On April 7, 2021, a Facebook employee thanked the CDC for responding to misinformation queries,
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:52.720]  and I quote, we'll get moving now to be able to remove all but that one claim as soon as the
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:59.040]  announcement and authorization happens. On July 28, this year, a Facebook employee reached out
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:05.680]  to CDC about, quote, doing a monthly misinformation debunking meeting. The CDC responded, yes, we
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:11.120]  would love to do that, sure they would. On July 20, 2021, Clark Humphrey at the White House,
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:16.160]  who's digital director of the COVID-19 response team, emailed Dave Sumner at your company,
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:22.960]  among others, asking any way we can get this pulled down and cited a specific Instagram account
[1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:34.400]  within 46 seconds, your company responded and said, yep, on it. That sounds like what in the
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:42.160]  what in the law we call a pattern in practice of meeting, coordinating and colluding with the
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:49.040]  United States government to target particular speech that no one in any of these emails alleges
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:54.080]  is incitement, which would not be constitutionally protected. No one in any of these emails
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:59.440]  alleges it directly encourages violence, which would not be constitutionally protected.
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:03.040]  So it appears to all be constitutionally protected speech on, I might add, very politically
[1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:07.920]  sensitive topics that Facebook is directly working with the US government to target and remove.
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:10.160]  Is that your company policy to do this kind of thing?
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:18.560]  Senator, we were quite public about our cooperation with health organizations during the
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:24.320]  unprecedented time of COVID. We knew that people expected and wanted accurate information on our
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:30.160]  platform. We had conversations with the CDC, with the World Health Organization, and with other
[1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:36.480]  public health organizations, not just in the US, but abroad, in order to understand how to help
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:41.520]  make sure that folks weren't getting information that could cause imminent harm.
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:46.320]  Fair enough. So you're saying that this was, in fact, company policy to have these kinds of
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:51.680]  meetings with HHS, with the CDC, with the White House directly, that you did engage in this
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:54.960]  behavior and you think that it was entirely fine. Is that your testimony?
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:59.280]  Senator, I do believe it's appropriate for companies like ours to be in consultation with
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:05.040]  public health organizations and with government. And you can confirm that things like taking down a
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:10.080]  private Instagram account and adjusting your policies at the behest of the White House.
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:16.400]  Okay, pause. I got up 10 seconds. I forgot to make one big point about this. Did you see the big
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:22.800]  announcement right in the middle of that, which we already covered two years ago,
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:27.280]  which we noticed the agreements that were public, but did you hear the big announcement?
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:34.240]  He doesn't just take orders on what to censor from the US government, which is illegal as hell.
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:41.920]  They take it from the United Nations and other international bodies. The World Economic Forum
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:47.040]  says they're going to quarterback censorship against open borders, against forced shots,
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:51.920]  against lockdowns, against carbon taxes, against banning your farms, banning your cows,
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:56.720]  shutting down your pipelines, shutting down your fuel. See, I live this, folks,
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:01.200]  and it's so frustrating. It's all mechanized. It's all prepared. It's all laid out.
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:07.280]  Remember that young golfer? I had a golfing scholarship, great shape,
[1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:12.160]  and he had a heart attack, microcarditis, and a heart attack from the shot. And the doctor said
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:16.880]  it was that. And there was an article in Yahoo saying, young man, you're not a bad person. And
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:20.960]  we admit you had a heart attack from the shot, but you could scare people from taking it. So
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:28.800]  we're still going to take your account on Facebook or as Instagram. It's a subgroup of Facebook. So
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:34.880]  yeah, you had a heart attack from the shot. Yes, it's true. You're still not allowed to tell the
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:38.480]  truth because you had his doctor come out and do another video and talk about it. They said, you
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:46.480]  know, you're just banned. They even said it's okay though. Enjoy that heart attack at 20 years old,
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:57.600]  buddy boy. Now let that sink into your noggin that he just said the United Nations tells.
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:05.600]  Well, it's not just the US government. I mean, we get told by international bodies what to do.
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:14.640]  You in world government, I have the articles coming back when we finish the club,
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:22.480]  surveilling you. They've now admitted in this lawsuit by multiple states against Facebook.
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:29.680]  Facebook goes, yeah, we surveil people with AI. And then we ask the UN, do you want this censored?
[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:35.200]  They say right here, I have the article. Well, of course, we file reports on the American people
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:44.800]  to the UN. And now internationally, the UN runs credit card processing. They announced last week
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:51.600]  they're tracking gun owners and gun accessories at the UN UN technocracy world government.
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:55.120]  It ain't just big tech raping us. They're just the tool to do it.
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:03.120]  Info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:09.840]  And today is do or die time. If info wars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year,
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:12.640]  we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever. But if we don't,
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:19.120]  I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:24.880]  I've done my work. I've put everything into it. I'm leaving it on the field. But I believe at a
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:29.280]  gut level, you're going to come through. Plus, you're going to get great products that your
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.480]  family already need. So don't procrastinate. Show info wars. You want us to stay on the air.

[1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:00.960]  stay on air. So please take action now. Thank you. Everybody knows that high quality fish oil

[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:12.880]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural
[1:17:13.840 --> 1:17:19.360]  psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:26.480]  bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now there are actually some studies out there linking it
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:32.800]  to amazing events in the brain. But I want you to experience it yourself. We know it's good for
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:36.480]  your heart. We know it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries and veins and

[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:06.560]  that we've released the last year and I believe the most powerful, the man in the arena coin,
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:15.280]  Teddy Roosevelt. The citizen of a republic, the man in the arena. There's only 10,000 of this coin
[1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:21.360]  in existence in the world. It will never be made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:26.640]  It funds the information war against the globalist. This is something you want to hand down to your
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:32.560]  grandchildren. This is something you want to own. And as a fundraiser, it is funding the
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:37.600]  information war against the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:43.040]  sell it very quickly. Please be part of history and thank you all for your support. You can go to
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:51.120]  1776 coin.com or you can go to page recollectibles.com and secure this coin. There's only 10,000 of this
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:58.320]  coin in existence and it funds the info war. Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, 1776 coin.com.
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:03.840]  Donald Trump and the mighty republicans represented extremism that threatens the very
[1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:10.080]  foundations of our republic. I would be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name. In fact,
[1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:17.760]  I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation Matador. They see us as the bull and they are shaky, a
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:25.760]  red flag in our face. And the Matador is the deep state with a long skinny razor shark sword
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:31.200]  so that when the bull lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:37.040]  heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust. They've got the
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:42.400]  ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags. Before you launch a war, you stage false flags.
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:47.520]  That's the first thing you do because nobody wants to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars.
[1:19:47.520 --> 1:20:08.960]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:37.600]  The will to survive. Love will tell us to roll over and die. We're not about to do it.
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:42.480]  This is about your will right now. It's about your strength. They hate this audience for anybody in
[1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:48.800]  the world because you are the best this planet's got to offer. Know that and know how special you are.
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:58.480]  That's not words. You know it's true. But let that sink in.
[1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:11.920]  The eye of the tiger, the eye of the tiger, the eye of the tiger.
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:30.960]  All right. Here they are announcing the UN is in control of Facebook and the White House being
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:35.360]  in control of the White House censoring you and your family, suppressing treatments,
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:41.440]  suppressing the truth about their deadly shots in mass murder operations.
[1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:42.160]  Here it is.
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:47.840]  Senator, I do believe it's appropriate for companies like ours to be in consultation
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:52.640]  with public health organizations and with government. And you can confirm that things like
[1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:58.800]  taking down a private Instagram account and adjusting your policies at the behest of the White
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:06.800]  House and putting into place misinformation policies at the behest of CDC that those things you
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:10.400]  think are appropriate. This was company policy to do so. Is that fair to say?
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:15.360]  Senator, I'm not familiar with the Instagram account specifically that you're referencing,
[1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:20.960]  but we do know that people expected and hoped from the platforms that we would help them get
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.840]  accurate information about COVID during the unprecedented time, especially at the beginning.
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:30.000]  Well, isn't there a difference between you as a platform putting forward information
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:37.200]  and censoring your users at the behest of the White House? The administration more broadly in
[1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:43.200]  the CDC? Isn't there a distinction there? We specifically wanted to work with public health
[1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:48.400]  experts to understand the relationship between information and behavior. And so we did consult
[1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:52.960]  with the CDC. No, you were directed by them. You were directed by them to understand how
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:58.240]  inclusion, criminal, dirt bag, enemy. Well, you didn't just, you didn't just consult with them
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:04.240]  to understand how they affected public health. You actually censored on their behalf. You took
[1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:09.440]  these emails. I'm just quoting from a sample of them, which, by the way, had been disclosed in
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:15.680]  litigation. These emails show that you took censorship steps. You took down accounts.
[1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:23.280]  You planned misinformation policies. You adjusted your policies at the behest of the
[1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:28.080]  United States government. I mean, that's not just some theoretical thing. That's actually
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:33.600]  targeting your user's speech. But I appreciate your forthrightness, by the way. But you're saying
[1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:39.440]  that you think that's fine and that was your policy. Senator, we've been public about our policies
[1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:44.240]  on COVID misinformation specifically, as well as on misinformation generally. And so you think
[1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:47.120]  there's nothing, you're not concerned about any of this. Nothing that I just read to you. You're
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:52.000]  not concerned about it at all. Respectfully, Senator, I think the balance of how to protect
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.880]  free expression as well as public safety is a difficult issue. But it's one we're committed
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:02.160]  to working with outside experts and publishing our work. Well, I appreciate you being so forthright.
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:05.920]  As I said, this is actually from litigation between the state of Missouri and the state of
[1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:09.280]  Louisiana and the federal government. I anticipate that your remarks on the road today are going
[1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:14.000]  to be very interesting and helpful to that litigation. I'll just say this. My view is that
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:20.880]  the United States government is bound by the First Amendment. They cannot encourage or coerce
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:27.520]  or incite or collude with a private party to get around the First Amendment. But you just said to
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:33.600]  me today that that's basically what they did, that you coordinated with them repeatedly over a
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:39.200]  pattern of months and years to adjust and target your speech policies for protected speech at the
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:43.040]  behest of the United States government. I have to tell you, I've got a big problem with that,
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:45.440]  and I think all your users should, too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[1:24:45.440 --> 1:25:02.000]  Five weeks ago, they swore in Klaus Schwab as the head of the UN and said,
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:08.240]  yes, full command of the UN policy. The WEF hasn't just penetrated our cabinets and governments.
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:13.280]  It's taken over our lives with big tech. And they're just hiding it in plain view.
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:16.800]  Yeah, the FBI called and said, block anybody talking about Hunter Biden's laptop
[1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:20.400]  four weeks before the election two years ago.
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:26.160]  And that's just the start of what we know they've done.
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:33.920]  They have U.S. intelligence agencies plugged into big tech with foreign operations.
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:43.040]  China, it came out in the same hearings as involved. China's involved at Twitter. CCP spies.
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:47.680]  Because the World Economic Forum and the UN and the Chai comms,
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:56.720]  or the radical Islam, are our enemy. And they're the ones coming after us.
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:01.680]  What an incredible video. Now, I want to play an EMOM here,
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:05.760]  because I'm not against Muslims in general. I want to play an EMOM here,
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:11.520]  where he talks about TikTok. And this is true.
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:15.760]  How TikTok, owned and run by the Communist Chinese,
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:26.720]  puts out destroying messages to kill the family and to kill our minds and our future.
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:34.800]  But then the very same algorithm in China puts out a different message of stoic strength and
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:41.280]  will and mathematics and military and physical combat. So while they're building men and women
[1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:46.800]  and families, they're sabotaging us with Hollywood and big tech and all of this. And the messages
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:52.400]  are all there to make you give up and roll over to die. And a lot of people caught in this web
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:56.720]  think, well, if I'm politically involved or culturally involved, that's hard. It's scary. It's
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:04.320]  like work. No, it's invigorating. I'm so alive. I can't even describe it to you.
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:10.400]  Because this is the animating contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:17.520]  Here is the EMOM talking about facts that everybody should know. We'll come back from break.
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:22.800]  We have all the other news, huge, big developments straight ahead. But here's the report.
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:54.800]  Using TikTok are people who are doing good things, achievements, youth making social enterprise,
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:28:01.280]  youth becoming successful in math competitions, youth becoming masters of karate, youth doing
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:05.280]  something with their life. And you are rewarded. That algorithm is that the Chinese government
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:10.400]  makes you see positive things for social development. Did you know here and in the United
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:13.840]  States, they, China, send you a different algorithm? Do you know what they send you?
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:19.840]  All the nonsense that you see. They want you to see girls dancing, boys and girls dancing with
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:23.760]  each other, pranks upon your parents, pranks upon people. How many pranks do you see? Yeah,
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:28.400]  I'm not saying it's not funny. Some of them are hilarious. But if you want to destroy the nation,
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:34.400]  destroy the generation, you make them in their mind be rewarded with the dopamine for thinking
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:38.000]  stupid things are good, thinking that this is what you're supposed to grow up doing,
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.520]  a large proportion of people grow up thinking that this is what life is about.
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:46.720]  But in China, they don't let their children think that next time you open up Tik Tok or
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:51.360]  Instagram or whatever, and you see this, understand that you are being played.
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:56.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to break down how to stop these people.
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:03.360]  The best selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds,
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:09.840]  written by Alex Jones. Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week. But the
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:12.880]  New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that. The
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:17.520]  New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:21.760]  The paper that started the Iraq war by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:27.040]  people killed. So they lied about his book. The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:34.240]  the historic book that lays out the plans of the Great Reset Death Star and exposes the New World
[1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:42.400]  Order's plans for global enslavement. Get your copy now at amazon.com to keep the book at number
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:50.560]  one and infowarstore.com to help keep info wars on the air. The Great Reset and the War for the World

[1:29:56.880 --> 1:30:01.920]  People ask me all the time, what is your best at troping? You've got turbo force,
[1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:06.800]  you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force altering. Which one is better?
[1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:15.600]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari?
[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:21.200]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies. All three are different formulas.
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:28.320]  All three do different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy. I can't
[1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:34.880]  even take a whole pack myself. Brain force plus is a long term acting, clean, new tropic. This
[1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:41.760]  brain force ultra is a super fast acting, new tropic that creates incredible clarity,
[1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:46.080]  but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas. And finally,

[1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:26.960]  ingredients behind brain force ultra include Guarana seed, which is loaded with energy compounds
[1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:33.120]  and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries. Alpha GPC, a natural
[1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:38.480]  compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli and Ginkoli, which is
[1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:43.280]  also known for its exceptional antioxidant content. This product is more than twice the
[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:47.760]  servings of our brain force plus as well. So you know, it's packed full of the good stuff.
[1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:52.960]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of brain force ultra before it is

[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:33.520]  It's better to be able to go to a sanctuary jurisdiction and yes, we will help facilitate
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:40.080]  that transport for you to be able to go to greener pastures. Biden would fly people in
[1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:46.320]  the middle of the night, dump them all across this country. There was no warning on any of this
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:51.920]  and all those people in DC and New York were beating their chest when Trump was president
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:56.880]  saying they were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions saying how bad it was to have
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:03.920]  a secure border. The minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with every day
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:09.200]  is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden go berserk and they're so upset that
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:23.840]  this is happening and it just shows you their virtue signaling is a fraud. So millions of people
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:30.880]  a month are coming across the Texas, Arizona, California border, mainly Texas. They're sleeping
[1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:35.760]  all over the streets. The even leftist centers that are taking them in and shipping them all over
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:45.360]  can't even keep track of it. So there is a total crisis going on here. The reports are from the
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:51.440]  border patrol. It's 10 times what Obama did when he opened the border. Trump shut it down basically.
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:59.920]  A little bit was coming through but 95%. And so then they shipped two plane loads, 100 people
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:04.880]  to Martha's Vineyard and you would think it was the end of the world. Now they've already bussed
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:12.320]  those folks out to a US military base. Oh, you can't come to Obama's neighborhood. So I think
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:20.880]  these videos speak for themselves. Let's play clip 8, 6, 10 and 19 just back to back. You have
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:28.720]  the White House Press Secretary saying, oh, they're horrible. They brought them here promising
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:35.440]  them housing and welfare. No, the Democrats did that. It's just so insane. Then she goes,
[1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:39.680]  well, Texas Governor Ted Cruz is the main reason this is happening.
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:46.640]  She's the White House Press Secretary. It doesn't even know that Ted Cruz is the junior senator
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:53.280]  behind John Cornyn from Texas and that Greg Abbott is the governor. She doesn't even know
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:58.240]  the name of the governor of the most popular state. You think, well, that's a sign of the
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:03.920]  weakness of the new order? No, it's not. The White House Press Secretary runs nothing.
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:09.360]  She's put there because she's an idiot. So is Biden. They keep talking about Fetterman in
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:17.120]  Pennsylvania. Oh, he can't even talk. Oh, Fetterman's an idiot. He'll probably make him president
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:22.000]  because he can't talk. In fact, play the clips back to back and then play Fetterman. It's not
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:27.840]  edited. It's just the excerpts cut out. Not edited to make him look bad. It's just the excerpts cut out
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:33.520]  of a 20 minute speech where he doesn't know what planet he's on. And that's the model of the future.
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:39.920]  He's presidential material because he doesn't know who he is. And he's obviously a very sick man.
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:45.520]  They're calling him a mutant. They're making fun of him. Obviously, he has acromeglia.
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:49.600]  Andre the Giant wasn't a bad guy. Don't make fun of people because he has acromeglia.
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:55.120]  Don't make fun of him because he's a really bad person. So here are those clips back to back.
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:00.480]  So what are the most difficult challenges right now? The difficult challenges are
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:06.560]  Hit pause again. I'm going to start this over. Sorry. Again, this is one of the leaders in
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:10.480]  Martin's Vineyard literally saying we don't have places for them. We don't have jobs for them.
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:15.360]  Don't bring them here. But you're telling them come here and they voted 85% in Martin's Vineyard
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:21.600]  or Joe Biden. So if you don't want to pour gasoline on yourself and let them on fire,
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:26.080]  lady, don't do it. But there's nothing like a leftist to be disconnected from reality. Sorry,
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:31.520]  started over. So what are the most difficult challenges right now? The difficult challenges are
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:40.720]  we have at some point in time, I have to move somewhere else. Right. We cannot, we don't have
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:47.680]  the services to take care of 50 immigrants. And we certainly don't have housing. We're in a housing
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:54.560]  crisis as we are on this island. And so we don't, we can't house everyone here that lives here and
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:38:00.480]  works here. We don't have housing for 50 more people. We're just watching our residents.
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:06.000]  So we, we notified that they were coming with these migrants to be showing up. I have no comment.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Do you know where they, where they need to go from here or are you just trying to make sure they
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.960]  stay away from the migrants? I have no comment. Yeah, just make sure they're ready safe and away
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:25.760]  from our face. On what you call this political stunt with the asylum seekers, let's specifically
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:34.000]  get into the locations. Martha's Vineyard, the Naval Observatory. Can you talk to the issue of,
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:42.720]  you said Boston. It's an island that they sent the asylum seekers to an island that is known to be
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:49.200]  in some instances of Democratic Haven, former presidents, former Democratic presidents, vacation
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:54.320]  there, own homes, et cetera. Could you speak to that as well as the Naval Observatory?
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:39:00.880]  What I could say, and I've been very clear, it is a political stunt. That's what we're seeing from
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:10.960]  governors, Republican governors in particular. And it is a cool, inhumane way of treating people
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:16.640]  who are fleeing communism. People who are, who are, and we're not just talking about people,
[1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:23.440]  we're talking about children, we're talking about families who are promised a home, promised a job,
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:31.200]  put on a bus, and driven to a place that they do not know. And it is a cool thing to do.
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:36.640]  We are not a sanctuary state, and it's better to be able to go to a sanctuary jurisdiction.
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:41.920]  And yes, we will help facilitate that transport for you to be able to go to greener pastures.
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:49.680]  Biden would fly people in the middle of the night, dump them all across this country. There was no
[1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:55.600]  warning on any of this. And all those people in DC and New York were beating their chest when
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:01.280]  Trump was president, saying they were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions, saying how bad it
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:08.320]  was to have a secure border. The minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:14.000]  every day is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden go berserk. And they're so upset
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:19.680]  that this is happening. And it just shows you, you know, their virtue signaling is a fraud. Okay.
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:28.960]  One of you, you didn't have a doctor in your life making fun of it,
[1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:37.680]  making light of it, or telling you that you're not fit to be served. Can you describe
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:49.520]  a stroke and what, you know, what's happened? So I use the example. So pretend I was,
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:41:00.640]  I want to go to Wegmans at such the most important race for the Senate here for 22.
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:05.920]  So we have to replace Pat Toomey.
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.200]  Senator Toomey was not very nice to me.
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:27.760]  He had to me is a miracle. He had a chance. He had a chance
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:37.600]  to match me up again. Abortion is the ballot now in November.
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:44.240]  That's who slaves of Satan are these pathetic people.
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:52.400]  Federmann's not running anything. They're not the bosses. They are the globalist minions.
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:57.440]  So when we come back, I'm going to hit the vaccine narrative collapses as Harvard study
[1:41:57.440 --> 1:42:02.880]  shows jab more dangerous than COVID. We're going to hit what's happened to the economy with Russia.
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:08.800]  And we have a special guest in studio to talk about the collapse of the entire COVID narrative
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:14.000]  straight ahead in full wars.com tomorrow's news today.
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:27.680]  I also want to look more at the situation with Bill Gates and what he's setting up
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:34.560]  and what he's doing. So that's all coming up here today in the final segment of this hour
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:39.440]  and the whole next hour with our special guest. We're going to have in studio.
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:43.600]  Remember, the globalists are working around the clock. Try to shut this information down.
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:48.240]  That's why your word of mouth can trump everything they're doing. So share the live links
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:43:01.920]  from info wars.com. It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year.
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:07.360]  And I believe the most powerful, the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt,
[1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:15.760]  citizen of a republic, the man in the arena. There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:21.200]  in the world. It will never be made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:26.480]  It funds the information war against the globalist. This is something you want to hand down to your
[1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:32.400]  grandchildren. This is something you want to own. And as a fundraiser, it is funding the
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:37.280]  information war against the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:41.680]  They'll sell out very quickly. Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:49.040]  You can go to 1776 coin.com or you can go to patriot collectibles.com and secure this coin.
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:55.200]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the info war. Man in the arena coin,
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:02.160]  Teddy Roosevelt, 1776 coin.com. The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:08.240]  plans. They financed major universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing
[1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:13.600]  their propaganda of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:18.960]  thing and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:24.640]  teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:29.840]  thing. And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter.
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:33.280]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:38.240]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:44.320]  nutritious and then all sit down together and have the communal event. And that's what the system
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:49.280]  is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions and coming together.
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:55.120]  They really are sick, evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:45:01.520]  into lab rats. We cannot let this continue. Several years ago, I approached one of the top
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:07.120]  companies in the U.S. that supplies the highest quality signature reducing fairy day cages,
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:12.720]  the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies. And now they have produced specifically for us
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:19.440]  this made America onion line at a very affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect
[1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:25.600]  your cell phone or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:31.040]  whatever electronics you want to put in like desktop computers. It is all exclusively available

[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:50.640]  protect your signature, your identity from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations,
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:55.520]  governments. This is one of the hottest items out there today. That's exclusively available
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:46:03.840]  at infowarstore.com. Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say,
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:08.640]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:14.320]  the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:17.840]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:21.600]  but really they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:24.960]  got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this
[1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:28.240]  from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:32.880]  gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:36.480]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America,
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:41.440]  Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally. In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:50.400]  We had like that. Okay, you wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how
[1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:56.000]  we find this operation. And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:20.320]  Old Klaus Schwab wants a civil war, but he didn't want to get the blame for it. He wants to kill
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:26.800]  each other. I got a better idea. How about we wake up and expose the real enemy is there's blood on
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:47.520]  the streets. It's up to my ankle. We have a highly recommended individual.
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:51.680]  We've got her, Peter McCullough and others. Every guest he's recommended has been amazing.
[1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:58.640]  Michael Hamilton is an attorney battling the vaccine tyranny and with such giant developments,
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:03.440]  I can't wait to have him in studio. He's here with his wife and great family. That's coming
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:09.120]  up next hour. Look for that. Okay, so let's race through this news. I've already mentioned a lot
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:13.760]  of this, but I want to actually drill through the actual articles. Joe Biden rages against
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:20.080]  Republicans transporting migrants to Democrat elites. It's un-American and we have that clip.
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:25.440]  We've already played Joe Biden saying it's un-American, but they call him here. He says,
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:29.280]  flood the border. We never played that clip yesterday. We got to cue that back up if you can.
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:32.560]  We've probably played it a hundred times. We haven't played it in probably a year.
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:36.480]  He says, if I get elected, I want you to literally flood the border.
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:46.320]  So then they flood the border and Texas and Florida governors say, we'll just ship a few
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:54.160]  hundred up to you. You're like the Holocaust. Democrats have said that it's a Holocaust.
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:57.760]  You told him to come here. You told him. I mean, these are quotes.
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:06.160]  These are unconscious people. Here's the clip of Joe Biden telling the illegals to come here.
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:12.160]  To have served with him, what I would do as president is several more things because things
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:18.160]  have changed. I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:22.240]  All those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard. That's who we are.
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:26.160]  We're a nation that says, if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:30.800]  We're telling folks, when I get elected, surge the border.
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:36.720]  And now they've surged the border millions a month, over a million a month in Texas alone,
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:42.880]  hell on earth, total collapse, insanity, illegal aliens everywhere sleeping on the street. And it's
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:51.680]  the Republican governors of Florida and Texas' fault. It's Greg Abbott and it's
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:50:01.120]  Ron DeSantis' fault. So now, we already played the clip earlier, but he rages that it's un-American
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:06.640]  to bring people into the country because his idiot constituents can actually see what it's like
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:10.640]  to be in the rest of the country in their rich areas because the Democrats have three times on
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:15.440]  average money Republicans. They're the rich people that would have a class war dumped on their door
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:25.040]  step. In fact, we already played the clip, but Kamala Harris put the illegals at her house.
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:28.240]  They go, get back from the fence. Get back from the fence. They have a fence. You can't.
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:32.960]  Look at the signs they have with the Marthas Vineyard. Liberal logic. Marthas Vineyard calls
[1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:39.440]  50 illegal immigrants a human humanitarian crisis, but 4.2 million illegal immigrants crossing
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:42.960]  the so-called secure border that Kamala Harris talks about.
[1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:53.600]  And the signs they put up say, we respect women. We value black lives. We stand with our LGBTQP
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:59.120]  community members. We stand with immigrants and refugees, with indigenous peoples. We stand with
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:06.160]  people of all face. We stand for our community, but don't come to our community. That was quick.
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:11.280]  Buses arrive at Marthas Vineyard and deport illegals off the island to military bases.
[1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:16.480]  Biden says we have a process in place to manage migrants. This complete chaos unfolds
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:24.240]  beyond any imagination on the border. The press secretary, KJP, says illegals have been
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:34.240]  promised a home and a job by them. Meanwhile, war on the middle class, America suffers the greatest
[1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:41.440]  loss of household wealth in history. But there's new videos of Biden losing himself on stage.
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:46.800]  Doesn't know who he is. Obama refuses to house migrants flown into Marthas Vineyard
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:49.840]  as Democrats lament open borders policy they voted for.
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:59.040]  We've got all these photos coming out of Marthas Vineyard. Here is Obama's 15,000-square-foot
[1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:05.760]  mansion. Not too worried about the sea level rising, are they? Oh, no, no. Don't come here. No,
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:11.840]  no, no, no. And of course, look at the house of Al Gore, Obama, Romney, and John Kerry on
[1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:18.160]  Marthas Vineyard. You see any solar panels there? No. You don't see any solar panels.
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:25.040]  El Paso border crisis deepens as a thousand migrants are left to sleep on the streets.
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:32.160]  Migrants from the global lockdown. Migrants from the shutdown. I remember these signs up the last
[1:52:32.160 --> 1:52:37.040]  five years. They're rainbow colored. It says, in this house, we believe Black Lives Matter.
[1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:42.400]  Women's rights are humanitarian rights. No human is illegal. Science is real. Love is love. Kindness
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:48.160]  is everything. So if you see that sign, illegal aliens, go there and ask for free stuff, but you're
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:55.520]  not going to get it. So if it's good enough for the Democrat strongholds to have giant
[1:52:55.520 --> 1:53:02.960]  tip cities, how about they start to happen at their houses? There's one from a spickle, me.
[1:53:04.560 --> 1:53:09.680]  He says, sorry, illegal migrants. Southern border states are full, but I hear Marthas
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:16.560]  Vineyard is accepting reservations. Actually, Laura Loomer's idea three years ago,
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:21.680]  she took a bunch of illegal aliens, she picked up on the Texas border, excuse me, California border,
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:27.680]  and took them to Nancy Pelosi's house and she got arrested for it. Like, let's get Laura Loomer on Sunday.
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:37.360]  And it just gets crazier and crazier from that point out.
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:43.360]  The system's dying. The power structure knows you're not listening.
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:47.120]  They don't know what to do, but crash things and hope you forget about what they did
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:50.480]  so they can pose as the saviors during the new crisis. Here's an example.
[1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:56.240]  Emmys for the last decade have slid to almost no viewers, but now TV's biggest night has lowest
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:02.240]  ratings in award history. That's okay. They've got a new target at Peter Wood.
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:07.280]  Coming out event hosted in non-profit encourages kids as young as five to attend.
[1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:12.080]  But these little kids who don't know who they are and haven't formed their identity
[1:54:12.640 --> 1:54:17.200]  should go give money to men dancing on stripper poles and decide they're gay.
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:20.240]  They got a name for that. It's called pedophilia, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:29.360]  Absolutely unprecedented evil. And what is the power structure's response to all of this?
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:37.600]  To try to outlaw our speech and our resistance to what they're doing.
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:43.200]  They have a special guest coming up next hour. More on Biden's new declaration of war against
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:49.440]  the American people that he made yesterday and more. But first, this new article up on infowars.com

[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:53.920]  The best selling book in America last week was the great reset and the war for the worlds
[1:57:53.920 --> 1:58:00.560]  written by Alex Jones. Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week. But the New
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:03.600]  York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that the New
[1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:08.160]  York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:12.400]  The paper that started the Iraq war by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:17.600]  people killed. So they lied about his book. The great reset and the war for the world,
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:24.160]  the historic book that lays out the plans of the great reset death star and exposes

[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:04.960]  You know, we have to get conspiratorial and we look at the Iran contra. The CIA was trading drugs
[2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:08.960]  with Nicaraguans for guns. We were giving them guns and then they were taking that cocaine
[2:00:08.960 --> 2:00:12.560]  and they're flying it into Mina, Arkansas, which Bill Clinton happened to be the governor of that
[2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:15.680]  state. And they're taking those drugs and they're putting them in Florida. They're putting in
[2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:20.160]  California for you, Ricky Ross. So they created the crack epidemic. So the people, the same people
[2:00:20.160 --> 2:00:25.200]  that did that, they're creating the problems that we have today. So it's just a new drug for a new era.
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:30.240]  I mean, I grew up in a world where, and I was speaking for myself, I actually believe that
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:36.560]  conspiracy theories were the way that dumb, uninformed people explained the complex world.
[2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:40.400]  Yeah. Understand what was actually happening. You resorted to a conspiracy theory and that was a
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:46.080]  mark of you, of course. I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:52.880]  Now, I always think this, the more informed, the smarter the person, the more likely they are to
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:56.800]  be connecting the dots that you're connecting. So you grew up in a world where people just like
[2:00:56.800 --> 2:01:01.840]  assumed that the system was not on the level, I think. Well, it's called cognitive dissonance.
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:05.120]  It's like, you know, the government is, you know, has done corrupt stuff. You know, there's
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:09.200]  classified levels of intelligence that you'll never be a part of. But you have cognitive dissonance
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:13.680]  thinking that the government has your back. They don't. It's a personal people control
[2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:17.920]  system. They want you to control us. And that's one of the biggest parts of why they want to keep
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:21.360]  you depressed. Because, Tucker, when you're constantly depressed, you're in what is called
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:26.080]  fight or flight. So your hormone response is constant cortisol. And that's why Brian Stelter,
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:29.600]  those guys that constantly have the ticker on CNN, how many people die, how many people die,
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:33.120]  because people get addicted to that hormonal response. And once you're in that fear state of
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:37.360]  fight or flight, you can't see the forest for the tree right in front of your face. So then they
[2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:41.920]  can literally like a dog with a treat, they can make you do whatever you want. And that treat is
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:46.320]  just more trauma, what I call trauma based mind control, just more fear tactics in order to
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:50.400]  control you. So that's what's happening now is the mainstream media uses fear to control us. And
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:53.520]  that's the same mechanism that the government uses. Couldn't agree more.
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:02.640]  Since you mentioned the great recent war of the world that you champion, and I really appreciate
[2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:06.480]  you reading it. It's mainly it was easy to write it's their quotes, it's their battle plan.
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:11.040]  What if people would have read mind comp that Hitler wrote everything he said in the book he
[2:02:11.040 --> 2:02:15.920]  did. Well, this is their mind comp. This is their admissions right here. This is their confessions.
[2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:20.000]  That's why I call the blueprint of the Death Star. No, listen, here's the beauty of the book.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:23.920]  You actually quote them at length, you take a couple of the top books, you take a couple of the
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:28.640]  top thinkers, you tie it all together. And this is what people have to understand. Look, once you
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:34.240]  read this, you understand what we're up against. Okay, you'll understand exactly what this apparatus
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:38.560]  know. What Alex calls it the Death Star, but you understand what we're up against. And we're not
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:42.400]  going to back off this. We can't back off it. The United States is actually the centerpiece of
[2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:46.400]  this battle, because they understand just like in the Revolutionary War, if they can take the
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:51.040]  liberty and freedom of American citizens, they can take it anywhere. And that's why you have to
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:54.880]  fight back. And by the way, Alex, I'm not just read it. I tell everybody, get a pin. I always get
[2:02:54.880 --> 2:02:59.760]  my great pens here. I had my pen and I'm underlining everything. And here's the beauty of it. You
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:04.480]  footnote everything. This is not Alex Jones's opinions. What Alex Jones's team has done is pull
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:11.520]  it all together. It's all referenced right there. You can go to a footnote. I know you've got an
[2:03:11.520 --> 2:03:16.080]  online site about it too. That's why I think Tony Lyons, the guys at Sky Horse, did such a great
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:20.880]  job. But listen, once you read this book, you understand why the Alex Joneses and the Steve
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:24.720]  Bannon's are not going to back off. There's all kinds of other things we could do is all kinds
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:28.480]  of other things Trump could do is all kinds of other things Tucker Carlson could do. We're all
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:36.160]  in this fight. Get your signed copy of the number one book in America and help keep info wars on

[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:59.520]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:04.320]  chemicals added to the food. It's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak,
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:09.840]  but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and the social
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:15.440]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody
[2:04:15.440 --> 2:04:23.120]  knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:28.720]  situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:35.680]  evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they
[2:04:35.680 --> 2:04:40.400]  signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:44.720]  keep info wars on the air now more than ever because even if you don't believe in God,
[2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:49.360]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic and we are opposing
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:52.240]  the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:03.040]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic? You've got turbo force,
[2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:09.360]  you've got brain force plus and you've got brain force ultra. Which one is better? And that's like
[2:05:09.360 --> 2:05:19.200]  asking what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari. It's different strokes for different
[2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:26.000]  folks. It varies. All three are different formulas. All three do different things. Turbo force is 10
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:33.200]  hours of clean out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself. Brain force plus is a
[2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:39.600]  long-term acting clean new tropic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:45.280]  new tropic thing. Creates incredible clarity but doesn't last very long. They're all three
[2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:51.040]  different formulas. And finally back in stock massively discounted brain force ultra is available

[2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:18.880]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind.
[2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:26.160]  All right Dr. Peter McCullough out of all the great scientists and researchers out there I can say
[2:06:26.160 --> 2:06:31.920]  is a leading person having the biggest effect exposing this and he said you to get Michael
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:38.640]  Hamilton and Dan Watkins on the show. And so we have Michael Hamilton in studio. We're very
[2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:44.560]  blessed and flattered that he came here to be with us. And we have Dan Watkins. We also appreciate
[2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:50.400]  joining us via Skype. But these are the guys. It's not getting a lot of media attention but it's huge
[2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:55.440]  that have the big lawsuits going in California over Rindesivir which they knew didn't help people
[2:06:55.440 --> 2:07:02.800]  and turn their kidneys and other organs off. And so this is a whole nother layer of Fauci and the
[2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:08.080]  stocky owns what Senator Rand Paul brought up two days ago in those hearings. And so I think the
[2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:13.360]  best thing to do the rest of the hours for me to just try to shut up and let real experts attorney
[2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:19.360]  Michael Hamilton and attorney Dan Watkins who are at the tip of the spear. Tell us who you are and
[2:07:19.360 --> 2:07:26.000]  what's happening and why this is so important. Thank you Alex. I'll just lead in. I'm a small
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:33.520]  two stoplight town attorney from Kentucky. But Dan Watkins and I have seen these Rindesivir
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:38.240]  protocols happening around the country. And I want to describe them a little bit. We filed a
[2:07:38.240 --> 2:07:43.600]  lawsuit three lawsuits in Fresno, California to try to hold these hospitals accountable and to try
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:48.320]  to bring awareness to this issue because it's happening. The protocol is almost the same in
[2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:53.760]  every hospital all around the country. Yeah the UN sets the protocol like Facebook said in Congress.
[2:07:53.760 --> 2:08:00.800]  So we take medical orders from the UN. Yeah it's crazy. I mean so just the basic protocol as I see
[2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:04.880]  it happening everywhere it's happening in my state. It's happening. I've got calls in from
[2:08:04.880 --> 2:08:09.920]  at least 25 different states. Somebody goes into the hospital and it could be for almost anything
[2:08:09.920 --> 2:08:14.400]  and the hospital just tells them they have COVID pneumonia. A lot of times they ask them if they've
[2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:20.480]  been vaccinated and that I'm not sure why they ask that. But I think I have some ideas. But they
[2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:26.720]  then tell them they have COVID pneumonia and they isolate them. They put them in the ICU. They take
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:31.200]  their family away from them. They put an oxygen machine on their face, a bipap machine and they
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:35.440]  turn it up to high levels which makes it hard for them to breathe. These folks will try to take it
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:40.240]  off and so they'll zip tie their hands to the bedrails. They bring in a psychiatrist who
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:48.720]  diagnoses them as agitated. And then they give them morphine and a whole handful of other kind
[2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:53.360]  of sedatives. So basically this is euthanasia. It is absolutely. They refuse to give them food
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:59.040]  or water. The remdesivir shuts down their kidneys. They flood them with all kinds of other drugs.
[2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:05.760]  Many of them contraindicated for use with remdesivir. And remdesivir I'm sure your listeners
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:09.280]  probably know that. Oh I remember when they were first giving an emergency approval they said it
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:14.640]  wouldn't work and would shut off the kidneys. So again the cold blooded, this is so cold blooded
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:18.160]  obviously your lawsuit wants to find out who creates the protocols, why is it the same,
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:22.400]  why is this happening. This is so organized whether you're in Kentucky or New York or Texas or
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:28.240]  California. That's right absolutely. Remdesivir was tested a few years ago in these Ebola trials
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:34.720]  and 53.1% of everybody they gave it to died. They pulled it from the trial and banned it from
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:40.560]  further use. Too poisonous to give to people. Then they went before the CDC, a panel,
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:46.000]  nine of the panelists who were seeking that EUA approval emergency use authorization were from
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:52.400]  the NIH. And nine of them had financial ties to Gilead Sciences who is the maker of the drug
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:10:00.320]  vexillary commonly known as remdesivir. And since then, well since the Ebola trials that the WHO,
[2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:05.760]  the World Health Organization did a very large study and they concluded that remdesivir does
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:09.280]  nothing to help anybody with COVID and should never be given to anybody with COVID. Yet it's
[2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:14.640]  being given all over the United States along with this protocol that's designed to starve people to
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:22.400]  death, shut down their kidneys, give them acute renal failure, fill their lungs up with fluids and
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:27.040]  when you say, when families say hey let's give them some food and water they say well no we can't
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:30.720]  put more fluid in them their lungs are filling up. Well their lungs are filling up because of the
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:38.160]  remdesivir and without the food and the water and without any human contact they're shut down,
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:44.240]  they're strapped down, they're and then they're just starved to death. And similarly in England
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:48.800]  they do this too but they also gave them that euthanasia drug they use for lethal injection
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:52.480]  which it says you don't give somebody that have breathing problems. I mean this is this looks
[2:10:52.480 --> 2:10:58.640]  pretty damn premeditated Michael. It looks really premeditated and and it's been financially
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:05.520]  incentivized in ways that most people can't even believe. For example in California there are three
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:10.800]  categories of treatment for a hospital. You either treat somebody that has COVID as an outpatient
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:16.640]  and if you do then the average charge rate is about $3200 or you bring them in and you treat
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:22.800]  them as a non-complex inpatient and then the average charge rate goes up to 111,000 and change.
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:30.160]  But if you treat them as a complex and to complex is defined as you've either intubated them or
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:35.040]  you've put them in the ICU either one or both now it becomes complex and the average charge rate
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:42.160]  jumps up to $450,000 and change. So this is a $400,000 death bounty. Well plus they get a 20%
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:46.800]  bump through Medicare if they offer remdesivir to the exclusion of any other remedy. If they don't
[2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:50.880]  give Ivermellan they have to exclude it. So they have to say remdesivir is your only hope
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:56.080]  and if they do that the government gives them 20% on the entire stay which at $450,000 charge rate
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:12:05.120]  is another 90 grand roughly. So this makes Vioxx blush. Yes. Please continue. So and on top of
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:09.520]  those financial incentives we know that with the original CARES Act anybody who got the word
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:16.240]  COVID on their death certificate in California the state of California gets an extra $147,000
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:20.480]  on top of all the other incentives that we talked about. Is there any particular group
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:24.080]  they're targeting? We know the ventilators and stuff in New York and remdesivir they target
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:30.400]  old people. Is there a particular group they're targeting? I would say and maybe Dan can speak
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:34.560]  to that a little bit but I don't see a particular group at this time. We may find some things out
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:38.160]  through discovery and we expect to learn. As we had a New York nurse on she said it's going to be
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:41.360]  totally healthy but they were homeless. They just grab and strap them down, give them remdesivir
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:47.840]  and kill them. We've seen them strap people down and kill them when they from from all walks of
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:52.480]  life and all different ages. That happened to Alex Stein's mother. They strapped her down,
[2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:57.200]  would let him see her, gave her remdesivir and killed her. Same protocol, same talking points
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:02.960]  all the way around the country. It's happening everywhere Alex. Wow. Let's bring Dan Watkins
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:06.880]  and we got three minutes to break. Kind of give us your opening statement here Dan. Sure you bet.
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:11.680]  Yeah with respect to what's going on you hit it on the head in terms of this is coming from above
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:16.560]  because I've been doing medical and dental malpractice defense work for 30 years in California
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:20.960]  and what's supposed to guide the health care providers is the standard of care practice
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:26.240]  among health care providers right and when you look at these protocol this protocol one protocol
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:32.000]  being implemented across the board in the fashion that Michael just described in a way that's designed
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:36.400]  to really kill the patient there's no way this could be the standard of care. No practitioner
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:40.480]  could look at this and say this is the viable standard of care when we know we have alternative
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:46.640]  methods of care such as ivermectin hydroxychloroquine way more efficacious. So somebody's pulling the
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:53.200]  strings on this and calling the use of remdesivir and it's beyond the standard of care. Peter McCulloch
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:59.200]  he hits this right square every time. Doctors need to exercise their own judgment and they're not
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:05.360]  their judgments being replaced by somebody somewhere. It's not the WHO I mean it could be a
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:09.600]  group of them but they'll look to well the CDC is the FDA it's the WHO it's the NIH they're calling
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:13.680]  the ball that's not what's supposed to dictate how a provider works. Well exactly they all point
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:19.520]  fingers at each other. Yeah it's not me I'm following the guidance from the CDC I'm following
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:23.440]  the guidance from the NIH I'm following the guidance from wherever but that's not how it's
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:27.440]  supposed to work and the fact that it's not working where the doctors using their own independent
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:32.400]  judgment they're replacing and then they're replacing the patient's decisions with their
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:36.880]  decisions something's up and that's what we're filing these cases for to try and get to the bottom
[2:14:36.880 --> 2:14:42.400]  of it because it's important and these are not exaggerations it's the same protocol I don't
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:47.120]  know how many states I know three people that healthy family members that they put on remdesivir
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:52.960]  that were dead in two weeks. Yep we have thousands of emails and calls since we did our press
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:59.280]  conference a week ago thousands from across the country same same result and young people healthy
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:02.880]  people and then I think the last person I would say if there was any group that was targeted
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:07.280]  it's the unvaxxed as soon as they know you're unvaxxed you are immediately moved into this
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:12.080]  protocol and your your care is put down on the back burner and no one pays attention to you
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:21.840]  until you're done. Wow so that's bioethical eugenics targeting. From the stories we're hearing
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:27.680]  and it's it's over and over and it's not just California and Fresno it is Kentucky Florida
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:34.240]  Michigan Connecticut Vermont Texas you name it the same thing I'm unvaxxed boom right into the
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:40.480]  protocol get them intubated. All right Dan Watkins attorney Michael Hamilton attorney
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:44.400]  highly recommended by Dr. Peter McCullough the guys that filed the big suit so blessed to have you

[2:18:54.480 --> 2:19:05.120]  get our great and a bag of it here I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:10.320]  the communists well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:15.520]  organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:19.360]  that you know the media calls communist but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is
[2:19:19.360 --> 2:19:23.440]  is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:26.960]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:31.440]  price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:35.760]  per pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up America
[2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:40.720]  Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact I'm gonna tell you a little story
[2:19:41.840 --> 2:19:49.600]  um we had like that okay you wouldn't believe it anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's how
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:56.560]  we fund this operation and if you don't find us you don't want to steer that's fine
[2:19:56.560 --> 2:20:19.520]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:27.600]  from 1810 folks I'm not in liberty to tell you one crew member whose mother died after they
[2:20:27.600 --> 2:20:31.840]  never ran down as a veers and I'm not in liberty I'm gonna get a family that died when they gave
[2:20:31.840 --> 2:20:38.240]  it to him but alex stein who's huge in a great guy from Dallas his mother was healthy they put
[2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:43.520]  her on it a killer he's hosting next Tuesday while I'm in Connecticut and our guest michael hamilton
[2:20:43.520 --> 2:20:47.760]  is going to be here in austin until then he'll be in studio actually with one of our co-host
[2:20:47.760 --> 2:20:53.360]  whose mother died that's how big this is and it's ongoing and it's a silent operation that's
[2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:59.360]  happening so uh dan walkins or michael hamilton the key lawyers uh taking action against this thank
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:05.600]  god uh who wants to go first and just lay out the next phase of this i'll let dan speak to the next
[2:21:05.600 --> 2:21:10.480]  phase yeah dan you can jump in I think the next phase we're in it right now and that's bringing
[2:21:10.480 --> 2:21:15.280]  awareness to what's going on you've identified it there are people don't know they go to the hospital
[2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:19.200]  they have no idea they're told remdesivir is the treatment of choice they submit and then they
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  they die we want people to know how bad it is so when they get there they say do not do this I do
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:30.320]  not want remdesivir and that's part of why we filed the lawsuits and I'll be I'll say on behalf of
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:34.720]  the clients in large part that's what they want they just want people to be aware they want also
[2:21:34.720 --> 2:21:39.680]  people to be aware of other treatments that can be used and to call for those but then when they go
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:47.200]  and administer this poison without the consent and in some cases they actually administer it over
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:54.000]  the objection of the patient we want those people to be held accountable so right now we've got the
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:58.880]  complaint filed we're going to wait for the answers from the three different hospitals and the health
[2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:03.520]  care providers and then we're going to jump into discovery and we're going to get after it we're
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:08.160]  going to dig into what's involved in the financial incentives we're going to dig into the protocol
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:13.120]  and where it came from and how they can equate it with the standard of care we're going to dig
[2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:20.880]  into the actual process that occurs when these people are given remdesivir in a 21 year old one
[2:22:20.880 --> 2:22:25.760]  of the sedans in our cases can be perfectly healthy and die within nine days we're going to get into
[2:22:25.760 --> 2:22:31.280]  that and we're going to Alex Steins mom dead within I think he said eight nine days yeah it's insane
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:36.800]  and it's not and I think we just got to go back to the idea that this is not an exaggeration this
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:42.640]  is not hyperbole these are exactly the same cases across the country and the numbers are
[2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:47.680]  astounding and the calls that come in the heartbroken hearts I mean that this is crazy that
[2:22:47.680 --> 2:22:53.440]  Americans are under this this at this time and and it just goes back to somebody's in control
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:22:58.080]  calling the ball and taking away our rights to decide what we're going to do in terms of medical
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:03.840]  care for our own bodies and Michael and I are going to fight like crazy to to put a stop to it
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:09.200]  because ultimately this lawsuit and the desires of the of the patients and the excuse me the planers
[2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:14.720]  that we're working with is to stop the use of remdesivir it needs to stop and that's ultimately
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:19.440]  their goal so as long as we can bring awareness to it and people can say no they can object and
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:24.000]  resist hopefully we can bring down the use quite a bit and start yeah this is the legal system being
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:28.480]  used for what it's supposed to be not suppress free speech not to destroy people but to save lives
[2:23:28.480 --> 2:23:33.040]  and again it's formulaic all over the western world they're following the same formula even
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:37.760]  though again day one they said it would cause this this is and like Rand Paul said two days ago
[2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:41.600]  with Fauci so we're going to find out with your medical recommendations across the board who's
[2:23:41.600 --> 2:23:48.080]  getting paid yeah and and that's where Michael comes in in terms of digging in on these financial
[2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:53.120]  incentives his expertise and this is exposure to this type of stuff over the years that's really
[2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:58.640]  number well it's up high on the list there's a lot of things we want to accomplish but the idea that
[2:23:58.640 --> 2:24:03.840]  this type of treatment is incentivized and it's incentivized even further by the death of the
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:08.400]  patient is abhorrent and we got to get to the bottom of that what's the best place for people to
[2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:14.000]  visit we got 30 minutes 35 minutes left but everybody's like flood the zone with your press
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:18.080]  conference flood the zone with your lawsuits flood the zone and pay attention to what you're doing
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:24.320]  because this is a silent holocaust that you're raising alarm on one other thing we're trying to do
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:29.840]  is bring awareness of this issue to other attorneys across the country that have
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:34.720]  a love for the Lord and want to do good for people and take the skills that they've learned
[2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:40.800]  over the years and fight for this same cause we're so we're hoping to develop in this a template
[2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:46.080]  so to speak how to go about filing lawsuits to make it easier and then to help people if they
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:53.040]  need help in medical malpractice we have a growing pool of experts that are assisting us in
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:58.080]  and will assist us across the country so one of the things that we really need to have though
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:03.760]  our attorneys Michael and I can only file so many suits and we really hope out of that that we can
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:09.040]  get people attorneys that love the Lord and want to do good to get involved in this fight
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:17.680]  so we have we are also in need of raising funds I'll just tell you that we have created a give
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:24.080]  send go is it all right for me to speak about these two yeah so we have because these families have
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:28.480]  everything's been taken from them they're grief-stricken they don't have these are just regular
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:32.720]  people you know like a lot of us they live from paycheck to paycheck many of them and
[2:25:32.720 --> 2:25:36.240]  they don't have the money to fund this kind of an effort there's the discovery costs are going to be
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:43.520]  really high we're so blessed to have a number of doctors including dr. McCullough donating their
[2:25:43.520 --> 2:25:48.000]  time to serve as a fact you've only raised a few thousand dollars you guys need to raise millions
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:52.080]  of dollars not just the hundred and something thousand you to raise these wars cost millions
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:56.160]  of dollars and the globalists just think we're stupid that they can just get away with this
[2:25:56.160 --> 2:26:00.240]  they can just carry this out this is the I could think of more important work so what's the give
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:06.880]  send go for folks that donate it is a www dot give send go dot com slash Fresno remdesivir death
[2:26:08.080 --> 2:26:11.280]  that will take you directly to our gifts and go we just set it up a few days ago when we already
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:16.480]  have people giving small amounts here and there but we really need to get some some traction there
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:21.840]  for the sake of these people and really for the sake of everybody Alex because with a with a win
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:25.120]  with a victory here as we get into discovery I think we're going to learn more about the
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:28.720]  financial incentives I know of some of the financial incentives and I laid those out a
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:32.880]  minute ago but I think we're going to discover much more that we can't even see I think we're at
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:37.760]  the tip of the iceberg we're certainly the tip of the spear and if we have a victory what we
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:43.200]  discover in this case is going to benefit other attorneys all around the country as they attack
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:47.600]  those things I mean I can't think of a more important area for people to donate how do they do it
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:54.800]  again it's a give send go dot com slash Fresno remdesivir death you know I've got thousands
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:59.360]  of questions but just just continue Michael and Dan well I want to tell you a story about a nurse
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:05.040]  in Kentucky this is how I really got my initial awareness I got a call from a group of nurses
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:10.080]  and they said they're putting this nurse to death in the hospital with remdesivir and she
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:15.840]  she was a 26 year old pediatric nurse in that hospital she went in for bronchial pneumonia
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:20.480]  which she gets just about every year and she went in to get hydrated and treated and she told them
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:24.960]  she did not want remdesivir and they said well let's just get you hydrated sweetie and they hung a
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:31.040]  bag of remdesivir on her and told her it was hydration then they shut the door and refused
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:35.840]  to let anyone come in for the next nine hours in the morning she was very dehydrated and they
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:39.280]  said oh you're dehydrated she said well I've been calling for help all night I'm so thirsty and they
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:44.160]  said well let's get you hydrated right now and they put another bag of remdesivir on her shut
[2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:49.200]  the door locked her in for another nine hours I drove to that hospital and I began to ask them
[2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:54.400]  she signed a power of attorney she was very lucid and she did not want the remdesivir
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:58.400]  and so I said I need to see a list of all the medications you have her on they said well
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:02.720]  that's not the way we do it anymore when she's discharged we'll give her a list and she'll
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:08.560]  be able to see everything we gave her I said no she's a free American and she gets to have input
[2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:12.960]  about what you're giving her she has a right to refuse medication she has the right to ask for
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:18.400]  things if she thinks she needs them and so for the next 13 hours they stonewalled me well the
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:26.160]  doctor's coming and I I patiently endured the stonewalling at the end I called up the CEO of
[2:28:26.160 --> 2:28:31.120]  the hospital and I said you've got a big problem down here in this room and if you call me back
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:36.080]  it's going to get exponentially worse you need to get out of your blankety blank chair and come
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:40.000]  down here and deal with the situation three minutes later I was surrounded by security
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:44.480]  the head nurse said to me said to them this man's been interfering with us all day
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:49.200]  he won't let our nurses do it do it let's share what happened when we come back it's an organized

[2:33:31.600 --> 2:33:38.160]  approval for redesivir not regeneron not the monoclonal antibodies but this chemical drug
[2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:42.800]  that killed 50 plus percent of people they gave it to in previous studies for viral infections
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:44.960]  they knew this
[2:33:47.920 --> 2:33:52.880]  redesivir fails to prevent COVID-19 deaths in huge trial and causes deaths but they're still
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:58.320]  giving they're still doing it under a directive by the big hospital chains that are making money
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:02.160]  because the federal government incentivized 400 plus thousand dollars if you did it
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:07.760]  to put some money on a ventilator with over a hundred thousand dollars total after it all
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:12.640]  so this is a pre-planned operation you were telling the story michael hamilton
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:18.080]  lawyer found these lawsuits with dan walkins and others you're traveling the country now exposing
[2:34:18.080 --> 2:34:23.520]  it and trying to save lives finish the story of the nurse and you're talking to the ceo of the
[2:34:23.520 --> 2:34:30.000]  hospital system in kentucky so after the 13 hours of grinding just trying to find out what medicine
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:34.640]  she was on i had a power of attorney i was also her attorney in fact and they surrounded me with
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:38.640]  security guards and so the nurse started saying i wouldn't letting them do their job i was going
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:44.160]  in and out of a of a covid ward without protective equipment that's not that they locked up the the
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:49.200]  nursing homes the hospitals keep family and and attorneys away so they can do their special work
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:54.240]  all over the country the same protocol same thing in the uk this who set this protocol sorry it's
[2:34:54.240 --> 2:34:58.240]  just so obvious no it's it is obvious and and we're determined to get to the bottom of who set the
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:02.960]  protocol uh after she described all these things that i had supposedly been doing i said to the
[2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:08.160]  security guards i said look gentlemen this this uh dear nurse here is lying to you through her teeth
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:12.560]  i have stood here and in this same calm voice i have asked her to tell me what medicine she's
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:19.200]  giving my client and and we know that she's trying to kill my client with remdesivir which my
[2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:22.640]  client i said she doesn't want and i said we're not going to have a wrestling match here but as
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:26.800]  i was talking to him i was dialing 911 i got the local police on the line and i said we got an
[2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:31.040]  attempted murder going on right here in this room in this hospital and i needed i need some troopers
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:36.000]  here right now they escorted me out of the hospital and i've been banned from returning but the police
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:42.080]  did come and after four policemen including a sergeant and the doctor and the nurse converged
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:47.760]  in that room they agreed to stop the remdesivir but they told this nurse and this is what they
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:52.480]  tell everybody they say if you leave the hospital against medical advice yeah your insurance is
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:56.560]  not going to cover it now i don't know that that's true we're going to find out but i don't know
[2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:00.800]  sitting right here today that that's true i suspect it isn't but they're being told that everywhere
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:05.200]  and so you know people are afraid it's a lot of money again you're all over the country the same
[2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:10.240]  story somebody wrote the whole protocol of how to lock people out how to give the drug how to
[2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:15.040]  scare people i mean who wrote this battle plan i keep obsessing on that but so what happened to
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:20.080]  the poor life and we need to because it's the it's verbatim i'm hearing the same script everywhere
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:24.240]  i've i've got it on tape i've got it from multiple hospitals in multiple states and they're saying
[2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:28.800]  the same thing well that's the key to the conspiracy right there yeah yeah so what happened so she was
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:32.720]  afraid to leave and they told her uh you're gonna have to be intubated she said i don't want to be
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:36.640]  intubated and they said well you're not vaccinated so you're gonna have to be exactly what they told
[2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:42.240]  her and four days later she died in the icu and they got even more federal bonuses for the innovation
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:48.880]  that's right my god this is paid for murder so tell us who her name and who she was we
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:54.640]  memorialize her i don't have permission from the family to understand okay i have to protect your
[2:36:54.640 --> 2:37:00.240]  privacy her family i would love to follow the super 14 families that are public now yes that's
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:04.640]  right 14 families in fresno california had the courage a lot of families are so grief-stricken
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:09.840]  and they can't endure the publicity of going forward with a lawsuit but yeah you don't expect
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:14.320]  a hospital to kill you expect a thug to do it that's right that's right people are we're used
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:19.840]  to going to the hospital to get help and instead uh you know people are going in for really minor
[2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:24.000]  things and they're being put to death the average time to death is nine days but some of these people
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:30.480]  didn't get killed that quickly they were tortured for they held on 30 40 one of them for 56 days
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:40.640]  family no family a room with no pictures hands tied down wow you know just this is beyond north
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:46.880]  korean torture yeah it's it's i can't believe this i appreciate your courage even faces because
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:50.240]  most people face pure evil they just they run away from because it's too hard to believe
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:54.240]  dan Watkins what should people know about this this holocaust
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:38:05.440]  well we've hit on so many issues i think that it's just the beginning is what i would
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:12.560]  tell people this isn't going to be the last time that some type of horrible protocol is
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:17.440]  unleashed on the american people we started it with the mandates for the supposed vaccine
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:26.320]  and they compelled people and they used all sorts of uh uh misleading information and
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:31.200]  misguided information to to convince people to take the vaccine they want to control people
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:36.640]  in the way that they handle their own medical care the idea that they can remove medical autonomy
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:41.920]  from the individual and then from society in general is something that i think is behind
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:47.520]  all of this and because that it's not the last time we're going to see this type of protocol happen
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:53.040]  and so what we need is for people to understand that this is not someone off this is not some
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:58.480]  mistake by a random hospital in the middle of you know central valley at california this is a
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:08.000]  coordinated effort to take away the rights of people and to impose somebody's will on in terms
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:12.240]  of their medical care on them and so people need to be aware this is happening it will continue to
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:16.240]  happen they need to say no to those types of protocols when they go to the hospital they
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:20.320]  need to be aware that they could be this is a coordinated agenda and i agree with you a total
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:27.280]  test case 100 percent i mean i think that the mandate on the the vaccine the supposed vaccine
[2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:32.320]  was the tester of the tests and now they've amped it up a bit and now we're going to see more and
[2:39:32.320 --> 2:39:37.680]  more of this type of stuff new vaccines going to be pushed out new types of treatment for the vaccine
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:42.400]  that doesn't help and it's going to be all directed and they're going to have one choice and that's it
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:48.400]  and they're going to do it to take people out and it's it's unbelievable to me that it's happening
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:54.880]  but it's clear that it is happening at some level above the medical provider because this is not
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:59.920]  the standard of care it can't be the standard of care to provide a patient poison that is got a
[2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:03.520]  greater chance of killing them than it does helping them that they know they want to let me just add
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:08.080]  this we already see hospitals around the world not just here who's directing the same policy
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:13.520]  to deny organ transplants or not give medical treatment or not give cardiac treatment or not
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:18.480]  even let you in if you've not been injected or fire their employees so we and you and you bring
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:22.960]  up across the board with your plaintiffs in your research that it's unvaccinated that are being
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:29.200]  targeted for death this is direct discrimination direct this is insane i will tell you alex we
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:34.320]  have thousands of people that were representing in california who fought against the mandate for
[2:40:34.320 --> 2:40:40.720]  the vaccine and were fired because of it hundreds and hundreds of which are with the healthcare
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:44.880]  industry they knew better and they said no they based it on their religious beliefs a very solid
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:50.240]  and important foundational belief they said no to the covid vaccine and they're fired for it
[2:40:50.240 --> 2:40:57.840]  and so this it's a it's so aggressive and the coercion is so evident it's just right out there
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:02.800]  and that's why we know for sure that there will be more of this and it is absolute discrimination
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:06.960]  when someone exercises their sincerely held religious beliefs against something and they
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:12.160]  say i don't want this the first amendment the first of the amendments and it's disregarded
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:16.080]  by whoever's in authority particularly in california all over the place we represent first
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:19.680]  responders up and down the state the city of los angeles is out of control the county of
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:25.520]  los angeles is out of control santa clara county all of these locations forcing people to take
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:29.520]  medical care that they don't want and i want to commend you for what you're doing because you
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:34.560]  guys are at the tip of spear but i am seeing some light at the other tunnel all over courts are
[2:41:34.560 --> 2:41:39.200]  ruling governments are backing off the military's backing off the force injection so thanks to the
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:44.640]  lawyers the heroes like you guys and the family stepping forward i'm starting to see some traction
[2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:50.080]  against them or is that not accurate i agree with you there uh we had that recent settlement
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:55.280]  liberty council on behalf of 500 employees in a new class action suit got a settlement with the
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:42:00.720]  hospital and got the people back to work so we're seeing certain organizations realize
[2:42:00.720 --> 2:42:04.800]  hey this might not be the best way to go in terms of treating our employees and treating people in
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.360]  general uh when we deny their religious liberty so i think we are seeing some traction but i
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:13.280]  think what's really important to highlight from all this and this is for all the listeners
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:18.400]  the attorneys can only file the suit if the client steps up and says i'm ready to step in the fray
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:22.960]  i'm just using the law and what i've been you know trained to do over the years to fight for them
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:27.600]  but i guarantee you alex stein told this story six months on my show it's why he's become a he
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:31.200]  was not even a public figure he's become a phenomenon they killed his mother the story you
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:37.440]  tell it's the same story yeah and it's the people and the families they feel so intimidated by the
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:42.480]  authority figures that do this to them they don't step out they feel like they are going to be taken
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:46.560]  out and these families in fresno i don't want to put their names out there it's on the complaint
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:51.920]  people can go but we want to protect them they're stepping out and they want so that michael and i
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:59.120]  can go about and tell their stories for them that's right stay there stay there info wars work has

[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:22.720]  and they are shaky a red flag in our face and the matador is the deep state with a long skinny
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:28.720]  razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward the matador uses the force of its weight
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:35.120]  to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:40.320]  they've got the ace of spades in their hand which is false flags before you launch a war you stage

[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:40.720]  california nevada where i'm licensed and then kentucky next and then we're going to try and
[2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:44.960]  find attorneys across the country to get other help for these people so that would be where i'd
[2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:50.480]  recommend they go to get uh on the list to get some help uh what was it like for both of you
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:55.200]  men just to personalize it when you just hard to believe this is going on but it is what was
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:49:00.400]  your you said it was the young lady the nurse being murdered in front of you for you dan walkins
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:08.080]  what was your process like in this yeah i practiced this is my 30th year of practice in law at 29
[2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:13.840]  years uh i've been looking for something to do but never really had the time in in really the
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:20.640]  compulsion to investigate it well my son became a victim of the mandates in california as a senior
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:26.080]  at one of the state schools and we wanted to fight against that and that was my step off into this
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:31.600]  we so you have a real skin in the game yeah that's what started it and uh we helped a bunch of
[2:49:31.600 --> 2:49:35.600]  college students just trying to get into it and then right after that the department of public
[2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:40.560]  health in california issued its mandate against health care workers and i will tell you that there's
[2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:46.480]  nothing short of god's doing this he put all these people in front of me and one step after
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:53.840]  another i met nurse after nurse and uh oh wait wait till alex dine gets on board yeah yeah no doubt it
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:50:00.720]  is it's been amazing and so in the last year we've been able to help so many americans fight for the
[2:50:00.720 --> 2:50:05.280]  fundamental rights of the first amendment their religious liberties their medical autonomy the
[2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:11.200]  rights to privacy fourth men 14 to men do process i mean such important things this is a tyrannical
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:16.720]  medical tyranny revolution 100 percent and you're seeing it just i mean there's no they
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:23.200]  don't even hide it anymore new some garcetti the or the l.a county board of supervisors it's just
[2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:27.200]  right out there they don't they don't hide it they just tell you you know fentanyl won't kill you the
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:32.160]  rendezvous very well they're gonna push it gets you guys in there for covid treatment if you're
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:37.440]  unvaccinated you get a different course of care and you're off with remdesivir and even if you
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:42.800]  you haven't been vaccinated uh they do it this for me that's the big takeaway the organized
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:47.920]  policy all over the world but the fact of the discriminating against the unvaccinated
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:55.360]  that right there is a smoking gun we're seeing that's what we're hearing these are the stories
[2:50:55.360 --> 2:50:59.760]  we're hearing that if you're unvaccinated you are on a fast track to your own room
[2:50:59.760 --> 2:51:03.840]  and intubation and problems with remdesivir all right we got seven minutes left both men split
[2:51:03.840 --> 2:51:09.920]  this up in closing comments well i want to i want to say uh alex that we are really thankful to have
[2:51:09.920 --> 2:51:14.480]  the support of folks like dr lee bleat who has a foundation called truth for health foundation
[2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:22.240]  she has been in arizona saving people from the hospital fighting this against remdesivir for
[2:51:22.240 --> 2:51:29.920]  quite some time and she has generously donated to help pay for some of the initial expenses but
[2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:36.720]  we have such a long way to go and and and so much money to raise uh it's it's hard wars cost money
[2:51:36.720 --> 2:51:40.720]  we either roll over and die or people can start getting their checkbooks out it's that simple
[2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:44.800]  that's right roll over and die folks or spend money and it's not hard to figure out we have
[2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:49.200]  people who have gotten on our gifts and go and given us ten dollars people don't have a lot but
[2:51:49.200 --> 2:51:54.240]  if a lot of people give something it's a way to fight this battle if one aunt stands up they might
[2:51:54.240 --> 2:52:00.400]  all stand up that's right courageous is contagious as april moss likes to say we were on her show
[2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:06.960]  the other day and it's just when people hear other people standing up for what's right then
[2:52:06.960 --> 2:52:12.160]  they have a temptation to stand up themselves well it's just the balls of Fauci these people
[2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:16.400]  he does the same crime over and over again a treatment for a disease is worse than disease
[2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:23.040]  and they blocks good treatments therapeutics that's right stuff that works ivermectin works
[2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:26.640]  there's a state in india there's a new canadian government study they suppressed that they knew
[2:52:26.640 --> 2:52:32.720]  it worked two years ago well and the cdc funded the original Ebola study they were one of the
[2:52:32.720 --> 2:52:37.600]  funding um the na h was one of the fun so they knew it killed people it didn't work so they picked
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:46.560]  it that's right cold-blooded bastards yeah pan well i'm just gonna spend the last few words and say
[2:52:46.560 --> 2:52:52.800]  that this is really god's fight for me and michael and while we're stepping out we're doing it with
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:59.040]  him behind us and we go forward and we asked other but we really need to do you've you've
[2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:05.120]  hit it on the head people across the country need to start speaking out and so when we're on our zoom
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:08.960]  calls with the clients that we're dealing with on whether it's a mandate remdesivir or whether
[2:53:08.960 --> 2:53:13.920]  we've also started to go after gender transition and the complete atrocities that are occurring there
[2:53:14.880 --> 2:53:20.560]  people uh need to stand up and speak their heart and speak their values against all of this and we
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:26.720]  need to do it uh all at once and we're seeing people find some courage to do that more and more
[2:53:26.720 --> 2:53:31.600]  as they see and hear these stories so people need to talk and tell the stories and get over the idea
[2:53:31.600 --> 2:53:35.120]  that it's some kind of conspiracy theory because it's not and i'll tell you if we just go back
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:40.000]  two years ago three years ago somebody ran this by me i'd yeah okay i get it maybe that's what's
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:45.520]  going on but it is happening and i am i'm living it and i'm seeing it and i want people to hear
[2:53:45.520 --> 2:53:49.360]  this is what's going on i'm not part of any establishment anywhere i'm some guy out of
[2:53:49.360 --> 2:53:54.640]  law office in orange county california and and we're out there now i'm seeing this and it's a
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:53:59.680]  mindblower so we stepped off for the lord we're going forward with the lord and if any attorneys
[2:53:59.680 --> 2:54:04.240]  are out there and they're feeling any nudging from him to get involved say yes get involved let him
[2:54:04.240 --> 2:54:09.200]  use you this fight is worth it because this is going to be the first of many and we are in trouble
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:13.920]  if people do not start speaking out and standing up for what they believe in pushing back against
[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:18.720]  this tyranny we need to do it you you're right the numbers will win if we can all do it well you just
[2:54:18.720 --> 2:54:25.040]  said it we can't defeat evil but if we take action god through us will you want to close this out
[2:54:25.040 --> 2:54:30.080]  michael that's right this you know our forefathers pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:34.240]  honor to fight tyranny and they were not up against anything like we're up against today
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:38.720]  it's time to stop quoting our founding fathers and become the founding fathers
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:44.880]  and mothers for our grandchildren and you know we see a great evil in the country dan and i
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:49.840]  never asked ourselves how are we going to get paid should we do this we just said our god is
[2:54:49.840 --> 2:54:53.840]  greater than this great evil how can we not do it and we just stepped into the fight and that's
[2:54:53.840 --> 2:55:00.640]  where we are today again how do people contact you guys how do they support you again so

[2:59:46.800 --> 2:59:54.720]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:07.440]  i don't think of myself as a victim being targeted and persecuted and lied about
[3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:12.400]  i think of myself as successful but at the same time i want to be able to continue on our mission
[3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:22.000]  so we're now into day four of the connecticut second show trial where the judge has found me
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:28.640]  guilty and actually issued orders to my lawyers last night one came and physically met me the
[3:00:28.640 --> 3:00:33.760]  other i talked to a connecticut saying you cannot say you're innocent and you cannot
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:38.560]  say a whole other list of stuff so if i was an airman shot down in vehement captured and put on
[3:00:38.560 --> 3:00:44.960]  tv i could say i was innocent but in america they don't just find you guilty they tell you i'll hold
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:50.080]  you in contempt but in jail if you say you're innocent well let me give the connecticut folks
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:54.320]  a little preview because i'm going up there next week i'm going to get on the stand i'm gonna say
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:01:02.480]  i'm innocent you can lock my ass up because i'm not in vietnam in a gulag i'm in america and that
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:09.680]  makes it 10 times more important it's wrong what the north vietnamese did to our troops our airman
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:14.880]  then and what you're doing is far worse you are disgusting and you're in your own delusional world
[3:01:14.880 --> 3:01:22.800]  and you're a fraud they claim my pre-programmer thing and plan every article and every interview
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:27.520]  and that i i masterminded all this stuff and we gave them all the discovery and they found us in
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:34.080]  default because we didn't give them stuff though they show all this evidence cherry picked out of
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:43.920]  context all these plaintiffs suing me i've never said their names those know who they are barely
[3:01:43.920 --> 3:01:47.600]  questioned sanny hook on the air i questioned all these big events whether chesney small or
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:57.360]  wbs in iraq but imagine saying you are sanctioned at the beginning of the defamation damages trial
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:00.960]  already found guilty not getting a real trial but they're pretending to the jury it's an actual
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:06.000]  trial into the world but i'm guilty when i get there and i can't say i'm innocent everybody
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  fundamentally knows that's a fraud listen about alex jones it's about you here's barbara bellis
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:20.880]  yesterday on the stand the following observation this stunningly cavalier attitude with respect to
[3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:28.400]  do their discovery obligations is what led to the default in the first place the defendants
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:34.480]  have consistently engaged in dilatory and obstructive discovery practices from the
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:42.160]  inception of these cases right through to the trial and finally i will note there is there is no
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:49.680]  notice in this file to this minute of any supplemental compliance producing the google
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:56.080]  analytic documents which is required by the practice book but was also required by my clear
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:04.560]  court order of september 30 2021 which apparently was not followed here so the motion is denied
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:14.160]  for these reasons and the court hereby sanctions the defendants by precluding them from presenting
[3:03:14.160 --> 3:03:21.840]  evidence or argument that they did not profit from the sandy hope coverage so it's like saying give
[3:03:21.840 --> 3:03:27.520]  me google google's an interface we didn't really use google analytics we gave them nine million emails
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:31.040]  they asked for and they found like five examples where somebody looked at google analytics was on
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:34.480]  the dashboard of the control i don't turn look at the statistics has any of the crew ever seen
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:38.960]  me look at statistics in here do i sit around no i don't everybody knows that so we say yeah
[3:03:38.960 --> 3:03:42.240]  we don't really look at it oh we found five examples where some of your employees look at
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:47.520]  google analytics and see how big your website was and then they order us to give it to them
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:51.040]  so we go what are the search terms two years ago we go and search the terms give them a
[3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:57.440]  four thousand page report she says that's not all of it all of google it's a search engine
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:04.400]  you can't give them all of google all it is is the back end of google there she is saying
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:10.160]  you didn't give any evidence and so you are precluded for putting on a defense
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:17.520]  and here's the latest up my lawyers told me can't say that we didn't problem sandy hook which we
[3:04:17.520 --> 3:04:24.080]  didn't profit from it sandy hook was a small part of our coverage which it was substantially
[3:04:24.640 --> 3:04:29.200]  complied with discovery can't say that can't say the defaults unfair can't say we're innocent
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:35.680]  can't say it's unfair and can't say i don't run pqpr that's my dad's company which i don't even
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:42.080]  run it he runs it and i can't say opposing counsel is unfair i've got to say i'm guilty
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:49.920]  and play their little north korean game this is the dying imbers of the corrupt empire these
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:58.320]  parasites are a joke pray for justice we'll be right back stay with us i don't care if you work
[3:04:58.320 --> 3:05:03.680]  in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer a rancher a doctor a lawyer or a millionaire
[3:05:03.680 --> 3:05:08.640]  fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles you see it every year 30 different
[3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:14.160]  tax returns 30 different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of
[3:05:14.160 --> 3:05:19.760]  them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the
[3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:24.000]  system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show it's
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:28.240]  a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:34.400]  to be able to do things tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
[3:05:34.400 --> 3:05:38.880]  money we wouldn't even be here if i hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:47.200]  the only way you fail is not writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com one word jonestaxrelief.com
[3:05:47.200 --> 3:05:59.280]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285
[3:06:02.320 --> 3:06:07.280]  welcome back to the outro jonesha i'm your guest host j dire of j's analysis and
[3:06:08.080 --> 3:06:14.240]  in the wake of the passing of the queen i thought it would be very helpful and timely
[3:06:14.240 --> 3:06:22.000]  also given the date the anniversary of 9-11 to get into the history of imperial geopolitical
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  motivations and subversion what's the approach that empire has to how they run their colonies
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:35.200]  and their subjects and by doing so we will understand the motivation of the geopolitical
[3:06:35.200 --> 3:06:42.080]  minds behind the modern era people behind the cold war people behind the war on terror and then
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:48.960]  where we're going now into the war on so-called viruses and invisible enemies we go back to
[3:06:48.960 --> 3:06:53.360]  dr carol quigley's book the angle american establishment he's basically laying out the
[3:06:53.360 --> 3:06:59.360]  structure and the the approach of these elites in the west what he calls the angle american power
[3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:05.760]  block to running the world how they would subvert their main two rivals the austral hungarian empire
[3:07:05.760 --> 3:07:10.400]  and russia to achieve global dominance and out of that global dominance how they would then
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:18.320]  bring about a world socialist fabian federation now in the early stages of 20th century late
[3:07:18.960 --> 3:07:24.240]  1800s 1900s there were quite a few people in the british establishment who did not want this plan
[3:07:24.240 --> 3:07:29.680]  they were not leftists they were not socialists they were not anything other than just traditionally
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:36.160]  minded british who wanted the best for their people and what they saw was the british empire's
[3:07:36.160 --> 3:07:42.960]  advantages for civilization and whatnot however they eventually fell sway to the influence of
[3:07:42.960 --> 3:07:48.320]  certain figures within the british establishment sometimes called the clived and set the astores
[3:07:48.320 --> 3:07:53.920]  and by extension uh seasaw roads and the rock of the excuse me the raw shells that was the this
[3:07:53.920 --> 3:07:59.520]  is the history of the british empire and how eventually the the bank of england essentially
[3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:05.760]  is a front for private banks and the way that this model of governance works is the original
[3:08:05.760 --> 3:08:09.920]  in the in the modern era shadow government models in other words you have these
[3:08:09.920 --> 3:08:17.280]  outer rings and circles that are academics and corporations and media moguls etc and then you
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:23.040]  have an inner core that they report back to and there's an inner core that knows the real long
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:29.280]  term plan and in quigley's book amazingly again describing things around the turn of the century
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:35.200]  you know from 1890s into the 1900s he lists the people that were involved in this at that time
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:39.440]  now it's not exactly the same anymore the british empire doesn't exist this is sort of the
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:44.080]  last waning phases of the british empire but when we look at this we get a real
[3:08:44.080 --> 3:08:49.520]  insight into the the skeletal structure and model for how the world government is coming
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:56.480]  into power now uh is in continuity it's the same plan there's changes there's new war new wars new
[3:08:56.480 --> 3:09:01.520]  phases right as we go into this great reset but ultimately it's the same model based on the same
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:09.040]  ideas of malthusianism fabianism and technocracy so you've heard me of course quote for a long time
[3:09:09.040 --> 3:09:15.440]  the writings of h.g wells the writings of burgeon russell and in both of their cases they represented
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:21.120]  the the fabian society at least russell not so much as h.g wells russell was a fabian for a
[3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:25.440]  while and then he supposedly wanted to do other things but the fabians represented this sort of
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:31.040]  left-wing idea of the establishment at that time and again remember that in my view even according
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:35.920]  to mainline historians the british empire was really just sort of a front or frontest piece
[3:09:35.920 --> 3:09:42.560]  for this inner inner shadow government of uh the the royal institute of international affairs
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:49.200]  chatham house etc that have these rules where you can't speak publicly about the inner policies
[3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:56.080]  and so this is called chatham house rules and they named their society the royal society and
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:00.160]  the royal institute of international affairs the round table groups so this would be principally
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:04.800]  one of the key figures that we have to know about uh well actually two there's lord millner and john
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:11.360]  ruskin and millner and ruskin were favor uh they favored socialism but they understood that you
[3:10:11.360 --> 3:10:17.760]  probably couldn't convert everybody over to socialism or a centralized world socialist republic
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:24.480]  without uh taking a long time to do that and this is where we get the idea of a slow implementation
[3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:30.480]  of a kind of fabian socialism that's the motto of the fabians is the turtle you know walking slowly
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:34.640]  in many many members of the british establishment especially
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:41.120]  as we get closer to uh our day are uh fabians or closet fabians now that doesn't mean that everybody
[3:10:41.120 --> 3:10:46.000]  who's not a fabian is therefore a good guy as if the monopoly capitalists or people like this
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:51.600]  are somehow exempted or the good guys really they're two sides of the same coin and this
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:56.640]  is a big thing that uh professor anthony sudden stressed uh as we've lectured through his famous
[3:10:56.640 --> 3:11:01.760]  book wall street and the bolshevik revolution because bolshevism was one of these early experiments
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:09.200]  and how to run imperial revolutionary tactics in other countries so for example there's a
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:17.520]  phenomenal page that he has where he goes into the history of we know exactly when lord millner got
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:25.600]  the loy george government to support revolutionary socialism and this was done
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:33.280]  by our political compromise via who knows what kinds of shady operations but in 1917
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:42.960]  david lord george prime minister in the uk flipped to support at the behest of lord millner woodrow
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:48.880]  wilson who was working at the behest of uh colonel edwin mandel house of the banking interest
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:56.640]  to switch their support to the bolshevik so this led to the u.s government as well under the wilson
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:03.280]  administration and others recognizing the bolshevik because they had a stake in the country being
[3:12:03.280 --> 3:12:09.760]  destroyed and then renovated and then it became a resource war right so then it became a situation
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:15.920]  where russia could be a western asset these corporations believe through revolutionizing
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:21.760]  the country and then were corporate and banking interests making russia into an asset of the
[3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:27.840]  west so you can see that it's not so much a government policy as it is these private inner
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:34.000]  corporate powers and banking powers use government as their shell as their engine as their front
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:39.760]  to run these operations in these other threat countries or what they see as perceivable threats
[3:12:40.320 --> 3:12:46.160]  so this is back in the days of the great game the original great game right the british empire
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:52.960]  seeing its two rivals being germany and russia and so imperial geopolitics is really all about
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:13:01.040]  tricks dirty tricks subversion warfare at every possible level and scale and it's no different
[3:13:01.040 --> 3:13:05.280]  now we still exist in that same kind of world because the world is organized on the basis of
[3:13:05.280 --> 3:13:10.560]  big power blocks large-scale power blocks and principally we're talking about the power block
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:17.600]  of the angle american establishment which is now the packs americana so these secret groups these
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:23.920]  inner uh steering committees royal societies right they're based on this idea of uh being the the
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:30.000]  i mean this is such a fantasy right of being the uh the round table right the the knights of the
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:33.920]  round table right the wise men the knights of the round table this kind of stuff is that's the
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:39.920]  terms that they use for their own governance policies but really these are just cutouts in
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:46.640]  fronts for very very very wealthy families and corporate interests that's it and so
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:52.400]  this is unfortunate but this is really how imperial geopolitics works in the modern era
[3:13:53.040 --> 3:13:57.680]  and we know that it's no different than the british empire uh as it is today for the american
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:02.000]  empire because one of the great strategists great in the sense of important powerful and
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:07.360]  influential the big new brzezinski in his book the grand chessboard he talks about yes of course
[3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:16.720]  america is now a vast empire that has to at all costs uh engage in all kinds of black operations
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:23.280]  proxy wars etc to make sure that no challenger to the angle american power block rises now
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:28.000]  you might think well this isn't this just power politics why wouldn't we agree with brzezinski that
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:32.320]  that maybe that's how it should be maybe we should just engage in whatever is necessary
[3:14:32.320 --> 3:14:38.000]  so that you know we maintain our great standard of living well you have to understand that the
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:42.480]  people that run our country are not interested in maintaining a standard of living in fact
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:47.520]  the really powerful interest in the west the families is like the rock flows for example
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:53.840]  they were involved in for many years promoting the idea of industrialization and consumerism
[3:14:54.640 --> 3:14:59.440]  and then now it flips after things like the club of rome and the first green revolution the first
[3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:02.960]  global revolution where they say that now we're going to decide that humans are the problem
[3:15:02.960 --> 3:15:07.360]  now you can't be a producing economy anymore you can't be an industrially
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:13.280]  industrial based economy anymore now you are bad for your consumerism you see so now they've flipped
[3:15:13.280 --> 3:15:18.240]  it to where it's a guilt trip after the baby boom after that generation after the success
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:24.640]  of the post-war generations the economic boom now it becomes a situation where you're guilty for that
[3:15:24.640 --> 3:15:31.760]  and that's done by design so it's a flip back and forth and so it has nothing to do with the
[3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:36.560]  improving the lives of people in the west or maintaining some sort of free market
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:42.000]  all that is about is phases in terms of rivals so that they can get to the end goal of the great
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:47.840]  reset austerity and destroying the economy in the west and by extension the world that's the
[3:15:47.840 --> 3:15:53.440]  end goal to bring in the new system intentional internal destruction to bring about the end
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:16:00.560]  goal don't go anywhere this is the alex jones show the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:05.920]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:11.200]  and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and
[3:16:11.200 --> 3:16:18.080]  we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:25.840]  internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not
[3:16:25.840 --> 3:16:32.240]  be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lives
[3:16:32.240 --> 3:16:39.200]  and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:44.080]  the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that

[3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:22.320]  analysis and i was just discussing the approach modus operandi of imperial geopolitics and the
[3:20:22.320 --> 3:20:27.760]  attitude of the british empire and how that transition into the packs americana one of the
[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:34.240]  lords in the circles was a guy named lord kurzon and uh him with some other lords they had this
[3:20:34.240 --> 3:20:39.040]  idea there was a book that was put out called the commonwealth of god the idea of being that
[3:20:39.040 --> 3:20:45.120]  we could resurrect the idea of a world government through this idea of putting it into a democratic
[3:20:45.760 --> 3:20:51.600]  free trade commonwealth now i'm not necessarily saying that i'm against free trade or i mean
[3:20:51.600 --> 3:20:57.200]  but the problem is that these ideas can be weaponized and in the sense of the british imperial
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:04.720]  policies they would actually use free trade and economic liberalism as a as a power move as a
[3:21:04.720 --> 3:21:09.440]  form of soft power along with other techniques of soft power as it would eventually be called
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:15.280]  as i think it's a harvard strategist joseph nye wrote he wrote this famous paper some decades ago
[3:21:15.280 --> 3:21:20.560]  about soft power and this is the idea of influencing and exercising influence in other countries in
[3:21:20.560 --> 3:21:26.880]  foreign policy through non-military means could be culture could be economy it could be anything and
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:31.440]  again this is nothing new but uh getting that term and getting that idea across
[3:21:31.440 --> 3:21:36.240]  is something that is crucial to understanding what we do in the west in terms of american foreign
[3:21:36.240 --> 3:21:41.360]  policy so um there's a a theorist who i don't agree with everything that he writes but he did
[3:21:41.360 --> 3:21:47.200]  have a good analysis of where the american geopolitical imperial strategy comes from and
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:51.920]  he links it back to the british empire as do dr carol quigley and then he saw ten and others as
[3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:57.520]  well as brzezinski himself there's a book called a postmodern imperialism by eric wallberg and
[3:21:57.520 --> 3:22:06.000]  wallberg has a great analysis of how the strategies of empire involved first of all internationalism
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:12.880]  no commitment to actual groups of people on the ground right it's it's an overriding international
[3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:19.520]  concern that first and foremost starts with a form of weaponized free trade this number two
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:25.360]  is followed by and by the way this free trade is actually something that is controlled so it's
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:29.920]  not a real free trade it's a free trade for select corporate interests banking interests that actually
[3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:37.440]  run the host government right next is that wars are conducted and done not for the basis of security
[3:22:37.440 --> 3:22:42.480]  or for the basis of self-defense but they're actually done for the purpose of economic gain
[3:22:42.480 --> 3:22:46.640]  and for the purpose of restructuring and extending the empire's power and colonial
[3:22:47.920 --> 3:22:53.600]  basically advantage that's it next is the exceptionalism principle that the anybody
[3:22:53.600 --> 3:22:58.560]  within the states of the empire are actually exempt that nobody's held accountable because
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:04.800]  the individuals be they americans british or whoever they are really not accountable due
[3:23:04.800 --> 3:23:10.960]  to the fact that they're run by the shadow click and they're really they're really cut off from
[3:23:10.960 --> 3:23:15.520]  the real power structure right i mean in america most most americans might might have a little bit
[3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:20.080]  of awareness of an inner shadow group that runs the country but most people unfortunately still
[3:23:20.080 --> 3:23:24.640]  think that the elected leaders are the ones really calling the shots right people think
[3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:28.640]  joe biden is really running the country and calling the shots and really they're just front
[3:23:28.640 --> 3:23:33.600]  people are not they're not they do have a degree of power but they're not the real power structure
[3:23:33.600 --> 3:23:36.880]  and we know that they're not the real power structure because they don't really change
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:42.960]  or influence this overriding plan that's at least 100 plus years old that still marches forward
[3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:47.760]  right and we're actually going past 100 years right we're going back into the 1890s when quigley
[3:23:47.760 --> 3:23:55.120]  talks about the power structure that runs empires okay that controls and has the say so at the
[3:23:55.120 --> 3:24:01.440]  imperial level and that really can't be grasped or understood if we don't understand
[3:24:01.440 --> 3:24:09.280]  and secret inner for banking structures and how private families and private entities gain control
[3:24:09.280 --> 3:24:17.120]  of national bank in the particularly the bank of england and in the bank of france and that same model
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:22.560]  is what happened in the united states with the federal federal reserve system and this is why
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:27.760]  at the time of world war one it was so crucial this is right after we have the passage of the
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:34.000]  federal reserve act right that the creature from jackal island this leads to the creation of
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:40.080]  international banking structures formed on that same model in that same pattern so the same model
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:44.800]  what you have in the british empire what you have in france and then what you eventually have
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:49.520]  unfortunately in the united states the federal reserve system and then these satellite federal
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:55.040]  reserve banks like the federal reserve of new york which according to anthony sudton the federal
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:01.760]  reserve bank of new york had a huge influence on the bolshevik revolution now this is not
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:06.240]  accidental so what we're we're starting to see is this pattern of the revolutions that are being
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:13.360]  conducted in the 1800s and 1900s the 20th century are really private banking corporate revolution
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:18.960]  and they are geared towards an end goal that many independent researchers have come to that
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:25.280]  conclusion of a worldwide international socialist capitalist technocracy it's a myth okay so it's
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:31.840]  a third-way blended system and this is precisely why the central bank of central banks the bank
[3:25:31.840 --> 3:25:37.040]  for international settlements is something that most people don't know about so we argue all day
[3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:41.200]  long about all these politicians and all this stuff but nobody knows that much about the bank
[3:25:41.200 --> 3:25:45.600]  for international settlements which quickly identifies as the central bank of all central
[3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:52.320]  banks and according to wallberg that is the imf and the vis that really are calling the
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:57.040]  shots in terms of the global economy now i'm again i'm not saying that they control everything
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:01.360]  they don't control the whole world and control every single thing but they did have the influential
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:10.000]  power such that they could essentially organize and and and structure world war one and world
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:18.560]  war two and the cold war and this is why uh in order to understand the british today's
[3:26:18.560 --> 3:26:22.240]  empire we have to understand the british empire so basically just think about what you're seeing
[3:26:22.240 --> 3:26:26.560]  there that picture of the bank for international settlements that's basically the federal reserve
[3:26:26.560 --> 3:26:31.920]  of the world that's all you have to know that that's how this works that's how this is structured
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:36.880]  and so when we look at these different scandals that have occurred at different times in history
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:42.800]  when we when we think about for example false flags that set off world wars or set off cold wars
[3:26:42.800 --> 3:26:48.000]  or set off the gulf of time whatever it is gulf of tawkin these kinds of things we find in so many
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  cases engineered secret society groups behind these events they're not organic happenstance
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:01.200]  crazy just out of nowhere things in fact wars are planned years and years ahead of time
[3:27:01.200 --> 3:27:08.160]  people don't know this people think oh it's just a reaction to a random event that happened no no
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:13.440]  wars are planned years in advance that's why hg wells could talk about world war two and what
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:20.480]  was coming with tremendous accuracy years before world war two happened right i think he wrote uh
[3:27:21.040 --> 3:27:26.480]  things to come several years before world war two and he describes in many cases a lot of
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:31.600]  accurate things that occurred in world war two i think he was off by a couple years but it still
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:37.440]  was an accurate description of world war two so when we think about the imperial global strategy
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:44.240]  the british empire again remember that the same power structure is who's running and co-opting
[3:27:44.240 --> 3:27:48.480]  the american government at the time of world war one and world war two eventually and most
[3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:55.840]  powerfully at the time world war two to get it back into global policing remember the attitude
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:28:01.120]  of the founding fathers was non-interventionism and not getting entangled in european wars
[3:28:01.760 --> 3:28:07.360]  and what do we have with the creation of the royal society millner's kindergarten all of these
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:13.920]  these roundtable groups was the intent plan to bring america back under the sway of the british
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:19.040]  empire now the british empire is not anything other than a cutout for what i'm talking about
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:25.280]  this inner shadow group and so they succeeded in doing that by using a bunch of british spies
[3:28:25.280 --> 3:28:31.120]  tricks dirty tricks techniques and tactics to get america from the time where we're wondering
[3:28:31.120 --> 3:28:36.480]  where we're to back into and under the umbrella ages of this shadow power structure and it's not
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:41.360]  just british people it's not just america it's very elite powerful families in both of these
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:47.120]  countries you see that are that are behind this shadow they were that's it's that easy is that
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:52.720]  something and they run it through banking and corporate power this is the option don't go anywhere

[3:31:01.440 --> 3:31:07.760]  foundations of our republic i wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name in fact
[3:31:07.760 --> 3:31:15.760]  i bet it does i bet it's called operation matador they see us as the bull and they are shaky a red
[3:31:16.320 --> 3:31:23.440]  flag in our face and the matador is the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword
[3:31:23.440 --> 3:31:28.880]  so that when the bull lunges forward the matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the
[3:31:28.880 --> 3:31:34.720]  heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust they've got the
[3:31:34.720 --> 3:31:40.080]  ace of spades in their hand which is false flags before you launch a war you stage false flags

[3:32:58.320 --> 3:33:04.320]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:12.240 --> 3:33:16.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host jade and i'm jason aulsis and uh i was
[3:33:16.240 --> 3:33:22.240]  just calling attention to the imperial british strategy that they had to bring america and
[3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:27.040]  its colonies back under their influence and support and we know about this again from
[3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:32.560]  multiple books and history a mainline historical records that have been written one of those was
[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:36.800]  the book called the irregulars which talks about as i pointed out many times in the past the
[3:33:37.360 --> 3:33:42.400]  british spies that were sent over uh at the behest of the british power structure to
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:48.640]  get these people in america these unruly americans to set up the same types of secret
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:53.920]  round table groups that have been set up in the uk right so we had in the in in new york
[3:33:53.920 --> 3:33:58.400]  these different uh uh steering committees and structures that were set up the council on foreign
[3:33:58.400 --> 3:34:04.480]  relations uh pratt house uh these are all modeled on the the round table models that we've seen
[3:34:05.520 --> 3:34:10.640]  in quigley's discussion of the british establishment and so as i mentioned millner's
[3:34:10.640 --> 3:34:14.960]  kindergarten millner's kindergarten was one of these recruiting strategies and ways to bring
[3:34:14.960 --> 3:34:20.240]  people into these groups to teach them world socialism imperial socialism and they'll say
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:24.480]  these things lord quickly quotes millner is saying well there are there's bad socialism but there's
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:30.640]  this good imperial world socialism that we'll bring about and he even talks about that democracy
[3:34:30.640 --> 3:34:37.360]  would be a cloak for this you see so uh democracy free markets the good of the people all the
[3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:45.920]  humanitarian cover that is used originates also in the british imperial strategy and so the common
[3:34:45.920 --> 3:34:51.040]  wealths but as they're called or the queen's commonwealth these kinds of things those aren't
[3:34:51.040 --> 3:34:57.120]  actually democratic states they're states that have a front of democracy that are actually controlled
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:02.960]  by the same elite power structure that's been there for the whole time right so that's what they
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:09.120]  wanted to do in america was have that same covert government that they had in the uk and
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:15.440]  unfortunately they were successful um the regulars who came over again not not just roald all but
[3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:23.360]  also william stevensson uh noel coward in flaming they all helped influence and convince the american
[3:35:23.360 --> 3:35:29.840]  power structure to set up the same covert national security deep state government that was existing
[3:35:29.840 --> 3:35:36.560]  in the in the uk and this is why we've had no real change in any kind of policies for the last
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:41.920]  i don't know 70 80 quickly even says 100 years and he was writing that back in the 60s so this is
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:47.520]  why it's so difficult to quote drain the swamp or to change thing is because this structure is so
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:55.120]  deeply embedded and has been for so long this national security covert deep inner core government
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:36:02.720]  right which there's kind of a layer of spies and espionage people who then protect and cover the
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:09.120]  inner group of the wealthiest families so it's it's a very difficult egg to crack you see because
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:14.880]  it has these concentric rings and if everybody remembers in the in the trump administration
[3:36:14.880 --> 3:36:19.360]  for example when he talked about draining the swamp and then what did the the spy chiefs and
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:24.160]  the people from the espionage world oh well they have a thousand and one ways to get back at you
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:29.360]  if you try to go against that inner and it's structured this way on purpose you see and
[3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:35.440]  unfortunately they can just cook up any myriad of made up totally fake things ppgate all this
[3:36:35.440 --> 3:36:40.480]  kind of stuff russia collusion it's all made up but the public doesn't know that this is how the
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:44.640]  world is actually structured and runs and so they just unfortunately fall for whatever the
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:51.040]  mainstream media says but over and over and over we constantly see everything that the quote
[3:36:51.040 --> 3:36:56.240]  conspiracy theorists are saying vindicated and there have been conspiracy researchers
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:01.920]  for decades and decades pointing this out john colman's book committee of 300 he talked about
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:06.880]  all these same things that and it wasn't because they theorized this out of their butt they didn't
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:12.160]  just get this out of the ether make it up it's because all of these establishment books say
[3:37:12.160 --> 3:37:17.200]  this stuff it's mainline history and that's why when i was studying this stuff and undergrad
[3:37:17.200 --> 3:37:22.480]  school i was astounded to see that all this was just out there in the mainstream book not even
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:26.560]  really hidden and i think the people from the establishment view it like well that's just the
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:34.400]  way it is right i mean the british empire's modus operandi was malthusianism and that's why it's an
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:39.920]  austerity great reset when you hear prince charles up there saying the same things as claus because
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:44.720]  he was formative in the creation of the world economic forum because he's always taught himself
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:52.000]  to these environmental movements it's because they believe in a form of darwinian social social
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:58.400]  darwinism and austerity malthusianism right they believe that there's a hierarchy of beings that
[3:37:58.400 --> 3:38:04.080]  exist and if you haven't evolved to be a you know global controller with a lot of money and power
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:10.640]  then you deserve to die because you didn't survive that you you weren't evolutionary you weren't fit
[3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:15.920]  to survive this there's nothing wrong with getting rid of you because they are the priests of power
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:22.160]  according to their own terminology but this is all based on a faulty worldview right it's that
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:28.080]  that's only true and so far as the worldview is true right and if pragmatic empiricism and
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:34.320]  darwinism aren't actually true then that's not gonna work you can't just kill everybody
[3:38:34.320 --> 3:38:40.160]  and think that you're gonna have a bright future and that's why oddly enough these people believe
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:45.920]  in a weird cult right the transhumanist idea is some kind of weird cult where they think
[3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:50.720]  they're going to live forever in computers or that silicon-based life forms are gonna somehow
[3:38:50.720 --> 3:38:55.680]  give them a form of they really do believe this and they've written many many books about that
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:01.520]  and it doesn't matter how philosophically incoherent absurd it is they still believe it
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:07.760]  because guess what it's a religious attachment right what most people don't realize is that
[3:39:07.760 --> 3:39:12.400]  everybody's worldview everybody's belief systems are at some level faith-based you have to have
[3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:16.800]  some kind of element of trust what are you putting your trust in well for these people they're putting
[3:39:16.800 --> 3:39:22.640]  a trust in science or scientism as if it's some kind of god when actually all science is an
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:28.640]  instrument it's just a tool a tool can't be the grand narrative explanation of everything it can't
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:34.000]  be god it's just a tool so they're going way beyond the bounds of science and they don't even realize
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:39.840]  it to adopt the kind of religion and if you do if you doubt that just look at everybody's attitude
[3:39:39.840 --> 3:39:48.240]  who was a normie blue pill person for the last three years since 2020 2019 how did they treat
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:55.680]  the decrees of the CDC and the UN and the WHO as if it was religious decrees from Mount Olympus
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:40:02.080]  the mass became a kind of sacrament the vaccines are kind of sacrament and all of us who criticized
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:06.400]  and warned about this have now been vindicated all these blood of studies coming out this last
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:11.680]  week that Alex has covered we've been vindicated not because we put doubt science but because we
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:20.000]  know the power of corporate influence in large-scale big science or scientism that's what we were
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:24.400]  concerned with nobody was doubting science that was just a propaganda technique that the
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:28.880]  establishment was using you're a science denier well so that is even that doesn't even make any
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:36.160]  sense a science denier I mean anybody who uses a calculator to you know balance their checkbook
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:43.040]  is using scientific principles anybody who works in engineering right uses the scientific method
[3:40:43.040 --> 3:40:49.520]  to do engineering so it doesn't even make any sense it's all propaganda it's all politicized
[3:40:49.520 --> 3:40:55.200]  science which isn't even science but remember the same people who are saying this are saying that
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:40:59.920]  men can have babies and that you can become a woman which is just completely impossible
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:06.080]  and irrational but it's that way also on purpose to get people to accept contradictions that was
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:09.680]  the whole point of what Orwell was writing about but another important thing that people have missed
[3:41:09.680 --> 3:41:14.560]  in Orwell is that as a person and Alex has talked about this for years as a person who was in the
[3:41:14.560 --> 3:41:19.760]  establishment from the left perspective and also saw things on the right-wing perspective what was
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:27.520]  the real point of 1984 and a lot of what he talked about his point was that the left movement the
[3:41:27.520 --> 3:41:34.160]  things that you think are anti-establishment that are counterculture most of the time those are
[3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:39.760]  controlled opposition that was the key point and this is a key point that I'm trying to get you
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:45.120]  to understand that is so crucial that Dr. Sutton said back in the 70s when he wrote Walsh
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:51.600]  for the Bolshevik Revolution he said when I read Dr. Quigley I had to realize that it was time to
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:57.840]  set aside that classic left-right dialectic of American politics and modern liberalism and
[3:41:57.840 --> 3:42:03.440]  conservatism he said because I realized that it's not a battle of Marxism versus capitalism he says
[3:42:03.440 --> 3:42:09.360]  if you believe that the battle was really just Marxist versus capitalist he says that is a
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:16.000]  Marxist attitude you're actually buying into the Marxist attitude if you believe that everything
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:23.200]  is about a presser oppressed narrative right capitalist versus Marxist he says not what
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:29.360]  actually was the case was Marxism and socialism are tools of very very powerful wealthy people
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:35.840]  and they are cognizant of that there are people that are in the know about that in fact in my
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:41.440]  mainline history class my mainline Marxism classes in college my professor who was he wasn't a
[3:42:41.440 --> 3:42:47.360]  conspiracy theorist at all he said Marx couldn't have done anything without the wealthy stock owners
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:52.480]  like Ingalls behind him why would wealthy people be behind Marxism do you think that they're all
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:59.520]  stupid don't go anywhere well answer that when we come back info wars work has never been having a
[3:42:59.520 --> 3:43:06.240]  bigger effect than it's having right now and today is do or die time if info wars gets the funding
[3:43:06.240 --> 3:43:10.160]  into the midterms in the next year we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever but
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:16.080]  if we don't I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main
[3:43:16.080 --> 3:43:22.640]  operations I've done my work I've put everything into it I'm leaving it on the field but I believe

[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:10.000]  by the controlled churches and the universities why is this the case because we innately by god
[3:44:10.880 --> 3:44:16.000]  have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyches our own souls and by connecting to god
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:23.360]  we can empower ourselves and trend send the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:30.080]  ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering
[3:44:30.080 --> 3:44:34.880]  us they're only making us more depressed coming in they're only making us less filled it is only
[3:44:34.880 --> 3:44:40.160]  by going within and really making that connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves that's
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:45.920]  why the globals bombardous toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:51.600]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the

[3:46:57.120 --> 3:47:03.040]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:03.040 --> 3:47:23.200]  we're discussing the british empire it's uh techniques and tactics of espionage and the version
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:28.160]  and certain players and characters that are crucial to understanding this narrative of the 20th
[3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:32.960]  century and particularly where we're going in the great reset and there's a great page in uh
[3:47:32.960 --> 3:47:40.560]  Sutton's book where he gets into lord melner who uh told the the british government to have a dual
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:44.960]  policy particularly the lord the the lords the lords gorge government if you remember when we
[3:47:44.960 --> 3:47:50.480]  covered dr carol quigley that dual policy also applied to tiny mustache men right the british
[3:47:50.480 --> 3:47:56.960]  had a dual policy because according to quigley they wanted to go to hitler into trying to take
[3:47:56.960 --> 3:48:01.840]  poland and trying to take these countries because they eventually had a war plan so they gave a
[3:48:01.840 --> 3:48:07.760]  dual policy that one that was public disapproval but private approval well guess what there was
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:15.040]  a dual policy from lord melner to the bolsheviks and what's amazing is that when we get deep into a
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:20.080]  lot of these famous british spy biographies they actually divulge a lot of this we actually find
[3:48:20.080 --> 3:48:26.640]  out that something else seems to be going on here as opposed to what the public story is right of the
[3:48:26.640 --> 3:48:31.760]  western uh opposition to communism and this kind of so there seems to be something more at
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:37.360]  at stake here that kicks off what will later be the cold war and so melner has this uh famous
[3:48:37.360 --> 3:48:43.200]  character that he sends who is the british intelligence liaison to the bolsheviks his
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:50.560]  name is bruce lockhart famous british spy and he was part of that uh dual policy and because the
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:54.960]  the british power structure couldn't openly say that they supported socialism they had a private
[3:48:54.960 --> 3:49:02.400]  inner party like like melner and others working together with uh rochelle who sent lockhart
[3:49:02.400 --> 3:49:08.720]  to be the secret go-between to say hey by the way pss we actually support you guys lin and trotsky
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:15.840]  etc now there's a couple characters who eventually got detained uh one of them was a revolutionary
[3:49:15.840 --> 3:49:21.760]  who i think was an anarcho-communist so he fell afoul of trotsky and lin and these characters his
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:29.120]  name is maxim gorky and when gorky was caught and uh uh interrogated i think this is in russia
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:37.040]  he said well what i've discovered is that the revolution the bolshevik revolution is actually
[3:49:37.040 --> 3:49:42.400]  quote a giant science experiment now that's interesting because we find other british
[3:49:42.400 --> 3:49:48.640]  establishment people also calling the russian revolution a quote science experiment it was
[3:49:48.640 --> 3:49:55.600]  burgeon russell and hg wells it's fascinating that we find this plethora of characters saying that
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:50:01.600]  it's a science experiment from very different worlds very different uh ideologies but we
[3:50:01.600 --> 3:50:06.800]  were finding commonalities which to me suggests that people were actually stumbling upon what
[3:50:06.800 --> 3:50:11.520]  was really going on a long time ago and they couldn't really make sense of it they couldn't make sense
[3:50:11.520 --> 3:50:17.120]  of how it's the case that the western power structure elites would actually be supporting
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:23.280]  what is supposed to be the very opposite of their whole ideology and we have to i think
[3:50:23.280 --> 3:50:27.280]  for some of these people right they were bound by their time and by their limitations they didn't
[3:50:27.280 --> 3:50:32.640]  have the internet they didn't even have access to even necessarily the libraries that we have today so
[3:50:32.640 --> 3:50:37.920]  you know they they just couldn't figure a lot of this stuff out and there's another case study
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:44.160]  of this which is again uh somewhat theoretical we don't know if this is a hundred percent sure
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:49.200]  but it does ring true given what we've seen what we learned since then in a lot of these things
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:54.640]  that have come out and it's called the red symphony which is a famous interrogation of a guy who was
[3:50:54.640 --> 3:51:04.160]  caught uh under the stalin government um as an as an operative i think of uh of trotsky and if
[3:51:04.160 --> 3:51:09.280]  if you know the history of course trotsky fellow fellow stalin and stalin ended up going after trotsky
[3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:14.720]  and this is a guy named cg rikofsky and if you're looking for this it's called the red symphony
[3:51:14.720 --> 3:51:18.960]  it's actually uh it's it's in the public domain and it's in quite a few different works i have a
[3:51:18.960 --> 3:51:22.880]  copy of it in a book i don't agree with everything in this book but it just happens to have a copy of
[3:51:22.880 --> 3:51:29.520]  this this interrogation it's called uh forthright of the rich and it's also about this uh principle
[3:51:29.520 --> 3:51:35.600]  of world socialism fascism et cetera communism marxism being supported by the wealthiest people
[3:51:35.600 --> 3:51:42.880]  in the west and this interrogation is fascinating because there's a the stalinists are interrogating
[3:51:42.880 --> 3:51:48.960]  this guy and there they come to find out this guy says well i'm actually working for very rich
[3:51:48.960 --> 3:51:52.880]  people in the west and they're kind of taken aback by this what do you mean he says well
[3:51:53.520 --> 3:51:59.440]  there's a lot of powerful interests that i support or excuse me that i'm actually working for and
[3:51:59.440 --> 3:52:07.200]  they have a long-term goal he says of world socialist technocratic control and guess what
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:14.000]  it's the same thing that comes up in this so there seems to be this curious pattern of again
[3:52:14.000 --> 3:52:18.080]  over and over and over again this is a speculative and we don't know if that's for sure but what we
[3:52:18.080 --> 3:52:24.320]  do know is that when we read people like lockhart the memoirs of a british agent he was the liaison
[3:52:24.320 --> 3:52:31.840]  between the elite imperial socialists who supported the bolshevik we find continually this pattern of
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:36.000]  supporting these kinds of movement now that doesn't mean everybody right not everybody
[3:52:36.720 --> 3:52:42.400]  in the british power structure for example was party to this or knew that people at the government
[3:52:42.400 --> 3:52:47.360]  level they typically didn't know this but it would be people in the establishment in the spy
[3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:52.560]  establishment in the security establishment and these inner party people that quickly describes
[3:52:52.560 --> 3:52:57.760]  it calls them the inner party the society of the elect they knew this bigger plan this bigger strategy
[3:52:59.760 --> 3:53:04.640]  because they were not working for public officials they were working for private interests
[3:53:05.280 --> 3:53:13.360]  private families old money banking families nobility etc all a party to this inner structure
[3:53:15.280 --> 3:53:18.800]  and this helps explain a lot of people get confused over how do we have people like prince
[3:53:18.800 --> 3:53:26.480]  Bernhard who was an ss working at with right people at bilderberg world economic forum etc
[3:53:26.480 --> 3:53:30.640]  these people who were national socialists that doesn't make sense with working with
[3:53:30.640 --> 3:53:35.280]  people from the west who are opposed to national socialism we'll just look up autoscoresse any
[3:53:35.280 --> 3:53:39.680]  look up the right hard galen network and you'll find that at that level it really doesn't matter
[3:53:39.680 --> 3:53:46.400]  what the ideologies are at that level it's a supra ideological power structure and they don't
[3:53:46.400 --> 3:53:51.360]  really care about the operating systems and the experiments in history those have come and gone
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:57.680]  now we're in a new phase where the war on terror has given away now to the next phase isn't it
[3:53:57.680 --> 3:54:00.080]  interesting by the way do you notice the war on terror just kind of went away
[3:54:01.280 --> 3:54:06.640]  where do the muslim terrorists just like conveniently and politely take a break from
[3:54:06.640 --> 3:54:11.520]  doing anything during the cove that was very nice of them to just take a a nice little break from
[3:54:11.520 --> 3:54:19.440]  any any sort of global terror now remember we had post 9 11 years and years of war on terror and they
[3:54:19.440 --> 3:54:24.240]  said uh didn't john mccainch out war on terror is never ending on every end war on terror forever
[3:54:24.240 --> 3:54:33.040]  it's forever hundred year war that's been forgotten now we're in the war on viruses
[3:54:33.040 --> 3:54:39.120]  for global health pandemic you see how quickly the script changed the invisible enemy of the
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:43.360]  fact they even use the same terminology the invisible enemy of terror which will never we
[3:54:43.360 --> 3:54:48.000]  can't see them they're everywhere it's invisible we got to track and trace everything to save you
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:52.640]  from terror now it's we got to track and trace everything to save you from the invisible enemy
[3:54:52.640 --> 3:55:00.400]  the virus it's exact same propaganda just flipped to the new fabled enemy of the coup fit and the
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:07.440]  virus and really all of those ends were achieved in terms of the transition on a mass scale in
[3:55:07.440 --> 3:55:12.640]  those two years of the lockdowns to move us into technocracy remember the lockstep document said
[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:17.920]  not in lockstep but in one of the other the green scenario the smart scenario is that there would be
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:23.840]  a transition to more and more automation and more and more of a green austerity agenda this
[3:55:23.840 --> 3:55:31.920]  austerity agenda is the exact same agenda of british malfeasian policy the idea that you
[3:55:31.920 --> 3:55:38.640]  have to shut down everything for the earth climate lockdowns that's the new thing that they're going
[3:55:38.640 --> 3:55:44.640]  to say they are moving now into shutting down of the fuels fossil it's not even fossil fuel
[3:55:44.640 --> 3:55:50.080]  it's not fossil fossil fuels you actually think oil is ground up dinosaur bones come on not what
[3:55:50.080 --> 3:55:56.400]  oil is i don't know what oil is but i know it's not that that's dumb whatever it is it's not killing
[3:55:56.400 --> 3:56:05.040]  the planet that's all cover to shut down the economy and people don't understand that international
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:11.120]  supra corporate supra national entities what i'm talking about this inner core of austerity people
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:17.840]  world economic forum they don't care about profit not about making money that's why these companies
[3:56:17.840 --> 3:56:23.600]  are enacting all these policies that don't make them money they have a plan to destroy the existing
[3:56:23.600 --> 3:56:28.960]  order destroy it from within this is actually that's part of military strategy to intentionally
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:33.520]  destroy your own thing at times so that you can have the justification to bring in the new thing
[3:56:34.560 --> 3:56:38.880]  that's exactly what that guy from i think the cdc said before the covid so we need to just
[3:56:38.880 --> 3:56:44.880]  blow up the existing medical system to bring in the new system that's what this is there's an
[3:56:44.880 --> 3:56:51.120]  intended destruction of the economy to bring in the new system what is the new system circular
[3:56:51.120 --> 3:56:55.200]  economy you own nothing you share your whitey tides with everybody else in your neighborhood
[3:56:55.920 --> 3:57:02.640]  you don't get to buy gas to drive down the road because you hurt the planet so they're right
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:06.880]  now they're rolling out the very thing that they said you will not drive cars you will they said
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:12.720]  years ago they would start getting rid of cars and it's nothing to do with the with the the
[3:57:12.720 --> 3:57:17.440]  environment it's everything to do with control and shutting down the existing system to bring in the
[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:23.600]  technocratic control which these socialist bolshevik people said they wanted a hundred years ago
