[08:46.680 --> 08:50.760]  here the rest of the story today with Jesse Ventura we also have an
[08:50.760 --> 08:53.400]  investigative journalist has been working with the former congressman
[08:53.400 --> 08:58.480]  Hanson on the true history of the vicious political persecutions that the
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.320]  IRS has carried out mainly under Democrats though there has been some
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.760]  political persecution using the IRS by Republicans Nixon was removed from
[09:08.760 --> 09:13.720]  office for it that's what he finally got in trouble for under Obama it's
[09:13.720 --> 09:19.360]  conservatively a hundred thousand times worse Nixon did it to about a hundred
[09:19.360 --> 09:27.840]  and twenty-something people Obama has done it to millions millions millions
[09:27.840 --> 09:32.240]  well over a million people have been messed with some jailed I mean if that
[09:32.240 --> 09:38.000]  doesn't concern everybody whoa and Anastasia Suza being arrested trying to
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.160]  stop his film from coming out being threatened being told to back off or
[09:42.160 --> 09:47.040]  you're gonna get it then they came after him again if Michael Moore was
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.760]  arrested and thrown in jail for making his films and set up I would come to his
[09:51.760 --> 09:53.840]  aid even though I don't agree with him on most things
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.960]  Vanessa Suza agree with on most things but it's the same deal you let political
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.880]  persecution happen to anybody it will bite you in the butt every time it was
[10:03.880 --> 10:08.840]  the famous pastor who was in Nazi Germany and he he wrote while living in a
[10:08.840 --> 10:14.080]  death camp first they came for the labor unions I wasn't a labor union then they
[10:14.080 --> 10:17.040]  came for the communist I wasn't a communist then they came for the Jews I
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.520]  wasn't a Jew and finally they came for me he was a Baptist wasn't he and then
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.720]  there was nobody else there to stand up for me this is how this works ladies and
[10:26.720 --> 10:35.360]  gentlemen and tyranny can shell itself going after a bad group like communist
[10:35.360 --> 10:38.720]  or radical Muslims or whatever but then it ends up setting the precedent to go
[10:38.720 --> 10:43.120]  after gun owners the Tea Party libertarians the guys found the quote
[10:43.120 --> 10:49.120]  I'll put it back up on screen first they came is a famous statement and
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.760]  provocative poem attributed to Pastor Martin Neimiebler how do you pronounce
[10:54.760 --> 11:01.160]  it you moldy a I can't even read it across the room about the cowardice of
[11:01.160 --> 11:06.320]  the German intellectuals following the Nazis rise to power and the subsequent
[11:06.320 --> 11:12.040]  purging of their chosen targets group by group there is some disagreement over
[11:12.040 --> 11:17.160]  the exact wording of the quotation and when it was created the content of the
[11:17.160 --> 11:22.720]  quotation may have been presented differently by the pastor on different
[11:22.720 --> 11:26.720]  occasions but it's known that he basically said first they came for the
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.200]  socialist and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist then they
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.040]  came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade
[11:33.040 --> 11:36.280]  unionist then they came for the Jews I did not speak out because I was not a Jew
[11:36.280 --> 11:42.000]  then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me and he created
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.560]  multiple versions of it while he was in a forced labor camp it was first able to
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.880]  write it down in 1946 didn't mean to digress off into that but it's an
[11:53.880 --> 12:01.680]  important point to make and before I get into the huge Ebola news and the huge
[12:01.680 --> 12:15.600]  border news and the huge Russian news before I get into all that I have three
[12:15.600 --> 12:19.920]  different articles in front of me one from two days ago and two from today
[12:19.920 --> 12:28.280]  that are both up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com police officer says
[12:28.280 --> 12:40.320]  if Obama doesn't follow the Constitution we don't have to New Jersey cop boy is
[12:40.320 --> 12:43.640]  that video not a Rosetta Stone we're gonna play it here in a moment with the
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.040]  gentleman who shot the video's commentary then it dovetails with the video two
[12:48.040 --> 12:54.160]  days ago time stamped last week where the where the truck drivers driving
[12:54.160 --> 12:58.120]  through an internal checkpoint 70 miles from the Texas border and they say are
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.400]  you a US citizen and he says does it matter and the Border Patrol guy says
[13:02.400 --> 13:09.360]  no not anymore and waves him through those two clips go together and then they
[13:09.360 --> 13:14.480]  go together with this clip that's coming up 9-1-1 dispatchers insane
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.720]  instructions to a woman whose house is being robbed put down the gun I'm here
[13:20.720 --> 13:23.960]  feel somebody's already breaking in my house and already in it when she found
[13:23.960 --> 13:27.520]  him I'm not gonna call 9-1-1 and say what do I do because the guy might be
[13:27.520 --> 13:33.400]  armed he's gonna get the jump on me I'm gonna creep up look around the corner
[13:33.400 --> 13:40.480]  if the person's got a firearm in my house I'm gonna drop them if they don't
[13:40.480 --> 13:45.120]  have a visible weapon I'm gonna say you've got three seconds I don't want to
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.000]  startle them either because they might panic and pull the gun I'm gonna say you
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.720]  got three seconds to get down on the ground before I feel you full of holes
[13:52.720 --> 13:58.840]  when I called 9-1-1 she kept saying well put the gun down put the gun down and
[13:58.840 --> 14:05.320]  I said I'll put the gun down when I see the police and then there's more to
[14:05.320 --> 14:11.560]  that newscast coming up but this is the type of stuff that's going on you don't
[14:11.560 --> 14:14.560]  tell an 80 year old woman put the gun down when her husband's out of town
[14:14.560 --> 14:20.240]  fishing and the person's breaking in in the middle of the night you got two
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.920]  choices if you got a back door and you don't have kids you can leave the house
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.920]  and call the police and quite frankly I don't want to deal with a dead burglar
[14:28.920 --> 14:34.720]  in my house I'll be honest I would think about just leaving if I was saying a
[14:34.720 --> 14:40.720]  back bedroom at a backyard and a way to get out in the back gate and then I just
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.080]  call the cops around side they get busted in the act inside because I don't
[14:46.080 --> 14:49.760]  want to deal with a dead person but if you're in my house and I'm say upstairs
[14:49.760 --> 14:54.080]  and I can't get out I'm gonna draw down on you I'm gonna tell you to get on the
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.240]  ground and if you don't get on the ground I'm gonna start shooting and law in
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.080]  almost every state of course allows and authorizes and encourages that because
[15:02.080 --> 15:08.600]  this is how people get killed folks now when the cops get there you know it's
[15:08.600 --> 15:12.320]  best to just talk to a lawyer first before you talk to him because the cops
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.840]  usually understand the common sense of defending yourself that some of the
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.560]  district attorneys now will try to prosecute you even of the person's
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.600]  armed in your house if you say shoot a couple times and they turn and run and
[15:26.600 --> 15:31.600]  because the adrenaline you keep shooting and then they die on the street they'll
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.040]  say why'd you keep shooting well I've he needed to die you're being honest they'll
[15:36.040 --> 15:39.560]  try to twist it to say it's premeditated when obviously it isn't you got
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.080]  somebody in your house they're attacking you they're coming after you they're
[15:44.080 --> 15:49.000]  violating you you've got adrenaline going it is a passionate defense not a
[15:49.000 --> 15:56.400]  crime of passion a passionate defense that's why even though it's sad when it
[15:56.400 --> 16:01.480]  happens the cops get let off when somebody gets out of their car pulls a
[16:01.480 --> 16:05.080]  cell phone out of their pocket it's at night it looks like a gun on the
[16:05.080 --> 16:10.880]  surveillance tape the cops shoot you it looks like a gun things like that are
[16:10.880 --> 16:16.000]  going to happen it's a sad thing but statistically the citizens are safer the
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.440]  police are safer everyone's safer when you have a right to defend yourself in
[16:21.440 --> 16:25.480]  your home look at the crime numbers on DC New York at Chicago with their gun
[16:25.480 --> 16:31.200]  bands we've put the graphs up on screen before you can look them up but crime
[16:31.200 --> 16:34.600]  rates have dropped 52% in violent crime everywhere else in the country since
[16:34.600 --> 16:42.160]  1992 while exponentially rising in those three cities Chicago ladies and
[16:42.160 --> 16:45.880]  gentlemen has roughly I saw this in the Houston Chronicle a few months ago you
[16:45.880 --> 16:53.200]  can pull it up 14 times the crime rate of even Houston for murders and in
[16:53.200 --> 16:58.800]  shootings and Houston's a dangerous city so could you imagine living in a place
[16:58.800 --> 17:02.960]  where only the criminals have guns it's a terrible thing let's go ahead though and
[17:02.960 --> 17:05.680]  first play this police officer and then I'll give you the rest of the story on
[17:05.680 --> 17:12.560]  it in New Jersey responding to a complaint about corruption and having his
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.360]  rights violated by asserting that law enforcement officers no longer need to
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.240]  follow the Constitution because it's already been decimated by President
[17:21.240 --> 17:27.800]  Obama so I love the argument Obama's bad and he's violating everybody's rights
[17:27.800 --> 17:31.920]  and setting the precedent so I don't have to follow it either and I'm not
[17:31.920 --> 17:37.200]  gonna let you follow a complaint so Obama's bad so I'm gonna act just like
[17:37.200 --> 17:46.480]  him or Obama's bad so I can rob banks or government officials are allowed to be
[17:46.480 --> 17:58.760]  pedophiles so I'm gonna go out and you know try to rob liquor stores no we
[17:58.760 --> 18:03.920]  bring them to justice we call them out politically we convict them in the court
[18:03.920 --> 18:08.480]  of public opinion we don't then just give into it and then say no holds barred
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.640]  now now all these unconstitutional laws unconstitutional taxes that are meant
[18:12.640 --> 18:15.560]  to destroy us it's your decision whether to pay them or not we're getting to the
[18:15.560 --> 18:20.080]  point of non-compliance and civil disobedience but you cannot have quote
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.600]  civil disobedience against the citizens violating their rights cuz Obama's
[18:24.600 --> 18:28.360]  doing it but that is gonna start happening where government across the
[18:28.360 --> 18:31.920]  board is gonna get even worse at the low level that's how tyranny's always
[18:31.920 --> 18:37.600]  unfolded as I've told you folks and this history shows when the big guys in the
[18:37.600 --> 18:42.160]  Soviet Communist Nazi Party whatever the case is get away with bloody murder
[18:42.160 --> 18:45.640]  pretty soon the mid-level then the low level get away with it and all hell
[18:45.640 --> 18:49.360]  breaks loose and the public turns against the system let's go ahead and go
[18:49.360 --> 18:54.080]  to this clip of the cop rights were violated my civil rights were violated
[18:54.080 --> 18:59.560]  right because Obama has decimated the frigate constitution so I don't give a
[18:59.560 --> 19:02.960]  damn cuz if he doesn't follow the Constitution we don't have this New Jersey
[19:02.960 --> 19:06.440]  case law yes you you don't have did you get that yeah it doesn't have to follow
[19:06.440 --> 19:10.960]  the Constitution can you say that one more time I'm not sure I heard it
[19:10.960 --> 19:16.160]  clearly Obama has decimated the frigate constitution so I don't give a damn
[19:16.160 --> 19:19.360]  because if he doesn't follow the Constitution we don't have this New Jersey
[19:19.360 --> 19:22.920]  case law just tell me that one more time so I completely understand what you
[19:22.920 --> 19:27.440]  just said Obama has decimated the frigate constitution so I don't give a damn
[19:27.440 --> 19:30.920]  because if he doesn't follow the Constitution we don't have this New Jersey case law
[19:30.920 --> 19:35.520]  you're aware of your rights and I don't like that so just talk about a property
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.080]  this is probably property we're gonna come back with the rest of the story give
[19:39.080 --> 19:44.040]  me the details but I want to get the guy that shot this video on because I want
[19:44.040 --> 19:47.760]  to see if the cops making a rhetorical point or whether this is edited or whether

[24:28.560 --> 24:34.720]  of just over the top bizarre tyranny and I'm gonna get into all that news coming
[24:34.720 --> 24:42.880]  up the next segment but I want to discuss the larger issue of a government
[24:42.880 --> 24:46.960]  that goes okay it is illegal for us to spy on you without warrants and we are
[24:46.960 --> 24:50.520]  using it for political control and to track what you're buying and doing to
[24:50.520 --> 24:54.360]  corner the market and fix the stock market and shut down our competition and
[24:54.360 --> 24:58.680]  we are reading all your emails and so are private corporations and we are
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.640]  selling your health data to everybody illegally and we are putting different
[25:02.640 --> 25:06.320]  chemicals in the water to control you that's in the news now and we do take
[25:06.320 --> 25:09.920]  foster children and test pesticides on until they die and nobody's gonna get
[25:09.920 --> 25:14.840]  in trouble and we are building emergency FEMA camps to put political
[25:14.840 --> 25:19.400]  distance in and we are gonna violate your rights and we are gonna give
[25:19.400 --> 25:22.760]  billions of dollars openly to our political friends we're gonna ship guns
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.360]  into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and run a false flag and we're
[25:26.360 --> 25:31.280]  gonna openly arm al Qaeda and change their name to IS to confuse the public
[25:31.280 --> 25:36.760]  or ISIS and we're gonna let George Soros overthrow Ukraine start a war with
[25:36.760 --> 25:42.200]  Russia get not saying Putin's good but it'd be like if our government was
[25:42.200 --> 25:46.960]  starting a war with China it's crazy is what it is we lose the moral high ground
[25:46.960 --> 25:52.120]  but look who runs our government people like George Soros and David Rockefeller
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.280]  with a bunch of weirdos who are really just organized crime like Robford
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.800]  Redford and and and Michael Moore who all have armed bodyguards and won our
[26:01.800 --> 26:05.840]  guns and want to raise taxes on poor people but they're always getting out
[26:05.840 --> 26:13.200]  of taxes and in Warren Buffett literally tax exempt lobbying 24-7 to raise taxes
[26:13.200 --> 26:18.440]  on poor people to get banker bailout money to stuff in his wallet while he
[26:18.440 --> 26:23.160]  funds eugenics operations it makes me want to throw up so here are these clips
[26:23.160 --> 26:28.440]  together of the cop in New Jersey today this came out this on info wars.com and
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.520]  the board of patrol in in Texas saying no yeah go on in that matter if you're
[26:32.520 --> 26:37.000]  a citizen or not here it is Obama has decimated the frigging
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.920]  Constitution so I don't give a damn because if he doesn't follow the
[26:39.920 --> 26:43.640]  Constitution we don't have it's New Jersey case law yes you you don't have did
[26:43.640 --> 27:01.920]  you get that not anymore unfortunately now that guy's a good guy he just says
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.480]  no not anymore waves him on through being honest the other guy I haven't
[27:06.480 --> 27:09.480]  there's a little more on the clip we'll try to play the whole thing coming up I
[27:09.480 --> 27:14.120]  want to get the folks that put the video out on the show as I said earlier but
[27:14.120 --> 27:19.240]  I've had cops tell me I don't want to hear about the Constitution when I'm in a
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.760]  jail cell for protesting or whatever and they're pushing my head in the wall or
[27:23.760 --> 27:29.520]  you know whatever and I just look at them and I go don't you understand you're
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.480]  gonna lose the checks and balances as well and you're not gonna have any
[27:33.480 --> 27:38.400]  security or your children and invariably are you threatening my children and then
[27:38.400 --> 27:43.320]  I say boy you really have a problem I guess that was a jail guard in that case
[27:43.320 --> 27:48.760]  when I'm clearly saying don't you care about your children and then invariably
[27:48.760 --> 27:53.240]  they say nobody's gonna fix it it's just gonna get worse I'm going along with it
[27:53.240 --> 27:59.240]  a fatalist given to the corruption join the corruption so you feel like you're a
[27:59.240 --> 28:05.600]  winner when all you're doing is greasing the skids but it's not just the
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.320]  people that work in the government the general public on average I found is
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.680]  even worse than the police and I'm not kissing up to the police I'm a big
[28:14.680 --> 28:18.880]  critic as everybody knows I'm just honest the general public on average on
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.800]  average a lot of great people in general public the best don't stop when
[28:24.800 --> 28:28.480]  somebody's run over on the highway don't don't go visit their grandparents or
[28:28.480 --> 28:35.360]  their parents in the nursing home are totally self-centered and they can see
[28:35.360 --> 28:40.840]  somebody's house burning down they say I don't care it's not my house and they
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.680]  just could care less and they want to abort more babies they want to get rid
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.760]  of the poor people instead of building them up but they're the first ones though
[28:51.760 --> 28:55.920]  that'll call the cops when you're nine-year-old is playing in the park
[28:55.920 --> 29:01.280]  behind your house and they say I believe it's abusive that that nine-year-old
[29:01.280 --> 29:09.280]  boy or girl seven eight nine ten eleven is playing out there or the kid gets off
[29:09.280 --> 29:13.680]  at 3 30 and mom gets home at five like my parents always did and you just get
[29:13.680 --> 29:16.200]  off the school bus and you go play at the park with your friends when you're
[29:16.200 --> 29:21.720]  eight years old in rural areas and in big cities they're taking people's kids
[29:21.720 --> 29:26.520]  calling an abuse and it's always the trendies that call the cops and the cops
[29:26.520 --> 29:31.200]  at the Fowler Port so CPS comes and demands they arrest people while Texas
[29:31.200 --> 29:34.520]  just quote change the law the regulation without going to the
[29:34.520 --> 29:38.920]  legislature to just have suspend all rules for illegal kids because it is
[29:38.920 --> 29:43.480]  human trafficking it is illegal but hey that's not suspended in Texas if your
[29:43.480 --> 29:46.680]  kid gets caught playing at the park you're gonna go to prison because this
[29:46.680 --> 29:53.000]  country's a police state we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[34:58.760 --> 35:05.840]  doing so the taxes they put on the rest of us that's the issue before I do that
[35:05.840 --> 35:12.920]  I wanted to just tell the listeners we're having the phones blown off the hook
[35:12.920 --> 35:17.720]  for people wanting the newest m4slife.com product DNA force that is the
[35:17.720 --> 35:24.040]  most powerful concentrated organic sources of patented cell boosting
[35:24.040 --> 35:29.720]  composites that are on record just rejuvenating you name it it is sold out

[35:34.040 --> 35:37.680]  hope to get it here within 10 weeks we're rushing it 12 weeks is what we were
[35:37.680 --> 35:41.960]  told maybe we're getting it a week early next time we're gonna produce more but
[35:41.960 --> 35:45.600]  it's so expensive to produce that we don't even have the capital to get the
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.540]  full amount we need to supply everybody but by reinvesting all the little
[35:49.540 --> 35:54.360]  profit we got from a thousand bottles we can get 3,000 bottles and then you
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.200]  try to build up the supplying folks and then you get the highest level of
[35:59.200 --> 36:04.960]  cutting-edge nutraceutical on record and support the info or while you're at

[36:31.400 --> 36:37.560]  oils and key organic compounds known to soothe the throat the lungs you name it
[36:37.560 --> 36:42.680]  three shots in the mouth and then you inhale you don't take it and inhale
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.320]  because that could burn your lungs but these are strong oils you dump this on
[36:47.320 --> 36:52.360]  the table I mean it moves very slowly this is not a cheap product we bring

[38:11.120 --> 38:14.440]  heard the rave reviews when I open the phones up on separate subjects and
[38:14.440 --> 38:18.480]  medical doctors call in in fact I only get that guy on as a guest he's been
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.000]  calling in for like 15 years the doc out of Wyoming who sent us so many great
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.360]  news articles and things over the years I didn't forget his last name he's like
[38:26.360 --> 38:30.280]  think chairman of the Republican Party now in his county or whatever but the
[38:30.280 --> 38:34.280]  point is really smart guy he's been taking X2 he called it on his own
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.520]  volition said man I'm gonna give you my testimony that's the type of guy we
[38:38.520 --> 38:41.360]  should separately interview about his inside stuff in the Republican Party
[38:41.360 --> 38:49.320]  separately about what X2 did for him or the first one X1 I mean I only bring you
[38:49.320 --> 38:54.640]  stuff that really is hardcore and the very best and when we go to these top
[38:54.640 --> 38:58.840]  labs and factories they go you're really going to put that much of it in
[38:58.840 --> 39:06.720]  there no one does anything near that with PQQ and CoQ 10 all this other stuff
[39:06.720 --> 39:12.040]  we go yeah we're doing it and you're not gonna sell it for $600 you're gonna
[39:12.040 --> 39:17.880]  sell for 129 yeah we're gonna do it and I expect backlash over this too folks
[39:17.880 --> 39:22.440]  because I'm kind of showing people the whole magic trick here of nutraceuticals
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.040]  because I want to dominate the market and win-win-win and feel good at night
[39:26.040 --> 39:29.200]  bringing people the lowest prices of the most hardcore stuff out there now I'm
[39:29.200 --> 39:40.160]  done ranting I'm taking my DNA force right now with my X2 in my purified
[39:40.160 --> 39:47.640]  water by ProPure and then I'm going to take the secret elixir that we won't
[39:47.640 --> 39:51.400]  have for a few months that everyone's wanting to know what it is when I'm
[39:51.400 --> 39:56.400]  tired and been up for 14 hours oh let me tell you this is it and there's no side
[39:56.400 --> 40:00.400]  effect no hangover on the mystery ingredient everyone wants to know about
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.040]  just wait let's just say it's a new development no one else has it and we're
[40:05.040 --> 40:08.880]  busy getting the patent pending and the trademarks and stuff before we even
[40:08.880 --> 40:15.760]  bring it out okay that's the reason we've not rolled it out yet and the best
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.440]  part is we're funding the info war at the same time and true independent media
[40:20.440 --> 40:32.280]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 now there worked a overrun of 200 bottles that
[40:32.280 --> 40:38.920]  aren't labeled of the DNA force we've had a couple thousand people sign up on
[40:38.920 --> 40:44.400]  the email the DNA force page infowarslife.com who want to be able to
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.400]  order at first when it comes out we will take the first 200 emails sometime
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.000]  next week out of those couple thousand and email you so you can get it when the
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.440]  200 bottles come in but that'll be it until I don't know what's 10 weeks from
[40:58.440 --> 41:06.040]  now 11 weeks from now we'll be into November so I'm sorry about that but
[41:06.040 --> 41:08.960]  it's good to have things where people have already tried our products and know
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.320]  they're so good that stuff like that's happening okay let's get into the really
[41:14.320 --> 41:21.840]  hardcore news and information now my friends again here are the headlines at
[41:21.840 --> 41:28.800]  the top headline up on drudgereport.com CDC refuses to identify where previous
[41:28.800 --> 41:36.120]  Ebola test originated they're hiding the Ebola test locations and again drudge
[41:36.120 --> 41:39.120]  first link to us reporting on the beginnings of this yesterday now it's
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.200]  being covered by Breitbart doing a great job immigrants again we'll get to that
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.760]  news here in a moment let me hit this news first some of it again is up on
[41:47.760 --> 41:54.200]  infowars.com the most complete coverage on Ebola is at drudgereport.com and also
[41:54.200 --> 41:56.840]  presentblended.com is covering quite a bit of it and we're covering on the
[41:56.840 --> 42:02.240]  nightly news as well CDC refuses to identify where previous Ebola test
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.600]  originated Tuesday evening the CDC confirmed what we reported on in the
[42:07.600 --> 42:10.960]  morning the Breitbart news that individuals in the United States and
[42:10.960 --> 42:14.920]  been tested for Ebola those tests came back negative we can't believe any of
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.960]  that but the CDC would not identify the states where they originated CNN's Dr.
[42:20.960 --> 42:25.400]  Sanjay Gupta reported Tuesday that's we reported on the drudge picked up that
[42:25.400 --> 42:29.960]  half a dozen people have been tested for Ebola it's way more than that and it's
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.760]  now being covered up CDC gets dozens of calls about people who are ill after
[42:34.760 --> 42:40.360]  traveling in Africa economic collapse blog reports should we be alarmed that
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.800]  the CDC has received several dozen calls from hospitals around the country
[42:44.800 --> 42:51.120]  about people who were ill after traveling in Africa as you read above and
[42:51.120 --> 42:56.000]  below a lot more Ebola testing has been going on around the nation we've been
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.960]  hearing about in the mainstream media and then it goes on to break down the
[42:59.960 --> 43:05.960]  people are collapsing from Liberia and coming to Morocco and coming to London
[43:05.960 --> 43:10.200]  I mean just a lot of scary stuff going on and again I'm more concerned about
[43:10.200 --> 43:14.000]  government response and using this as a power grab than I even am about the
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.440]  Ebola but this is undoubtedly a real pandemic in Africa now in five nations
[43:18.440 --> 43:22.520]  at least they've brought Ebola at least two people into Atlanta it's a serious
[43:22.520 --> 43:29.800]  situation but again CNN reported yesterday US health authorities concerned
[43:29.800 --> 43:34.880]  and then they've been concealing the number of suspected Ebola victims from
[43:34.880 --> 43:40.600]  the public Ebola tested across the nation government suppressing the info
[43:40.600 --> 43:46.800]  Ebola BBC reports global experts begin emergency talks at the World Health
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.640]  Organization global health experts at the World Health Organization are
[43:50.640 --> 43:56.760]  meeting to discuss new measures to tackle the Ebola outbreak the meeting is
[43:56.760 --> 44:04.720]  expected to last two days and we'll decide whether to declare a global health
[44:04.720 --> 44:11.440]  emergency today a man suspected of contracting Ebola died in Saudi Arabia
[44:11.440 --> 44:21.040]  if confirmed this will be the first Ebola related death outside of Africa the
[44:21.040 --> 44:25.840]  outbreak began in February in Guiana and a sense spread to Liberia Sierra Leone
[44:25.840 --> 44:31.160]  Nigeria and out of Saudi Arabia on Wednesday a nurse became the second
[44:31.160 --> 44:36.640]  person to die from Ebola in Nigeria Nigeria's health minister and five other
[44:36.640 --> 44:44.040]  cases of Ebola have been treated in isolation sub-Saharan Africa's largest
[44:44.040 --> 44:49.280]  city it comes as leading infectious disease experts have called for
[44:49.280 --> 44:56.960]  experimental treatments to be offered more widely let's continue
[44:56.960 --> 45:01.920]  Ebola outbreak can be much worse than first thought Johannesburg South Africa
[45:01.920 --> 45:06.280]  the worst outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in history could actually be much
[45:06.280 --> 45:12.680]  worse than official death tolls reflect the World Health Organization says and
[45:12.680 --> 45:19.200]  again they have a history of covering up how bad things really are when they're
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.240]  serious then when something isn't serious like H1N1 five years ago they
[45:23.240 --> 45:27.960]  hype it up like it's the end of the world but we have governments as evil as
[45:27.960 --> 45:31.880]  this running things that's the big concern and why is the southern border
[45:31.880 --> 45:36.240]  still wide open and why border patrol agents senior ones gone public saying
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.200]  they've been ordered to load people up vomiting with high fevers you name it
[45:41.200 --> 45:47.720]  from the Middle East from Africa and just let them come in on the buses which
[45:47.720 --> 45:51.280]  is then increasing the surge of illegals coming in here's another one out of
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.800]  Reuters bodies dumped in streets as West Africa struggles to curb Ebola
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.200]  relatives of Ebola victims in Liberia defy government orders and dumped
[46:01.200 --> 46:04.680]  infected bodies in the streets as West African government struggle to enforce
[46:04.680 --> 46:08.560]  tough measures to curb an outbreak of the virus that has killed let me say this
[46:08.560 --> 46:13.320]  for over a week 887 people it's way over that folks most estimates have been
[46:13.320 --> 46:19.220]  over a thousand for a week Sierra Leone deploys troops in Ebola crisis to
[46:19.220 --> 46:23.400]  control the border and other issues we won't do that here don't worry
[46:23.400 --> 46:30.680]  Ebola virus spreads because of lax quarantine enforcement says the World
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.840]  Health Organization in the New York Times
[46:35.520 --> 46:41.960]  five new Ebola cases and another death confirmed in Nigeria
[46:44.400 --> 46:48.680]  now they're saying in Africa God is angry with Liberia for trying to legalize
[46:48.680 --> 46:57.200]  homosexuality blaming Ebola on homosexualism well I'd blame it on
[46:57.200 --> 47:03.200]  airborne viruses that come from fruit bats that have been manipulated by a
[47:03.200 --> 47:08.000]  weapons labs in the last 50 years 45 years that's on record it's clearly been
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.040]  weaponized and it's becoming more airborne and by the way if you're a new
[47:11.040 --> 47:15.200]  listener and say hey it's on airborne mainline science has said for two years
[47:15.200 --> 47:19.920]  evidence it's airborne with monkeys transferring it to pigs in Africa in
[47:19.920 --> 47:26.560]  cages separated in in in laboratories where they're separated I think a lot of
[47:26.560 --> 47:31.400]  this testing and CDC stuff and you in stuff undoubtedly these labs are
[47:31.400 --> 47:36.080]  becoming vectors for it even if they're not trying to create it it's no doubt
[47:36.080 --> 47:41.840]  SV 40 that gave over 100 million Americans cancer on record was from the
[47:41.840 --> 47:47.320]  vaccine production the question is wasn't on purpose or by accident well one
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.240]  of the developers of it told PBS television we played the clip probably
[47:51.240 --> 47:56.760]  hundred times there we ought to pull it back up he was interviewed by the
[47:56.760 --> 48:02.440]  Boston station the PBS aired nationally back in the early 90s that oh yeah we
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.400]  knew it was in there but there's too many people I mean this is the type of
[48:06.400 --> 48:09.840]  garbage we're dealing with what's shocking is how Ebola patients look
[48:09.840 --> 48:14.000]  before they die British doctor working Sierra Leone describes the horror of the
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.160]  deadly disease giant purple blisters everywhere blood pouring out of every
[48:18.160 --> 48:20.560]  orifice
[48:23.800 --> 48:27.600]  I'm not even gonna read any more of this here on air maybe I'll get to it more
[48:27.600 --> 48:33.280]  as people know how serious this is but don't worry the Washington Post says
[48:33.280 --> 48:38.200]  global warming you know the earth's been cooling for 19 years the UN's own
[48:38.200 --> 48:44.920]  number show is the cause you didn't pay your carbon indulgence to the Rothschild
[48:44.920 --> 48:53.240]  Bank the Rockefeller Bank so that's why this happened I'm gonna go to break and
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.680]  I'm gonna come back and get into the border situation then the Russia
[48:57.680 --> 49:04.160]  situation a Bola crisis spurs passenger checks as airlines still fly
[49:04.160 --> 49:08.840]  Bloomberg reports out of West Africa
[49:09.640 --> 49:16.160]  I love this headline Tuskegee students stuck in Liberia due to Ebola fears WSA
[49:16.160 --> 49:21.880]  WSFA six students who attended Tuskegee University where the government for 47
[49:21.880 --> 49:25.240]  years injected black people syphilis so they get spread it to everybody else at
[49:25.240 --> 49:29.400]  the same time other blacks everybody else are stranded in Liberia see that's
[49:29.400 --> 49:33.400]  how I think when I see a headline oh but the government wouldn't be involved
[49:33.400 --> 49:38.480]  anything now briefly don't forget this hour is brought to you by the great

[52:05.680 --> 52:09.840]  Patriots supply. Several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[52:09.840 --> 52:13.000]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlottes
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.440]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take action a company run by
[52:17.440 --> 52:22.240]  Patriots for Patriots was born. My Patriots supply has never taken a loan or

[54:23.000 --> 54:29.440]  Alright folks, we are back live. In other news, Michelle Obama who came out with
[54:29.440 --> 54:34.160]  other, you know, pop celebrities, that's what they sold her as, came out and of
[54:34.160 --> 54:38.640]  course said, don't say bossy, it hurts women's feelings. Don't call a woman bossy.
[54:38.640 --> 54:45.120]  You don't use the word bossy as a man because you're bad. And people are now
[54:45.120 --> 54:49.320]  saying they won't use the word because she's God. And if she says don't use the
[54:49.320 --> 54:54.240]  word blue, you don't use it. You do what they say. When they say jump, you say yes
[54:54.240 --> 55:00.200]  ma'am. Because that's what a free country does. And you don't call illegal
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.200]  aliens, illegal aliens either. You use the language. They say when they say it
[55:04.200 --> 55:08.680]  bust her. There's even video and audio of this. I want to get it. Michelle Obama
[55:08.680 --> 55:15.320]  now says women are smarter than men. First lady, Michelle Obama shared some
[55:15.320 --> 55:19.880]  thoughts about women versus men during a conversation with former first lady
[55:19.880 --> 55:27.400]  Laura Bush at the US African leader summit in Washington DC. And she went on
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.960]  to say women are smarter than men. What an outrageous statement. Some women are
[55:31.960 --> 55:36.680]  smarter demographically than other groups of men. But you when you get to the
[55:36.680 --> 55:41.040]  highest level of geniuses, you can't even say who's the smartest. Physiologically
[55:41.040 --> 55:44.320]  women's brains tend to have three times the connections between left and right
[55:44.320 --> 55:50.760]  hemisphere. So women are more intuitive and tend to be a lot of times on average
[55:50.760 --> 55:55.160]  better at aesthetics. I mean this is well known by sociologists, anthropologists.
[55:55.160 --> 56:01.320]  That's what they target. Psychologist. But we are the same species. Men and women
[56:01.320 --> 56:06.440]  are together. That's why they attack both the normal genders. Both the standard
[56:06.440 --> 56:10.400]  genders is to end humanity as we know it. And that's in the textbooks. And so
[56:10.400 --> 56:16.960]  now imagine if a president said men are smarter than women.
[56:16.960 --> 56:20.720]  Statistically men are better fighter pilots. Of course machines are about to
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.880]  replace us so it doesn't matter. Because men generally have better eyesight.
[56:25.880 --> 56:31.240]  Generally don't get as confused under pressure. Generally can work in
[56:31.240 --> 56:38.120]  coordination under pressure. Generally can operate better when wounded. Now a
[56:38.120 --> 56:43.320]  woman on average can live longer when wounded. So ooh, big difference. Men can
[56:43.320 --> 56:51.840]  operate better in pain on average. Women can handle more trauma. Gunshot wounds
[56:51.840 --> 56:57.680]  you name it. On average. That's about a seven point increase in women. Same thing
[56:57.680 --> 57:01.120]  in female babies. They're known to be much stronger than male babies. Look at
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.360]  autism. The chemicals hit boys a lot worse. Because boys, well it's a complex
[57:06.360 --> 57:10.000]  issue. The point is it's all about thinking about how we're all different
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.960]  and not together. What an outrageous, bigoted, sexist scumbag. But see she can
[57:15.960 --> 57:20.960]  say it. You can have rap songs putting down white people all day. You can have
[57:20.960 --> 57:24.720]  a little Mecheloraza running around. Hispanic Ku Klux Klan putting down
[57:24.720 --> 57:30.560]  white people as the devil. You can have the black first lady up there or first
[57:30.560 --> 57:35.920]  whatever she is. Up there you know saying men are dumb basically. Oh I heard
[57:35.920 --> 57:44.240]  there wouldn't be any more wars once women got into office. Now they run the
[57:44.240 --> 57:47.320]  State Department just warmongering everywhere because they work for the
[57:47.320 --> 57:54.280]  globalist. It's a total front ladies and gentlemen. And these women act more
[57:54.280 --> 57:58.120]  arrogant and more aggressive and more crazy than the nuttiest alpha males I've
[57:58.120 --> 58:03.640]  ever known. Shouldn't the headline be women are smarter than George W. Bush?
[58:03.640 --> 58:08.240]  That would be a probably inaccurate headline. I mean the point is is that
[58:08.240 --> 58:13.800]  women and men today are childlike. So easy to manipulate. And I refuse to do it.
[58:13.800 --> 58:17.800]  But people like Michelle Obama do. I mean women are, I mean they're getting people
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.880]  ready for Hillary to run. Oh yeah I'm gonna show you a girl gonna get in. I mean it is
[58:22.880 --> 58:29.520]  just so transparent, so mindless, so stupid. And it's all sick. I didn't get
[58:29.520 --> 58:33.640]  in all the border stuff. Suspects and murder a Border Patrol agent arrested
[58:33.640 --> 58:39.120]  and deported Texas. I mean it's all coming up. Stay with us.

[58:49.080 --> 58:56.160]  Hi I'm Dr. Edward Groot. It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the

[59:48.520 --> 59:59.320]  Waging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.520]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:20.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:29.560]  Jones. Mark Adams joined us investigative journalist and chronicle the
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.440]  incredible criminal history of the illegitimate run-for-profit or the
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:40.160]  offshore banks eternal revenue service. And I talked to senior people in the IRS
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.320]  in Austin, one of the biggest IRS centers in the country here. They admit it's all
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.840]  true in the total fraud and total scam and the ultra-rich or tax exempt and the
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.200]  illegals are all allowed to be basically tax-free in many cases and the
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.640]  launder money. I mean this is all just a mafia government. So that's coming up. I
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.200]  said I'd get into the open borders situation. We reported on this a few
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.720]  days ago. Drudge picked it up first. Now it's in mainstream news today but
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.240]  suspects and murder of board patrol agent arrested and deported numerous times.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:18.440]  They were living illegally in Texas. We reported on this yesterday or actually
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:22.280]  two days ago. So now it's hit national news that they have been deported over
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.920]  and over again and we're just running around robbing and killing people
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:30.560]  reportedly for fun and to rob them. Texas eased rules for housing immigrant
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.720]  children. They can basically do anything they want with them and have no
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.880]  inspections and no Congress can't get in. Nobody can get in. Overwhelmed by the
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.820]  arrival of thousands of undocumented immigrant children, the state of Texas
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.360]  relaxed its standards. That's called laws. The legislature, you're breaking the
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.080]  law. You just say now like Obama were relaxing standards for the shelters that
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.120]  housed them mainly because the illegals are crapping on the floor. I mean I'm
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.000]  sorry that's just in the news. Governing how much space they just won't use the
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.120]  toilet in some cases. Never had a toilet. I mean I don't blame them. Why not? The
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.360]  GPA does it. Maybe that's the new sign that you're in the in crowd. You just walk
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:13.720]  into a restaurant, crap on the table. I mean why not? It's racist. Walk into a
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.680]  police station and just walk in and just crap right on the front desk and they're
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.480]  going to go, they're going to start arrest me and go, what? I'm culturally sensitive here.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.160]  That was in the news last week that that's why they're having all these
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.680]  inspections. People are getting in trouble because there's just crap everywhere.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.280]  But easing rules, governing how much space each child needs and what kind of
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.640]  facilities they should have. Maybe that's the new American flag. It's just
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.000]  somebody crapping on the floor. I mean the EPA, by the way when I said this a
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.600]  few months ago people thought I was joking that I mentioned it again a few
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.520]  days ago or last week and people were on YouTube going, I thought he was joking
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.720]  till we flashed the article up. No, no, no. At EPA facilities all over the country,
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.520]  they go, the US citizens, we're not just playing the illegals here because they
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.920]  grew up like in cardboard boxes. I feel sorry for them. They go to the bathroom at
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.280]  their desk and hallways and they're not just lazy and pee on the floor. I mean in
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.000]  idiocracy you have a toilet built right into your seat. That's, that's, that's
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.320]  trendy. No, no, you got to have a hipster beard, a hipster, you know, hipster, by
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.720]  the way there's a new article out. Islamic State's new icon is a hipster and I
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.120]  saw this a few days ago and thought it was satire, but now it's in the London
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.600]  Telegraph. I look at so much news. I looked and thought that can't be real.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.680]  You guys, if you'll punch this up for TV viewers, it's so ridiculous. Islamic
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.120]  State's new icon is a hipster jihadi, sword-wielding supporter of the Caliphate,
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:45.840]  is a university graduate from a well-off Cairo family. I bet you a million
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.600]  dollars, he's CIA or Ford Foundation or Soros Group. I mean you can just look at
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.560]  it, what a joke. And hey, they're carrying out democratic party operation to
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.280]  murder every Christian they find, slit the throats of non-radical Muslims and
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.280]  just rule savagely, rolling with power like Akron. You walk in Akron, go, I got
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.400]  children, I want to run as sex slaves. They're like, sir, you came to the right
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.280]  place, time to run ops. And if you don't run child sex slaves in America, the
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:18.000]  Democrats, you're a racist. And if you're at the EPA and you don't just projectile
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.440]  crap all over the walls, you know what, maybe when I was at CNN a few years ago
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.880]  for the Piers Morgan deal and I'd been at the same studios before and it was all
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.960]  nice a few years before and now it was all gross while I'm on this
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:34.560]  scatological deal with it, Carl Rowe who listens in Austin, I'm sure loves. I'm
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.480]  disgusted by it, I'm not obsessed with it like he is with his nickname for the
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.560]  president, TB. I don't mean tuberculosis. Yeah, I'm not kidding.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:48.760]  Turd Blossom, that it was like Jackson Pollux all over the walls, green, brown, black,
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.000]  crap. I mean, maybe that's what America is. Maybe you prove you're a Democrat now
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  by just running around the street, don't even wear diapers, stay with us.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.200]  This is Scotty's John for Infowars.com. I know that most of you here in this

[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.080]  know? If not, then I want to know why. Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.720]  some people. They might call you names or they just want to talk about sports.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.280]  They're so poppers. I say so what? There's a battle going on out there right now.

[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.920]  had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years and
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.400]  I'm still fighting. If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.160]  everything. The Infowars is worldwide. Tell your friends about Infowars and let

[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:29.680]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. We're here live. Back
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.640]  weeknight 7 o'clock Central. Info wars, nightly news. Former Congressman George
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:41.640]  Hansen had the eye of the tiger. Back when no one in government dared
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:47.880]  criticize the IRS or speak on the floor of the house on C-Span about stories of
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:53.440]  them taking homes without even warrants or out without even juries jerking the
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.600]  diamond rings off little old ladies fingers. He would expose that it was a
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.160]  collection agency for the private Federal Reserve that had been set up in
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:09.120]  1913 and I remember interviewing Hansen back in the mid 90s again after 2000. I
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.200]  tried to get him on last year and again earlier this year and learned that he was
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.520]  in bad health and could not come on but he recommended Mark Adams who is his
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:26.320]  biographer. And we look at what the IRS is doing today going after hundreds of
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.480]  thousands of conservatives libertarians, tea partiers, pro-life groups,
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:35.520]  Christian groups, land rights organizations, setting people up, arresting
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.320]  people. It's created a giant shilling effect. We're even mainline Baptist
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.600]  churches hand out letters we've shown here on air telling their practitioners
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.520]  when you go to a church dinner don't even talk about politics when you're
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.200]  having dinner. Well I mean the First Amendment says Congress shall make no
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.400]  law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.320]  exercise thereof and then it goes in the freedom of the press the right to
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.480]  assemble for redress of grievances. So petitioning all of its in the First
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.080]  Amendment. More important the founders believe in the second but the two go
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:18.160]  together like a horse and carriage like a engine and a caboose because it's the
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:23.560]  pin that is so mighty even more than the sword because the sword will fail if
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:30.080]  it's not backed up by the pin. That's the info war. Pentagon says 90% of war is now
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:38.960]  info war. They say soon it'll be 90 plus percent 98% and so that's why we're
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.760]  going to remember what's been happening to George Hansen. We're going to look
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.240]  back on what happened to him but first we're going to start at present times
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:53.160]  and work our way back with investigative journalist Mark Adams who again has a
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.680]  book coming out on the subject and Jesse Ventura joins us in the next hour. We'll
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.560]  have news as it breaks as well more on the border. Russia prepares large-scale
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.640]  invasion, battle-ready forces of infantry, armor, artillery, and air defense.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:12.040]  That's up on infowars.com. We've got some of the other important news up on
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.280]  infowars.com. NATO warns Russia we'll use a mandatory admission as pretext to
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:22.840]  invade Ukraine. CDC remains silent on potential Ebola victims in the US. COP if
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.680]  Obama doesn't follow the Constitution we don't have to. There's video of that.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:34.720]  Amnesty supporter hits protesting woman's car. CDC getting dozens of calls
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:43.120]  about people who are ill after traveling to Africa. 9-1-1 dispatcher issues insane
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.120]  instructions to woman whose house is being robbed. Put down your gun. That's the
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.080]  kind of news up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Also Robert Redford
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.780]  has come out. He wants to be basically tax exempt. He's suing the state of New
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:02.000]  York over 1.6 million in taxes and it's always the Democrats if you look at the
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.700]  numbers. The congressmen that don't pay taxes, the big rich moguls that don't pay
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.440]  taxes, the bill on the linda gates that get out of taxes, the Warren Buffett's
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.200]  while lobbying to have poor people's taxes raised because they get it in
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:19.240]  government contracts. Truly a disgusting group of kleptocrats posing as loving
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:24.360]  liberals who have the moral high ground. Now before we go to Mark Adams if
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:30.440]  you're a TV viewer we'll show you some of the photos of congressman Hanson who
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.680]  was tortured and that's the story that we haven't gotten to yet. He was driven
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.800]  around his teeth knocked out. He was driven around for months. They call it
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:48.080]  desoling. Those aren't even the bad photos we found online until his, yes they
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:54.920]  call it diesel therapy, thank you John, where your toes pop, your legs rot, your
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:58.040]  feet burst. In fact the photos we found online aren't even the ones he sent me
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:04.040]  more than a decade ago that were just unbelievable but this is the
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.040]  type of evil that you'd imagine in a communist gulag happening to Alexander
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.880]  Sheltzenitzen that goes on. So he's too ill to keep fighting on but he fights on
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:17.520]  through his biographer and researcher. First I want to play a clip from the
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:23.800]  early 1990s on Geraldo Rivera with congressman Hanson when it was admitted
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:29.800]  and confirmed that he indeed had been targeted and tortured. Here it is. But in
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.360]  my case I beat them on the tax matter that they tried to throw at me. In fact
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.600]  we had a five-figure refund but they did everything they could to try to
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.200]  embarrass you in the middle of an election all that type of thing and then
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.200]  it didn't stop. They tried to come at you from other directions, the Federal
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.920]  Election Commission or or the ethics reports that you filed with Congress
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.680]  and it didn't even matter if you went to the committee that handled the
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.800]  reports and asked them how to file the reports with two attorneys present and
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.960]  they filed the reports. They made sure that one agency of government, the one
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.800]  they work with, the Justice Department came in and got you anyway even though
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.840]  you followed the instructions. So they have a way of getting you if they don't
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.480]  like you and there's a whole host of stories. Any politician that stands in
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:17.040]  their way they're not safe either. They file taxes. And you wonder why people go
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.800]  along. Well the NSA is blackmailing. We had William Benny on a few weeks ago to
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.200]  say no. It's confirmed they spy on the Congress and blackmail them and threaten
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.920]  them and then they had an intel operative come out in the news and say I
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.160]  claimed I interviewed of someone from an intelligence community when Bill Benny
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.240]  is the highest level NSA person ever go public. He was number four at the NSA
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:46.760]  when he quit in October 2001. This is the psi-op they run. Telling you there's no
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.760]  death panels in Obamacare. Telling you there's no open border. Now they admit it.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.760]  Telling you that that you can keep your doctor. Telling you raising the debt
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.200]  limit doesn't raise the debt limit. Telling you there's no tyranny. They're
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.760]  lying to you. So Mark Adams, I'm gonna give you the floor for the next six
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.680]  minutes till we go to break. Where should we begin? Currently what's happening or
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:14.480]  at the beginning? Well gosh thanks for having me on Alex. I'll tell you it's
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:22.600]  remarkable. So much of Congressman Hanson's fireball career it directly
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:30.240]  relates now to the exposed collusion of the IRS and the Justice Department
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:40.760]  working together to try to destroy the Tea Party. And for sure 2014 has been a
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:50.640]  busy year for the IRS. As reported in the New York Daily News on June 24th
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:59.280]  United States Archivist David Ferraro he testified to Congress that IRS did not
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.360]  follow the law when it failed to report the destruction of lowest learners
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:16.760]  emails. Also on June 24th it was revealed that the IRS was forced to pay
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:25.680]  $50,000 to the National Organization for Marriage for illegally
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:35.400]  disclosing their donor list. That was reported in the daily signal. And then
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:43.800]  let's also remember Christine O'Donnell when it was revealed last February that
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:54.480]  the IRS illegally disclosed her confidential tax documents. And then at
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:01.480]  the end of June June 30th the Hill newspaper published an article with
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:10.000]  this headline Senator Thune he's from South Dakota. Runner emails on Senator
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:18.720]  Grassley show the need for a special prosecutor. And in the Hill newspaper it
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:28.080]  quotes Senator Thune. He says we're all very concerned when we hear that the
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:36.240]  IRS in addition to targeting political groups may be targeting
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:47.360]  conservative senators who've been critics of the IRS. Well the fact is the IRS has
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:57.440]  been targeting lawmakers for a very long time. Their first victim was Senator
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.800]  Ed Long a Democrat from Missouri and this takes us all the way back in the
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:12.520]  1960s when Johnson was president. Senator Long spent an unprecedented three
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:21.920]  years investigating the internal revenue service and he was outraged at what he
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:31.000]  discovered and he did not mince words. He warned the whole country how too often
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:42.680]  the IRS acts like a despicable playing upon defenseless citizens. And his
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:50.440]  hearings generated a lot of press coverage because they also exposed the
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:59.000]  illegal wire tapping that was going on with the IRS and the FBI. And in fact
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.080]  way back in I think it was 1967 he published a book titled The Intruders
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:15.040]  that documented the government's crusade into secret and illegal surveillance.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.640]  Absolutely I've read that book and that's cited by so many people that began to
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.320]  expose the NSA as well and that data is shared with all these agencies that are
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.560]  really mafia's to do whatever they want. We're going to go to break with
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.000]  investigative journalist Mark Adams I'm Alex Jones who just joined us and come
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.560]  back and break this down because it's getting worse and every year they cut
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.760]  more and more white-collar investigators that's the headline but IRS
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.440]  that investigates billionaires and they only focus on political now so they're
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.840]  becoming purely political on top of it and getting away with it so what happens
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.540]  when they get away with persecuting people in the NSA spine you get a full
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:01.560]  blown tyranny stay with us. Hi folks Alex Jones here with some important
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.640]  information I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.800]  over at my patriot supply. Several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.920]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:17.040]  charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take action a
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:22.240]  company run by patriots for patriots was born. My patriot supply has never taken
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.560]  a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.960]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women. It is rare to find
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.600]  companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:40.480]  high-quality storeable foods from my patriot supply. Go to mypatriotsupply.com

[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:38.280]  Big Bad John. So what we have going on here is a rain of terror and it's
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.080]  intensifying. I saw in the Wall Street Journalist a few months ago where they
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.520]  cut even more of the white collar fraud investigators across federal agencies
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:55.320]  like the Election Commission, the commissions that look at the stocks and
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:02.760]  bonds, the IRS. The IRS will let one house in Austin get 80-something million
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.640]  dollars over several years of fake tax returns. Obviously it's being laundered,
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:13.120]  the Democratic Party and others. It's not a house of four or five illegals
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:20.360]  getting that. Same thing in Atlanta, Georgia, Los Angeles, California. It's
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.880]  there though to tell churches you can't have free speech and speak out against
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:30.680]  abortion when that's not even a law. But just like the mafia can threaten to
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:41.200]  break your legs and it's illegal but still a lot of people buckle to them. So
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.680]  we'll get into Congressman Hanson's story and we'll go back and look at the
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.320]  hearings that exposed it and what happened to him specifically and then
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.280]  move forward. But it's just important to understand this is a rain of terror and
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.440]  giving into it only makes it get worse. The answer to their chilling effect and
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:02.280]  their intimidation is to get more vocal against them, to get more aggressive and
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:08.360]  to let the politicos that come after you know that when they try to set you up
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.920]  Eric Holder may get out of it but they're not gonna get out of it. You're
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.520]  gonna sue them forever, you're gonna dig into their background, their other cases
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.920]  and just like the Michael Mortensen case you're gonna end up sending them to jail.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.760]  It may take 10 years but I've always warned the government everybody else. I
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:31.040]  know I'm clean and if anybody ever sets me up or tries anything I am gonna make
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.800]  your life miserable by the full extent of the law forever and I've got lawyers
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:41.600]  and a trust set up. My money is set up to own a jet airplane. My money is set up to
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.960]  live in a big house. It's set up to take care of my kids, a little bit of money I
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:51.520]  got and to make whoever kills me whoever sets me up their life a living hell. I
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.640]  don't mean to go off on a jag but I've talked to so many top lawyers here on
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:00.600]  the air. I don't want to get that top EPA lawyer on and the FDA lawyer. He does
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.000]  both. I forget his name. He's the one top lawyer in the country we had him on and
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.480]  he's won a whole bunch of cases against the FDA EPA you name it when they're
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.760]  bullying people for no reason and he said look we go after the judges and the
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.560]  prosecutors for the crimes they've committed and all the money they're
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.840]  getting from the companies themselves this is a mafia they shut it down real
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.360]  quick. That's the only way to beat the feds in federal court. That's why they got
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:30.200]  a 97 98% conviction rate because it's a mafia folks but you start investigating
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:38.480]  the lifestyle of the people that set you up. Oh they quit real fast. I'm sorry
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.800]  we got a long segment coming up. I'm eating up your segment here. Mark get back
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.200]  to that member of the Congress who was getting into this in their book The
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:50.120]  Intruders and then move forward to what it's grown into today. Yes well here's
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:59.960]  how they set Senator Ed Longa. Bill Lampert was an associate editor at Life Magazine
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:07.040]  and he was contacted by an official in the Justice Department who were closely
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:16.040]  with the IRS and this official promised Lampert a big juicy story about
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:28.760]  the crusading senator and it was the May 1967 issue of Life Magazine published
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:38.000]  an article that made the outrageous accusation that Senator Long's hearings
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.480]  which were exposing obviously illegal wiretapping they in fact interfered
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:51.440]  with the government's investigation of organized crime. The article also accused
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:29:02.800]  Senator Long of collecting $48,000 in bribe payoffs. Now Long of course denied
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:10.960]  the accusations and as for the $48,000 that was a legal finders fee from an
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:18.760]  attorney in Missouri. Money which in fact he had reported to the IRS and he
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:26.960]  documented the trail of payments. Later that summer 1967 a Senate
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:33.960]  investigation committee cleared Senator Long of any wrongdoing. But it shows the
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.720]  incredible dirty tricks that scare everybody else off and we're showing
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.080]  the news articles on screen right now that our guests sent us. We'll be back
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:44.160]  to look at more of those documents for TV viewers. We'll break them down for radio
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.440]  listeners. This is important. This is how they're destroyed in America. We've got
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:53.760]  to expose it. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:30:02.160]  GCN Radio Network. I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.800]  helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:12.560]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.760]  many of the body's functions especially the thyroid. I discovered a product
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:21.720]  being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield true nascent
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.000]  iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said listen if

[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:15.800]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90

[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.600]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:54.160]  in the game so it only has like 280,000 followers on it that's still good
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.720]  because it's real followers and sometimes I'll tweet on the weekend if

[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:12.720]  funny depending on your views at real Alex Jones very important to follow real
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:16.920]  Alex Jones even though it's a globalist platform it's very useful now we had
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.400]  fans that set up fan sites on Facebook pretty early on that's why we have three
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.200]  million folks that like us on Facebook about 900,000 on one and he had all the
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.520]  others together it's about three million that's because we got there early one
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.160]  thing I noticed about the internet it's important to get there early when some new
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:39.120]  platform comes out if you get to one of these sites late it's it's not as easy
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:44.000]  to dominate it of course we've dominated YouTube we got to that not really early
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.040]  but but but not late we got to it by about two thousand and five right when
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:55.480]  it got sold to Google we were on it before I got sold to Google whenever
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:01.400]  that was and obviously on one channel we didn't we didn't set our channel up
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:07.320]  till 2009 or so and that one has four hundred something million but all put
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.520]  together eight hundred million on big channels alone of people that have seen
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.040]  our videos and that's just big channels I can't even track all the others and I'm
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:22.360]  not tooting our horn I'm saying people are awake liberty is popular and now the
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.160]  IRS has been exposed being political going after people who are innocent but
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:31.960]  it's a fraud to begin with didn't get set up till 1913 the average American
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:37.920]  didn't pay money to the IRS till the 1950s and here's it here's a headline for
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:43.840]  the New York Times in 2000 April 16th IRS more likely to audit the poor and not
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.600]  the rich and since then I've seen that headline over and over again where it
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:55.120]  were I mean there's not auditors for Warren Buffett boys and girls but if you
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:58.520]  own a car dealership you're getting audited every year if you own a restaurant
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.000]  you're getting audited every year that's what the poor people think are rich
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.200]  people or if you make twenty thousand dollars a year thirty thousand those
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.160]  audits went up in 2013 they reported this year and and and of rich went down
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.520]  even more but I'm ranting I want to give Mark Adams investigative journalist the
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:21.840]  floor and then a new article that just went live on info awards dot com North
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:28.320]  Carolina sheriff to residents fight back against crime by taking up arms and he
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.720]  goes on to say crime is exploding in their county due to the illegal alien
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.920]  crime wave the economy being bad and that's the truth crime has gone down
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.480]  since 1992 with the end of the crack cocaine epidemic I remember when I was a
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.160]  kid growing up in Dallas there'd be sometimes four murders a day five
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.640]  murders a day I remember hearing you know 20 murders in the last three days
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.760]  over the weekend Dallas had the highest crime rate worse than Chicago when I was
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:58.160]  growing up but it was more than that they think it was the lead in the fuel
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.920]  made people violent or something I mean you know I grew up where if you looked
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.160]  at somebody wrong they would just jump out of their truck while it was moving
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.240]  and just run towards you I mean it was just like just like fist fights
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:15.360]  constantly people and I lived in a nice neighborhood and and and people were
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.320]  shooting each other and stuff sometimes you know it was like wife shooting
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.160]  husbands you name it just crazy stuff but I don't know why I'm going off on
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.520]  that jag the point is since guns became so incredibly popular and concealed
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:31.800]  carry came out that the FBI even admits that's one of the largest reasons crimes
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:36.200]  gone down also taking lead out of the fuel let'll make you a mad dog folks that
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:40.200]  was a big part of why the US was so violent because we would led the fuel
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:44.960]  a lot of their folks banned that before we ever did but so I give that to the
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.000]  left who always talks about crime dropping being fuel that's part of it
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.760]  but the guns are the biggest because lead was out for a long time crime went
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.680]  down some and then down even more by the mid 90s 2000 and through that when the
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:00.840]  lead had already been out by the by the 80s but I'm gonna go back to my guess
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:06.440]  you know how I love factoids but now because of the economy being in a
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:13.080]  depression in most areas and and methamphetamine on the rest of it crime
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:19.320]  muggings shootings people knocking out the window in your car people stealing
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.000]  your bag when you go to the bathroom at the restaurant petty crime is off the
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.760]  charts and what's happening is people trying to car jack car jacks coming back
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:30.640]  it's not as bad as it was since concealed carry came in but it's coming back
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:35.720]  they're just getting killed muggings are going up they're getting killed so the
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.440]  sheriff we're gonna play the clip after our guest leaves us and Ventura joins
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:44.640]  us he says get guns learn how to use them because the sheriff's apartment is
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.800]  overwhelmed the departments are saying this everywhere start shooting these
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.640]  people somebody tries to mug you try to break in your car grab the revolvers
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:56.920]  shove it in their chest pull the trigger till they're dead till they're off of you
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:02.120]  and and that'll teach all these people to go out and get a job and work and not
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:07.720]  go around knocking people on the head let's go ahead and go back to our guest
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.520]  mark Adams the investigative journalist who's writing a book about
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.920]  congressman George Hanson who was arrested tortured he's getting into
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.160]  earlier congressmen and senators that were persecuted they don't want to get
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.400]  into his torture and when your book is coming out go ahead sir well thank you
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.720]  Alex one thing I want to point out here it was the Life magazine article that
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:36.040]  really sabotaged our senator Ed Long he lost the primary election in August
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:43.640]  1968 Life magazine never published a retraction even though it was proven that
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.880]  he was innocent of those charges that were put forth in the article well on
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:40:03.000]  August 6th 1968 46 years ago today the IRS commissioner Sheldon Coleman called
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.360]  Bill Lampert the associate editor at Life magazine to offer them his
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:16.600]  congratulations and by the way we're showing the New York Times article as
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:24.040]  you speak go ahead yes now Bernard Fensterwald he was chief counsel to
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:29.720]  Senator Long's committee he also did not mince words he came right out and
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:38.840]  warned senators and congressmen who are not scared of looking into the IRS have
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:46.880]  to be crazy because the IRS will just ruin your career and they should have
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.000]  all gotten together as a coalition against cowardice and all come out or
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.840]  even 30 or 40 then they couldn't bring them all down but instead cowards all
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:41:00.120]  sit down while great men like Congressman Hansen are tortured yes well one
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:05.920]  senator who came forward was senator Joyce of Joseph Montoya he was a
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:14.360]  Democrat from New Mexico he chaired the IRS appropriations subcommittee and in
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:21.640]  1972 he started aligning up witnesses to testify before his subcommittee about
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:33.040]  IRS atrocities well in 1975 he was sandbagged when IRS operatives colluded
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:45.120]  with Bob Woodward and a Washington Post IRS chief walks out of Montoya's
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:53.960]  taxes but well that was the screaming headline on the October 19th 1975 edition
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:42:02.920]  of the Washington Post and that article by Bob Woodward has got all the
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.480]  appearances of a real work of sabotage right there at the beginning of the
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:16.160]  article Woodward states that Montoya senator Montoya had been twice
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:24.200]  recommended for prosecution because he allegedly failed the file returns going
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:33.440]  back to World War two they were looking at 1945 and 1946 but then four
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:39.800]  paragraphs later Woodward writes there is no evidence that Montoya has
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:44.240]  illegally evaded taxes for those that don't know Bob Woodward I'm not
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.800]  defending Nixon was naval intelligence and that was a total set up they were
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:53.280]  giving them all the intel to bring down the presidency to bring in a soft cue of
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:58.320]  bureaucrats so anytime Woodward or Bernstein especially Woodward are
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.440]  involved in something you got to look out well yes in fact what Montoya was
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:09.680]  doing was he was making people nervous he was going full throttle to again show
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:19.440]  America how the IRS behaves like a Gestapo playing on defuseless Americans
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:25.560]  now I remember in 1968 the IRS finally got rid of Senator Long now just four
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:32.120]  years later Senator Montoya is in hard pursuit Woodward doesn't mention any of
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:39.140]  this all she says in this article is he Montoya is well known on Capitol Hill
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:45.520]  for his active interest in IRS matters of course he has an active interest in
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.480]  IRS matters he's the one who chairs their their subcommittee that oversees the
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:56.560]  IRS yeah the headline should be IRS persecuting Congress IRS going after
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:02.160]  their bosses IRS in political sabotage of those that would bring him to justice
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:06.000]  IRS tries to block congressional prosecutor that's what's really going
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:13.040]  on well in fact in 1972 when Montoya was really getting serious of looking into
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:21.240]  the IRS that's when the IRS district director in New Mexico decided to start
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:32.160]  investigating Montoya then in December 1972 an IRS memorandum was issued by
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:39.480]  IRS chief intelligence division this is in San Francisco and that memorandum
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:48.360]  branded Senator Montoya as a tax protester and they further smeared him
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:54.280]  as one who would advocate violence against revenue and we're showing that
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.800]  memo right now so if you're on the committee to control the IRS and you
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.220]  don't like them abusing old ladies and taking their houses you're a tax
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:06.440]  protester because you're exposing this criminal organization that was the
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:10.040]  position of the IRS now now now we're gonna have you back for a second
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.720]  interview obviously to go over more of this or a nightly notice because you've
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:15.880]  sent us so many documents I want to do an interview when your book comes out as
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:19.720]  well sir but first off we got a lot of ground to cover with Congressman
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:25.120]  Hansen so but you're showing the pattern here that links up with today of why
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:31.640]  Congress won't do anything to the IRS yes now what's interesting here is it was
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:37.000]  later exposed well there's more than 10 years later that one of the IRS
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:45.560]  operatives that was used against Montoya was later used against Senator
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:53.760]  Hansen T that person's name is everon ride he was transferred this is now in
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:02.560]  1975 he was transferred from Albuquerque to Salt Lake City so they have to find
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:07.920]  specialist goons to target good people even in these rogue agencies they find
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:14.440]  specialist hit men to do these political jobs yes and when he arrived in Salt Lake
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:22.160]  City everon ride who is now promoted to IRS intelligence chief oh he was
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:32.120]  collaborating with IRS district director Howard Martin and they use the same
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:39.760]  blueprint that destroyed senator Montoya and senator long only this time
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:45.320]  the target was congressman George Hansen let's talk about what they did to him
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:54.840]  okay this is an election year 1976 and in that summer there was a fateful event
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:03.080]  the Teton damn burst and as a result of that a lot of Idaho citizens and
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:10.920]  businessmen lost everything they had congressman Hansen let the battle to
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:19.400]  secure over 400 million dollars and flood damage reimbursements but before the
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:26.640]  waters barely even subsided the other side of government showed up what
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:34.440]  happened next truly warps the mind agents from the IRS swooped down on the
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:42.600]  flood victims with plans to tax their government relief payments congressman
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:51.520]  Hansen bought them on that tooth and nail he called it a flood tax then three
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:58.480]  weeks before election day a scandalous article appears in the Lewiston morning
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:05.200]  Tribune and with lots of supporting detail the article alleged that
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:14.960]  congressman Hansen was not paying his taxes now here because of a courageous
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:20.720]  IRS whistleblower named Paul Defossus a lot of these players have been
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:26.480]  identified like I said there was the IRS intelligence chief everon ride there
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:33.000]  was the district chief Howard Martin or Evan ride was contacted by Robert
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.880]  Huckley it was the campaign treasurer to Stan Cress
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:43.840]  Stan Cress was the Democrat candidate who opposed George Hansen and
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:49.720]  information I should say misinformation lies were provided to Robert
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:55.880]  Huckley and then those were used against congressman Hansen by Stan Cress and a
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:02.480]  debate that was being held at Idaho State University so that's key first they
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:07.080]  discredit you they have mainstream media put out this info on you then they
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.920]  come out and indict you for something and then they try to break you torturing
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:17.280]  you in the dungeons yes there was also a clandestine meeting with in the
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:25.520]  offices of professor a history professor Richard Starling's at Rick's college he
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:32.760]  was the campaign manager for Stan Cress well Richard Starling's is now running
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:37.720]  for Congress from the Idaho 2nd district
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.960]  well is he running as a Republican or a Democrat Democrat unbelievable that
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:49.880]  needs to be known yes indeed now what happened here though if George Hansen is
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:57.000]  interesting unlike Senator Ed Long unlike Senator Joseph Montoya George
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.600]  Hansen survived the sabotage and he won re-election
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:13.560]  afterwards the IRS struck again now they put congressman Hansen to the ringer
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:22.320]  with a criminal audit it was a grooving audit it was being conducted by the
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:27.920]  criminal investigation division of the IRS which is hanging out meeting with a
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:34.360]  guy that ran against him yes but once again IRS smear tactics grew up in their
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:43.240]  face after months of auditing it was determined that the government old
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:48.200]  congressman Hansen a refund but it doesn't matter with the IRS there's not
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.880]  just double jeopardy there's triple jeopardy and soon they'll get in their
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:55.920]  hands on him and get him in a dungeon we'll be back with the criminal foreign

[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:59.280]  but the the technicians of it are out of control and look at people like Joe
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:04.720]  Bannister a Treasury agent who found out it was all a scam quit over it but he
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:08.200]  was a rising star they tried to put him in federal prison twice but the jury's
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:15.160]  counting on guilty I mean this is a crazy group folks who've been ruling this
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:18.560]  country and it's getting worse don't forget this hour is brought to you by my
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:22.720]  patriot supply.com forward slash alex super high quality non-gmo

[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:47.880]  let's go back let me just ask you briefly and I want to finish up in this
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.600]  segment the next and then Jesse Ventura's coming on with investigative
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.800]  journalist Mark Adams let me finish up with you I know the story the public
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:00.080]  doesn't know the story hey how was congressman Hanson now George how was
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:06.000]  George doing and then B finish up what happened to him. His rejuvenation powers are
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:14.320]  remarkable he has many many medical afflictions but his mind is hyper razor
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:21.120]  sharp and he fights on and gosh there is so much that has happened to George
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:31.680]  Hanson twice he has been illegally railroaded to prison. The first time when the
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:39.000]  United States Marshals got their hands on him he was giving a speech somewhere
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:49.840]  in the Midwest and they hired a private rear jet to pick him up flew him to
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:57.240]  National Airport booked him into the Alexandria County jail under the alias
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:06.520]  Fred Smith to hide him from his family in front. The second time when they got
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.320]  their hands on him that's when they dragged him all over the country in
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:17.520]  chains with a black box attached to the chains to interfere with your
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:22.800]  circulation to cause those horrible injuries that you enumerated earlier.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:28.240]  Let's be clear they grabbed a congressman like rendition threw him on a
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:33.240]  jet and flew him off I mean this is the mafia that is our government no one is
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:39.280]  safe from these narcotics trafficking murderers. Indeed they can do it to a
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:43.600]  congressman they can do it to anybody and really that's the headline you know
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:50.680]  the true story of a congressman that was kidnapped. Yes indeed that's exactly
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:57.760]  what happened once finally he was tracked down there was a whole cot array of
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:04.600]  congressmen and senators that got a hold of Ed Meese demanding answers but
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:08.800]  really the whole thing was just effectively covered up.
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:13.880]  And people wonder why Congress is scared and bends over it's because the guy
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:18.120]  can be found not guilty twice the next time they grab him and they just
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:22.000]  disappear him he beats that so then they grab him again and drive him around for
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:28.360]  months till his hands and feet burst his toes burst. Yes that is exactly what
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:32.280]  happened to him. Yeah and we've got a few of the photos today but they're not
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.200]  even the ones congressman Hanson sent me when it back in 97 when he first came
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:39.760]  on the show. We'll be right back. Stay with us five more minutes and Jesse
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.000]  Minterra joins us. Mark Adams is our guest can't wait till his book comes out.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.840]  We'll talk about that straight ahead.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.080]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs. Supermale vitality was developed to
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:59.080]  activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:04.160]  chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:09.280]  then concentrated for maximum potency. I just received my male vitality about
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:13.280]  three days ago and I must say that was good stuff. After consulting top doctor
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:17.680]  nutritionist pharmacist and others we have developed what I believe is the
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:24.080]  ultimate non-gmo organic super male vitality formula. Super male vitality by

[01:59:50.360 --> 02:00:00.920]  Waging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:12.800]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:21.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:25.920]  Jones. People ask me all the time, Alex, how come you're on the air and haven't
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:31.120]  had repercussions? I've had plenty of repercussions but the whole government's
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.320]  not evil. That's why they have specialists to do this bad stuff and more
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:38.360]  and more they're on the defense because even though they set up this giant
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:42.520]  police state now they've discredited themselves where they don't have public
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.160]  support. In fact a lot of people are now being found not guilty in IRS trials
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:52.000]  that never used to happen. In fact the biggest losses the feds have now are in
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.600]  tax trials. A lot of people across the board, juries, grand juries, know the
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:01.720]  truth and as people write books and we do radio shows and all of it we expose
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:07.080]  that they kidnap Congressman Hanson, rendition like he was a son of
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:11.240]  bin Laden, flew him off the middle of nowhere. This is what they do or then
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:14.360]  chain him up in buses and drove him around the country with his feet burst.
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:20.560]  Mark Adams, I would encourage you to get your book out. Everybody who's writing a
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:23.480]  book is contacted by folks that want to put it out or whatever and that's fine
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:26.080]  but but I would just encourage you because I was asking you during the break
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:29.720]  about when's your book coming out to get it out as soon as possible so it's there
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:33.800]  so the truth gets out about what happened to Congressman Hanson but
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:37.200]  regardless in the three, four minutes we've got left before Jesse Ventura
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:41.680]  joins us. Tell us other points about George Hanson and what he went through.
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:47.400]  Well thank you. One thing I should try to point out, it would take a whole segment
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:53.120]  to explain how they rigged George Hanson's first prosecution. When I say
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:02:01.360]  they, I mean specifically the so-called public integrity section at the Justice
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:06.640]  Department. What a joke, public integrity. It has a whole long insorted
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.920]  history to it. I'd be like calling the Cougars Clan the pro-black people group.
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:17.520]  Indeed, the person who rigged that prosecution working in that so-called
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:28.360]  public integrity section was James Cole. Now James Cole today is deputy
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:35.760]  Attorney General and if we go back and cover some of our recent hearings from
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:44.480]  last month, it was revealed how the so-called public integrity section was
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:53.200]  collaborating with Lois Lerner. What I think here was how they can destroy the
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:58.480]  Tea Party. So the way they destroyed George Hanson, it was a tandem effort
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:06.680]  between the IRS and the so-called public integrity section being led by James
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:11.720]  Cole. Absolutely and they're so discredited now, the agency's a fraud to
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:14.160]  begin with for the private Federal Reserve, but they shouldn't be able to
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:19.240]  prosecute anybody because they're known organized crime. Indeed and what they did
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:25.760]  to George Hanson 30 years ago is being repeated today. But now they're purely a
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:29.080]  democratic operation. As you're about Dallas and other areas, when this came
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:32.960]  out they have public celebrations with Obama signs and say yeah we're gonna
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:38.280]  audit you and MSNBC says yes we're coming for you ah-ha-ha. They're on TV
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:43.400]  bragging that they're criminals. Yes, they are they are not shy about it at all.
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:47.600]  They've gotten away with so much and what we've seen happening right now with
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:52.960]  Christina O'Donnell and with Senator Grassley. Well if we step back and look
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.720]  at the larger picture really that's all just kind of surface fraud compared to
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:03.040]  what would they've gotten away with for the past 40 years or more. Well I want to
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:06.400]  get you back in a few weeks to look in just on Hanson. We kind of told the
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:09.440]  backstory now we'll talk about just what happened with Hanson, the details for
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:12.680]  about 20-30 minutes, then we'll spend time on the current things and the way
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:18.000]  you're crystallizing what they're doing. But it's just so incredible that they
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.680]  get caught and they celebrate and say of course we're auditing you, of course
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.660]  we're coming after you, you're racist and you're not I mean it's just bizarre how
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:31.040]  criminal they are and Acorn and all these groups are above the law and and do
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:35.720]  whatever they want and I mean it's just it's just so wild thank you so much Mark
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:39.040]  Adams. Is there any website or any place people can visit what you're doing?
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:42.880]  We're getting one under construction right now I guess the last words I would
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:50.760]  have to say is the deadly arm that wields the hammer of tyranny is the IRS. The
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:58.240]  Tea Party has to assert itself. Save America. Shut down the IRS. Absolutely criminal
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:03.540]  operation. City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:07.600]  I didn't like this dirt in it. God knows what's in this. These people just sampled
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:11.640]  City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet. Next we had them try a
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:16.560]  sample of tap water filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system. Now
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:20.760]  when it is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep I know what good water tastes like. It's good water.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:25.920]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:29.800]  many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of
[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:34.320]  major health issues including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer. It tastes
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:38.600]  like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water. The Pro Pure G2.0
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:43.160]  filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving only fresh tasting
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:47.680]  deliciously clean water. Okay this is very tasty. It's good water. Refreshing. It's

[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:06.120]  because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified. Most
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:10.840]  people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:16.160]  is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid. I discovered
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:20.440]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:25.200]  true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:28.720]  said listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:33.760]  earth deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had have
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:39.520]  been life-changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:43.320]  ladies and gentlemen this is innovating and the best part is it helps fund

[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:40.720]  Well ladies and gentlemen you won't be getting any sound bites here. The next
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:44.600]  50 plus minutes we've got for Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura on the
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:50.640]  broadcast and I have been very close to this case in the last two plus years
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:58.040]  between Jesse Ventura and Chris Kyle both Navy SEALs because I was the guy
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.280]  that ended up getting a hold of Jesse through Tyrell and was the one that told
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:09.160]  him what had been said on Opie and Anthony and then Fox News and he was
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:13.400]  just shell shocked I was there on audio Skype with him and his wife and I've
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:16.560]  known him for years about nine years we become friends he's come down and
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:20.680]  visited me in Austin I've traveled around the country with him I know he's a
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.440]  real guy doesn't even mean I agree with all his politics he didn't agree with all
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:31.460]  of mine but we're both real guys and then I looked into Chris Kyle God rest his
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:34.640]  soul and I'm sorry for his wife and we're gonna go to Ventura to give you
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:39.560]  the rest of story but I sat here when he was in a 3M tournament last week and
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:43.040]  couldn't really respond because he committed to be part of that and watch
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:48.080]  the media hit piece the next phase first I get calls saying Jesse Ventura got
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:54.480]  an argument with a cop almost got arrested speeding to an airport in LA I
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:57.920]  call him up Minnesota and I because I got his home number and I said governor
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:02.320]  they just said last night you were in LA flying you don't fly he goes no not for
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:05.680]  over a year Alex as you know what are you talking about I said well they claim
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.560]  you're you're you know you're running around doing this it was all over
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:14.960]  national news he went that's crazy I've I'm on record I'm here I you know was
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:19.400]  doing business yesterday I played golf and let me come on your show remember
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:24.480]  that so that didn't work was almost other weird stuff going on and then right
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.720]  as he had been on the show about a week before he was driving into Mexico in his
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.640]  RV to go to Baja where he spends part of the year during when it's below zero in
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:36.080]  Minnesota just giving you background story we're going to him because he'll
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.240]  never really defend himself because he defend himself for the trial look at the
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:42.920]  inside baseball on that but I watched it as a media analyst I know how these
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:45.840]  tricks work so I couldn't get a hold of him for three days because they don't
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:50.840]  have a cell phone that works in Mexico as they announce perfect timing that he
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:53.880]  was saying I'm glad the seals are dead and he got knocked out and all this made
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:58.360]  up stuff which would have come out in the news at the time that was true so I
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:01.720]  call him get a hold of him at first he goes come on Alex don't you know you
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:05.440]  never joke around I don't appreciate this you know no they're really saying
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:08.840]  that it what and I'm not going to go into what he privately said but it really
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:12.560]  hit him hard and I've seen him meet veterans and airports and stuff with
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:16.000]  their arms and legs blown off and get tears in his eyes saying that's why I'm
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.960]  against these wars then they don't take care of you of course his dad was in
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:23.920]  World War two won a bunch of bronze stars his mom was in World War two or my
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:29.120]  grandfather was at in North Africa so he really cares about our military but
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.880]  again they could do this to anybody they've tried to destroy me before with
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:36.720]  some similar dirty tricks but not as concerted and we caught him quickly so
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:41.680]  they backfired so then he sues Kyle because Kyle won't back down he said
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:45.760]  just say it in true meant the truth I'll back off but Ventura started seeing his
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:50.200]  movie offers and TV offers get cut back it really defamed him people said what
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.360]  are you doing having a guy on the air I could have testified but you know they
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.640]  didn't ask me what are you doing have that guy on he's glad the Navy SEALs are
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:02.800]  dead so as a sigh up written by news core they have an insurance policy when
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:09.320]  they lose a suit it's called omissions insurance is what they call we've bought
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:13.040]  it before when I have been involved in big films and things because you know
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:15.840]  you've always got to be careful we bought it before from I'm not gonna get
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:20.400]  into it you buy from Lloyd's of London or anywhere and so that's alive that he's
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:26.760]  suing his wife okay he sued the man who was alive with him mysteriously died up
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:31.040]  there at that shooting range and that's very mysterious and so then he wins the
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:36.600]  lawsuit and I see the Minnesota newspapers with nothing about him winning
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:40.960]  it's all about the trial and and what had been said by Kyle about him Fox News
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:47.760]  CNN MSNBC all did the same thing against Ventura and I'm going to him but I
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:50.520]  just want to defend him here because I haven't done this yet and I've done it
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:53.800]  some but I want to do it with him here so you could respond to spur him to tell
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:59.080]  the story that he knows because he just says oh it's sea story sailor stories
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:03.120]  not true hurt my reputation I had to you know get the truth out my name you know
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.200]  nobody's a winner well the truth's a winner because he knew what was gonna
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:11.920]  happen but Fox was all yeah after the guy knocked him out and after he was glad
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:15.440]  the fields were dead everybody knows Ventura says that I watched Fox and
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:18.560]  Friends say this everybody knows Ventura says this all the time he's glad
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:23.000]  trips are dead then they didn't show a clip just like MSNBC says I'm deeply
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.360]  racist doesn't show a clip and you know everybody knows Ventura you know says
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.720]  this all the time and yeah he got mad at Kyle so he sued the ladies you know his
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:35.800]  wife the widow and now is taking everything she's got none of that's
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:39.960]  true folks Ventura now joins us I'm gonna shut up give him the floor we're
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:43.520]  gonna skip this network break coming up to gain back the time thanks for giving
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:47.440]  us the hour governor thanks for telling the truth and thanks for standing up
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:51.680]  for everybody because I admire the fact that they tried to destroy you and
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:56.080]  defame you you stayed the course you made the judicial system work with the
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:02.520]  jury and the system cannot stand it they cannot stand it go ahead well you know
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:09.000]  it's it was an exhausting couple of weeks Alex sitting in that courtroom and
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:16.240]  and seeing your their only defense was to attack me personally because they had
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.960]  no evidence now all of their witnesses they promised the jury they were gonna
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:28.640]  parade 11 witnesses up there who saw the event the only one that it turned out
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:35.520]  saw the event I think 11 or 12 times we impeached his testimony and he really
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:41.480]  perjured himself between his deposition and what he said on the stand so he had
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:45.960]  no credibility but they promised that there'd be 11 witnesses up there that
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:52.080]  would verify Chris Kyle's story they produced zero of actual evidence now
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:58.360]  they produce people up there that you know the old baffle with BS stuff plenty
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:02.880]  of that and they went after me personally can you believe this they
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:09.440]  actually took conspiracy theory which is entertainment it's my job I'm doing a
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:17.160]  show and they actually use that as their evidence amazing in the trial I mean
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:22.880]  how could anyone you know that's a TV show that I happened to deal with
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:28.520]  investigating conspiracies it's reality television but it's by no means a
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:34.800]  documentary all we did was put out the information and you as a viewer can
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:38.920]  decipher it decide on your own if you want to believe it if you think there's
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:44.040]  beat on the bone or you know if you think it's all BS you know you can take
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:48.880]  whatever in fact a lot of times a lot of times you'd end up thinking what you
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:51.720]  were covering I mean you would go out and investigate to see if it was true or
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:56.320]  not sure and it's interesting because that's a niche market there's a lot of
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:01.360]  people that love conspiracy so why wouldn't you do a show about that and
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:06.360]  they tried to use that as evidence and all this other stuff and you know I came
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:12.000]  in with solid witnesses who had been with me get this in the end it turned
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.800]  out their witnesses had the assault taking place and I think five or six
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:26.640]  different locations no two matched up not even two matched up in the location
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:33.840]  where they alleged it took place they had me there there was a rental car
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:40.200]  receipt which they produced that showed that I arrived at 729 and rented my car
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:46.440]  in San Diego which means I couldn't even a got to McPee's no sooner than 830 in
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:51.400]  the evening they had witnesses there that testified they saw me there at five
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.560]  in the afternoon in a Hawaiian shirt with flip flops and shorts on and they
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:00.640]  also said from when I read that you were drunk everyone knows you haven't had any
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:05.760]  alcohol for decades and I've been with you Alex they you know Kyle himself they
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:10.080]  didn't really that's wrong the media the media was saying that reported that
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:15.120]  wrongly then because their testimony they all testified to know they didn't
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:20.320]  see me drinking at all but they thought but they tried to downplay their
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.960]  drinking and their drinking was immense that night as I knew it would be let me
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:32.360]  state this the Navy SEALs that testified against me on the stand they did
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:39.120]  exactly how they're trained to do they did because we have a t-shirt which I
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:44.480]  submitted as evidence that's a Navy SEAL slogan it says on the back of the
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:51.840]  t-shirt admit nothing deny everything and make counter accusations because
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:57.960]  that's how you're trained in the Navy SEALs and they followed it to a T they
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:03.360]  admitted nothing they denied everything and they made counter accusations
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.640]  exactly how is their trained so you know that didn't shock me but it did wrench
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:15.600]  my heart because I learned how much they all hate me and I didn't do anything and
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:21.720]  that's the part where I can never win is the fact there's a whole generation
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:27.520]  now I can't call them SEAL brothers because when I went through they weren't
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:33.960]  even born yet so I guess I would refer to them as my SEAL sons I have a whole
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.440]  generation of SEAL sons now who hate my guts and I didn't do anything well they
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:43.400]  also spun in the media like you started all this when Chris Kyle's the one that
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:48.440]  wrote the book with news core and ran around making all this stuff up well you
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:54.800]  know Mr. Kyle wrote the book and the book is wrong get the Harper Collins has
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:19:00.520]  now agreed that any more printings of that chapter will be removed yet they
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:05.120]  said they were standing by Kyle 100% well then why are they removing the
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:14.280]  chapter now to cover their butts you know but I you know it's a shame it got
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:18.320]  there because I want people to know that and here's another thing they need to
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:25.040]  know they always have a lot of these what do you call it settlement ordered
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:31.480]  conferences that the judge orders with a judge presiding and I can tell you this
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:37.920]  never once would they move one inch on restoring my reputation or admit the
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:43.120]  story was fabricated they took that off the table right at the start I told them
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  that was the reason I was suing it all they would offer me was money they they
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:53.480]  told me that they said nope it's the only thing we'll discuss is money now
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:20:01.040]  they did make me a money offer to go away but I refused because my thing was
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:05.920]  the truth I did not want my name tarnished at the level that it had been
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:12.120]  tarnished and hurt and I'll never get fully restored it's impossible now but
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:18.040]  the point is I wouldn't be bought off so I risk going to trial and according to
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:23.920]  what I'm reading is that I was the major underdog on this thing because you know
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:29.880]  defamation has a very high level at the federal level yes let me tell you your
[02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:36.600]  listeners this on the internet there's the national review online and an H.A. Delgado
[02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:42.200]  and he's a lawyer in a conservative wrote a phenomenal piece called justice for
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:48.320]  Jesse Ventura was right in his lawsuit I would encourage all of Alex all your
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.040]  listeners to go and get this and read it we'll put it on screen right now and
[02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:57.400]  I'll read some passages from it justice for Jesse the Ventura was right in his
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:03.680]  lawsuit national review well look bottom line it was a Psyop and if they can do
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:09.680]  this to you Jesse Ventura they can do it to Ron Paul Alex Jones Matt Drudge
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:19.680]  Alex you're deeper that I won't go as far to say it was a Psyop I don't know but a
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:25.000]  lot of things don't add up and the fact that they would not move an inch they
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.520]  forced me I had no choice but to go to trial because if I didn't go to trial it
[02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:36.320]  would have been in a movie well here get this Alex their lawyer says to me and
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:40.840]  he thinks he's gonna nail me on my insignificance well you hear this he
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:46.080]  says mr. Ventura would it surprise you to know that in the first the first draft
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:52.000]  of the screenplay that you're not in it and what happened to you is not in it
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:57.560]  and he was doing that to get the jury to believe that that's how irrelevant I was
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:22:02.880]  to the monetary of this book and my response from the stand I looked at him
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:07.920]  and said no it doesn't surprise me at all because we've already sent Warner
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:13.360]  Brothers two letters telling them that if it is indeed in the film they will be
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:18.480]  next to be sued and I said I've worked in Hollywood Warner Brothers doesn't
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:23.560]  traditionally like to step into lawsuits so I said it doesn't surprise me a bit
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:28.600]  that it's not there I said it better not be there and for those that don't know to
[02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:33.640]  stop it from being there sure for those that don't know Clint Eastwood is
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:38.680]  making that movie and again I mean imagine they put you in the middle of
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:43.600]  this they sandwich you in there and governor I mean look at all the hacking
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:47.040]  scandals and the rest of it with news core and their imprint that put this
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:52.560]  book out and then Chris Kyle gets mysteriously killed and and there's guys
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:58.560]  in craft hats and the same pants and everything running security in Boston
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:01.800]  I'm not saying they were involved not even saying it's craft but it's the same
[02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:06.560]  uniform as people war and then he ends up getting killed we I mean we know they
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:12.560]  use seals for major shy ops now I've had high-level spymasters on like Steve
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:16.920]  Pachennick saying it's wrong to use the seals for for the other type of PR I
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.200]  mean what about the story saying you got in trouble in Los Angeles or got in
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:25.760]  trouble you know at the airport I mean it's all just made up well you know
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:31.800]  that's been going on and I'm not pulling it Alex but believe it or not that's
[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:35.880]  been going on whenever you're a public figure I mean I'll give you an example
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:41.800]  Borger the lawyer that I went against this isn't my first encounter with him
[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:48.160]  a decade ago it's a fun story decades ago I was involved in what was called the
[02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:53.640]  smoke-free generation it was way back in like the early 90s and we were trying
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:59.040]  to encourage a generation to get rid of to not use tobacco don't smoke the
[02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:04.520]  smoke-free generation well I've never I don't smoke but I did use Copenhagen I
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:08.960]  was a jeweler and I felt that the kids needed to know that chewing is not a
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:14.520]  safe alternative that chewing is if not more dangerous it's certainly just as
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:20.480]  dangerous as Tony Gwynne while you can't anymore because Tony unfortunately
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:25.360]  died from his use of chewing tobacco debate the great baseball player from
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:32.240]  San Diego but anyway I was involved in the smoke-free generation and Borger is
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:37.600]  also the lawyer for the Star Tribune newspaper and they had a columnist named
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:43.240]  CJ and she wrote this front-page article maybe we should call him Jesse the
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:49.640]  butt where where he accused me of being at the smoke-free target center I was
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:54.200]  smoking a cigarette and that I gave people a hard time and then mashed it
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:59.920]  out in the carpeted floor well it turned out that night I was in Cannon Falls
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:05.880]  Minnesota at a horse show with my wife hundreds of people saw me there even the
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:10.320]  security of the target center knew I was not there they do me well for my days
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:15.720]  of wrestling well then we had this is Borger now the same lawyer that
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:21.440]  represented Chris Kyle I had this run in with him before years earlier on this
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:26.880]  slander thing well you know I didn't sue because they ended up they did an
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:31.520]  investigation they found out the same thing it was true I was not there it
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:36.960]  never happened the same as this story it never happened and of course they
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:40.920]  printed a full retraction in the Minneapolis paper and I asked them to
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:47.120]  make a donation to make a wish you know for what they did and they refused they
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:54.040]  would not even donate a hundred bucks to make a wish for kids you know because I
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:58.320]  felt you know you ought to pay a little penalty here make a donation to charity
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:03.440]  and they wouldn't all they would do by law is write an equal retraction or John
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:08.840]  Borger was the same lawyer who Chris Kyle had incredible I want to hear more
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:12.400]  about inside the trial and then get into news issues and get your take on it but
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:16.840]  the reason I've defended you is I believe you I could see that it was a
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:21.160]  hit piece whether it was a psi off or not the whole thing stunk to high heaven
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:25.320]  and then now I'm even more sure I was a hundred percent sure but now I'm even more
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:33.360]  110% the way I would watch Fox News and you would think that you had won they
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.320]  would literally repeat the lie what they done how he knocked you out well here's
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:44.840]  the deal to they also sit there and question the jury now here are people
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:52.280]  on Fox News who were not there they have no direct evidence of what was submitted
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:57.480]  in the trial the jury and I sat there through the whole thing and they would
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:03.520]  dare question the jury's decision when they do not know if they have no hands on
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:09.880]  eyewitness evidence of what what was submitted in trial well and yet they
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.720]  questioned the jury they were outraged over the jury's decision outraged well
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:20.400]  they framed it like Jesse Ventura body slams widow and nowhere did they ever
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:26.000]  admit that they have an insurance policy yeah exactly and and not only that but
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.600]  you know in that in the Justice for Jesse piece on the national review she
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:35.880]  points that out she said it's a very common thing in litigation when the
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:42.480]  person being who's dies it automatically goes to their estate especially like she
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.160]  said when the estate has profited from the very litigation that you're talking
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:53.680]  about well you know I've studied defamation of public figures and I've
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:56.360]  been involved in it a few times myself when I had to sue people and they
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:27:59.600]  settled out of court because it was show over the top where they're saying I'm
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:06.360]  gonna destroy you I made this up you've got them it is extremely hard to do what
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.200]  you did so you must have put on one hell of a case that the media doesn't want the
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:14.880]  public to know about and I've seen major law journals since you won last week
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.880]  saying this is precedent setting and I'm glad because I'm sick of people thinking
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:23.920]  they can just say whatever they want about public figures I mean you know it to
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:29.720]  me Alex you know maybe in the world of law and in defamation and slander it was
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:36.680]  I don't know but I always felt I simplified it the truth I had the truth
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:43.040]  so they can say that I'm this huge underdog my belief is how can you how
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:49.840]  can the truth be an underdog how can you possibly be an underdog when you have
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:53.360]  the truth that the reality of the truth that never happened let me ask you this
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:56.880]  then we're gonna break in one minute do you think Chris Kyle got drunk that
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:01.320]  night and did punch somebody out and thought it was you baby I don't know I
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:06.080]  certainly he was drunk they all were all the young seal but they had a thousand
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:12.400]  bucks and this is back in 2006 they had a thought the import they had a thousand
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:17.440]  dollars that they spent on alcohol that night now how much can you drink for a
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:23.960]  grand how many of them was it how many there I don't know 20 maybe yeah they
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:27.640]  got fallen down drunk you know but I mean you're talking they had a thousand
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:33.920]  bucks because Chris Kyle was in charge of it and they had a thousand bucks that
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:39.840]  they've bought and you can bet McPeese, McPartlin's an old seal he's gonna give
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:45.160]  him a rate on it you think they're gonna pay full fare absolutely not well
[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:50.600]  let's come back and talk about more with Jesse Ventura we're on the March the
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:57.600]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:04.360]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:07.880]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:11.920]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:16.120]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:20.000]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:31.280]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well

[02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:34.080]  network folks I'll tell you why they went after Jesse Ventura they got his
[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:37.520]  phones tapped he's talked about that when he was governor it's come out their
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:42.520]  blackmailing Congress they know there's no real dirt on Ventura and they know
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:48.280]  that he's not gonna sell out to him I mean he had one of the top hand jobs in
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:53.240]  MSNBC and he can tell that story he wouldn't play ball so they basically got
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:59.240]  rid of him and so they don't like people like that out there that's why they do
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:05.160]  these dirty tricks against Ron Paul and so many others and I've seen it over and
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:08.840]  over again so whether Kyle made it up or whether he was drunk and didn't know what
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:13.200]  was going on I'm sad for him but boy you talk about a Greek tragedy Governor
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:21.520]  Ventura it's wild for me I mean you know you sue him he dies somebody a crazy
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:27.080]  guy reportedly shoots him in a shooting range and then you go to court and you
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:33.160]  win and then the Fox News Fox and friends I saw was just bizarre where they
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:37.840]  wouldn't even say you'd won basically when I tuned in it was all just how
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:43.280]  horrible you were and you know basically like it was true and I mean I mean I know
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:48.160]  you're not litigious and don't like suing people but at the same time Fox News
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:52.520]  one time O'Reilly we played the clip goes there's people online sexually
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:56.760]  stalking women and there's all sorts of other problems and pedophilia and you
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:02.240]  name it and hate speech and they cut to a clip of me yelling and screaming as if
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:06.400]  I'm a sexual predator when there's never been an accusation of that never been an
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:11.720]  issue with that and then MSNBC my lawyer said no you can win a lawsuit it'll
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:15.000]  cost you half million to a million they'll keep appealing it and you might
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.640]  get to a three million do you want to spend that much time to get you know and
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:23.120]  I said no they're so discredited saying I'm deeply racist and influence the Boston
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:27.880]  bombers with no proof that I'm not gonna do it but my lawyer the top lawyer in
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:33.840]  Austin hands down number three in Texas monthly he said you can win this lawsuit
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:37.520]  but do you want to do it I would imagine your lawyer one of the top guys in the
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:41.520]  country well-known I would imagine he gave you a similar speech give us some
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:45.800]  of the inside baseball on the trial and stuff that wasn't in the news governor
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:53.240]  well he didn't give me a speech like that we we went from day one of we David
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:59.080]  spend my attorney now for 25 30 years I can't even remember how long and I'm not
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.600]  a Johnny come lately with David Olson this past year he was named the top
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:08.240]  attorney in the state of Minnesota which I think he earned and deserved but I've
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:12.480]  been with him and I he's been that way for me you know all through my career
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:17.800]  and not we always you know when I contacted him you know he knew this
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:22.440]  story was not true because I told him it wasn't that as we gathered evidence and
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:27.400]  did depositions all of their witnesses became ours because you know they
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:33.240]  couldn't state they saw me get hit nobody saw the punch and yet Kyle stated in
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:36.800]  deposition there were four people standing around me within three feet
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:44.920]  when he hit me wow where are these four people they couldn't produce them so in
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:50.520]  my opinion you know that you it was he I was the jury said it was difficult but
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:55.320]  to me the evidence was so overwhelming I had no marks on me we had
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:00.480]  photographs we had everything so David I we got my attorney we went into this
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:06.560]  fully knowing that we had truth on our side and he knows me well enough after
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:11.520]  25 years I'm not going to back down that we're going to go to court if it
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:18.000]  requires that but when they would not offer any type of you know retraction
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:23.520]  and like I said initially I had told them initially when I got back into the
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:28.920]  country I said if Chris Kyle will simply go on television with me at midi
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:35.200]  fabricated the story apologize I would forgive him we could shake hands and go
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:40.800]  our separate way they wouldn't do it why because the millions were coming in the
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:46.280]  cash was paying off and they weren't about to get away from that money and you
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:51.240]  know they weren't going to do anything that inhibited it do you know the book
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:57.040]  so the book company said it's the biggest the guy has been there 15 years
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:00.880]  on the stand and he said it's the biggest selling book since he's been
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:05.200]  there incredible and now they've got Clint Eastwood making a movie out of it
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:11.400]  yeah and and and they're trying and here's the good one today before it went
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:18.160]  on sale they had it's fully that $5,000 pre-orders after he did opiate Anthony
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:25.360]  and O'Reilly that night a hundred thousand in one day and they're trying to
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:30.640]  say that I didn't have something to do with it no they used you as the
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:34.880]  detonator you're absolutely right to sell the book to then put it on every
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:39.480]  news channel out there Jesse Ventura's glad seals are dead and got knocked out
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:45.800]  I mean designed to defame you and designed to enrich themselves while they
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:50.360]  crap all over you and anyone else associated with you and then you're the
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:56.080]  bad guy for going and proving it was a fraud yeah that's precisely it Alex
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:03.480]  that's exactly it I'm now the bad guy for having the truth on my side and going
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:08.480]  the proper way in a court of law and winning a trial and now they even
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:13.920]  questioned the jury how could the jury do this well the jury saw the evidence
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:18.760]  and they saw it clearly you know because every all the people out there
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:22.360]  saying it's astounding I want well you also made the point I talked to you on
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:25.560]  the over Skype when you first learned of this a few years ago and this first
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:30.840]  happened time flies you said Alex plus it would be suicidal to walk into a Navy
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.680]  seal bar and say I'm glad Navy seals are being killed that would be the
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:38.480]  equivalent of walking into the Hell's Angel clubhouse and say and they sock
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:45.760]  oh man you know that would be the equivalent you know you and not only
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:50.800]  that but I was there with my friends who testified the case in fact that the
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:55.520]  wits Bill and Charlene his wife that was the first night she ever met me and
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:02.280]  both of them testified that I left before they did and nothing had happened
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:07.440]  yeah you're not a big partier I mean you know I am but it was a three-day week
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:11.760]  we still have the next day we had a graduation to go to and then the
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:16.440]  following day I had a big picnic to do it was a three-day event for us because
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.000]  for me it was the graduate and here's the other thing if I felt that way about
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:26.520]  my unit the Navy seals which I never would why would I be there attending the
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:34.800]  graduation of 258 I buy Centennial class I was in class 58 class 258 was
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.600]  graduating the next morning or the next day and then we were having a picnic and
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.980]  that's what the tradition is when when you're Centennial class I was there for
[02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:48.600]  150 years you're not a warmonger the truth is you're not a warmonger and a
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:51.680]  bunch of these guys got around and probably if I had to speculate just
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:56.880]  cooked up you know defaming you know one person did it wasn't a bunch of them
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:01.960]  yeah one person did it no you should you said some of his buddies went along
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:09.680]  with it though well put it this way Alex if you'll die for someone won't you lie
[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:17.040]  for them yeah well you know they'll all die for him there's no doubt in my mind
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:22.320]  about that you know and like I told you remember the seals did what they're
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:26.480]  trained to do it did nothing deny everything and make counter accusations
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:30.240]  sure but I mean I come off as a bombastic guy on air but I'm pretty
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:34.640]  calm in person you're calm on air but also very calm in person and you're
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:40.360]  into being control the situation being calm being cerebral I mean it's just as
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:44.480]  soon as I heard the story I knew it was completely asinine that and then I
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:48.440]  called you and of course it was pure bull and then all the people laughing at
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:52.720]  you saying you were a liar I guess they're still just laughing because we
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:56.480]  live in this world of just a bunch of dishonorable people especially in the
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:02.000]  media well look look you know how I feel about it should we have some fun with
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.760]  it remember when Chevy Chase did the movie where they were the Vegas
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:10.920]  vacation oh yeah yeah and you remember the very last scene where they're sitting
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:15.880]  there with the old guy and Chevy's trying to win his money back and the old guy
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:22.920]  gets the right ticket oh yeah yeah you know I won I won I won I won and the
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:29.320]  bottom line is box news can't happen Jesse Ventura beat the odds and won
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:34.920]  despite everything they could do to destroy me see they thought mainstream
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:39.720]  thought Alex that they were throwing the last shovel of dirt on the legacy of
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:45.200]  Jesse Ventura that I couldn't possibly win this and it was political suicide
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:51.160]  for me well I always believe in the truth always will and to me the truth
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:56.280]  prevailed and you know they're attacking now but the worm will turn
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:01.440]  because more as the truth gets out it already is because there's more and more
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:07.040]  stories coming out Chris Kyle stated all the money's going to charity well look
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:12.240]  at the trial records none of it hardly has gone to charity less than 2% of the
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:17.160]  millions have gone to charity you know what the excuse is well you can't give
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:21.080]  more than $13,000 without getting taxed well what's the matter with creating a
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:26.960]  nonprofit a five or whatever they call it that's not hard to do and of course
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:30.840]  they're not gonna make money off the movie either I mean I feel sad for his
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:39.640]  wife because well I mean you know how much that the writers have made six
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:46.200]  million six million six million off the book sure she's got royalties coming
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:51.080]  for he travels around the country into speaking engagements it's paid well for
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.560]  that sure when I say well I say I feel sorry for I'm sorry her husband put her
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:00.720]  in this position okay well you know maybe you want to check on something else too
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.800]  there's a thing and right there in Texas and you're in your bankruptcy courts
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:10.440]  that she's heavily involved in interesting and it's very much parallel
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:15.800]  my case you want to check it out it's right the Texas bankruptcy courts right
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:23.440]  now it's he's suing our craft really yeah and there's a whole bunch of public
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:28.560]  info on it you know we couldn't submit it we wanted to submit it into the trial
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:34.440]  but here let me read this from David also attached as a public document from
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:39.040]  Taya Kyle's Texas lawsuit against her late husband's business partners the
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:43.640]  attached is the answer to the business partners filed to her complaint and it
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:48.880]  alleges that Chris Kyle did not include Taya Kyle as a member of his company
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:54.760]  Craft International because they were about to get divorced so she may not be
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:59.320]  the loving wife she pretends to be the media may be interested Matt that the
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:04.440]  as well as the lawsuit but it's right now in Texas bankruptcy court Chris Kyle
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:09.640]  made that company purposely so that he couldn't get anything from it did taste
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:15.720]  they divorced Wow that's what your lawyer saying that's amazing that's not
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:20.680]  the same he's not saying it at all this is in a Texas lawsuit that's right there
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:25.440]  with public record oh wow so she's saying that in her suit yes wow no this
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:30.760]  isn't my lawyer at all that we tried to use this in our case but the government
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:35.840]  but the judge wouldn't allow it Wow but it's factual it's happening right in
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:42.960]  Texas right now it's in Texas bankruptcy court she has sued Chris's
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:46.440]  business craft I just found the headline thanks for telling us about it's in the
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:49.400]  Dallas morning news we'll put that headline back up on screen and I'll
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:54.120]  read it to the listeners out there slain American sniper Chris Kyle's former
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:58.800]  business partner says his widow's lawsuit is completely groundless well
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:01.560]  why don't they just blame it on you why don't they just say that's your fault
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:13.680]  too well if they could they would don't give him any ideas Alex was done with a court case no I'm joking how's Terry
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:20.280]  doing she's doing as well as can be expected the stress was tough on her she
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:26.320]  had to testify one day and she did very well at you know which I knew she would
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:31.160]  but it did later on it had its toll took its toll on her now I want to shift
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:35.120]  gears into some other areas I want to talk about in the next segment your TV
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:39.000]  show that I like watching it's really good my internet show absolutely but
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:44.720]  TV's TV my friend Twitter.com forward slash gov Jay Ventura and there's also
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:49.400]  pound I stand with Jesse for Twitter and other things I've seen massive
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:53.360]  organized attacks against you just started getting going on Twitter folks
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:47:00.120]  need to follow you there at gov Jay Ventura I stand with Jesse hashtag I
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:04.640]  stand with Jesse and all these people that just want some cheap propaganda to
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:08.640]  go after you they need to stand up for the First Amendment and stand up people
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:14.880]  to tell the truth speaking of wars what do you make of IS and ISIS being turned
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:21.760]  loose by the West been gauzy I mean I mean what do you make of the NSA I can
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:26.520]  only say this Alex I must be a prophet when I was against the Iraq war back in
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:33.040]  2003 because it's a holy hell mess over there isn't it boy it is and it wasn't
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:39.200]  quite that bad Batman was it no and and you know here's the thing that disturbs
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:44.200]  me even more so did you read the other day how they just caught that we had
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:50.280]  operatives from Central America sneaking into Cuba yes disrupting now isn't that
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:57.960]  terrorism well yeah and they were using never done one thing to us in 50 years
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:01.800]  the only thing is that they have a government that apparently our
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:07.960]  government obviously doesn't like and he doesn't allow corporations in there so
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:14.400]  we were allowed to put operatives into Cuba to try to overthrow their
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:19.560]  government sure they were using AIDS Foundation fronts yes so it's really bad
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:23.920]  to use charities because that discredits all charities exactly so here we are
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:29.400]  using the charities as a front to go in and try to overthrow the Castro
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:34.920]  government well who has done nothing to us yeah Alex can you think of anything
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:39.840]  Cuba's done to us in your lifetime no I don't agree with their government but
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:44.280]  it's true that our own government is more authoritarian on many fronts
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:50.320]  whether the government aside the country of Cuba have they done anything to the
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:54.600]  United States of America in your lifetime no other than other than dumping
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:59.800]  their prisoners out to come in on the Cuban boatloads well we didn't have to
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.600]  take them did we no no I hear you on that point I listen I'd love to be able to
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:06.480]  travel to Cuba and go scuba diving there I hear it's really nice well and you
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:11.600]  might enjoy a cigar there too oh yeah hey what's that really good cigar one
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:16.440]  time that we smoked what's that called well that's an Aston cabinet BSG that's
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.680]  Dominican yeah that was really good oh yeah it's the best one see Cuba hasn't
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:25.320]  practiced crop rotation so their tobacco isn't as good you can get as good or
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:29.040]  better across the guys now from Dominican because oh I know those are delicious
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:33.720]  Cuba's made some agricultural mistakes with their tobacco they didn't rotate
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:39.840]  crops but you know what's that done is done hey tell me about this diet briefly
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:45.120]  the diet yeah oh I got a patent this Alex you notice how I've lost weight I
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:49.080]  look in great yeah yeah pose that earlier okay I'm doing everything I'm still
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:54.080]  working out the same way and I still eat everything I normally eat haven't
[02:49:54.080 --> 02:50:00.040]  changed a thing but here's the secret to the diet Alex Jones we ought to patent
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:09.360]  this baby because it's novel for the last month I only drink water I eat normal
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:14.040]  but I only drink water like for example when I play around the golf normally
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:20.200]  I'll drink three of those minute-made lemonade well each one of them's 150
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:28.200]  calories so I'll take in 150 useless calories just drinking lemonade playing
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:33.920]  golf now I drink only water so I've eliminated 450 I'll bet you by just
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:39.240]  drinking water every day with all my meals it's the only liquid I consume I'll
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.720]  bet you to eliminate at least 1500 or more calories a day and I know what we
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:48.600]  call it when we come back with Jesse Ventura straight ahead I'm Alex Jones
[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:54.160]  info wars.com prison planet.com we're gonna send a tweet out saying Jesse

[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:08.400]  alright final segment with Jesse Ventura I'm your host Alex Jones nightly news is
[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:12.960]  back tonight seven and of course that governor you were saying the name of the
[02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:16.560]  diet during the break the water diet finish up with that then I've got one
[02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:21.000]  other point for you okay finish up with your water diet point how much weight
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.920]  you're losing well yeah like I said I I eat normal I eat all the same forts I
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:30.680]  just stopped drinking anything but water when I would play golf I drink like
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:35.880]  three bottles of lemonade well that's 450 calories I eliminated that by
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:40.520]  strictly drinking water I'll bet you I saved 1500 to 2000 calories a day I'm
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:45.120]  telling people you want to lose weight drink only water and eat normal well and
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:48.920]  it turns out exactly the aspartame and other additives in diet coke so their
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:52.360]  diet soft drinks makes you fatter and more hungry incredible hey I promise
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:55.840]  listeners a few weeks ago I'd raise this point because the media spun it and
[02:54:55.840 --> 02:54:59.840]  said Ventura supports totally open borders well I know you and I said no
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:04.120]  that's not it well I asked you during the break and you clarified it what is
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:08.520]  your take on the open borders and what's happening right now well I love I love
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:12.880]  open borders because to me we're all people with the planet earth and why
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:16.600]  should I be required to have paperwork to go around the planet I belong on
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:21.720]  borders are nothing but man-made obstacles now here's the deal if we
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:26.720]  would end the ridiculous war on drugs you would not have this problem at the
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:31.720]  border this is the direct result of the United States war on drugs if we ended
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.720]  it we would have enough money to take care of the border problem and if you're
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:39.520]  gonna blame the people coming up here and getting on welfare well then blame
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:45.040]  the politicians who create a system that allows them to get on welfare but the
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:50.160]  point being is their children for the most part and they're the results of
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:55.080]  their they're more like refugees they're the results of the war on drugs down
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:56:00.280]  there which if the United States would legalize it would go away and probably
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:04.120]  your border problem would disappear with it and look at all the money we have
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:08.400]  Alex if we weren't fighting the war on drugs well look I mean I know your view
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:14.480]  and then that's a hardcore libertarian view and I get it if it wasn't a drug
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:20.040]  war if I can't go to Guatemala and and have a baby with my wife had it paid
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:24.320]  for so I'm saying that is a discriminatory against American citizens
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:28.240]  making them pay for it so I agree with you get rid of the welfare and then we
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:32.400]  get the skilled people up here not the folks looking for something free I mean
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:37.800]  I but I get your humanizing the people and I understand that of you Jesse it's
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:42.120]  just that the larger issue is the Democrats one a bunch of people they
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:48.240]  can put on welfare well I don't necessarily agree with that Alex I'm not
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:54.720]  gonna go that far to me the bigger issue is stop this idiotic war on drugs and
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:59.840]  that it's a complete failure it causes corruption like my mother told me she
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:04.520]  lived through the probation of alcohol before she passed on my mom told me the
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:09.440]  war on drugs is identical all it does is make criminals rich and powerful let's
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:14.720]  end it let's take our heads out of the sand and deal with drug addiction the
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:18.920]  way it should be medically not criminally I totally agree with you governor
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:22.360]  Jesse Ventura in a minute and a half we've got left tell us more about some
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:27.720]  of the episodes on the TV show aura.tv forward slash off the grid well Jesse
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:31.280]  will be going off the grid sooner than you think I was forced to come on the
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:36.280]  grid the funny part is here in my home in Minnesota I lost my electricity twice
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:40.120]  already this summer because of storms and when I'm off the grid I never lose
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:44.640]  it imagine that Alex that's right you do a lot of the show from Mexico off the
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:49.400]  grid yeah but I'm forced to do it up here on the grid temporarily because of
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:53.000]  the trial and all that stuff so I'm looking forward to getting back down to
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.040]  Mexico and doing it like it's supposed to be done off the grid the way we do it
[02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:01.080]  down there although I'm still enjoying it here but we're still dealing with the
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:04.200]  controversial topics and I'll tell people if you want to hear more about the
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:08.360]  court case go to off the grid because that's why I speak openly about it
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:12.520]  there's only a couple places here and on my own show that I'm talking about it
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.960]  you're not gonna hear the truth I'm being streamed media I'm sure that now after
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:20.720]  what they've done at your job they've done to me absolutely and again you
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:23.520]  said you'll come back in September governor say hi to your wife everybody
