[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen it's incredible here we are another global transmission in
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.560]  Hollywood's collapsing the NFL's collapsing the official cover-up of
[00:13.560 --> 00:18.160]  Vegas has basically collapsed it's amazing but they're going to fight back
[00:18.160 --> 00:22.120]  and it's all coming up today this transmission will be one for the record
[00:22.120 --> 00:27.240]  books let's kick it off with John Bowne exposing the Satanic cesspool that is
[00:27.240 --> 00:33.200]  Southern California Governor Jerry Brown is now pitching from left field Fox
[00:33.200 --> 00:37.880]  News reports California health care workers who willfully and repeatedly
[00:37.880 --> 00:42.840]  declined to use a senior transgender patients preferred name or pronouns
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.520]  could face punishments ranging from a fine to jail time under a newly signed
[00:48.520 --> 00:53.600]  law but that's just the appetizer for Governor Moonbeam's appetite for
[00:53.600 --> 00:59.400]  self-destruction so far the HEPA virus has killed 17 and infected nearly 500
[00:59.400 --> 01:04.640]  in the county nearly two-thirds are homeless or drug users but the rest are
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.320]  from the general population the advice remains if you have yet to get your
[01:09.320 --> 01:16.560]  vaccination for HEPA you need to get it the hepatitis A virus is highly
[01:16.560 --> 01:23.880]  contagious and it is transmitted person to person by the fecal oral route the
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.960]  fact that while this is a broad concern there is a targeted subgroup a very
[01:30.960 --> 01:37.080]  focused subgroup in our community that is at high risk for which we have the
[01:37.080 --> 01:44.760]  greatest concern include the homeless IV and illicit drug users men who have
[01:44.760 --> 01:50.520]  sex with men individuals having sexual contact with someone who has the
[01:50.520 --> 01:56.880]  hepatitis a man people with chronic liver disease individuals who have
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.560]  clotting factor disorders now the signing of carefree dangerous blood
[02:02.560 --> 02:07.960]  donation legislation during a massive hepatitis a outbreak in San Diego that
[02:07.960 --> 02:13.680]  could actually spur a larger statewide epidemic breaks all the standards of
[02:13.680 --> 02:20.880]  common sense safety and human rights the people that treat blood plasma as a
[02:20.880 --> 02:28.520]  global commodity as broker brokerage as if it's gold or silver these people need
[02:28.520 --> 02:34.760]  to be rained in some of my competitors resent this but I used to define the
[02:34.760 --> 02:38.920]  United States as the opaque of blood because we supplied most of her now
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.600]  they're gonna use California's the vector for the attack it's bio attack because
[02:43.600 --> 02:46.480]  you need donors they know what they're doing the donors have to be free of
[02:46.480 --> 02:53.640]  disease the brown Satanist but testing free of disease it's safe millions of
[02:53.640 --> 02:57.340]  people over the centuries certainly the post-war period and yet with the
[02:57.340 --> 03:02.440]  hepatitis the main problem is killed tens of thousands of people and a few years
[03:02.440 --> 03:06.960]  we're still here as a planet don't have nuclear war I will go back to this show
[03:06.960 --> 03:12.720]  and say here I am in 2017 saying within three to five years California will have
[03:12.720 --> 03:18.200]  a 200% increase in HIV they will also complain and say we need single-payer we
[03:18.200 --> 03:21.600]  need social self-care the reason we have HIV is because we don't have free health
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.000]  care no the reason you have HIV is because it is a culture now in the gay
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.080]  community that first read about 20 years ago in Rolling Stone to give other
[03:30.080 --> 03:37.840]  people HIV it's truly nihilistic so here's the article progress LA Times
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.040]  knowingly exposing others HIV no longer a felony in California it's the same
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.960]  thing as a parking ticket so it's essentially legalized and here's the
[03:48.960 --> 03:52.440]  LA Times Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony
[03:52.440 --> 03:55.800]  to misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without
[03:55.800 --> 03:59.600]  disclosing the infection how about hepatitis how about everything else the
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.000]  measure also applies to those who give blood without telling blood bank they're
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.880]  HIV positive oh wow don't tell the blood bank your HIV positive this is a
[04:08.880 --> 04:12.520]  religion this is Satanism folks because they can get away with this thing
[04:12.520 --> 04:16.000]  with anything this is totally insane remember the Clinton's row a decade knew
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.320]  that all the blood coming out of their prisons was infected with HIV and
[04:19.320 --> 04:23.240]  hepatitis fact rate is about how the state of Arkansas harvested bad blood
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.920]  from its inmate population and infected thousands of patients around the world
[04:27.920 --> 04:35.000]  with hepatitis C HIV AIDS meanwhile California is on fire massive earthquakes
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.080]  in Mexico signal a big one hitting California any day now then there's the
[04:40.080 --> 04:46.080]  unreliable water supply a mountain of debt a stagnant economy are just a few of
[04:46.080 --> 04:51.760]  the issues facing this land of confusion that recently wanted to allow
[04:51.760 --> 05:01.320]  communists to hold state jobs John bound reporting for info wars calm all the
[05:01.320 --> 05:06.040]  perplexities the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.600]  their Constitution or confederation not from want of honor or virtue so much as
[05:10.600 --> 05:14.720]  from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.680]  those are the words of John Adams the second president of the United States
[05:18.680 --> 05:22.880]  are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve do you understand the nature of
[05:22.880 --> 05:27.720]  our fiat currency you understand how a private corporation has the ability to
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.240]  create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it what kind of leverage to
[05:32.240 --> 05:36.160]  these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people or for that
[05:36.160 --> 05:40.560]  matter what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money will you be
[05:40.560 --> 05:45.320]  a slave or will you be free Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without
[05:45.320 --> 05:49.760]  general knowledge among the people join the info word spread the information
[05:49.760 --> 05:53.600]  educate yourself and others the truth shall set you free

[06:03.800 --> 06:09.160]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end
[06:09.160 --> 06:13.760]  up on top the truth is humanity is coming down fast
[06:13.760 --> 06:24.760]  but we're miles above on our journey to the world listening to the Alex Jones show

[06:45.960 --> 06:52.960]  to be 20 hours a day again thank you so much for joining us where to start I
[06:52.960 --> 06:57.000]  think today I'll do what I do sometimes when the news is just overwhelming I
[06:57.000 --> 07:05.080]  think I'll just read you headlines and then get into the meat potatoes on some
[07:05.080 --> 07:11.640]  of the big specifics report FBI wiped phones and laptops of Las Vegas massacre
[07:11.640 --> 07:16.480]  eyewitnesses wonder why they did that because of all the multiple shooter
[07:16.480 --> 07:24.160]  videos oh now confirmed worker warned hotel before Las Vegas shooter opened
[07:24.160 --> 07:29.040]  fire on crowd and folks were down on the crowd warning people and mainstream
[07:29.040 --> 07:33.960]  media made fun of us and acted like that was fake they knew it wasn't fake they
[07:33.960 --> 07:38.560]  know they're the liars we try to tell the truth doesn't mean we're right all the
[07:38.560 --> 07:45.200]  time but we try to tell the truth big difference Vegas hotel worker warned
[07:45.200 --> 07:52.120]  police a shooter before massacre happened but nothing was done 45 minutes
[07:52.120 --> 07:56.520]  before not six minutes see notice it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger now
[07:56.520 --> 08:03.800]  the entire story is not true we were the first to tell you all of it he wanted
[08:03.800 --> 08:08.760]  the Middle East his girlfriend did he had millions of dollars he got shot he
[08:08.760 --> 08:16.040]  didn't commit suicide there were multiple shooters on and on and on and on it's
[08:16.040 --> 08:22.320]  all coming out oh look CBS news worker warned hotel before Las Vegas shooter
[08:22.320 --> 08:26.920]  opened fire on crowd associated press as well here's info wars from a day
[08:26.920 --> 08:31.440]  before Mandalay Bay owner what's being expressed by police may not be accurate
[08:31.440 --> 08:34.600]  that's a nice way of telling you that the sheriff's department's been told a
[08:34.600 --> 08:38.880]  lie since the FBI took over they stopped saying we think he was radicalized and
[08:38.880 --> 08:42.400]  had to have help they now have been saying the opposite now that the FBI's
[08:42.400 --> 08:48.680]  in charge oh and Newsweek's walked it back to saying yeah maybe ISIS is
[08:48.680 --> 08:53.320]  involved we've got that report that's all coming up that's just that's just one
[08:53.320 --> 08:57.920]  of the stacks that's only part of it but it's a big deal and boy they're just
[08:57.920 --> 09:01.120]  hoping everybody forgets about it right now oh we're not hearing from Keith
[09:01.120 --> 09:04.840]  Overman and Hillary and everybody's saying gun owners are to blame and
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.080]  conservatives are blame and Christians are to blame and white people are to
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.640]  blame and aren't you all guilty aren't you all bad let's let's ban those bump
[09:12.640 --> 09:18.120]  stocks right now because they've already banned belt-fed machine guns back in the
[09:18.120 --> 09:24.920]  30s and that's what was getting used not bump stocks so they're all kind of
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.560]  wanting you to forget about it now because we blew their official story
[09:29.560 --> 09:35.680]  wide open and we created a united front to make it okay for the real witnesses
[09:35.680 --> 09:41.040]  to come forward and now CNN and CBS are having the victims on the people that
[09:41.040 --> 09:44.080]  saw the multiple shooters and they're changing the subject wow they've changed
[09:44.080 --> 09:47.760]  the timeline showing their response time wasn't good we started 45 minutes
[09:47.760 --> 09:53.600]  before just changing the subject not to wow why'd they lie about it all what
[09:53.600 --> 09:58.800]  really happened it just becomes they covered up for response time no they
[09:58.800 --> 10:02.320]  had shooters all over the city and took a bunch of them out that were probably
[10:02.320 --> 10:11.000]  diversions for the main attack that came unice's attack and we've got coming up
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  as well the most ridiculous M&M video I saw this two days ago and it was so
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.240]  contrived so cringe worthy so fake so middle schoolers trying to act like
[10:23.240 --> 10:29.000]  hip-hop people so fake by a guy with hundreds of millions of dollars but
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.160]  he's authentic he's got a couple black guys standing behind him and some old
[10:33.160 --> 10:39.080]  cars the guy flies around in helicopters and his brand new Ferraris it's such
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.000]  bad hip-hop that I didn't ever attack it but Millie Weaver did and it's got
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.720]  millions of views on Facebook and YouTube since last night our reporter her
[10:49.720 --> 10:53.880]  and her teammate Gavin Winston a great job that's coming up M&M is a complete
[10:53.880 --> 11:01.960]  idiot is the name of the video and Paul Joseph Watson has another big report M&M
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.000]  is a complete idiot so both those who coming up because it's even more
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.040]  hilarious with the unintentional comedy with Keith Oberman the failed TV host
[11:13.040 --> 11:17.400]  coming out saying this is the best political statement ever this is the
[11:17.400 --> 11:23.760]  best music ever produced this is so incredibly wonderful
[11:25.720 --> 11:33.520]  it is just the greatest unintentional comedy that you will ever see in your
[11:33.520 --> 11:42.360]  life I mean M&M is so pathetic and he is emblematic of the entire fake Hollywood
[11:42.360 --> 11:49.920]  rock star hip-hop red carpet system that everyone is so sick of and his records
[11:49.920 --> 11:57.000]  are tanking everything he's doing is just absolutely falling apart it is
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.640]  nothing but a huge delicious joke on them and it gets even better then coming
[12:03.640 --> 12:10.840]  up we have the NFL stars coming out saying we're going to still go to a knee
[12:10.840 --> 12:13.880]  and we're going to rebel and we're going to stand up because we don't like
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.120]  America and you know what that's great because that will extinct your pathetic
[12:18.120 --> 12:24.720]  disgusting league even faster let's now become an anti-American weapon by the
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.360]  globalist to destroy this country so just just squeeze even tighter trying to
[12:29.360 --> 12:35.280]  force us into submission and we're going to be exposing all of that in a big
[12:35.280 --> 12:42.840]  big big way also ring of fire volcanoes remind Asia of seismic peril as even the
[12:42.840 --> 12:48.920]  USGS says that the super volcano of Yellowstone may go off sooner rather
[12:48.920 --> 12:54.360]  than later sooner than they thought then the big news is coming up
[12:54.360 --> 13:02.520]  World War three Korea claims Trump has lit the wick of war threatens hail of
[13:02.520 --> 13:09.920]  fire Trump responds by coming out and pointing out on Hannity that his fire
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.600]  and fury comment and of course obviously his call for the storm comment does
[13:14.600 --> 13:20.400]  reflect North Korea as US bombers fly over Korean Peninsula in latest show of
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.920]  force and as a US helicopter apparently may have been shot down on the DMZ just
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.200]  yesterday so that's coming up meanwhile conservative leaders urge Mitch
[13:31.200 --> 13:37.280]  McConnell to resign because he's a neocon flathrag and we have new study
[13:37.280 --> 13:42.320]  finds Democrats moving left driving growing partisan gap yes they're getting
[13:42.320 --> 13:46.880]  more radical more pathetic no they're just less disciplined telling us what
[13:46.880 --> 13:54.280]  America haters they always were and then yesterday Anderson Cooper told one of
[13:54.280 --> 14:00.520]  the biggest whoppers of a career filled with mega whoppers and faking locations
[14:00.520 --> 14:06.480]  with blue screens and green screens with chroma keys he said I am a liar and
[14:06.480 --> 14:13.160]  congressman is a liar and vice magazine has this bizarre reporter that looks
[14:13.160 --> 14:17.320]  like she's been given a lobotomy I mean I'm not being mean it's just it's its
[14:17.320 --> 14:24.520]  next level the weird freak show stuff left into those weren't way beyond you
[14:24.520 --> 14:32.320]  know midgets and all the rest of it but now they're claiming ladies and gentlemen
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.000]  that we made up that Soros was ever connected to the Nazis now that now they
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.520]  also say we made up that Hitler was associated with them or Herman Göring or
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.760]  Heinrich Himmler or Zeb Dietrich our and Strom or Arnold Schwarzenegger's
[14:47.760 --> 14:55.880]  daddy but this is next level CNN claims Alex Jones fabricated Soros ties so
[14:55.880 --> 15:01.720]  there's a 12 13 minute interviews like 12 and a half minute long full 60 minutes
[15:01.720 --> 15:06.080]  interview and Soros is fought to the nail to have it removed they always claim
[15:06.080 --> 15:10.360]  copyright no it's fair use you guys are saying it doesn't exist every time we
[15:10.360 --> 15:15.640]  try to put it up they try to take it down I'm Aaron the whole thing and I'm an

[15:24.880 --> 15:28.760]  to destroy the country trying to start a race war and then he wants to have his
[15:28.760 --> 15:33.320]  spokespeople say I'm a liar on CNN when we've got him smiling and saying he's
[15:33.320 --> 15:38.640]  proud of working for the Nazis and that if he didn't do it quote somebody else
[15:38.640 --> 15:45.200]  would have you guys got a lot of nerve you got a lot of nerve so you just get

[19:13.000 --> 19:18.200]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had
[19:18.200 --> 19:23.680]  drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[19:23.680 --> 19:28.640]  weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of

[21:26.000 --> 21:31.480]  waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation
[21:31.480 --> 21:40.480]  thank you for joining us this is the broadcast the enemy hates Hollywood the globals the pedophiles the elites the old call for our
[21:40.480 --> 21:45.720]  defeat the old call for our censorship they all come against this with their
[21:45.720 --> 21:50.800]  lawsuits and their lies and their fraud and their operas and their stalkers and
[21:50.800 --> 21:56.920]  their disinformation but the worse it gets better it gets it's the great
[21:56.920 --> 22:02.240]  animating contest of liberty and we're all right in the middle of it I'm honored
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.960]  to be here with you thank you so much for joining us I have two stacks of news
[22:06.960 --> 22:13.160]  that intersect together and I'm gonna hit right now Harvey Weinstein the big
[22:13.160 --> 22:18.240]  news Trump has dispatched the Justice Department to investigate him fleeing the
[22:18.240 --> 22:25.480]  country he has fled the country for a sex addiction facility until they've got
[22:25.480 --> 22:28.920]  some nice brothels in Europe they're actually called those it's a sick joke
[22:28.920 --> 22:34.680]  but they find out how to properly satisfy you that's your real problem we're
[22:34.680 --> 22:40.040]  gonna get to the bottom of what you need and so he's now fled to Europe just like
[22:40.040 --> 22:44.240]  Roman Polanski did who he was buddies with and of course Meryl Streep who he
[22:44.240 --> 22:50.880]  thinks is God because she's such a nobody talent was twit yes she has said
[22:50.880 --> 22:54.200]  he's God and she says that Roman Polanski should be let out a president in
[22:54.200 --> 22:59.880]  Europe after getting away with what he did for decades and that Harvey Weinstein
[22:59.880 --> 23:03.440]  is a great guy well she's been forced to now say he's a bad guy because Hollywood
[23:03.440 --> 23:11.000]  doesn't have the spell over America and over the world anymore and so we've got
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.680]  all that happening and we've got women that he's not denying that he's sexually
[23:15.680 --> 23:23.400]  abused rape you name it coming out on Twitter they're being blocked by Twitter
[23:23.400 --> 23:29.600]  famous movie stars see Twitter works for the big corporate chiefs and they want
[23:29.600 --> 23:33.080]  to make sure that if one of these rape victims or somebody else tries to speak
[23:33.080 --> 23:37.360]  out they can't they want a virtue signal all day about oh we love women oh we
[23:37.360 --> 23:42.560]  love children let us be the guardians of culture will protect your women and
[23:42.560 --> 23:49.920]  children oh yes we'll do well meanwhile during Weinstein's years Disney hired
[23:49.920 --> 23:54.120]  child molester who've been convicted of brutally raping a 12-year-old boy and
[23:54.120 --> 23:58.800]  was known to be a savage pedophile they hired him to direct movies with
[23:58.800 --> 24:06.840]  children in them get Daniels wrote a story about that isn't that liberal Ben
[24:06.840 --> 24:12.840]  Affleck asked TV host exposure breast mox disabled in resurface video he did it
[24:12.840 --> 24:20.760]  on tell live television isn't that just sweet and liberal and it goes on and on
[24:20.760 --> 24:26.320]  now it's hurting the Batman star and hurting the image that Batman Batman
[24:26.320 --> 24:36.280]  might just be a child prodigy pervert let's leave it that but continuing
[24:36.280 --> 24:44.560]  ladies and gentlemen they're trying to shut this down as fast as they can and
[24:44.560 --> 24:54.240]  here's some examples of what the huge Hollywood pervert combine is up to New
[24:54.240 --> 25:00.240]  York Times and YouTube collude spawn fake news bastard child in the latest
[25:00.240 --> 25:05.280]  project Veritas video part two of prom to America by the way James will keep
[25:05.280 --> 25:13.080]  joins us next hour live via video Skype he has them admitting that oh don't
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.200]  worry we force our videos to number one even if they're not popular YouTube
[25:17.200 --> 25:23.680]  suppresses conservatives and force feeds us to the public well we already do
[25:23.680 --> 25:29.320]  that but it's just good to understand how the force feeding works yeah we can
[25:29.320 --> 25:35.120]  have a video that has a million views as of this morning on one Facebook and that
[25:35.120 --> 25:39.480]  won't trend on Facebook even one stuff with a hundred thousand do and then
[25:39.480 --> 25:43.640]  we'll have videos with another million or so yesterday and that's not on
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.600]  trending and they've got videos with two hundred thousand trending because it's
[25:47.600 --> 25:52.560]  establishment it's force fed they tell you it's winning the race they tell you
[25:52.560 --> 25:56.240]  it's popular because you trust the wisdom of the crowd you trust the five
[25:56.240 --> 26:03.160]  stars when it's half a star this is how they operate this is how they do it so
[26:03.160 --> 26:06.080]  that's coming up we'll discuss that next hour with James O'Keefe New York Times
[26:06.080 --> 26:10.440]  and YouTube collude sparks fake news bastard child MSN a Silicon Valley
[26:10.440 --> 26:15.520]  teaming up to push globalist lies of course you heard it here first Mozilla
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.360]  gave a hundred thousand a secure email platform for anti-fuck to launch their
[26:19.360 --> 26:22.720]  criminal operations that's all the examples of big corporate money daily
[26:22.720 --> 26:28.120]  going to him again Twitter suspends Rose McGowan's account for criticizing
[26:28.120 --> 26:33.680]  Weinstein and saying that he sexually assaulted her because listen Twitter is
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.080]  here to protect rich billionaire sex assaulters but virtue signal that men
[26:38.080 --> 26:45.040]  wearing pants or dad being dad or just having dads exist is that so we've got
[26:45.040 --> 26:49.600]  that censorship Trump doubles down network licenses must be challenged like
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.960]  network licenses like CNN they call that dictator behavior but meanwhile they're
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.720]  the ones trying to shut us down saying we should be a national censor or a
[26:58.720 --> 27:03.480]  ministry of truth that controls us MSNBC is calling for this show to be shut
[27:03.480 --> 27:07.320]  down completely but when Trump says people calling for that that are un-
[27:07.320 --> 27:10.880]  American the one to destroy the country and destroy the markets and lie
[27:10.880 --> 27:14.480]  continually we should look at their licenses they're like oh my gosh see
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.360]  because they're total hypocrites scum former ESPN reporter says she was told
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.480]  not to like conservative leading tweets or she'd be fired Fox Business NFL
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.400]  players says there's gonna be an uproar players are forced to stand yeah

[27:34.000 --> 27:38.600]  year and if you add it all together they're down 55 points in the last four
[27:38.600 --> 27:42.560]  years so just what now they've got high school cheerleaders taking a knee in the

[32:47.480 --> 32:50.800]  system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more
[32:50.800 --> 32:55.280]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so
[32:55.280 --> 32:59.880]  revolutionary today infowarstore.com
[33:01.000 --> 33:06.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:08.800 --> 33:14.440]  my understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours yes yes
[33:14.440 --> 33:18.160]  went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the
[33:18.160 --> 33:27.440]  Jews that's right was it difficult not not not at all not at all maybe as a
[33:27.440 --> 33:33.520]  child you don't you don't see the connection it created no no problem at
[33:33.520 --> 33:39.200]  all no feeling of guilt no well actually funny way it's just like in markets
[33:39.200 --> 33:45.560]  that if I weren't there somebody else would would be taking it away anyhow
[33:45.560 --> 33:51.440]  and it was the whether I was there or not the property was being taken away so I
[33:51.440 --> 33:56.720]  had no sense of guilt defending the Republic from enemies foreign and
[33:56.720 --> 34:01.640]  domestic it's Alex Jones
[34:04.640 --> 34:09.480]  rarely do we compare somebody to Hitler rarely do we compare somebody to the
[34:09.480 --> 34:17.080]  devil but in the case of George Soros a listener sent us a sculpture in the
[34:17.080 --> 34:22.720]  mail two weeks ago very nice sculpture of George Soros as the devil so I've
[34:22.720 --> 34:25.920]  got it in my office think I'm gonna move it out of there though it's a little bit
[34:25.920 --> 34:37.040]  creepy because he went on a 13 minute segment in 1998 of 60 minutes and said
[34:37.040 --> 34:44.560]  that he was proud of being a Nazi collaborator essentially now starting
[34:44.560 --> 34:52.680]  about six seven years ago they would always ban the interview on YouTube we
[34:52.680 --> 34:56.640]  had copyright strikes but I challenged YouTube filed the paperwork and said I
[34:56.640 --> 35:01.440]  will sue in court over this so they withdrew the strike on our account but
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.320]  would not let us upload it they've got computer bots that can recognize it by
[35:06.320 --> 35:12.120]  keyword but also just by the video and not let us do it now we've learned how
[35:12.120 --> 35:16.520]  to get around them by slowing the audio down speeding it up putting other video
[35:16.520 --> 35:20.200]  over it and scrambling it that's the only way you're able to actually get the
[35:20.200 --> 35:25.280]  video and it's it's subtle when you're watching but we haven't edited it for
[35:25.280 --> 35:30.520]  content we've just edited it so that we can get around the bots that's what we
[35:30.520 --> 35:33.920]  do here remember back when we had the Google bomb per a year and a half and we
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.040]  can have the keyword every day they changed the whole algorithm to block
[35:38.040 --> 35:43.760]  that we weren't gaming the system we had enough listeners to go search a term and
[35:43.760 --> 35:47.720]  back then they weren't gaming it as much so you could actually have the top term
[35:47.720 --> 35:51.120]  if you know a million of our listeners would go and put in a keyword we could
[35:51.120 --> 35:57.920]  do it any time we wanted to boy that got their attention but what's amazing is
[35:57.920 --> 36:06.800]  that CNN would have the nerve to come out yesterday and say that I am a liar
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.640]  Rob do just brought in the sculpture please thank you didn't ask for it but
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.640]  it's perfect timing thank the listener that sent this to us it's Ellie Hasselman
[36:17.640 --> 36:30.440]  Eli Hasselman now that said imagine CNN when it's known for 19 years that George
[36:30.440 --> 36:37.960]  Soros from from from 14s when he started to 17 would fair it in because the Jews
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.800]  would trust him he was a young Jew just like child molesters use teenagers
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.600]  lure kids they think oh we can let him know our hidden place and they gave money
[36:47.600 --> 36:51.120]  and stuff he'd bring them food then he'd find out what they had he'd sell them
[36:51.120 --> 36:58.000]  out they'd get rounded up he was a Judas go Jew they would send in to find the
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.040]  hidden Jews to find folks like and Frank that's why he's a hero of liberal Jews
[37:04.040 --> 37:08.640]  and a hero of the ADL they give him the highest award and a hero of the left
[37:08.640 --> 37:12.840]  because he's the greatest living Nazi collaborator that we they're still
[37:12.840 --> 37:17.400]  around you know it doesn't make sense these are really twisted sick people the
[37:17.400 --> 37:22.800]  left folks they're really into evil they think it's cool and it's a better joke
[37:22.800 --> 37:26.800]  for them to know he's a Nazi and funds their main operations and has
[37:26.800 --> 37:29.920]  overthrown all these other countries and had nothing but an evil history after
[37:29.920 --> 37:35.920]  overthrowing Ukraine overthrowing many nations the Middle East with the
[37:35.920 --> 37:40.560]  Arab Spring putting the radical Muslims in that enslaved the women throw the
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.600]  gaze off buildings blow up the churches this is a very very sick ruthless guy
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.600]  but he's their bad guy hero that's why in the last James Bond movie it's based
[37:50.600 --> 37:55.200]  on him and the quantum group as the main group funding specter funding both
[37:55.200 --> 37:58.800]  sides of ever major war British intelligence help write the script they
[37:58.800 --> 38:02.080]  admit that's George Soros and the quantum group is the name of his main
[38:02.080 --> 38:08.080]  fund so he's a literal James Bond villain and Anderson Cooper of the
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.120]  Central Intelligence Agency that's admitted went on television and said
[38:12.120 --> 38:17.960]  that we made all this up and that we made it up but some of the leadership of
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.880]  the so-called new right turns out to actually work for the Democrats so here
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.280]  is a clip from Anderson Cooper going beyond any level of fake news ever seen
[38:28.280 --> 38:34.560]  before he is going where no man has dared to go before here it is as
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.400]  disgusting as both rallies were there is something else that caught our eye when
[38:38.400 --> 38:42.920]  it posted this past Friday it's the claim that the the August protest the one
[38:42.920 --> 38:47.200]  that killed Ms. Hire was some sort of left-wing plot now who he might ask
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.680]  would say something so offensive and disgusting is that some shock-jock
[38:50.680 --> 38:55.080]  radio personality maybe no an elected representative who's serving right now
[38:55.080 --> 38:59.960]  in the U.S. Congress here he is two-term Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar now
[38:59.960 --> 39:02.840]  he's exact here's exactly what the congressman said to Vice News
[39:02.840 --> 39:07.920]  correspondent L.A. Reeve let's look at the person that actually started the
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.240]  rally it's come to our attention that this is a person from Occupy Wall Street
[39:12.240 --> 39:16.280]  that was an Obama sympathizer so wait a minute be careful over which area you
[39:16.280 --> 39:20.480]  start taking these people to and look at the background George Soros is one of
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.880]  those people that actually helps you know back these individuals who is he
[39:24.880 --> 39:29.160]  I think he's from Hungary I think he was Jewish and I think he turned in his own
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.920]  people to the Nazis we bear with care careful over where we go with those do
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.640]  you think George Soros funded the neo-nazis who marched in Charleston wouldn't it be
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.240]  interesting to find out again that was Republican Arizona
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.280]  Congressman Paul Gosar this man keeping him honest does he have proof no
[39:48.280 --> 39:51.800]  nothing in other words it's a false flag he's spreading and insulting and
[39:51.800 --> 39:58.040]  disgusting conspiracy theory when it was swiftly Cooper it turns out all three
[39:58.040 --> 40:05.800]  leaders you've had two of them on of the Charlottesville unite the right rally
[40:05.800 --> 40:14.520]  we're Democrats just a year ago and have all this financing so you're saying
[40:14.520 --> 40:20.360]  it's a disgusting line no it's not it's a fact but you don't even show any proof
[40:20.360 --> 40:24.800]  we're lying you just say we're lying but now he tells the whopper that I made up
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.840]  that Soros was a Nazi collaborator here it is by many we asked Congressman Gosar
[40:29.840 --> 40:32.560]  to come on the program tonight his office declined we told them it's an open
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.760]  invitation we got no reply these conspiracy theories were first spread by
[40:36.760 --> 40:41.240]  radio talk show host Alex Jones the rally in August was organized by Jason
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.680]  Kessler who said he voted for President Obama and attended one occupy event but
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.760]  he also says he became disenchanted with the Obama administration and in addition
[40:49.760 --> 40:52.400]  to organizing that hatefield Charlottesville rally has according to
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.000]  vice news spent time on YouTube rallying against what he called white
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.480]  genocide is certainly a charmer as for a billionaire investor George Soros who
[41:00.480 --> 41:04.160]  does back liberal causes a spokeswoman for his foundation issued a statement
[41:04.160 --> 41:08.240]  device news that reads in part quote George Soros survived the Nazi occupation
[41:08.240 --> 41:11.240]  of Hungary and he has spent his life supporting efforts to ensure that such
[41:11.240 --> 41:15.640]  terrifying authoritarianism never takes root again he was 14 years old when the
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.320]  war ended he did not collaborate with the Nazis he did not help round up people
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.600]  he did not confiscate anybody's property joining me now is Ellie Reeve she's the
[41:23.600 --> 41:26.960]  vice news reporter who did that interview with Congressman Gosar and who was
[41:26.960 --> 41:32.640]  also at the original rally Charlottesville did such amazing right that's good so
[41:32.640 --> 41:36.520]  there you go ladies and gentlemen that's the type of garbage they engage in they
[41:36.520 --> 41:40.560]  go on to blame me and the rest of it so here's the headline CNN claims Alex Jones
[41:40.560 --> 41:48.800]  fabricated Soros Nazi ties but then we have the whole 12 and a half minute
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.440]  interview from 60 minutes posted in the article where he goes into how he helped
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.200]  round the people up and I just played the clip earlier later in the
[41:57.200 --> 42:01.960]  transmission today I'm gonna air the entire 60 minutes piece for you so you
[42:01.960 --> 42:07.280]  can see it unedited for yourself but then we upload it to YouTube or Facebook I
[42:07.280 --> 42:11.480]  don't really think we're gonna scramble it to get around the box I think this is
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.280]  where I should follow suit if they want to say I'm a liar and he didn't do this
[42:15.280 --> 42:18.720]  interview and it's clearly fair he used to have a right to expose what this
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.200]  public figure did and they try to claim that I don't have a right to show you
[42:22.200 --> 42:26.400]  what he said but then say I'm a liar then I think under the first amendment
[42:26.400 --> 42:30.680]  we've got a lawsuit we're gonna win and I don't want to sue people but man
[42:30.680 --> 42:35.880]  they're censoring us more and more so they can build a straw man and say
[42:35.880 --> 42:40.840]  things we never said and then not let us show you what we really said and I'm
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.000]  getting tired of it but again it's not about info wars it's about truth tellers
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.600]  and if you're a truth tellers these people come after you and they want to
[42:50.600 --> 42:54.360]  shut you up because they're a pack of liars shame on Anderson Cooper and all
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.560]  these people for being collaborators with a real Nazi wow James Madison the
[42:59.560 --> 43:03.840]  father of the Bill of Rights wrote we're an excess of power prevails property of
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.640]  no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.320]  faculties or in his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.320]  power in Washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we
[43:17.320 --> 43:22.360]  remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual that
[43:22.360 --> 43:26.080]  is the ultimate concern the concentration of power the excess of
[43:26.080 --> 43:30.680]  power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country it was why
[43:30.680 --> 43:33.560]  the anti-fiddle is to pose the Constitution they believe they put
[43:33.560 --> 43:37.520]  safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power but as James
[43:37.520 --> 43:42.160]  Madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who
[43:42.160 --> 43:46.360]  mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge
[43:46.360 --> 43:50.080]  gives arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing of what
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.400]  the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to

[50:28.200 --> 50:35.320]  days are numbered it's all happening you are so sick and and it's the rediscovering
[50:35.320 --> 50:39.880]  of America Alexander de Tocqueville the French historian wrote shortly after
[50:39.880 --> 50:45.280]  Revolutionary War he traveled through the Americas and he just talked he
[50:45.280 --> 50:49.400]  traveled all over the known world and he said Americans hate establishment they
[50:49.400 --> 50:54.000]  hate elitism they hate posers they hate people that were given what they had they
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  love individualism whether you be some rich guy that did what you did or you be
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.480]  some poor guy that can fight hard or somebody that can invent something and
[51:01.480 --> 51:05.680]  they wanted people that were honorable and did what they said that was America
[51:05.680 --> 51:09.400]  not that we were perfect but we were about over cloning overthrowing the real
[51:09.400 --> 51:16.280]  class structure for freedom communism's the opposite and that's why they hate
[51:16.280 --> 51:21.000]  this country so much is because we are the sexiest thing we are the Renaissance
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.760]  we are freedom we are why all these people can come here and have such a
[51:24.760 --> 51:28.360]  creative thing that thousands of football players can be paid five ten
[51:28.360 --> 51:33.320]  million dollars a year and bitch about it but I have the right to walk and no
[51:33.320 --> 51:38.120]  longer watch you and you'll see who the boss is we the people the average folks
[51:38.120 --> 51:42.560]  of every color and every creed that are of one race with red blood the human
[51:42.560 --> 51:46.760]  race and America isn't perfect but we recognize an offshore globalist attempt
[51:46.760 --> 51:50.520]  to turn us against each other and make us hate our country so we can be conquered
[51:50.520 --> 51:55.200]  and we recognize mercenaries trying to pimp us out like that little bitch
[51:55.200 --> 51:59.960]  Eminem and his little wannabe thug pansies behind him who aren't real men
[51:59.960 --> 52:05.800]  who wouldn't take on the globalists like Donald Trump or anybody else and I
[52:05.800 --> 52:08.840]  know all the anti-military stuff blew up their face so they say this pro-America

[55:09.000 --> 55:14.480]  your stingy as I am yeah you may be stingy Eminem but Trump gave over a
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.360]  million dollars of his own money to the victims of Hurricane Harvey put up or
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.120]  shut up it's like we take a step forwards than backwards but this is his
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.720]  form of distraction I went to this late I'm gonna come back to the next segment
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.920]  I'm gonna play it without my commentary but but let me just add this right now
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.120]  Trump with the basic policies of cutting regulations and bringing back cheap
[55:38.120 --> 55:41.880]  electricity we've seen four trillion the stock market four hundred plus billion
[55:41.880 --> 55:45.920]  in new jobs one point six million new jobs three point one percent growth rate
[55:45.920 --> 55:51.040]  they never said we see again in America says we were over 69% reduction
[55:51.040 --> 55:54.320]  illegals coming across the border thousands of new factories moving back
[55:54.320 --> 56:00.800]  to the United States the highest numbers in new factories and and wage
[56:00.800 --> 56:06.280]  increases in modern history just everything and that's what them trying
[56:06.280 --> 56:10.720]  to raise interest rates to block it so you're saying Trump stingy when his
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.520]  hotels and his golf courses for the first time are hurting and they're coming
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.360]  after him and his whole family and he's given up hundreds of millions of
[56:18.360 --> 56:21.400]  dollars of his own money and got his pageants canceled and everything and
[56:21.400 --> 56:25.160]  then you sit there and say he's stingy like you because I know in fake thug
[56:25.160 --> 56:29.720]  culture it's cool to be hard and be stingy and not take care of people around
[56:29.720 --> 56:36.520]  you I understand that so again to watch another fake gangster thug pose as if
[56:36.520 --> 56:40.680]  he's political read off a teleprompter and do a terrible job and then watch a

[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.920]  million dollars of his own money to the victims of Hurricane Harvey put up or
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.120]  shut up it's like we take a step forwards than backwards but this is his form of
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.440]  distraction plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL they're
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.240]  kneeling for our flag you imagine how pathetic Eminem is while they're
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.320]  benefiting from the lifestyles that these fallen soldiers never had so we
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.200]  focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico actually Puerto Rico got caught
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.520]  withholding so that idiots like you could go out and scold him and says he
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.520]  wants to lower our taxes then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips back
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.400]  and forth with his family was golf resort to this man he slandered yeah
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.600]  Trump called out the Clinton Foundation from stealing money from the Haiti
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.680]  nation but you don't want to talk about that in your little wrap then does it
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.120]  more from his endorsement of banning support for the Klansman the only KK
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:43.440]  Klansman is Hillary Clinton kissing all up on Senator Bird she needs to get her
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.240]  mouth cleaned forking a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa who keeps
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.560]  ignoring our past historical deplorable factors I'm sorry Eminem you want to talk
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:01.200]  about racism and bigotry and all this holier-than-thou virtue signalling
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:06.520]  crap coming from the guy who talks about murdering raping and killing women
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:15.720]  regularly in music videos shut up this is for calling ball up a fist and keep
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:23.040]  that ball calling compatriots talking all this trash he's gonna get rid of
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:32.280]  all immigrants I don't feel no ways tired he's gonna build that thing up

[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:45.400]  southerners he's a bigot mine who's a supporter of his I'm drawing in the sand
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:51.240]  a line we see it so either for against newsflash Eminem there's already been a
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.840]  line drawn in the sand and you know what you're standing on the side with all
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:01.000]  the globalist and rich celebrity elitist and if you can't decide who you
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.920]  like more in your split on who you should stand beside I'll do it for you

[01:05:51.760 --> 01:06:10.440]  store.com to learn more at infowarstore.com
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:25.160]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:31.960]  for the next 30 minutes he's with us the model of a true on-the-ground but also
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.920]  in the research investigative journalist James O'Keeffe the guy with this team
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:42.440]  that brought down the organized crime syndicate Acorn the undoubtedly helped
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.400]  defeat Hillary in 2016 joins us and I think it's just better if he leads us
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.320]  through this because part one was powerful but that's what got all the
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.560]  news yesterday on Drudge and hundreds of newspapers and we're gonna play part
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.400]  one he's gonna walk through but part two is really powerful in a cashless world
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.800]  we're also gonna get into some of those reports that coming up his view on what's
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:09.040]  happened in Puerto Rico and other areas but we've got a big report out here how
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:15.160]  the New York Times and YouTube collusion spawns fake news bastard child with his
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:19.560]  undercover journalist there with these New York Times high-level operatives
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.400]  bragging oh it doesn't matter if folks don't want to see our stuff we just force
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.160]  feed it and then block all their stuff that's why we can have videos every day
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:33.160]  they get a million views in one day and then I go to the most viewed there'll be
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.720]  something with 200,000 views in the in the trending or most viewed and I'm
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.320]  like it's three days all this because their force feeding it during the
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.280]  campaign see a Hillary speech with 10,000 views they'd say trending but then
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.480]  you'd see some other video with 10 million views in two days wouldn't be
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.280]  there so that's part two of what James O'Keefe has discovered to show the covert
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:00.480]  massive discrimination and censorship that's going on plus all the admissions
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.240]  that are now happening Twitter is censoring women who Weinstein has
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.120]  apologized to but who are saying he raped so now women movie stars if they
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.560]  criticize Hollywood are being blocked James O'Keefe I tell you I see this is a
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.720]  major sign of desperation aren't they jump in the shark here with the
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:22.400]  Streisand effect well yeah I think so Alex the YouTube platform says quote we
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.960]  believe everyone should have a chance to be discovered that we to build a
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.640]  business and succeed on their own terms and that people not gatekeepers decide
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.120]  what's popular but according to this New York Times editor we caught on tape as
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.360]  well as his buddies at YouTube we actually have an employee at YouTube on
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.000]  hidden camera admitting this the first time any journalist anywhere has taken
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.960]  hidden cameras inside the Silicon Valley bigwigs this YouTube guy says that they
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.200]  determine what's legitimate and illegitimate news and they specifically
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.760]  call out you Alex they say that at the very least in our news carousel the top
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.880]  of YouTube that they can determine which news partners are legitimate and he says
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.360]  if at that point quote somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.520]  find Alex Jones well they were looking for him to begin with anyway
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.840]  unquote which direction directly violates YouTube's mission statement now we
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.640]  finally have proved that there's a sort of conspiracy a sort of collusion
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.760]  between these mainstream media players and the Silicon Valley giants against
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.760]  the interests of truth against the interests of the so-called non-human
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.560]  intervention algorithms and obviously it's just the tip of the iceberg so
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.360]  you've got New York Times CNN YouTube I know you've got a lot more coming and
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.600]  as you said on the show you told me we're coming two years ago you said
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:43.520]  we're working with former CIA on classic legal tactics to infiltrate them aka a
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.520]  good-looking women here I guess in some cases good-looking guys but all I got to
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.440]  say is buddy you've reached a new milestone not even government agencies
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.840]  have done as good a job as the team you've assembled so I know you don't
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:00.080]  want credit yourself but listeners need to understand thank you so much for what
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.880]  you've done for freedom not just America and thank you for what you've done for my
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:09.480]  four children James O'Keeffe well thank you Alex I appreciate that I do think it's
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.080]  just the tip of the iceberg I think we got we have more videos coming but we're
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:17.560]  gonna roll them out slowly this is a New York Times editor who's responsible for
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.800]  all their videos they would to call the audience strategy editor at the New York
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.920]  Times it wasn't just beautiful women we had men who had built relationships when
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.760]  I say that I mean just building confidence with the people inside
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.240]  YouTube and over a series of meetings they talk about the relationships on the
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.960]  platform they talk about the gatekeepers and then they can arbitrarily
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.960]  determine what news people see and and and there have been some reporting about
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:49.680]  this news carousel on YouTube but no one knew that there was a human component
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.720]  there was a sort of arbitrary human component blocking it out it's funny
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.640]  that they call you out by name this Ernie Petty guy at YouTube his name is Ernie
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.640]  and he says and he's wearing a black lives matter sweatshirt with Google on
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.280]  the sleeve and he specifically says this is one of the meetings you're seeing
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.880]  right here but there's another meeting where he's wearing something else he
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.720]  specifically says he tries to help lack lives matters why why that there's
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:17.640]  someone at YouTube trying to promote one agenda but not some other news source
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.840]  is beyond me and I and I hope that when the New York Times has responded Alex
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.480]  this is the managing editor of the New York Times said this reporter quote
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.360]  violated their ethical guidelines we don't know whether that means they're
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.920]  gonna fire this New York Times editor or they're gonna promote him but the
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.520]  main argument that everyone always says is that the New York Times does not have
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.080]  a political agenda that's what they say the difference between people like us
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:47.640]  and them is when the truth is they that their agenda far exceeds the agenda of
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:52.120]  the citizen journalist well look when I get in my gym in my garage and turn on
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.640]  YouTube it's all leftist globalist crap and then your stuff my stuff it's
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.200]  nowhere there even though I'm actually watching that used to just a few years
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.840]  ago it would put that in my top feed knowing I wanted it it now blocks that
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.680]  when I turn on my iPhone I get fed Huffington Post CNN used to maybe a
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.520]  little Fox News no zero no Breitbart no info wars no project very toss no
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.680]  drugs reports so it's everywhere they're forced feeding their garbage since you
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.400]  mentioned this YouTube individual tell us a little bit about him we're gonna play
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.920]  this clip so this guy's name is Ernie Petty he works at YouTube he's responsible
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:35.040]  for I guess the brand and strategy he works with partners inside mainstream
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.480]  media companies this is another thing that no one I guess is reported on that
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.480]  they're there Huffington Post New York Times are specifically mentioned by by
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.800]  Petty as mainstream partners that he collaborates with to make their content
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.160]  the ones that show up as legitimate news and to hurt people like you he
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:58.200]  specifically he talks about you and he says that in some cases we can make
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.520]  browsers have to manually go to this other news even if it's very successful
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.120]  he also talks about changing the algorithms he says that there has to be
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.120]  some human intervention to make up for it to compensate for things that they
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.680]  don't they think should be trending but are not notice what we're missing here
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.880]  the total arrogance that politically globally freedom is exploding sensors are
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.960]  in trouble the NFL Hollywood they're all imploding the censorship isn't working
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.720]  here is the YouTube New York Times interface here he is laying out how
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:36.640]  they run the Ministry of Truth aka Winston Smith 1984 for real 2017
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:14:03.520]  Allah James O'Keefe and project veritas that's what that news carousel kind of does so like it's above the search results so that's a very least we can say that like this shelter videos is legitimate news because we know that these are legitimate news organizations and at that point somebody decides
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.160]  the way to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones well they were looking for him
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.560]  let's be about that algorithms control YouTube but according to Petty his team
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:18.880]  has the power to shape those algorithms for Nick Dudek and the New York Times this
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:26.160]  connection is invaluable because probably like one of the
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:35.400]  people I think who has more knowledge about YouTube as a platform and power to play from what
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:40.840]  we've heard Dudek has more than just knowledge of YouTube he has access we
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:46.360]  wondered what exactly does a friendship with Petty by the New York Times there
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.800]  are things that exist in the product that like they're like are definitely
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:59.120]  optimized for news like we have a news channel page that features stop right
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.080]  everyone to break them back with James O'Keefe but more talk with James O'Keefe
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.360]  about this project veritas fame on the other side but here's the key for me
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.000]  under classic racketeering laws of the Civil Rights Act if you have a
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.280]  Christians have to bake a cake for gay folks which I do anyways my free market
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.120]  guy then they're telling us as libertarians or conservatives they put a
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:22.040]  prior constraint on us to where we get discriminated against and can't use the
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.600]  bathroom or go to the soup kitchen or set at the back of the bus in fact we
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.440]  can't even get on the YouTube bus is what he's saying we're going to talk
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.680]  about this massive form of discrimination straight ahead and the
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.600]  groundbreaking information with project veritas.com everybody go to project
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.360]  veritas.com and should donate because I know they had more money they could do
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.520]  more just like we could do but you need to go to them and support them today
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.440]  this is incredible stay with us ladies and gentlemen the truth is striking
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.640]  back
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.120]  we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.960]  own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.760]  gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body that's why I'm
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.880]  introducing z-shield toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in

[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.920]  some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul the most basic principle to being a free
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.320]  American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:13.000]  own lives and decisions we do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.480]  up for our own mistakes neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.920]  to live so long as we aren't infringing on their rights freedom to make bad
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.560]  decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones if we are only free to
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.920]  make good decisions then we are not really free liberty is lost through
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.160]  complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.240]  automobile checkpoints random searches mandatory identification cards and

[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:49.840]  I want listeners to understand something in the nine minutes we have left
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.200]  with James O'Keefe project very tough we have the individual from the New York
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.640]  Times Liaisoning with the YouTube executives bragging how they censor
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:05.240]  conservative pro-america pro-military pro-common sense pro-christian stuff
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.560]  that exposes radical Islam that's all being censored the exposed black lives
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.280]  matter people saying kill cops that gets blocked I mean this is the radicals
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:18.240]  they've hired to run this and then Mozilla just today gave a hundred thousand
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.240]  to Antifa and let them have access to their main servers and their systems to
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:28.760]  set up this big rebellion group to start basically a civil war November 4th you
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:33.960]  cannot make this up so Google last time I checked just gave 10 million this year
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:39.720]  to black lives matter alone these are their brown shirt foot soldiers to not
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:44.680]  just beat us up on the street but to also control things in cyberspace which is
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:49.520]  illegal it's racketeering it's discriminatory it violates so many laws to
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.960]  have them and we know they're doing it but to then get them on tape because I've
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.120]  been looking at suing them because I have to because they're blocking us
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:00.240]  everywhere and so we if that's all we have fighting back it's non-physical so
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.400]  it's one of the few things left to us having a video like this is invaluable
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:09.760]  that's why I said I think I'm gonna give a donation if I am I'm giving $20,000
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:13.080]  a project for her toss today get the accountant over here I want to sign the
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.360]  check he'll be gone but I want to sign it on-air because everybody needs to do
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.480]  this we're in this together folks James O'Keefe I'm not kidding this is so
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.760]  valuable what you're doing just to freedom these people are so authoritarian
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.960]  they're so arrogant that they think they're gonna beat us I think we're
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.560]  gonna win so this eight minutes we have left or seven minutes finish up the
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.440]  key points folks need to know because there's hours of these videos you have
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.360]  thank you Alex and I really appreciate that it means a lot that that will hire
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.280]  another undercover journalist for a long time to help I let me just go over what
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:46.240]  we've exposed here so that your audience knows what's happening this is an a guy
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.520]  at YouTube who's quote brand and diversity curation at YouTube this is
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.720]  self-described his name is Ernie Petty he quote works on the team that provides
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.320]  human inputs into a lot of the machinery at YouTube this is what he says the so
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.480]  called news carousel these are the trending videos about news Alex you're a
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:07.360]  news provider this isn't people this isn't real voting basically it's a fake
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.640]  election your vote doesn't matter now this guy sits there in the sides right
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.360]  he's he's one of the few people at YouTube that actually is part of this
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:21.480]  sort of so-called human human inputs he calls it where he adjusts that the the
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.360]  way the videos are seen and by the way YouTube is one of the last places that
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:29.640]  people like me can actually go publish our information it's owned by Google this
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:33.080]  guy Ernie is sitting at the at the table wearing a black lives matter sweater
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.080]  with Google emblazoned on the sleeve and he's talking about the relationships he
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.680]  has with people at Huffington Post New York Times and Black Lives Matter and
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.880]  how he gives preferential treatment to these news companies as opposed to
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:47.480]  citizen journalists like you and I this New York Times reporter he's referring to
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.960]  his name is Nick Dutic he's the subject of the first video that we did there's
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:54.520]  the sweater sweater that says black lives matter on it with Google on the
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:58.320]  sleeve and and he's talking about this relationship with Nick Dutic in the
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.440]  first video we released this is an unbelievable video the New York Times
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:07.440]  reporter says that he is targeting Trump's businesses he's trying to boycott
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.560]  Trump's businesses he brings information to the front of the New York Times's
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:17.160]  pages that are more negative when it comes to classic racketeering classic
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.960]  stalking right and well the New York Times is publicly the videos are so
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:26.160]  serious that the managing editor of the deputy managing at our gun in Clifford
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:31.360]  Levy who works in the New York Times said quote the the employee violated our
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.840]  ethical standards and quote we are reviewing the situation now that this
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.520]  video is so big that the New York Times is condemning the activities of the
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.440]  employee we're wondering whether that means they're going to give him a
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.000]  promotion or whether they're gonna fire him we can tell you that there's more
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.440]  videos coming and and and the New York Times has an ethical policy that says
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:54.000]  you can't do anything to compromise your neutrality so of course the New York
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.040]  Times does have a political agenda that doesn't surprise you it doesn't
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.200]  surprise the people watching this program but you've got a video but you
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.400]  got a video is one thing out yeah absolutely keep going so so what I
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.920]  need you guys to do it I do have an action item this Clifford Levy guy is
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.560]  his Twitter is Clifford Levy that's Clifford Levy why and he has already
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.880]  responded but we don't know the status of this employee at the New York Times
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.640]  his editor is we don't know whether he's been suspended whether he's been
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:26.040]  fired we need you to tweet at Clifford Levy and ask him there there's the
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.960]  there's the comment we need to ask him what is the status of these people
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:36.800]  working with YouTube employees to to ban people they don't like to ban ideas
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.760]  they don't like that's obviously not that's a violation and then to terrorize
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.320]  Trump's businesses and brag about it right and brag about doing so and also
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:50.040]  what is the status of this YouTube employee who's on tape Alex he's
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:54.240]  specifically calling you out he says that we determine what's legitimate and
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.960]  what's illegitimate and that's dangerous that know that that's not YouTube's job
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.360]  to determine let me ask you this don't they get the Streisand effect like like
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.920]  they've been caught at the White House when it was Obama and people talking
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.280]  about you and shutting you down that shot you up there even more or trying to
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.520]  shut me down don't they get that yes we're getting hit by the censorship but
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.920]  we're still growing despite it because people go wow this must be really
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.680]  important yeah I mean they I don't think they understand that I don't think they
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.200]  they they realize they're not gonna change their behavior because it's the
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:28.000]  virtuous thing to do they're not gonna stop doing this immoral this is don't
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  take my word for it he says the violation of their own ethics the managing
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.840]  editor of the New York Times has responded to us he said that they are
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.160]  violating their ethical policies but they're not gonna clean up their act
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.440]  because they're doing wrong things they're only gonna clean up their act if
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.440]  we light it if we shine a light on the cockroaches and this is just the tip of
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.720]  the iceberg Alex we want them to say it's an isolated incident they said it
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.120]  was just a junior position doing this we hope that they say these things because
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:58.120]  Alex what's coming next is a much higher level editor who's also admitting to a
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.840]  political agenda and it's a very systemic thing the difference between us
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:07.080]  and them they say is that we have a political agenda and they don't but we
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.520]  are exposing that lie for what it is well I mean we got documents months ago
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.720]  that Google admitted were real where they hired a company for over a million
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.520]  dollars to go around with real people voting us down so they do it in the
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.320]  algorithm they hired outside PR companies have thousands of people go vote us
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:29.120]  down I mean this is just insane it's over the top yeah I mean it's insane but
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.080]  that's the power of every time I go on your show I say this is we confirm
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.800]  suspicions at Veritas it's not a shock to you but to get the employee at YouTube
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.160]  on tape admitting that they do it I mean you must be a threat if they call you
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.320]  out by name they didn't call out Fox News by name they didn't call out anyone
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:52.200]  else by name they said when it comes to Alex Jones we need people to scroll and
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.200]  manually find him and manually have to find that video we're not we're not gonna
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.120]  allow that video if it gets 10 million views to be on the front of the so-called
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.640]  news carousel and we work with the Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.160]  in the New York Times these people Nick Dudek is either a serial liar or he has
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.120]  one of the biggest conflicts of interest in the history of the world because he
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:17.560]  says in this video these James Comey's godson and that nobody knows that he's
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:21.280]  either lying about it or he's under some type of psychosis these are the types of
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.600]  people that that YouTube's working with exactly listen James you're a hard

[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.960]  has now gone so mainstream that even realtor.com is writing about it but
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.520]  the realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.240]  themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis's guns and canned foods

[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:21.400]  sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then

[01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:02.920]  willing to die to key alchemy there you got to have the truth and you got to be
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:08.480]  willing to die and lose everything you got and only then can you go through the
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:14.320]  fire and believe me if this amount of pressure been put on me 22 years ago when
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:23.920]  I first went on air I couldn't handle it now I have seen God's design through
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:28.960]  not just me but countless other people preparing everybody incrementally for the
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.280]  weight that can be put on us so that when we get to that point of real face to
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:40.960]  face contest with the enemy which we've now reached we're ready no longer the
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:50.720]  learner but now the master and of course the master knows that he's a learner the
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:37:01.600]  learner believes he's already the master that's why you see project veritas
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.520]  there with the New York Times main liaison to YouTube and you know I had
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:14.200]  private agreements with YouTube and I don't violate private agreements but I've
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.080]  talked about this before as far as I can go
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:24.040]  YouTube told me leave us alone and we'll make you number one did you just think
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:36.520]  that was me trying to sound big on here Facebook told me three years ago you
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:43.640]  leave us alone we'll let you have access to the 35 million real people that have
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:49.960]  liked your page about the million and a half Ted Nugent it's on the air going I
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:54.320]  used to have 27 million now it's 2 million but I know that sometimes 27
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:00.240]  million people like my thing yeah Ted I'm member be talking the phone sometimes
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:05.800]  I said Ted I remember seeing 22 million on there and the point is of course people
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:12.200]  like Ted Nugent of course we're winning they're not gonna let us have the brass
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:17.960]  ring it's it's like Joe Rogan I go on his show and he calls me the next day he
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.440]  goes yeah they always uploaded they put the name up that's usually the top 20
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.880]  podcasts today the numbers show it's number one on these other platforms but
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:35.720]  they're not letting it go up it says uploaded but somebody held it and then
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.120]  there was an uproar so they put it out but hit it where nobody else could see
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.480]  it only people that looked and then it was still the number one podcast long
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.680]  form it's something you'll five minutes long that have more that they've ever
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:54.200]  had all total is like 40 something million last time I checked
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.680]  and then of course people get the words like I just can't have you back on them
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:08.000]  right now Alex which is fine I've got my own platform but see you think oh you'd
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.280]  want the biggest podcast again right no no no no no you don't win the ND 500 in
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:18.360]  this world and get put back on they go oh I'm sorry you can't race again you
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:24.320]  don't score the touchdown in the Super Bowl you get fired for that you don't
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:31.640]  win and dominate and get put forward in America under the globalist control if
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.120]  you're not going along with their whole game of course that's true but it's
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.840]  invaluable because in court I can get into stuff that I told YouTube I wouldn't
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:47.560]  talk about publicly and you don't just think I recorded Megan Kelly and by
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.880]  recorded I just have the emails they put us in touch with a vice president of
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:58.720]  YouTube all this stuff work with us but just be nice Alex and then when I
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:02.240]  wasn't nice they said well you saw what you could do we unleashed you for a while
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.040]  we're gonna put you back on a leash so same thing people like hey you being
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:13.480]  nice to Facebook and we're gonna let you actually have access to your fans and
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:19.520]  it's gonna be big and you're gonna make hundreds of millions of dollars Alex but
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.760]  I don't want to have access to it I'm posing as a fake conservative like Fox
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:29.920]  News I I don't want the biggest jet on the tarmac and the best trophy wife and
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.640]  walk around with a bunch of other mummies you know what half of them are
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:42.200]  pedophiles no I don't want to have sex with ten-year-old girls no I don't want
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:49.920]  to devil worship and decide I'm a god I do not want what you're offering I want
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.760]  to squeeze your neck until your eyeballs pop out metaphysically I want to
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.440]  destroy you that's what I want the globalist always asked in the past what
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:05.800]  do you want I want to destroy you because you want to destroy me you want to
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.280]  overthrow everything good you want to hurt children you want to brain damage
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:13.360]  people you want to force fetus GMO and all the rest of garbage and you know the
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.120]  fluoride in the vaccines lower IQ 30 plus points together and you're the enemy
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:25.920]  how would I not oppose that it'd be like if I was a mouse and they said help us
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.000]  feed all the other mice of a meat grinder and then we'll throw you into the
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.120]  meat grinder after I'd say I'm a mouse I'm not gonna throw my other mice the
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:40.000]  reason I use that example I'm not a mouse I'm a man mice would run from this
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.040]  people say boy you're sure fight you sure got courage I folks in this running is
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:51.600]  fighting there's no where to run we're cornered they're still getting out of
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:56.360]  this alive unless we fight them you figure that out yet and it's that basic
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:01.800]  human instinct that they hate that I'm not scared I'm only scared of them
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:06.640]  when I'm only scared of rolling over I'm only scared of them standing in the way
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.960]  of what our species can do together so don't ever call this show and thank me
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.440]  for what I've done thank me for not wanting to see all of us fed into a
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:24.800]  meat grinder it's not special to want to fight these people it's default it's
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:32.120]  not something to get an award for the reward is a future for your children I
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:41.600]  just have to cool my afterburners and not exude all of my energy now against
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:47.720]  the enemy I've got to slowly lean up against them and strangle them and to
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.720]  do that I need your prayers and support but make no mistake just as you just

[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:40.960]  region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones again America
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.520]  and the world was sleeping under the parasite of the satanic globalist
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:52.840]  pedophile system once you awaken you'll see everything I've seen and more that's
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:48:01.680]  why the enemy so scared their entire house of cards is falling we are now
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:07.800]  gaining on them every day even though we were way behind the enemy is throwing
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.840]  out every technique they can to try to drive you back into submission but it's
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:19.200]  not working all I can tell you is as good as the awakening is the enemy's
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.440]  gonna strike back in a very bloody way and I haven't gotten into this yet I'm
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:31.720]  gonna get into it more later in the next hour and open the phones up as well you
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.320]  have to understand they can compartmentalize people in the military or
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.440]  in law enforcement just as much they can compartmentalize you in the company you
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.520]  work in do you know what's going on in accounting do they know what's going on
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.440]  in maintenance do they know what's going on in lawn care whatever it is your
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:52.600]  main business is pool care radio TV I mean whatever it is think of the
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:56.360]  compartmentalization in your life with your husband or your wife you're not
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:59.200]  hiding stuff from the other one it's just that somebody handles this somebody
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.360]  handles that you tried to know everything they're doing you'd spend all your
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:08.920]  time so when we look at Vegas I'm not defending the sheriff's department or
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:13.600]  the police or FBI but it's the FBI and local police that have given us the
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:18.440]  truth before anybody else did that there was a lie now mainstream media
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:22.920]  spending at the sheriff's department lied and it was police response time
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:28.000]  that's why they lied there were shootouts all over the city there were
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.360]  multiple terrorist teams the police got several of them now it's under national
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:36.320]  security we don't know exactly what happened the people involved are trying
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:43.760]  to figure it out but again when I get in here in an exercise of saying it's not
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.280]  all the police I'm not doing that as some virtue signaling thing it's that
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.760]  they're compartmentalized just like we are we knew what really happened we knew
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:59.960]  the first questions because of local police local citizens and the FBI they
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.760]  go wait a minute Alex you're saying the FBI guy over it's a bad guy we have that
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.680]  from multiple federal sources some on air I'm surprised Craig Sawyer said on
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.600]  air I heard the same stuff from other people he named the guy that's an Obama
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:18.920]  creature back from the Clinton days but under Obama really got nasty so they
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.840]  don't know everything they just know he had Islamic material they just know he
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.760]  had anti-material they said no Alex when I kept saying she they said there was
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:34.160]  Islamic notes in the house or in the hotel room and the she'd travel there's
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:39.160]  like no Alex he's traveled there him to came out later a week later he traveled
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.720]  there so it doesn't mean we have all the answers or I have them all it means
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:55.440]  we're being lied to about what happened here so the casino is acting very very
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:59.040]  suspicious right now I'm trying to blame the police and if you look at the
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:02.040]  background of the casino and the leftist garbage the George Soros connections
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:06.800]  Islamic connections it's not the casino that was given us tips about the being
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:11.360]  a cover-up it was law enforcement so think about that and they're the ones
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:17.000]  telling us there's a cover-up going on above it below Trump but above them it's
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.320]  at that high-level management level right below the top people and Trump's
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:25.880]  trying to clean it up and he's fired 13,000 people but they'll lie to his
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:31.600]  face a lot of his managers face it's just it's a it's an infiltration this is
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:39.280]  an infiltration war now he's been there for almost a week he just got back
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.880]  last night and he's dutifully without me telling him to in here at his desk
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:46.680]  working hard one of our most intrepid in the field reporters and investigative
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:50.760]  journalists videographers and Michael Zimmerman's gonna be in studio riding
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.600]  shotgun the whole next hour when we take your calls in another subjects but he
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.840]  went to Puerto Rico they landed there and they flew to other sub areas and
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:03.640]  they've been there and it's exactly what Trump said the island was always
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:09.920]  infrastructure low it always had a lot of corruption you got 90 plus mayors that
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.280]  tell you things they should have like for three million people most Puerto
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:18.880]  Ricans live here what's that tell you beautiful island great culture but you
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.640]  know it's like areas east Texas or something or podunk places I mean they
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.840]  just it's it because it gets hit by hurricanes all the time why should you
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.360]  put in a big expensive house or infrastructure they get flattened every
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:35.760]  five years by hurricane the Caribbean's awesome folks but if you're right in
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:44.560]  those hurricane pass it's you know it's got some issues so he's been there the
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:48.720]  Democrats are 100% sitting on their hands 100% he's got all the video and
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:53.080]  more let's come start the next hour I got a lot of the clips I want to get to
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:56.320]  I've got all the cover up by the mainstream media and all these nasty
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:04.720]  notice I singled out Matt Damon Ben Affleck George Clooney as the slimmiest of
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:09.240]  the slimmers because I know folks that know him and I've been around them a
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:12.960]  few times and I'm not proud of that by the way so I've been around them I
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.720]  think and yeah I've been around Hollywood and I got out of it real quick I
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:20.480]  sure went and checked it out for a few years just off and on and it rolled out
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.440]  the red carpet by the way but it was not a carpet that I wanted to follow come
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:29.040]  up you'll Tom and Jerry cartoons where the tongue goes out and it looks like a
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.520]  hotel or a nightclub it's really the cat's mouth and the mouse is walking in
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:38.920]  I was like yeah this looks like a mouth I think I'll go back to Texas my little
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:44.120]  spidey sense is like pegged like get what are you doing get it wasn't even
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:50.320]  fear it was like weakness it was maybe that's just Hollywood then I'd be a
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.880]  few other places around the country feel great till I went into a room with them
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:04.000]  and then I felt again like whoa this is like being in hell man my spirit is like
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  punishing me get away from these people but I can be in the middle of some
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:19.680]  little poor town in Georgia fishing with some old blind man on the edge of a
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:26.920]  river my soul feels real good but if I'm in Hollywood or anywhere around it man
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:31.920]  my spirit tells me man this is empty this isn't like power that wants to
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:37.400]  control you or dominate you kind of like barbaric male energy that's has a hint
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:41.120]  of Satanism but it really isn't it's just twisted that that's an urgent gets
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.680]  me excited and angry and that's the one that really tempts me the you know
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:53.840]  conquest resistance war domination against worthy opponents but Hollywood
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:55:01.160]  it's like soullessness it's emptiness it's like a betrayal it's it's pure
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:09.800]  Satanism so that's coming up but before I go any further as you know you built
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.960]  info wars and they're trying to censor us on every platform out there but we
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:18.480]  have found ways around it I'm not going to get into how we do it I've talked
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:23.120]  about some of it already today they want to censor us out of existence they can
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:27.960]  say Alex Jones the liar George Soros fought the Nazis at the Battle of the
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.600]  Bulls with General Patton CNN said that last night they said Soros was a
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.880]  victim and battled Nazis valiantly he stood beside Captain America in the
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.600]  front lines I mean they almost went that far when we had the videos of him
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.920]  admitting the whole deal and I'm gonna try to play more of that next hour
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:49.240]  CNN claims Alex Jones fabricated Soros Nazi ties that's the article you can see
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:53.360]  the full 12 and a half minute 60 minutes where he says I'm kind of proud of
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:57.760]  what they've done you know it's just total counter-acculent stuff but if you

[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:13.800]  continues to grow as more victims continue to come forward and as more
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:18.800]  clips of hollywood stars continue to surface showing them engaging in well
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:24.200]  shall we say similar behavior CNN calls Jimmy Kimmel America's conscience and
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:28.880]  here's America's conscience enticing young girls into groping his crotch for
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.640]  a chance to be on television this game show is called yes what's in my pants
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:38.760]  now I've stopped something in my pants and you're allowed to feel around on the
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:45.280]  outside of the pants you have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants you're
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:57.840]  ready go you should use two hands you think is is that your final answer
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:08.740]  wow he continues to skit with a variety of different fame horse who
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:12.640]  are all willing to humiliate themselves for a chance to be on television which
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:16.240]  in Los Angeles coming in almost unlimited supply one of which is so
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:19.920]  young-looking that he's concerned that he may be breaking the law you worked on
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:27.600]  a farm haven't you okay can you sure of that there's a uncle Jimmy doesn't need
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:33.120]  to do time it's not gonna bite you well nothing unusual there I guess just a
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:36.560]  late-night Hollywood talk show host who regularly uses his show to promote
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.040]  Hollywood propaganda and poison the minds of billions here's Ben Affleck
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.960]  who's worked very closely with Harvey Weinstein over the course of his career
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:46.280]  on a variety of different films and apparently he's learned quite a bit from
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:50.200]  him because here he is groping and apparently sexually harassing this
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.800]  woman is trying to interview him about one of his films well I usually show a
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.400]  lot more cleavage than this what's the story why are you covering it up today
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:08.400]  by the way this is when he was dating Jennifer Lopez this is how Hollywood
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.280]  people roll when they're in a relationship no wonder Hollywood marriage has
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.320]  never last and then there's this guy Ed Asner who was on a show in the 1970s
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.360]  called the Mary Tyler Moore show which was about a woman who decided not to
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.600]  get married and not have kids but instead pursue her career a show which was
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.640]  celebrated by all the liberals and the feminists as groundbreaking and here he
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:32.280]  is on MSNBC yesterday talking about the Harvey Weinstein scandal and sexism in
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:38.160]  Hollywood when he started the interview off by saying this at Asner wow it's
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:41.920]  great to have you here thank you so much for coming in thank you and not even a
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:48.600]  kiss no nothing right oh my god this is it this is okay this is totally bizarre
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.320]  you're on the show talking about sexism in Hollywood and hear your pestering the
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:56.520]  interviewer to give you a kiss that wasn't the end of the weirdness they went
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:59.680]  on to talk about the Harvey Weinstein scandal and then he blamed President
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:03.960]  Trump for creating a climate in the country that enables people like him and
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:08.840]  then when they wrapped up the interview he said this at Asner the book is the
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:14.120]  grouchy historian longtime fan thank you so much for coming on the program good
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:18.760]  luck with the book you show me a kid okay you're gonna get yourself in trouble
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:27.040]  and with good reason I'm not the job I'm not a job procurer thank you what an
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:30.520]  absolute creep this guy even looks like Harvey Weinstein look at that he's got
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:34.760]  that same one squinty eye maybe they're just both possessed by similar demons
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:37.680]  while there are more people denouncing Harvey Weinstein every day from
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.760]  Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama not everybody is ready to write him off just
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:47.000]  yet Lindsay Lohan who is apparently not dead from a drug overdose posted this
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.200]  video on her Instagram telling everybody to leave Harvey alone
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:04:00.800]  Hi, this is Lindsay Lohan. Hi, I'm in Dubai. I'm home. I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:08.800]  It's not right what's going on she says to him he's the victim here. I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:13.800]  I think Georgina needs to take a stand and be... She lives in Dubai of course.
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:23.800]  I've never hung with him and I was like yeah when you trump out of Islam and so I think everyone needs to solve I think it's wrong so we'll stand up.
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:26.800]  That really is her I know it sounds like she has an accent there but that is
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.800]  Lindsay Lohan apparently she's just stuck in character unable to differentiate
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.600]  completely mentally from reality at this point it gets so much more disgusting I
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:37.920]  don't even like talking about it check my previous video yesterday to see
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.440]  Hollywood A-listers including Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson literally
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:45.240]  giving a stand yeah and the idiocracy president the producers would grab his
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:50.680]  movie who was given an Oscar we'll be back folks but couldn't accept it we'll be
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:53.480]  back you know there's plans you like to rape old girls that's okay just a little
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.840]  sets cool
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:01.440]  police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:07.000]  called stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:13.240]  text messages without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the FBI
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:17.880]  who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:22.360]  agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:26.920]  needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:31.040]  they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying where we
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:35.720]  now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:41.240]  people who are not even suspected of any crimes once again more evidence that the
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:46.240]  police state isn't coming it's already here this is Darren McBreen and I invite
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:52.200]  you to join the resistance info wars dot-com
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:06:07.160]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:11.440]  gonna happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:25.000]  one of the information war it's Alex Jones ladies gentlemen Michael Zimmerman
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:30.760]  just spent five six days in Puerto Rico and it wasn't at some arms resort where
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:34.480]  they got security guards protecting it for some rich neighborhood it was in the
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:40.120]  poorest areas riding with the 18-wheeler's going in witnessing the unions
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:44.760]  ordering a stand down but still despite that the 20% of the truck drivers
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:49.520]  working around the clock me I'm making hours a day have gotten 80% of the stores
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:53.480]  and gas stations open power on the many areas and our media just keeps lying
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:57.840]  even though we've given more aid per capita than we've given to Houston
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:02.600]  that's 10 million people Metro to Puerto Rico is 3 million and I'm all for
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:05.920]  helping Puerto Rico like I've talked to folks that go on vacation there it's very
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:09.520]  low-cost very beautiful they tell me don't want to go downtown at night you'll
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:13.000]  get mugged but other than that it's really nice country and I'm you know a
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.120]  lot of Puerto Ricans are listeners of the show but we're gonna get into the
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:21.200]  reality of what Michael Zimmerman with the great Gary Haven documented as part
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:25.840]  of the aid relief that we supported me while Hillary robbed the Philippines and
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:30.000]  you know robbed you know so many other countries like what happened in Haiti and
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.320]  robbed other countless other nations during disasters they quote oversaw then
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:38.040]  she shakes her fish it at her fist at Trump it's not that I'm even defending
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:42.000]  Trump I'm defending reality so let's go ahead and go to Michael Zimmerman's
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:47.440]  report this is Michael Zimmerman reporting for infowars.com on September
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:52.560]  20th Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico now 20 days later the effects
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:56.600]  of the storm are still being felt by most of the island this week I traveled
[02:07:56.600 --> 02:07:59.960]  to Puerto Rico with Gary Haven and his wife Diane who had previously traveled
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:04.280]  with Tahiti to cover the damage after Hurricane Matthew we're off to Puerto
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:10.480]  Rico right now we're picking up a group of missionaries that need to assess the
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:14.120]  situation they're working with over 2,000 churches there and incidentally
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:18.280]  they're working for the White House and so we should have a really interesting
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:22.680]  day going to the island of Vieques which is kind of isolated they say the
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:27.360]  airport's closed but we're going there anyway so we'll find the out so let's
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.880]  have a great adventure and see if we can do some good out there we traveled to San
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:34.760]  Juan where we picked up a pastor that was working with the network of over 2,000
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:39.000]  churches across Puerto Rico and a former US ambassador who led recovery efforts
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.680]  after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti from San Juan we flew to the remote island of
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:48.000]  Vieques home to 9,000 people in order to survey the damage and see where aid
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.160]  could best be used what we saw in Vieques was similar to what we saw in the rest of
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:56.080]  Puerto Rico there's lots of damage across the island but residents for the
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:00.400]  most part have food and water at this point access to electricity is the main
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.960]  need but not something that aid groups or individuals are able to help with the
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.580]  mainstream media has spent the past 20 days attacking President Trump over his
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:13.440]  response to the disaster blaming him for the current crisis on the island but
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.360]  as info was previously reported the problem really lies with the
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:19.960]  distribution of aid across the island here's what Colonel Michael Valle
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:25.240]  commander of the federal relief effort in Puerto Rico had to say the aid is
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:29.120]  getting to Puerto Rico the problem is distribution the federal government has
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:33.080]  sent us a lot of help moving these supplies in particular fuel is the
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:37.040]  issue right now it's the lack of drivers for the transport trucks the 18
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:43.440]  wheelers supplies we have trucks we have however only 20% of the drivers show up
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:47.840]  to work as a Puerto Rican what happens here for the people is personal to me
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:52.040]  to say we are not provided all of the help and resources needed is just not
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:57.840]  true distribution is the key and we're working day and night on it this match
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.600]  is what we observed while in Puerto Rico the containers of aid are backed up at
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.880]  the ports and not making it to the people here's what m4's contributor and
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:11.360]  Puerto Rican Ruben Obed had to say who lives just 30 minutes from San Juan I'm
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:14.320]  gonna be really honest with you and this you might not hear in the mainstream
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:18.160]  media here in Puerto Rico there has always been an issue with truckers you
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:21.720]  know they they sometimes they paralyze the whole country because they want
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:26.920]  raises because they want this and that I don't know if that is what's going on or
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:31.960]  maybe they're thinking you know let's put pressure and capitalize on this
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:36.360]  hurricane that might be the case I personally I'm a Trump supporter and I
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:40.320]  and I know for a fact that Trump has sent the help in a series of tweets
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:43.600]  president Trump said they want everything to be done for them when it
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:47.880]  should be a community effort 10,000 federal workers now on Island doing a
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:51.920]  fantastic job despite the many issues with FEMA as we see with every
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:56.000]  disaster Trump was right Puerto Rico depends upon the community coming
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.840]  together to distribute aid while traveling around the island we saw
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.840]  cars on all major freeways and stores open everywhere Democrats will continue
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:07.800]  to blame Trump for the problems of Puerto Rico but thousands of men and
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.760]  women at the National Guard FEMA and other government agencies will continue
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.520]  to work around the clock to help with recovery efforts in Puerto Rico this has
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:21.280]  been Michael Zimmerman for info wars.com you know seeing in what father
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.400]  average show is about 300,000 viewers an hour nationwide and about that
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.840]  internationally so 600,000 viewers it's if they put something on like you just
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:34.560]  put on three and a half minutes long super HD video all the experts the
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:38.040]  truth of what's happening that would have five million viewers in a show but
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:42.080]  they just have to lie about everything and then they even have the teamsters on
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:46.040]  video bragging oh we're holding it all up but despite that everybody just went
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:51.880]  around them Trump signing order to bring in outside truck drivers you were there
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:58.160]  Michael and it just shows how they jump on every opportunity to try to sabotage
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:01.920]  the recovery and now they're trying to raise interest rates to sabotage the
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:06.040]  economy's recovery this is really a group of terrorists absolutely and they're
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:09.880]  not reporting the truth they've spent the past three weeks demonizing Trump
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:13.040]  saying that he's doing nothing for these people they'll play the clip of you know
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.240]  he went there he threw some paper towels into a crowd and they're like oh
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:20.120]  that's all the relief Trump did that's not true they were yelling give it it's
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:23.680]  exactly it was like a football game or a rock star deal he was just being
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:26.840]  personal was having fun actually and everyone's laughing and smiling people
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:30.440]  liking cuz he does that right we don't want some stuck-up president that you
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:33.720]  know yeah and they're trying to make it out to be that's the only release that
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.720]  he gave to the island but they're actually sending power line trucks that's
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:40.560]  CNN Skelter said look at the relief this is all he did was paper towels they have
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:44.880]  you were there it's stacked up to the well I showed in that that footage all
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:48.240]  those containers throughout the ports the docks are full there's nowhere to
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:53.080]  unload new containers because despite you know it's full of goods it's full of
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:58.640]  relief and that was two weeks ago I was reading it's like 1520 ships lined up
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:03.080]  to yep but they can't even dump it yeah we saw a couple ships out in the in the
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:06.320]  harbor there in San Juan but all the ports that are federally controlled are
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:10.320]  open on the island all the airports are open we drove on let's show that
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:13.760]  math you mentioned to tell folks for themselves on radios we always think
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:18.160]  we're just visual we're mainly radio tell folks I think of the official nation
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:21.840]  of Puerto Rico Island of Puerto Rico's own site to see what's really going on
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:25.920]  right there's this website called status dot PR let's put that on screen guys
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.840]  status dot PR on this website they show all the up-to-date statistics as of
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:37.240]  today so 79% of gas stations are open today 86% of supermarkets 55% of
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:41.000]  telecoms back of course the big power issue is power and electricity that's
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.400]  at 17% today but the power company was bankrupt there months before the storm
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:48.920]  even hit so they don't have condition it's been bankrupt for two years the
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:51.680]  overall name but they're they're power that's what Trump's saying he's saying
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:56.200]  listen like Houston the citizens help everybody work with the military
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:59.720]  everybody you got it it's not the citizens fault there they're controlled
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:04.840]  by these liberal mafias these the like mayors are like the mafias of each
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:09.600]  little street exactly 93 mayors and we saw young people driving around in
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:12.680]  pickup trucks and I'm thinking the whole time we're there if there's people in
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:15.720]  need if there's old people who are going without food or water why are you not
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.520]  driving these points where they're distributing the aid with your pickup
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:21.280]  truck yeah I mean here's the deal it's not because it's not because their color
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:25.640]  it's it's cultural you had Hispanics and whites and blacks all help each other
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:28.640]  in Texas that's how we do it right just get out of the way there's this
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.720]  attitude the third world in Latin America just wait and go through a
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:36.040]  bureaucracy well we went to some of these areas and right down the street
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:38.960]  there's a whole mall open there's grocery stores open people are like where's
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:41.240]  their food where's their water it's like well if you don't have a car you might
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:44.160]  have to go walk to get some but it's very different than what we saw in Haiti
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:47.480]  where if these people didn't have food delivered they died they would die how
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:51.920]  many what hundreds of thousands 200,000 died in Haiti we got maybe 50 something
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:55.040]  deaths 50 60 around that yeah I check you last night
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:59.920]  57 deaths versus 200,000 from the earthquake in a right and Katrina was
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:04.840]  over a thousand people died right here in Louisiana. See that's all teleprompter
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:09.800]  free because we actually have a passion to care because think about you love a
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:14.120]  cashless society there was an article out today from Mises.org it's on
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:18.760]  infowords.com in a cashless world you better pray the power never goes out and
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:22.000]  they're in big trouble because of that they the banks are not open and a lot
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.640]  of people like Ruben Obed who we spoke to who's been on the show before he said
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:29.360]  well we've got money on our debit cards but we can't go to the bank and get cash
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:33.280]  and the card readers are down in the stores. I mean I don't want to sit here
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:36.880]  and just defend Trump but it's like defending reality it's like somebody I
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:41.200]  call it and said Jews invented devil worship and I go actually Jews were the
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.440]  first group to ban human sacrifice Abraham and it's not just defending
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:49.080]  Jews it's defending reality it's the same thing here you know it's just like
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.080]  Trump did not do this he's done a great job so is our military and FEMA and
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:54.720]  everybody else.

[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:11.520]  organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:17.080]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:20.960]  in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.080]  pathogens added to the food and water to the lining of plastics that destroy our

[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:18.120]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:25.240]  to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars. You know about three weeks ago
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:28.880]  I made the decision we're gonna get back to Puerto Rico in a minute it's bigger
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:32.920]  than Puerto Rico it's about media response control manipulation you
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:37.360]  understand Puerto Rico you understand it all it's a great case point example and
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:42.200]  it's very important but I decided and I told the crew I said listen I don't tell
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:44.960]  you what to cover I don't tell you what to do so I hired people that I know are
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:48.000]  competent care about freedom I want to have their perspective the media always
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:53.040]  says look Paul Watson disagrees with Alex on this Alex can't control his
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:57.160]  reporters no no I don't work at the Huffington Post or Newsweek where it's
[02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:01.360]  a cult I don't tell folks to agree with me they don't get in trouble for
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:05.440]  disagreeing it's they have a general history of being smart of know what's
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:10.720]  going on and I respect it I want that college of ideas I don't want to be
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:21.280]  addled or hobbled by by by people being yes man that said I said look I don't
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:24.320]  want to I've told Roger Stone this to us I don't want to follow White House
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:28.720]  intrigue and power struggles because I said we get rid of Spicer we get rid of
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:34.280]  previous and then we get Kelly and then Kelly's even worse supposedly and I said
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:37.560]  I don't know what the truth is about Kelly his son died in Iraq he sounds like
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:41.720]  a committed guy but then I hear I can't help it you know that Trump's very close
[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:45.320]  to firing Kelly and suddenly Kelly is doing a live press briefing right now
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:51.120]  coming how much he loves Trump just the one way to not get fired by Trump so so
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:57.400]  I just all I know is Kelly admits in the news our main jobs keeping info wars
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:03.240]  from the president well what did Google and the New York Times say we want to
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:08.920]  stop Alex Jones because it's not Kelly out there when they're saying that
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:12.840]  Trump's killing everybody in Puerto Rico exposing it it's our operation it's
[02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:16.280]  our audience that then helps us get the info and carries the ball we're all
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:20.280]  you folks your info wars I don't just set a pat on the head without you we're
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:30.200]  dying with you we win together you win so but I think it's healthy you're not
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:34.440]  focused on the White House intrigue and I don't tell Roger what to do I'm just
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:37.360]  giving examples I told everybody I said listen I get caught up in this too
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:41.600]  we're not in DC we're not scrambling to be part of the power we're not all these
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:46.880]  losers up there in DC that need to be part of that power we built this we're
[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:51.560]  America we don't want to be part of Hollywood or DC or New York or the power
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:56.720]  structure we want to be separate and independent but that said I don't mean
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:00.320]  never cover it but but what's your view on that Michael right I agree we shouldn't
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:03.840]  make that the main focus they're trying to distract us right now from all these
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:07.960]  things happening in Las Vegas to cover up with that with this news about IQ
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:11.520]  tests and Kelly and Trump having some sort of feud that's not the main story
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:14.960]  going on the main story is that 60 people were murdered in Las Vegas and the
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:19.120]  story they're giving us is a bunch of lies what do you make of the info we
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:25.200]  got up 12 days ago all of it proven right from the HRT I mean the first time
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:28.320]  I got info from the HRT I was like okay and then it happened second time like
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:34.440]  wow third time they're giving us what does it say about America that the FBI in
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:40.840]  the actual tactical level communicates to us I was skeptical about some of this
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:45.160]  when I left town a week ago last Tuesday you know I was questioning the main
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:49.560]  story but I wasn't really sure you know where they're multiple shooters what of
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:52.680]  the story they're giving us is true and then when I got back in town and had
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:56.200]  internet again I was just reading article after article last night and
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:59.640]  they admit the whole stories of fraud multiple shooters shooting 45 minutes
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:02.840]  before notice I said two days ago but notice it's six minutes before I said
[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:07.160]  watch they're gonna expand it because what we had was there was at least four
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:11.880]  shooters and cops took them out in other areas and we have the witnesses there
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:15.320]  was a major ISIS attack they said there was guys with beards running around I'm
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:18.400]  not supposed to get into this but I mean they just covered up an ISIS attack
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:22.200]  then you gotta ask why are they doing in the hotel new six minutes before yeah
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:25.200]  this guards getting shot their policies not to do anything about it so they
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:27.720]  don't even tell the police we've got someone reigning gunfire out of the
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:31.960]  window and then this whole thing saying it was these bumpfire stocks they
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:35.240]  finally put those pictures out that's all lies there's videos out there I've
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:40.080]  everybody we've talked to Navy SEALs Delta Force special forces green beret
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:43.320]  they even know the names of the guns we've been hired an acoustic guys coming
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:48.000]  out tomorrow they they have signatures they know the guns bro right and it's
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.680]  not what they're telling us so where are these guns where the other shooters just
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:55.760]  like there's voice print analysis for 20 years right they got gun analysis they
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:00.240]  know the report how long it is even what what load they're shooting when you can
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.160]  measure the the distances with the you know sound the actual gunshot and then
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:08.280]  the sound of the bullet hitting knowing velocity since yeah it's like 250 meters
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:13.160]  or something Gary was actually showing me a video while we were in the Dominican
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:17.200]  Republic he found one that was analyzing all of this how cool is Gary Haven
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:22.860]  coolest person I've ever met cooler than me I'm jelly I never get to fly on you
[02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:26.000]  guys all his jets and stuff but he's always like help him he doesn't just do
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.600]  it for publicity he never even wanted to I said hey let us go on your aid
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:32.560]  missions he literally just flies around helping people once the first day we
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:37.000]  went into into Puerto Rico we flew over the island and we're trying to find out
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.880]  where could aid best be used but if the ports are open and the freeways are open
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:44.880]  it doesn't make sense for him when his money could be used for aid in other
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:49.280]  countries to fly things in you know on an airplane when the ports and roads are
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:53.240]  open all the stores sure and stacked up to you know 10 boxes deep 10 containers
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:56.800]  right literally but but you guys did go give the real age showing the truth
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:00.800]  exactly so we distributed aid to a town right outside of San Juan and then
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:05.120]  Rubin Obed has then gone and distributed that to a bunch of people in his
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.800]  community we gave him some money since the stores are open too but he's
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:12.600]  making good use of that because what we left the break in a cashless world you
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.280]  better pray the power never goes out he's got money he's got a business he's a
[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:19.960]  successful guy he can't spend it right everyone has their money on the cell
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.000]  phone the banks are down the store may be open but sorry yeah if you don't have
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.480]  cash on hand you're not going to be able to spend any money so 80% of the
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:30.600]  stores are open if you don't have any cash you're out of luck because the
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:34.360]  stores don't have power they can't run your car and they always act like we're
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:38.680]  against technology that we've got food or we got solar or we got a garden it's
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:44.960]  a normal human activity ants save food grasshoppers don't they die I mean it's
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:51.240]  like normal instinct like you know I had a new great baby total angel five months
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:55.600]  ago and I told my wonderful wife I said listen I want you to buy even though
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.600]  you've got breast milk case that stopped case it was a problem in case anything
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.040]  goes on there was a major war I want you to buy a year of formula and she and she
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:08.200]  said my milk's fine blah blah blah and you know we got I said do it well four
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:12.840]  months in her milk stop nope no effect on her great lady and you know and it's
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:16.200]  just examples like wow yeah now we got a year of formula right I said exactly
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:20.760]  it's insurance we can eat it's like I want the bases covered that I can cover
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:24.200]  in worst case if it gets towards the end of life of the storeable food which is
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:28.440]  20 plus years on most of the stuff the stuff we saw was 25 years right yeah
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:32.040]  it's getting close to the end of the life you know 22 23 years and you can
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:34.880]  donate all that food to a food bank well I mean exactly but I'm sitting there
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:39.920]  rocking a baby who's a month old and watching my wife you know nurse her I'm
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:43.320]  thinking what if there's a nuclear war with Korea I got food for everybody else
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:47.480]  I don't have stuff that protect the baby and then I think well what well she's
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:51.120]  got milk I'm not gonna just count on her have a milk no and then sure enough it
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:55.120]  ran out it happened before with other three other kids another wife but it's
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:57.960]  just you know it's no effect on her I can't produce milk the point is that you
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:01.400]  just look at an every angle right well and you've got to provide for people you
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:04.280]  have to provide for your family and make sure they're taken care of and your
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:08.120]  community too so right now those roads are open in Puerto Rico people need to
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.240]  go to the stores buy food help their neighbors if your neighbors don't have
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:14.920]  food it's up for you to help and that's my point it's not being a superhero as a
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.320]  father you're analyzing at night are the are the lights on outside are the
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:23.080]  doors locked and do I have a firearm and an instant access it's not that I'm
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:27.760]  living in fear I'm living in charge so I lay down I feel good yep you're not
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:30.920]  losing any sleep at night your family's taking care of you've got food for them
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.400]  all that and I'm ready and I'm politically fighting for the future
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:40.760]  not because I'm a hero but because I'm not an enemy of my family it's a default
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:44.640]  to be involved folks and it's empowering it's the real ballgame not
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:49.280]  one should a bunch of drug addict steroid heads out there pissing on the

[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:01.480]  story and and Zimmerman's been looking into this it's a hit Daniels article on
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:07.840]  news wars.com and info wars.com how did they a few years ago get hundreds of
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:11.760]  photos of all these top models I remember when I heard it in top stars I
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:16.520]  thought how'd they get into all of their cloud computers at once that just
[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:21.800]  doesn't make sense turns out it was the database people are fortune the
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:27.640]  autistic army as they call themselves not an insult to plus has found the trail
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:32.360]  that it appears to be a Weinstein cache that's on info wars.com we'll talk
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:35.640]  about that in a moment speaking of that before we get back into this with
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:39.960]  Michael Zimmerman riding shotgun with me fresh back from our aid trip and our
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:44.600]  investigation of Puerto Rico the island nation hit by three hurricanes this
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:52.080]  year before we go any further I just want to point out that the Justice
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:56.960]  Department Trump started a criminal investigation today how sensational is
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:03.320]  that of him fleeing like we and others pointed out yesterday I and others the
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:06.680]  whole office did is this Polanski too where he rapes a 13-year-old girl after
[02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:11.800]  kidnapping her brutally and then flees to France for years not getting in
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:15.160]  trouble then there's pressure they grab him for other sex abuse put him in
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:18.920]  prison at Merrill Street once he went to prison the arrogance of publicly
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:25.160]  defending convicted child molesters why would Merrill Street now come out and
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:30.280]  say she's against Weinstein because their powers gone the numbers show it
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:36.680]  the facts are in the NFL mainstream news CNN of the Daily Show Comedy Central
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:41.800]  co-bear all of it I never got up here in my 20 plus years and said they've fallen
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.320]  they're done I was like they're on top of us dominating us there's come their
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:48.840]  filth here's the alternative when I'm telling you they're done they know
[02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:52.160]  they're done that's what they're trying to blow the country up trying to cause a
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:56.040]  race war trying to try to ship AIDS infected blood all over the country from
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:00.360]  California as they've legalized they are in full panic mode they've reached this
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:04.280]  point where they're eating their own now everyone is going to save themselves
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:07.560]  they're going to turn on the others the whole system they've built there with
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:12.440]  all these pedophiles all these sex offenders abusers how luscious is it
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:16.000]  going to be to watch it and plug oh Harvey Weinstein is the beginning it's

[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:47.440]  that the crew put together of them sickeningly including the star of one
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:52.280]  of the biggest films has been out lately based on the whole books that were put
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.840]  out kind of showing us a near future world that they could create the hunger
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:02.360]  games and we've got this quote star of that literally on camera groveling to
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:09.080]  Weinstein and we've got her in the data dump of this whole situation I mean this
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:13.240]  this whole implosion is incredible because we all know these guys are not

[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:50.520]  turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:19.520]  I mean don't have a fight with me

[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:11.960]  and just a powerhouse I just want to thank God so that's the joke is to have
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:18.400]  a tranny as the beard for that Obama's just be public about it as a gay man the
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:23.080]  Punisher Old Testament I guess
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:26.920]  I just want to congratulate Harvey and his wife Georgina on the birth of their
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:31.960]  new baby boy what's that hearts man Harvey gave us what we needed
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:36.200]  she looks really gross think about her she's done with him now she's gross she
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:40.640]  was a major person who's photos for anything like his dad Jennifer Lawrence
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:45.920]  Harvey Weinstein right mate she thanked him at every award show he was on set of
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:49.880]  movies that he didn't even produce she was in Oscars
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:55.760]  let's just do what we're here to do oh yeah she's in deeper time
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:01.440]  are we asking for it you know by prison all of the feminists now now women are
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:05.240]  asking for it like the feminist mayor of Columbus said don't wave many skirts the
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:08.240]  Muslims are gonna write you a performance by an actress in this
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:11.360]  where don't write me bracelets congratulations you five ladies no
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:15.920]  longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein

[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:25.680]  where was she call me God it doesn't work oh my gosh called you God how
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:33.280]  embarrassing I did later on the rapist interviews the rapist who is this
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:38.480]  woman I don't think we're only looking at him I think you're looking at a world
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:45.240]  much deeper than that Donna Karen I think we're looking at a world much deeper
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:48.400]  you know they had that they tried to have the Huffington Post come out and
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:52.120]  claimed that I was defending Weinstein when I said a lot of women know they're
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.440]  getting into this and it's really evil but a lot of young women don't and so
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:59.240]  watch out young women you may end up in snuff films which has happened in
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:04.000]  Hollywood I mean look at Sharon Tate oh that was filmed oh we'll see I'm sorry
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.400]  don't know that the point is is that that's an FBI files you're gonna call
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:14.080]  today so how do you know that Jones this is all going on this is all happening
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:22.840]  and the truth is a lot of women like Meryl Street reportedly who defends
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.800]  child molesters like Ron Glansky they help procure the young girls just like
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.160]  they'll use a woman or a child to get kids in the back of the ice cream truck
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:33.920]  this is what people are talking about when they talk about selling your soul
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:37.600]  for fame when you're selling your soul to make it in Hollywood they're talking
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:40.600]  about this kind of stuff getting just passed around by these studio creeps
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:44.500]  like Corey Feldman and others have said their children when the stuff starts
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:50.840]  happening to them well you know Mark Dice told this story it has happened to me
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:55.520]  too and he's in a big major TV studio they're offering me a TV show with one
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:00.600]  of the one of the Molly crew people and I separately confirmed this I just say
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:04.040]  the name right now and the Molly crew guy wasn't into it either and you know
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:09.080]  they should the pettograms and stuff till you look radical but they're pitching
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:12.560]  them both this show Mark Dice and a member of Marley crew it's about five
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:16.840]  years ago and they tell Mark Dice when he's out of the room they go listen just
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:20.240]  a pleasure he's just a Satan let's pray to live for right now we're giving the
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.600]  show and and Mark said you know I'm a Christian but you guys like listen we
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:27.840]  just want you to not push that Christian stuff just say it and we'll let you go
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:31.560]  well later it came out that that's what they do to quote make sure you're not a
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:34.960]  Christian or right wingers that no that's not what they're not just seeing
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:39.400]  that's what they're into and I've had him say that to me like hey Alex you

[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  realized they were messing with me but they weren't I was like you know what

[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:31.480]  the world listening to the alex jones show and I hope I'm getting my heart
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:34.680]  right with God and not be part of this collapsing to hell to clear the world is
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:39.120]  degenerating quickly a lot of good developments as well it's it's it's a
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:46.200]  paradox a lot of key stories up on news wars dot com and prison planet com you
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:49.400]  just got back last night but have you seen we're seeing and says that George
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:55.440]  Soros was fought the Nazis like Captain America I mean they had he said he helped
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:59.680]  the Nazis and work with them on 60 minutes in 1998 now they say that's a
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:02.720]  lie that I told what do you make of that it couldn't be more clear what Soros
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:06.480]  said we've played that clip hundreds if not thousands of times here at m4s
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:11.160]  Soros says that those were some of the best days of his life and then of course
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:15.240]  everyone knows CNN is fake news at this point it's only these same people get
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.000]  their news from John Oliver and Jimmy Kimmel who believe this stuff that's
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  right they just know they're disruptive now their job is just to get us
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:28.080]  debating with them when they say the skies you know orange instead of blue at
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:31.960]  noon they just want to get us debating that's their only job Trump only gave
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:38.080]  people paper towels yeah sure I know I saw John or what's his stelter or whatever
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:41.000]  little Humpty Dumpty got like so on there saying that with all this weird
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.960]  confidence act I can't even do the look he does where he just goes like that
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:53.360]  tries that company is I can't even do it he's such a ridiculous person I don't
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:58.040]  know this is the best weapon they've got yeah these mainstream media jokers and
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:02.440]  the the comedy shows that come on at night they think a late-night host or
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:06.200]  people source in news now because a lot of morons out there believe it well
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:10.160]  here's the problem we built a high-tech civilization the average folks worked in
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:15.160]  factories or doctors or teachers or were farmers and we built this high-tech
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:18.280]  civilization a bunch of crazy psychopaths thought we'll be God if we get
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:22.600]  into this they sought power they got into positions Hollywood government now
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:26.800]  because of internet we've all become savvy generationally and we're like who
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:32.000]  is this creepy pervert wanting to be good saying he's God he I mean anybody
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.440]  who's confident knows you're not God you're confident you're just you you
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:38.720]  have a connection to God that's your he doesn't even have the connection he
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:42.800]  thinks he's God and doesn't have the connection right it's like dude you're
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:46.640]  not even don't even have a connection to God and their audience too is small
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:49.840]  compared to that guy you had on the other week who shoots the the phantom
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:53.560]  videos yeah he's getting 30 40 million views a lot of these students he had
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:58.760]  70 million on one he's just a black cop it's articulate and everybody saying what
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:03.080]  people are all right there make it yeah he's telling the truth he's going out
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:07.040]  there and people want the truth so instead of these these movie execs who
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:09.920]  spend hundreds of millions of dollars making a film and a lot of them are
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:14.280]  flops this guy gets his cell phone and reaches 70 million people they wish they
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:18.040]  could do that CNN wishes they could do that because of the internet like you're
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:22.240]  saying people now have the power to go straight to the rest of the country by
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:25.440]  the way we should make a bigger deal out of this because I'm a humble person I
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:29.360]  mean that's my strength I mean I am humble because I realize it's all finite
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:32.840]  which makes me feel pathetic that if I'm doing a good job who are these people
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:35.960]  I'm beating I mean it's the opposite of power it's like are we actually that
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:40.240]  good a species it's like the opposite but project Veritas goes undercover with
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:43.720]  the New York Times and top YouTube executives are like our main job is to
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:47.600]  stop Alex Jones and Veritas is like wow what are you doing that's kind of
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:52.200]  miss upset and that just shows how weak they are not how strong I am but we
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:57.360]  should make some promos and stuff so the audience me included gets the fact hey
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:02.200]  we're what they're scared of so behind the curtain they're scared of this what
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:06.960]  are they scared of they're scared of Americana they're scared of God they're
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:13.200]  scared of Christ they're scared of God fear in Texas Americana prosperity where
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:17.080]  people aren't such needle you know what's that they want to suppress people so
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:21.320]  they feel powerful I want to see you rise I want to be successful that's what
[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:26.960]  they hate that's that spirit and I'm ready to kill people that attack me I'm
[02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:31.240]  not scared and and so they also scared of that because they want to be killers
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:34.960]  they want to be the mustique filled killers and killing for me is like
[02:51:34.960 --> 02:51:38.280]  another you know thing in my Swiss army knife not that I'm some tough guy but if
[02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:42.480]  I need to it's easy it's like it's like taking a piss and they don't understand
[02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:46.760]  that well and they have to interfere with their algorithms that they've
[02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:51.040]  developed to you know put us in these internet ghettos like dredge said they
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:54.520]  have to manually interfere with the algorithms because people want to watch
[02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:58.720]  inforce the growth that you know inforce and other alternative media outlets are
[02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:03.600]  having they cannot control unless they manually step in and they've been doing
[02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:08.240]  it and it's still not working no no they fell no matter what because you know
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:11.560]  they come after inforce you launch newswords they come after our YouTube
[02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:14.320]  channel we launch another YouTube channel what we really launch is the
[02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:18.200]  talking points and everybody else realizing they're really the secret and
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:23.280]  it's all them when I see people getting 70 million views and dwarfing us I love
[02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:31.040]  it it's it's the people get Satanism is envy Satanism is is is jealousy of
[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:34.400]  something that's only helping you it's one thing if somebody takes your wife
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:37.480]  away for no reason it ruins your life you should be mad at them but if
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:40.840]  somebody's better than you and smarter than you in many respects of just saying
[02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:44.720]  something I try to say in a whole hour in six minutes like Tatum because the
[02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:48.280]  media is like Jones is praising a black guy saying he's articulate yeah like I'm
[02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:52.040]  saying Trump is or you know anybody else the point is the guys better than me in
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:56.240]  many ways that's a strength we all has to have a community that doesn't make me
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:52:59.680]  weaker that makes me stronger well reaching people with the truth is what
[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:03.680]  intimidates them like I said they spend all this money trying to push allies on
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:07.400]  the public and it's not working anymore the point is they've tried to already
[02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:11.600]  threaten us all and threaten do stuff to us and we like it they haven't figured
[02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:17.400]  it out that we're I don't want to explain it to them but good people have a big
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:21.240]  good side they have a evil side the evil people only have their evil side they
[02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:24.760]  cultivate that all day and think it's their power but if they actually measured
[02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:27.880]  their evil next to ours ours is much bigger we're not proud of that we're
[02:53:27.880 --> 02:53:31.560]  trying to get rid of our evil they just think because we don't use the evil that
[02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:35.520]  we're that we're like chumps they don't understand we've transcended the evil
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:40.800]  because of Christ a little bit that makes sense yeah explain it to them then
[02:53:40.800 --> 02:53:46.160]  well they are so obsessed with this evil and they it shows you know they're
[02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:49.400]  obsessed with Satanism they're obsessed with pedophilia they're obsessed with
[02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:53.920]  abortion if you look at their their obsessive radical Islam which is the
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:59.780]  worst system out there totally suppressive dirt baggery and they call
[02:53:59.780 --> 02:54:02.360]  themselves progressives while they're pushing all of these things they're
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:06.640]  pushing death they're pushing you know just evil and darkness and they're
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:11.640]  obsessed with it and it's so pathetic who wants to kidnap a little kid and
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:14.880]  ruin their dreams because you've got the will to take them in a basement and
[02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:18.960]  rape them for a month well they beg for mommy and then when they finally pass out
[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:24.040]  and turn into catatonic mental illness you kill them oh I mean what that's not
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:28.400]  power that's not power no as much as they would like to
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:31.840]  powers getting up as a single mother and busting your ass and taking care of
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:34.880]  those kids even though your husband ran off and seeing them successful that's
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:39.000]  power yep it's building a family it's providing for them like you were talking
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:42.720]  about earlier making sure your children have food making sure their their home
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:47.720]  is protected when you lock everything up at night that's power you know faith in
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:51.480]  Christ helping others I'll make an admission though I really do hate the
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:54.560]  globalist Mike you've been here a couple years I mean what is it like studying
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:55:00.600]  them every day watching them I mean I gotta be honest I'm guilty in the fact
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:04.680]  that I lost after hurting them yeah I know you do we've had a lot of
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:08.560]  conversations traveled a lot together we went to Hawaii and Seattle this summer
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:13.960]  and it's it's the truth you hate these people I mean these people until you
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:19.760]  finally defeat them you're gonna keep fighting every single day towards that
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:24.240]  but I think you hate them too right yeah absolutely but just your drive and
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:30.160]  passion you've you know you have this focus that you've turned this into the
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:34.440]  biggest you know the tip of the spear as you put it but it's not just it I
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:38.080]  don't want to hate them I hate what they do to people right and if they want to
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:42.840]  fight and they want to grow in this big free country and then piss all over try
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:46.160]  to bring it down for everybody else I just want them to get what they want I
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:49.800]  want to accelerate where they want to take us but I want to happen to them not
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:54.760]  us Mike right they want to just not our children no not their children if they
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:58.760]  want to fight if they want to bang heads let's give it to them yeah you'd be
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:01.480]  happy with with saving them too but no if they want to destroy everything if
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:04.280]  they want to tear everything the Bible talks about it I should think I could
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:09.560]  wake them up you can't they're turned over to it they've put everything they
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:17.600]  have in the evil what do you make of a big so panicked no they know their days
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:20.440]  are numbered when it comes to this they know that their systems are falling
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:24.480]  apart they see it they expected Hillary to win they expected to be able to
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:29.360]  continue all of this that the pots that they're engaged in but then Trump won
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:33.720]  and they're panicking now they're using every weapon they have against the
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:38.200]  president yeah and I'm sorry pedophiles you can't openly legalize the schools to
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:41.200]  sexualize kids and if you can't rape them in the back room you're going to
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:44.480]  convince 70-year-olds to have their generals cut off I'm sorry perverts
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:48.040]  your Satanism and you'll be out in the open anymore make it legal to give
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:54.360]  people AIDS yeah California legalizes giving blood of you of HIV or giving it
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:58.800]  to somebody and they spin it like it's cute like it's a right I mean yeah the
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:05.440]  Jerry Brown is a dying cockroach who's just trying to disease as many people as
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:09.080]  he can and then of course the advocate came out claimed I was anti-gay people
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:13.280]  yeah cuz I don't want gay men cutting holes in their condoms and giving other
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:18.960]  gay men AIDS or HIV so I'm anti-gay it's proving their scum the people running
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:23.760]  that want to prey on men and kill them they're really Satanist vampire spiders
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:26.720]  that want to kill gay men that's what they are yeah the loving thing would be
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:30.200]  to make sure these people don't get AIDS which is the death sentence the truth
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  is it's a targeted group they first put the AIDS in vaccines HIV and that's

[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:57.480]  came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:02.120]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:07.120]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:11.120]  were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop

[02:59:54.600 --> 03:00:15.160]  now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the
[03:00:15.160 --> 03:00:22.920]  resistance it's alex jones anthony kumi is coming up final segment here with
[03:00:22.920 --> 03:00:26.880]  Michael Zimmerman who just got back from Puerto Rico Matt one of the crew
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:31.640]  members who I try to make it on air all the time this guy is like a super talk
[03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:34.920]  shows behind the scenes he gets on air gets a little bit nervous so does that
[03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:40.320]  that doesn't stumble over his words he just slows down real slow to make sure
[03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:45.640]  he's saying it right and then Matt kind of stumbles over it but behind the scenes
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:49.240]  he's better talk shows than I am and just as smart as we are smarter he's like
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.900]  hey alex make the point but I don't want to plagiarize it he wants me to make
[03:00:52.900 --> 03:00:56.800]  these points but I'm teleprompter free so this is not my brain saying this he
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:02.640]  said this he's like alex notice we played it earlier governor brown will
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:05.880]  give you prison time if you're a health care provider and you don't use the
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:12.400]  weird GZ whatever the new thing is for a Facebook says there's 50 new sexes I
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:17.080]  mean we don't learn reading writing and arithmetic we but we learn all this he'll
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:23.760]  give you more jail time for not using a tranny's proper name or trend sexual's
[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:28.920]  proper name then they will if you give somebody HIV knowingly and they go but
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:34.440]  it's liberal we're gonna try to kill you or give blood so I said to Matt just
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:38.240]  come on here and say he goes no no no you do it but that's a great point
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:42.200]  government yeah people's feelings are more important to the California
[03:01:42.200 --> 03:01:46.160]  government and giving someone AIDS and possibly killing them and then that is
[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:51.080]  the key to the entire situation they take your real rights to privacy to
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:56.520]  money to property to your own world and they give you feelings they give you
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:02.080]  lingo they give you a new language exactly yeah here's the words you're
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:05.880]  allowed to use here's the preferred pronouns but no when it comes to actual
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:08.960]  things that matter they don't care they've already destroyed the family in
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:13.760]  California they've already banned guns essentially you don't I mean I've said
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:16.880]  this the only hypothesis that makes sense is there's some interdimensional
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:22.280]  alien breakthrough that is channeling into these leftists because everything I
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:27.480]  do destroy the atmosphere with Kim trailing destroy the family GMO you know
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:32.760]  attack the attack men and women attack giving birth just everything they do is
[03:02:32.760 --> 03:02:38.040]  what an alien attack would do if it was like a psychic takeover like a mind hack
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:41.960]  you think of hack of computers but a hack of the mind and I'm not saying
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:45.840]  that's what's happening I just hypothesis wise you look at the Bible and
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.800]  every other the ancient Vedic text of the Indians they talked about sometimes
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:54.040]  whole cities would go crazy and just start killing each other and it's like
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:58.440]  is this like beamed in from Saturn it's a slow kill the stuff they're putting in
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:02.480]  the water you know it's one thing after another and cumulatively they will
[03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:09.560]  destroy us but I mean Jerry Brown is literally spreading HIV and hepatitis
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:14.240]  everywhere and literally waging war on California and trying to bankrupt it and
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:20.000]  trying to play I mean it what is he demon I mean like the rest of these
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:26.840]  people they worship and celebrate evil and it's like avatar it's like you're
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:29.520]  walking down the street in Seattle somebody looks totally normal it's like
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:35.800]  agent Smith's I'm sitting they go they're walking on it and you go the
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:39.040]  next street and some woman doesn't and you're like dude something's going on
[03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:42.760]  it's like something jacks in and that's what it does it like hops around like a
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:45.920]  lizard they these people look different the ones that have been totally
[03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:48.960]  brainwashed you can see it in their face you can see it in their eyes they have
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:53.240]  no life to them the one who threw coffee on you a homeless guy right after was
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:57.000]  like oh man Alex you know I'm sorry that guy had a life in him he even confessed
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  to us he walked to breakfast with us and got breakfast with us that morning this
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:05.520]  guy was addicted to heroin he's homeless but he said I said I realized
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:11.320]  Seattle is all a giant temple to suck souls yeah that guy had more soul in
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:15.560]  him even though he was suffering with drug addiction and things like that in
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:20.840]  this potbelly goblin creature who's just how can I be evil he actually went

[03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:47.720]  like what happened here hey we don't know what's going on we're trying to
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:50.880]  figure it out we want to save these people and we know the enemy hates us the
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:55.880]  New York Times YouTube wants to shut down you know someone very profoundly once
[03:04:55.880 --> 03:04:59.560]  said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America it'll come in the

[03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:34.480]  entertaining I cannot get enough of watching Alex Jones here on info wars.com
[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:41.320]  my god a few things have transpired since I was last here and I want to focus
[03:06:41.320 --> 03:06:47.920]  first on on Hollywood Hollywood you know that wonderful place that gives us the
[03:06:47.920 --> 03:06:57.400]  gifts of entertainment we we spend how much time do you think we spend watching
[03:06:57.400 --> 03:07:06.120]  the the product that comes out of that town think about this we like to think
[03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:14.040]  we would love to think that sitting down and watching the product movies
[03:07:14.040 --> 03:07:20.280]  television shows even advertising to some extent that comes out of that world
[03:07:20.280 --> 03:07:25.280]  and we would love to think it's there for our entertainment that's it right
[03:07:25.280 --> 03:07:33.840]  these amazing people put together these amazing movies and fantasy scenarios and
[03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:39.080]  and we get to escape from our drab little lives for a little while don't we
[03:07:39.080 --> 03:07:48.080]  and it's fun and we spend a hell of a lot of time absorbing what they're putting
[03:07:48.080 --> 03:07:54.800]  out and I don't use that word accidentally we absorb what they put out
[03:07:54.800 --> 03:08:01.240]  and boy I I might sound like a giant hypocrite with what I'm gonna say because
[03:08:01.240 --> 03:08:10.440]  I probably spend more time watching their product than most people I know I love
[03:08:10.440 --> 03:08:16.400]  it I sit my ass in front of a television set or I in front of a movie screen and
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:28.400]  I love it so much fun but look look at the community of people I use that term
[03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:35.440]  loosely that are putting this stuff together and putting it out there every
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:45.840]  every year I guess we could look at it that way we see what degenerates these
[03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:53.280]  these people are that are putting out the stuff this product of theirs that we
[03:08:53.280 --> 03:09:02.040]  cannot get enough of we sit down eyes and ears open absorbing absorbing
[03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:07.600]  everything they're putting out there and again entertainment isn't sure it's
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:14.080]  entertaining but if you don't think that there is some type of agenda that is
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:22.000]  being thrown into your face on a daily basis from this this hive of scum and
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:27.360]  villainy that is and I use that from a movie hive of scum and villainy that is
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:32.200]  Hollywood you're out of your mind you're out of your mind if you don't think
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:41.080]  that this sick perverse town is pumping out propaganda on a daily basis because
[03:09:41.080 --> 03:09:46.880]  they know you are locked into it and can be influenced by it you're out of your
[03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:56.000]  mind this town for years for years has been known to be what it is it's a
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:05.320]  collection of extremely disturbed people with this sick ideology and this want
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:11.120]  and need for some reason to deconstruct everything that has made the
[03:10:11.120 --> 03:10:16.960]  country this country great over the course of history every institution that
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:25.400]  we have that has any type of moral value to it has to be destroyed and
[03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:33.840]  deconstructed by this this town this Hollywood town it's been glamorized over
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:41.280]  the course of probably a century right I would guess glamorized as a place that
[03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:47.640]  you know regular people I aren't allowed in you're not allowed in we watch all
[03:10:47.640 --> 03:10:52.640]  their award shows on television we hear about their their personal lives and we
[03:10:52.640 --> 03:10:57.840]  see where they live and where they're entertained we're not allowed there this
[03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:04.440]  is a private little club such a small little enclave of these people that
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:14.120]  have that have the ability to influence everyone else with their agenda driven
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:21.680]  propaganda and if you look at the history of this it's been the same for
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:28.480]  many years deconstruct and break down the value system that has made this
[03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:33.680]  country great and there are so many reasons why this would happen an end
[03:11:33.680 --> 03:11:39.600]  game I guess you'd call it and I honestly don't know what that end game is I
[03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:46.120]  have some ideas I have some ideas I think American exceptionalism is one
[03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:53.800]  thing they don't like that they want a more global society but I honestly have
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:12:00.680]  to believe that there are just some sick people there are some sick perverse
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:10.840]  people that have figured out how to to operate in relative safety in numbers
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:17.960]  by by giving us something that we somehow cannot live without this
[03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:24.520]  escapism and fantasy so they all get together they live these pretty perverse
[03:12:24.520 --> 03:12:32.280]  lifestyles they have a hatred for what has has made this country great and they
[03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:40.600]  do things with relative impunity and of course I talk about Harvey Weinstein the
[03:12:40.600 --> 03:12:45.840]  latest in this collection of degenerates that has been exposed and
[03:12:45.840 --> 03:12:54.080]  that's it he's been exposed this this has been going on for decades with this
[03:12:54.080 --> 03:13:00.760]  guy Hollywood knew this was going on so when you hear all of these people all
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:06.920]  the sudden coming out Kate Beckinsale I avoided Harvey Weinstein come on when
[03:13:06.920 --> 03:13:12.720]  I was 17 by saying I had school in the morning I mean and these are this is one
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:18.160]  story of just literally hundreds that are coming out about Harvey Weinstein but
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:22.160]  if you think for a second these stories are coming out because people all the
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:28.280]  sudden found out again stop open your eyes open your eyes and ears like you
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:32.280]  do when you're sucking in that propaganda that they put on movie and TV
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:38.280]  screens open wide because if you think for a second they didn't know everything
[03:13:38.280 --> 03:13:44.520]  that was going on with this guy you're out of your mind our own a president of
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:53.440]  Barack Obama the last one not the good one Barack Obama sent his own daughter
[03:13:53.440 --> 03:14:00.640]  to work at the Weinstein corporation there the Weinstein company knowing
[03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:06.040]  you're not going to tell me that the president of the United States did not
[03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:13.720]  know that Harvey Weinstein was a complete serial predator and degenerate
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:21.560]  disgusted Barack and Michelle Obama are disgusted by what they read about Harvey
[03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:27.160]  Weinstein you mean to tell me Hollywood knew everyone knew popular
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:34.800]  culture their own industry made jokes about it on award shows on 30 rock on
[03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:41.040]  family guy it was the scuttle butt of the town because they're all like this

[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:49.800]  and the focus right now Hollywood Hollywood is just a giant tumor on this
[03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:55.720]  country it is it does go it makes perfect sense that it resides in the sick
[03:21:55.720 --> 03:22:02.320]  state of California by the way as alex was talking about just before the fact
[03:22:02.320 --> 03:22:12.480]  that you could go to jail for using an improper what do they call it an
[03:22:12.480 --> 03:22:23.560]  improper label pronoun pronoun that's it pronoun for LGBT next why is he you could
[03:22:23.560 --> 03:22:30.920]  actually go to jail for that in certain circumstances yet yet if you give somebody
[03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:36.520]  AIDS if you know that you have AIDS and then you transmit that through a sexual
[03:22:36.520 --> 03:22:43.160]  sexual contact that's fine California says that's fine you knowingly exposed
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:49.240]  others HIV gets no longer felony in California to give someone a death
[03:22:49.240 --> 03:22:55.240]  sentence is no longer felony but pairs the thought you say him or her when
[03:22:55.240 --> 03:23:00.200]  somebody feels like a her or him oh boy that's trouble it makes perfect sense
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:07.160]  please please San Andreas fault if you're listening if the San Andreas fault is
[03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:12.880]  listening could you please shake rattle and roll that state right into the
[03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:20.080]  Pacific could you do us a favor here Hollywood is just a glamour central
[03:23:20.080 --> 03:23:26.760]  glitter city Tinseltown and it is one of the sickest places on the face of the
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:34.200]  earth and if you don't see the fear also we talk about the the sickness the
[03:23:34.200 --> 03:23:40.760]  depravity the propaganda that is being pumped out of Hollywood but we we rarely
[03:23:40.760 --> 03:23:48.080]  talk about the utter and complete fear that it just envelops Hollywood people
[03:23:48.080 --> 03:23:56.920]  are petrified to speak out about what's going on in that town I guess Rose
[03:23:56.920 --> 03:24:04.640]  McGowan Rose McGowan you might have seen her she she was in Charmed I guess
[03:24:04.640 --> 03:24:11.080]  Charmed she went out for a little while with Marilyn Manson and she's been in a
[03:24:11.080 --> 03:24:17.520]  few things a few movies from Tarantino who by the way Miramax did his movies
[03:24:17.520 --> 03:24:24.240]  by the way was run by the Weinstein's at the time it all comes together it all
[03:24:24.240 --> 03:24:31.960]  it's the biggest incestuous sick stew that has been on the on the stove brewing
[03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:40.400]  for decades so Rose McGowan has been tweeting a lot about Weinstein about
[03:24:40.400 --> 03:24:46.400]  Weinstein's cronies about the this this whole thing that goes on in Hollywood
[03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:55.520]  with sexual abuse and powerful people perpetrating crimes against other
[03:24:55.520 --> 03:25:00.520]  people using their dreams I guess against them everyone has a dream of
[03:25:00.520 --> 03:25:06.480]  being a star so Rose McGowan has come out and calling out people like Matt Damon
[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:13.560]  like Casey and Ben Affleck who of course worked with Weinstein but again they
[03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:20.640]  never knew everyone knew but no one knew what was going on in Hollywood isn't it
[03:25:20.640 --> 03:25:26.320]  amazing isn't amazing so now they all come out they're apologizing left and
[03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:30.960]  right but they're doing it publicly if you really wanted to apologize for
[03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:34.080]  someone wouldn't you just do it privately well it doesn't help if you do
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:39.800]  it privately yeah there's which look I'm not in Rose McGowan's camp either she's
[03:25:39.800 --> 03:25:45.000]  a tad bit of a hypocrite you dress like that and I gotta tell you there's gonna
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:50.400]  be some issues with guys maybe maybe getting the wrong idea wrong idea
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:56.120]  perhaps but of course you'd call me you know victim blaming if you look at a
[03:25:56.120 --> 03:26:00.280]  woman out in public like that go ah maybe a guy's gonna say something to you
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:05.440]  that you might not appreciate but again that's the sickness that goes on I
[03:26:05.440 --> 03:26:11.160]  really fear for her life she's calling out a lot of people a lot of powerful
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:16.920]  people others are petrified to do it why just because they won't get work that's
[03:26:16.920 --> 03:26:23.120]  probably part of it but I wouldn't put it past these sick individuals especially
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:28.280]  those in very high places in Hollywood to get rid of people to literally
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:36.560]  dispose of people Twitter figuratively killed off Rose McGowan I guess they
[03:26:36.560 --> 03:26:41.640]  didn't like what she was saying about some powerful people and Ben Affleck
[03:26:41.640 --> 03:26:46.400]  she dropped the F bomb in one of her tweets about Ben Affleck and her Twitter
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:51.040]  account has been frozen I know what this is like Twitter YouTube a lot of these
[03:26:51.040 --> 03:26:57.800]  places just cannot take the truth they do not like the truth when it reflects
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:03.320]  poorly on all of the different industries that weave together and the
[03:27:03.320 --> 03:27:08.960]  powerful people that run them yeah Rose McGowan Twitter account locked after
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:14.760]  post about Weinstein and Affleck and Matt Damon and then we have another thing
[03:27:14.760 --> 03:27:19.760]  Corey Feldman a couple of years back was talking about Elijah Wood and the
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:27.200]  Hollywood pedophilia controversy there's apparently a huge pedophilia problem
[03:27:27.200 --> 03:27:34.040]  in Hollywood and of course Corey Feldman he was teamed up for many years with
[03:27:34.040 --> 03:27:41.080]  Corey Hame when they were youngsters in Hollywood and the stories of pedophilia
[03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:47.600]  running rampant in Hollywood these powerful men stories of parties and
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:56.960]  and these these young boys just being thrown in to these sick men to have
[03:27:56.960 --> 03:28:05.000]  their way with them and Corey Feldman will not mention names if you see
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:08.760]  something like this going on that literally led to the death of one of
[03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:14.960]  his friends Corey Hame who had a problem with drug abuse wound up dying a very
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:22.880]  early age and and he has said that it's a direct result of the assaults that
[03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:28.560]  happened to him in his youth but he won't even say who the who's what's and
[03:28:28.560 --> 03:28:32.760]  when's because he's petrified think about that why would you be that scared
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:36.040]  especially if you're Corey Feldman it's not like you're missing work it's not
[03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:40.200]  like somebody's not gonna give you a gig haven't worked in years but he's scared

[03:30:59.800 --> 03:31:03.960]  five years doing more and more research I came across the fact that the elite
[03:31:03.960 --> 03:31:08.680]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many
[03:31:08.680 --> 03:31:13.080]  cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors
[03:31:13.080 --> 03:31:17.600]  sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then
[03:31:17.600 --> 03:31:21.800]  processing and so I set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[03:33:32.800 --> 03:33:42.120]  Washington man to do politicians love celebrities don't they how many pictures
[03:33:42.120 --> 03:33:51.960]  have we seen of politicians with Harvey Weinstein and the they they seem to go
[03:33:51.960 --> 03:33:57.640]  hand-in-hand you watch these award shows and all you see are celebrities getting
[03:33:57.640 --> 03:34:02.680]  up there and giving their their political views which I think I could go out on a
[03:34:02.680 --> 03:34:09.960]  limb and say a little left-leaning just a little left-leaning we saw Eminem the
[03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:17.720]  other day oh my god was this embarrassing I'm on Twitter and I see
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:25.320]  oh Eminem really wow did he just tear up Donald Trump oh my god look out he's
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:32.200]  back shady's back and he's gonna he's tearing up Donald Trump so I'm like all
[03:34:32.200 --> 03:34:38.920]  right I'll watch this right from the get-go it was so embarrassing first of
[03:34:38.920 --> 03:34:44.920]  all he's he's what mid 40s now he's like 44 something like that and there he is in
[03:34:44.920 --> 03:34:51.920]  yeah he's in a like a parking garage with some like thuggish dudes behind him
[03:34:51.920 --> 03:34:57.880]  and stuff like this might work if you're in your your 20s still it just kind of
[03:34:57.880 --> 03:35:02.800]  looks silly at this point that this guy in his mid 40s it's like when you see
[03:35:02.800 --> 03:35:07.680]  guys in their mid 40s like skateboarding all right if you enjoy it and
[03:35:07.680 --> 03:35:14.200]  everything that's one thing that's fine but don't make that your thing don't go
[03:35:14.200 --> 03:35:17.800]  out into public and make it your thing because you're kind of gonna look silly
[03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:26.080]  so when you get Eminem up there and he's he's spitting some rhymes yo it comes off
[03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:31.920]  looking very silly and the whole gist of this thing was how awful and terrible
[03:35:31.920 --> 03:35:40.600]  Donald Trump is he's with the bravery the bravery of Eminem to come out against
[03:35:40.600 --> 03:35:47.840]  Donald Trump at a time like this it could be the the hackiest thing people
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:54.440]  do in the entertainment industry and now is to do any material about Donald
[03:35:54.440 --> 03:36:00.200]  Trump I personally don't get it whether you like or don't like Donald Trump's
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:06.800]  policies whether you think he's not that smart or or not a good speaker or
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:12.320]  anything you could have all these opinions about him but I've yet to get a
[03:36:12.320 --> 03:36:19.040]  rational answer from anyone on the left what he's done so wrong and what his
[03:36:19.040 --> 03:36:27.440]  motivations are for for becoming the president and doing the job of the
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:36.440]  president because I see this I see a man who who got very wealthy and successful
[03:36:36.440 --> 03:36:41.640]  utilizing the opportunities that are given everyone in this country did he
[03:36:41.640 --> 03:36:47.920]  have a father that gave him money I know that that's a big issue sure do some
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:55.000]  people start out with a little more than others on their road to success indeed
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:01.400]  they do that's part of the the freedoms of this country not everyone starts out
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:07.240]  the same not everyone ends up the same some people use a more skill than luck
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:11.440]  with others it's the other way around that's the amazing thing about this
[03:37:11.440 --> 03:37:19.000]  country is that there is the possibility for anyone to do well you're not just
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:29.560]  born and thrust into a rice patty or or put a soldering together iPhones knowing
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:34.080]  that that's gonna be your life and wherever you are that's what you're
[03:37:34.080 --> 03:37:38.960]  gonna continue doing till you drop dead no we have the opportunity in this
[03:37:38.960 --> 03:37:45.760]  country to do great things and all I see in our president Donald Trump is the
[03:37:45.760 --> 03:37:53.680]  the the want to to give that opportunity to everybody of course he's
[03:37:53.680 --> 03:37:59.000]  called racist all the time when I and I ask and I want a rational answer but I
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:06.880]  can never get it what has he done that that shows what a racist he is for some
[03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:15.200]  reason for 35 40 years in the public eye was never called a racist I mean this
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:23.400]  guy's been on TV he's been a a contractor a builder for for decades no
[03:38:23.400 --> 03:38:29.000]  one ever called him a racist all the sudden he's a racist and of course M&M
[03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:37.240]  slams Trump and calls him a racist he's a sexist always sexist it's terrible
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:44.680]  he's a man who enjoys the company of pretty women you know that makes him a
[03:38:44.680 --> 03:38:50.680]  man that makes him a man or what a man used to be I believe you're not even
[03:38:50.680 --> 03:38:55.280]  allowed to do that anymore but the accusations that I see from the left
[03:38:55.280 --> 03:39:01.400]  coming out about Donald Trump they never have a rational discussion with me
[03:39:01.400 --> 03:39:08.280]  about why he's labeled these things did he say some inappropriate stuff sure if
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:14.360]  you look at what men talk about as inappropriate stuff because that's all
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:20.280]  he was doing anyone that says different again is lying many men talk this way
[03:39:20.280 --> 03:39:26.360]  about women and their sex ploits over the years guys will discuss things like
[03:39:26.360 --> 03:39:30.960]  that but I see a president in Donald Trump that just wants to make things
[03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:36.600]  better for this country and he is he's doing just that but the left can't take
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:42.960]  it so the likes of M&M and a lot of these actors and actresses that are
[03:39:42.960 --> 03:39:50.440]  crying I've seen genuine tears come out of people's eyes when they just talk
[03:39:50.440 --> 03:39:54.640]  about Donald Trump I was watching a clip the other day it was hilarious I guess
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:40:01.160]  it was some antifa people and some some gentlemen from info wars was was
[03:40:01.160 --> 03:40:06.320]  questioning some of these people asking about Donald Trump and what these
[03:40:06.320 --> 03:40:14.040]  people were even protesting a woman ran away ran away from the microphone from
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:20.400]  this gentleman's inquiry in tears and I'm just laughing my ass off at this
[03:40:20.400 --> 03:40:27.520]  point because that really epitomizes what they're all about they give you no
[03:40:27.520 --> 03:40:32.960]  answers you cannot get a straight answer yeah this is this is so look at this
[03:40:32.960 --> 03:40:39.800]  girl right here look at the one in the in the back she's already choking up and
[03:40:39.800 --> 03:40:51.440]  she runs off crying it's astounding but that epitomizes what what we we see when
[03:40:51.440 --> 03:40:57.920]  when the left is addressing politics and Donald Trump and what they want they
[03:40:57.920 --> 03:41:03.880]  scream about impeachment we see maxine waters constantly now screaming about
[03:41:03.880 --> 03:41:12.160]  impeachment this woman is out of her mind out of her mind and she's screaming
[03:41:12.160 --> 03:41:18.200]  about impeachment when there's nothing that indicates that this president can
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:24.320]  legally be impeached yet it's her her mantra now it's her battle cry that we
[03:41:24.320 --> 03:41:29.960]  need to impeach Donald Trump and then again you ask these people why for what
[03:41:29.960 --> 03:41:39.000]  and they have no reason whatsoever aside from my feels my emos are hurt and
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:45.640]  then you dig a little deeper well can you give me an exam and they run off in
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:54.200]  tears you have to laugh you have to laugh I'm wondering if after a few more
[03:41:54.200 --> 03:42:00.720]  years I'll start actually feeling sorry for them we're almost at a year people
[03:42:00.720 --> 03:42:08.680]  we are almost at the one year mark where we recall the first real tears of the
[03:42:08.680 --> 03:42:15.320]  left in the Javits Center when Hillary Rodham Clinton did not show up to
[03:42:15.320 --> 03:42:22.200]  console her people after the election I can't believe it's almost been a year
[03:42:22.200 --> 03:42:27.760]  next month the beginning of next month is a year and the tears have not stopped
[03:42:27.760 --> 03:42:35.240]  it's been a year-long cry fest you ever see a child having a temper tantrum in a
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:40.360]  store they don't want to be there with mommy or something and they cry imagine
[03:42:40.360 --> 03:42:45.440]  that kid kicking and screaming and crying on the floor for a year and it's
[03:42:45.440 --> 03:42:49.040]  not gonna end we're gonna see this temper tantrum for at least three more
[03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:56.480]  years perhaps even longer I hope we'll be back December 23rd 1776 these are the
[03:42:56.480 --> 03:43:00.960]  times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot Wheel
[03:43:00.960 --> 03:43:04.720]  in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by
[03:43:04.720 --> 03:43:10.000]  it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:13.600]  easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of
[03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:17.680]  the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we
[03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:22.360]  esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives everything its value heaven
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:26.960]  knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if
[03:43:26.960 --> 03:43:31.760]  so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated Britain with an
[03:43:31.760 --> 03:43:36.440]  army to enforce her tyranny has declared that she has a right not only to tax but
[03:43:36.440 --> 03:43:40.840]  to bind us in all cases whatsoever and if being bound in that matter is not
[03:43:40.840 --> 03:43:45.240]  slavery then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth even the expression

[03:48:46.120 --> 03:48:50.960]  happened that's probably what happened I'm kind of one of those guys I am it's
[03:48:50.960 --> 03:48:59.560]  very tough to convince me that something is different than what obviously
[03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:09.240]  could have happened I do not feel this way about the Las Vegas shooting something
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:18.960]  is amiss with this entire story of course we we we know Steven Steven
[03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:26.840]  Patek there it is Occam's razor yeah it's just it's it's whatever the obvious
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:31.760]  explanation is is is pretty much what it is another way say the more yeah the
[03:49:31.760 --> 03:49:37.080]  more subject you have to make the more unlikely an explanation is and I believe
[03:49:37.080 --> 03:49:43.720]  in this I I think I adhere to this more than not but again this situation in Las
[03:49:43.720 --> 03:49:52.680]  Vegas is bizarre I don't know why more people aren't talking about this and I
[03:49:52.680 --> 03:49:56.640]  honestly think when you have something like we do with social media these days
[03:49:56.640 --> 03:50:05.280]  you would think that the the ability to exchange ideas and and evidence and
[03:50:05.280 --> 03:50:11.480]  explanations would make us look into these things more question more things
[03:50:11.480 --> 03:50:18.960]  but for some reason our our our ability to to concentrate on any one thing for
[03:50:18.960 --> 03:50:25.440]  any longer than maybe a few days has screwed us up we're on to the next thing
[03:50:25.440 --> 03:50:32.760]  well I'm kind of hanging out on this one because a nothing makes sense there
[03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:40.680]  is so many loose ends with this story of course the the official story is that
[03:50:40.680 --> 03:50:49.360]  Steven Patek went up into his room and started shooting out the window at a
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:54.040]  concert killed a bunch of people wounded a bunch of others shot himself end of
[03:50:54.040 --> 03:51:00.560]  story nothing's nothing is making sense on this one the timeline is now
[03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:07.600]  different he supposedly shot a security guard after he shot a bunch of the
[03:51:07.600 --> 03:51:16.200]  the concertgoers and that tipped off the police who then came in breached the door
[03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:21.720]  he had killed himself that's the story well now they're saying that Steven
[03:51:21.720 --> 03:51:28.560]  Patek shot the security guard before he unloaded on the crowd how do you make
[03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:37.000]  that mistake and how does that go unexplained or unresolved for days for
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:42.280]  days and days on end all of a sudden the story changes and and is completely
[03:51:42.280 --> 03:51:51.960]  different how is it that Steven Patek's house gets broken into the other day
[03:51:51.960 --> 03:51:57.160]  someone broke into his house through the front door they don't know who they
[03:51:57.160 --> 03:52:03.400]  didn't catch anyone they got no leads it completely contaminates his house and
[03:52:03.400 --> 03:52:08.200]  you might think well the FBI obviously searched his house well hypothetically
[03:52:08.200 --> 03:52:14.640]  what if another piece of evidence leads them to need to look a little closer
[03:52:14.640 --> 03:52:22.680]  inside this guy's house all of a sudden anything you find or don't find is
[03:52:22.680 --> 03:52:30.480]  possibly tainted how did that happen and why there are so many loose ends to
[03:52:30.480 --> 03:52:37.800]  this story reports of multiple gunmen sound analysis of the shots that imply
[03:52:37.800 --> 03:52:44.520]  that there were multiple gunmen why so many guns in the room and the biggest
[03:52:44.520 --> 03:52:50.120]  thing I've been to Las Vegas I've been to Atlantic City I've been to other
[03:52:50.120 --> 03:52:58.160]  places where there are casinos could possibly be the most surveilled place
[03:52:58.160 --> 03:53:06.760]  places on the face of the earth there is is I have yet to see one frame of this
[03:53:06.760 --> 03:53:13.240]  guy I've seen maybe two pictures one where he looks pretty goofy and another
[03:53:13.240 --> 03:53:17.080]  one where he's in a bar I think but these were pictures that people took of
[03:53:17.080 --> 03:53:25.360]  him I've yet to see one frame of surveillance footage of this gentleman
[03:53:25.360 --> 03:53:36.640]  yet in 2001 we saw the next day after 9-11 we saw Mohammed Atta going through
[03:53:36.640 --> 03:53:47.040]  security at Logan Airport and in 2017 at a casino I have yet to see one frame
[03:53:47.040 --> 03:53:56.760]  of this guy again I don't know what that means but it sure means something I don't
[03:53:56.760 --> 03:54:06.600]  understand why we're not getting more information from the police from the FBI
[03:54:06.600 --> 03:54:13.720]  why who is this guy what was the motivation why does he have this
[03:54:13.720 --> 03:54:19.720]  Philippines connection we don't hear any more about the money he said we hear
[03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:26.560]  this insanity from his brother and all of it just gets swept away and then
[03:54:26.560 --> 03:54:33.560]  we're all you know hashtag Harvey Weinstein and hashtag Vegas shooting
[03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:42.840]  gets thrown in the bin with Coney 2012 we really need people like Alex Jones
[03:54:42.840 --> 03:54:51.240]  and info wars to stick to this story and try to get some kind of answers it
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:59.560]  doesn't it's not making sense we've I'm certain we've seen instances of actual
[03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:05.880]  lunatics for no reason then they're insane that have gone and murdered
[03:55:05.880 --> 03:55:13.200]  people and taken their own life or what have you this does not look like that
[03:55:13.200 --> 03:55:20.720]  there's way too much going on here that we're not getting an explanation for you
[03:55:20.720 --> 03:55:25.560]  know the things we know and don't know what happened in the six minutes after
[03:55:25.560 --> 03:55:31.880]  the hotel security guard was shot well the police have their theory but it
[03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:39.840]  doesn't jive with with other timelines of the shooting why weren't there the
[03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:44.440]  number of shell casings there should have been why did this guy take his life
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:53.640]  apparently before the police were even alerted to where he was was he the only
[03:55:53.640 --> 03:55:59.120]  one in the room how did he get all those guns up why take so many guns he
[03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:05.000]  didn't use every gun why have so many guns in that room was he supposed to
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:12.600]  meet somebody or some other a group of people wasn't an arms deal gone bad did
[03:56:12.600 --> 03:56:19.720]  he get converted to something all right Islam over the course of some of his
[03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:30.800]  travels his airplane at a government site like none of this is your run-of-the-mill
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:36.880]  if I could say that shooting by just some some lunatic they actually checked
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:40.680]  his brain out too isn't that sick they cut him open you know they checked his
[03:56:40.680 --> 03:56:45.640]  brain out and apparently nothing in there that indicated he had any medical
[03:56:45.640 --> 03:56:54.760]  problems that would have led him to just snap and do that so again I I strongly
[03:56:54.760 --> 03:57:02.200]  suggest we we pay attention to this and keep tabs on what is and and sometimes
[03:57:02.200 --> 03:57:10.160]  more importantly what isn't being said by law enforcement to the people and when
[03:57:10.160 --> 03:57:18.680]  you see something pop up like the Weinstein thing that distracts us don't
[03:57:18.680 --> 03:57:24.760]  be so distracted keep your eyes and ears open all the time Anthony Kumi you can
