[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:24.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.000]  I'll tell you why I love DrugsReport.com.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  I'm sitting in here with my writers and reporters that are in the U.S.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  and my writers in England in a conference called 10 Minutes Before the Show.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  And I said, look at this Breitbart article on Drudge with the secret document confirmed, accurate,
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  out of the U.S. Border Patrol's secret committee.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  Leaked CBP report, the highest level of the Border Patrol,
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  showing entire world exploiting open U.S. border, buried in the report,
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  is dozens of people caught in the last month, sneaking in from a bolus trick in countries.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  I literally look at Kit Daniels at Don Salazar, and this is normal to have in a newsroom.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  We have a newsroom here as well.
[01:12.000 --> 01:21.000]  And Kurt Nemo, and I said, here's a bunch of the important news and angles here
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  that no one's reporting on. Who wants to go with A, B, and C?
[01:24.000 --> 01:35.000]  And Kit Daniels said, I want to go with scores of illegals from Ebola countries caught crossing border.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  Drudge refreshes in front of me as we go live,
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  and he changed the headline linking from Breitbart that said leaked,
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  CBC report shows entire world exploiting open U.S. border.
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  What did I see in this article? What did Kit Daniels see in the Border Patrol report
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  that I have in full right here?
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  The secret report that came out last week, the Drudge got, Breitbart got.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  I see the Ebola countries, Drudge sees the Ebola countries,
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  and gives the Breitbart headline what it should be.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  And we'll now make their article go mega viral, which it should.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  We need to expose the fact that the border's wide open while the police state's being used against us.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  But see, that's why I like the Drudge report.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  Because Drudge is probably twice as good as I am at understanding what's important.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  And I, after Drudge, I have to say probably know more than most people.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  I mean, I can look at an article, see what's really important in it to me and my family,
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  and then that's what I go with.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  My bias is justice. My bias is telling the truth.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  My bias is the borders are wide open, and they've got people from Ebola countries able to get in.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  And so many times I see an article and buried in it is the big enchilada.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  Buried in it is the $64 million answer.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Buried in it is the bombshell info.
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  I told Watson yesterday, big bombshell info, that he raised on air, and I said, dude, that's the headline.
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  And the story isn't up on infowars.com yet, but it will be.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  So by the end of the show today, we're going to have some big breaking news.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  I would announce a lot of this now. It's not that I even want the scoop.
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  It's that if I give this info out now, disinfo operatives, even from the White House on record,
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  will come out with spin ahead of what we're about to put out trying to stop us trying to save this country
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  and secure our borders and secure our republic.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  So we're going to launch major truth bombshells. We were going to launch that one.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  I said, look, give the Breitbart article credit, give the credit to the report,
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  and then just, you know, rewrite it with our headline that we've got dozens and dozens and dozens of illegals
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  crossing at the southern border from Ebola countries. Boom.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  Five minutes later, it pops up.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  What's the saying? Great minds think alike? I'm not saying I have some great mind,
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  but boy, I'll tell you, compared to the average person, I guess I do.
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  That's quite a scary thing to come to grips with when you realize when it comes to street savvy and news savvy
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  and basic understanding that you know more than almost anybody.
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  And, you know, in your field, it's a creepy feeling and you want to teach others
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  and you want to see others excel past you and become greater than you are.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  It's like that line in full metal jacket, which is based on real training in the 1960s in the Marine Corps,
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  where it said, you know, in the final days of boot camp, our instructors were very happy to see
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  that we were, you know, our youthful energy basically raging past them and even surpassing them.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  Because, of course, they're 35, 40 years old. They're not as young and vicious anymore.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  And so now the instructors are in awe of what they've created.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  We'll be right back. That's what I'm looking for.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  That's true leadership is creating another generation to promote liberty.
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.000]  Durga, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  about a potential for-hood situation?
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  Here we go, folks. I'm being a sergeant.
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news,
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  In Fall Wars is the tip of the spear.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  Is this another false-flight stage attack to take on civil liberties
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  and promote homely and security by sticking a hands-down run against on the streets?
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  against the so-called rebels.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  Visit infowarsnews.com today.
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[06:01.000 --> 06:07.000]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  I just received my mail vitality about three days ago, and I must say that was good stuff.
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others,
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic supermail vitality formula.
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  Supermail vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  I look forward to waking up and taking my supermail vitality and get the day started.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  It's not just the supermail vitality.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  All the products in infowarslife.com are simply amazing.
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your supermail vitality
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  get healthy and detoxify.
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful,
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  I'm going to come out with rare earth and deep earth crystals.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  The radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.000]  We've got it.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  Thank you for coming to you.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  All right, you are a ghost.
[08:11.000 --> 08:17.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is unprecedented for any major western government
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  to openly take someone with something as deadly as Ebola into their country.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Germany has now done it with Ebola patients, shows the United States.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a scythe to create terror and to fear monger
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  and to bring in a greater medical tyranny, bottom line.
[08:46.000 --> 08:53.000]  But the issue is, even old bioweapons labs that were off the U.S. coast like Plum Island
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  infected the United States with weaponized tick-borne syphilis
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  that the public knows as Lyme's disease to the syphilis family on record.
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  And that's where it came from, that zoological bioweapons lab.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  So the point is, this stuff can and will get out.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  But now, they're just bringing it directly to a hospital, and I looked the hospital up.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  It's got level two containment where they have a special wing.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  Level four is what bioweapon hazards like Ebola are supposed to be in.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  Underground, with minefields around it, machine gun nests.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  If it gets out inside the facility, they hit a button, and the place burns down.
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  Huge canisters of natural gas are released, like torches, and everything is burned to the ground.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  Okay? It's supposed to be underground.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  Now, this is about a government and a political system that doesn't care about the people as well,
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  that are flirting with disaster.
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  You've all seen the headlines about a FedEx truck crashing, and it had weaponized flu on it
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  that kills over 90% of people that come in contact with it seven years ago.
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  You see headlines where universities in the U.S. and Europe
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  release the ingredients list on how to produce airborne mouse pox for humans
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  that kills 97 to 98% of people, even worse than Ebola, that kills about 91%.
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  So again, why are the elites suddenly just putting the designs for stuff like this out on the Internet?
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  They want plausible deniability down the road when the eugenicists, the globalist,
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  carry out a 12 monkey-type scenario.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  And they're on record talking about that.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  Dr. Erick Pionka, right here at UT in Austin, talks about how they need airborne Ebola
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  to kill 90% of the world's population to save the Earth.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  So that's clearly what's happening.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  But regardless of why they're doing it, this is endangering the public.
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  This is in precedent setting, and they never acted like this or did this before.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  So you've got to ask yourself, why is that happening?
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  Let's look at these headlines.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  Ebola patient walks into Atlanta Hospital CNN.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  American physician with Ebola virus arrives in Atlanta for treatment.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  What's it really all about?
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  Well, this story we put out last week went viral.
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  You'd think mainstream media would want to point it out.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  Obama signed an executive order to disappear American citizens if you even have a cough
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  and to basically lock you up in a prison.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  So they're using this to set the precedent for medical tyranny.
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  That's one of the reasons.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  Here's another one.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  Possible evacuation of Americans infected with Ebola triggers fears in U.S., okay?
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  And that's breaking down our report.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  They mention infowars.com in this report posted on the Fox site.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  If Ebola hits U.S., even healthy Americans will be quarantined.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  Well persons who do not show symptoms would be forcibly detained.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, our southern border is wide open right now,
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  but we're being told that that's okay and they're releasing sick people.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  But the American people themselves can be secretly locked up and disappeared.
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  This is all about a power grab, all about a sigh of the Ebola to set up the medical tyranny state.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  We'll report on all this tomorrow on the Sunday transmission.
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  4 to 6 p.m. Central, infowars.com, prisonplotter.com, follow us on Twitter at realalexjones.
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  And finally, this is all about the insanity of a system that's getting more and more reckless.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  90 plus percent of the reactors are now leaking.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  No one even cares about that.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  It's an elite that's so decadent they could care less.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  So it's more than just fear mongering.
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  It's also part of their nihilistic disconnection with reality, thinking they're invincible.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  Pride goes before a fall. Alex Jones signing off for infowars.com.
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  All right, I shot that Saturday afternoon.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  Then of course we had the syndicated Sunday broadcast.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  Yesterday we broke down the latest developments,
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  but I thought it was important to play that four and a half minute breakdown
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  before we got into the latest information.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.000]  I'll give you some of the background on exactly what we are facing and dealing with.
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.000]  Now, the report is up on infowars.com and prisonplotter.com.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  It's up on drudgereport.com as the top big superlink.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  It's Breitbart that obtained it.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  It has been confirmed to be from the highest levels of the U.S. Border Patrol,
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  Customs and Border Enforcement, Office of Intelligent and Investigative Liaison,
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  Trafficking and Smuggling Branch.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  Finds a giant increase in illegals of all types, 17%,
[13:39.000 --> 13:47.000]  just as our former head of the Border Patrol Union, now head of the retiree union,
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  just as he said on the show Friday of showing he's got access to the current intelligence,
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  17% are the minors under 18.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  The rest are adults and the minors are the flood to tie down the response.
[14:05.000 --> 14:15.000]  But Breitbart went with the angle of leaked CPB report shows entire world exploiting open U.S. Border.
[14:15.000 --> 14:22.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, that's important, but the big issue is the communicable diseases
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.000]  like drug-resistant TB, drug-resistant staff, drug-resistant strep, Ebola and things like that
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  that are already ravaging U.S. hospitals and ravaging world hospitals.
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  And again, it's already killed millions over the years in Latin America,
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  and so they have basically survived it, the people that are going to survive it.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Now we're being introduced to things that many of us are not going to survive.
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic or Asian.
[14:53.000 --> 15:05.000]  Again, this year, December into this year, December through January, I lost three close family members.
[15:05.000 --> 15:19.000]  Pat Lynn Simmons, William Hammond and Peter Hammond, and I called Pat Lynn my grand-uncle
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  because he always lived across the street from my grandmother and was my grandmother's sister's
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  firstborn son, like best friends with my dad.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  So I just called him Uncle Leonard, but he wasn't my uncle.
[15:31.000 --> 15:41.000]  But then my uncle, my mom's brother and her son died this year of drug-resistant standard bacteria in their lungs.
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.000]  And my uncle was not a smoker and played football for LSU and was in Vietnam in really good shape,
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  and it killed him better than a hammer.
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  And so when Geraldo Rivera says these diseases don't matter and then it's race-baiting, pure bull.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  They're now in the news saying, is the backlash against Ebola?
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  I saw this last night, anti-African.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  I guess we should all drink Ebola or we're against black people.
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  There is no end to how political correctness can be used.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  Don't like Obamacare and death panels, you're racist.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Oh, I love it.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  Don't want to turn your guns in, you're racist.
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  Oh, I love it.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  It's mind control.
[16:24.000 --> 16:34.000]  So in one month, 874 people, if you look at these statistics,
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.000]  we've got an expanded article being done by Kit Dales right now, came in from regions illegally were caught.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  This one was caught, and I think they caught, catch about 5%.
[16:43.000 --> 16:54.000]  Came in from regions, aka Africa that have Ebola.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  24 and then 18 caught coming in recently from countries that have it like Nigeria.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  That's just one country, Nigeria.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  And it goes through it.
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  It goes through the African countries like Ghana, 257.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  Before that, 290. That means thousands, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  This is all office of intelligence and investigative liaison.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  And this is restricted, by the way.
[17:22.000 --> 17:32.000]  But people inside the federal government are doing the right thing when you're faced with open, naked, country destroying treason.
[17:32.000 --> 17:39.000]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails and those that cried, appease, appease, are hung by those.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  They tried to please.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  I forget who said that.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  I think we looked it up last time and no one knows.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  A lot of famous people have quoted that.
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  That's from the Revolutionary War era. I know that.
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails.
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  And those that cried, appease, appease, are hung by those.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  They tried to please.
[18:02.000 --> 18:11.000]  And no one really knows, historically, why the traitors get killed by the elite even more than the people that fight the enemy.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  But we do know.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  The corrupt elite respect the good men and women that fight them.
[18:19.000 --> 18:26.000]  But under mafia rules throughout history, when you're already part of the club and you're a traitor that helped bring down good people,
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  do you think the group that comes in and takes over wants a bunch of traitors around?
[18:31.000 --> 18:40.000]  The first thing I do, if I was the new world order, would be get rid of the people that were traitors and sold good people out.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  You don't want them around anymore.
[18:42.000 --> 18:51.000]  What happened to Hitler's essay headed up by Ernst Rome, the goblin-like creature?
[18:51.000 --> 19:02.000]  They killed some estimates are as many as 50,000 of them in one night and another 50,000 or more over the next week.
[19:02.000 --> 19:09.000]  And Rome was under such mind control and probably Hitler's boyfriend was the main reason he was killed.
[19:09.000 --> 19:16.000]  That's come out that Rome was having sex with about half the upper echelon of the Nazi men.
[19:16.000 --> 19:23.000]  That as they took him in the jail cell and the SS came into shooting, he screamed,
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  Oh, I love you, my sweetie cake.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  Roughly translated from German.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  You think I'm joking.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  Look it up.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  Oh, I love you.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  My sweet pastry.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  I think it was translated.
[19:32.000 --> 19:33.000]  We would call it cupcake.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  I love you, my cupcake.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  Well, there you go.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  How Hitler, how Hitler, I love you, my cupcake after he was shot three times in the chest.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  Look it up.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  With Heinrich Himmler outside the door.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  The German royalty, a.k.a. the chicken farmer.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  We'll be back to break down the treason straight ahead.
[19:56.000 --> 20:24.000]  Stay with us.

[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  All right, it is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.000]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.000]  It's time to take action.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  It's time to filter our water.

[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  Then my folks both got a blocket pocket.
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.000]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  I like my blocket pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  Awesome.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  Blocketpocket.com has other cool stuff too.

[23:55.000 --> 24:20.000]  VaticanCatholic.com.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  Now we have atomic weapons. Now we have nuclear weapons. It's not the way we've always done before.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  Now we have liquid airborne Ebola.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  We'll be breaking that down.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  Here's a story from HealthMap.org from two years ago.
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  From pigs to monkeys, Ebola goes airborne.
[24:39.000 --> 24:48.000]  There's a lot of evidence that we now are having airborne transmission between humans, though the pathogen does not live very long.
[24:48.000 --> 24:59.000]  Though the Ebola virus has trouble living out in the open atmosphere very long, especially if the temperatures aren't hot.
[24:59.000 --> 25:07.000]  Ebola virus, we're going to be looking at it today, upwards of a thousand people dead now.
[25:07.000 --> 25:20.000]  And then our border is wide open to the south, but if Boy Scouts are out in the woods taking photos of a bridge and a gorge, who wouldn't?
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  Customs comes over and points guns at them and makes them get on the ground.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  Or if I want to fly, they want to grab my genitals or put me in a naked body scanner.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  But then illegals are allowed to go on without their identification.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  And nothing against the illegals. Their pawns doesn't matter, though.
[25:40.000 --> 25:49.000]  If you dropped a truckload of metal pawns an inch tall off the Empire State Building on the crowd below, it'd kill everybody.
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  The pawn itself's not bad until you put it in a blunder bus with black powder and pull the trigger.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  And then the pawn goes flying out as a weapon, as a projectile.
[26:01.000 --> 26:07.000]  Those old blunder busts, you could put rocks in them. Never ran out of ammo with those as long as you had powder.
[26:07.000 --> 26:13.000]  You'd just put powder down in there, get your fuse down in there, or get your charge in there.
[26:13.000 --> 26:22.000]  Roll up some rocks in a piece of sack, cram it down in there, and you've got yourself a system to fire grape, as the sailors would call it.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  An anti-personnel weapon.
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.000]  Well, you take tens of millions of poor people with diseases who are handicapped or who are criminals or who are fleeing justice or who got babies they're ready to have.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  To a country already teetering on the edge of collapse, it's a weapon.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  Just like a swimming pool is a really nice place.
[26:42.000 --> 26:49.000]  Unless you tie bowling balls to your legs and chain them on and jump into the deep end, you're going to die.
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.000]  Even if you're one foot from the surface or inch from the surface, you can't get up. You can't lift those bowling balls up.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  You can't get that big lead weight off. You're going to drown.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  The water's nice. You need to live. It's a nice thing.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  Until you're submerged in it, submerged in a sea of third world despair and pain and horror.
[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  The people that live high on the hill in Latin America, they don't want to leave where they're at. They run the show.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  Where they got a business or they're so wealthy, they got a house in Austin.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  You know how many rich Mexicans got houses in Austin?
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  They go back and forth. They own Mexico.
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  But not the people coming up here from Latin America, ladies and gentlemen, and they are political putting in the hands of the establishment.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  So why are they engaged in the unprecedented action of bringing not one, not two?
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  I knew it was coming. I said it on the Sunday show yesterday.
[27:48.000 --> 27:57.000]  This sets the precedent. Will Obama bring hundreds of Ebola patients to the U.S.?
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.000]  Now that there's thousands and thousands of people infected, as many as 30-plus thousand,
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.000]  the World Health Organization said last week they believed it may have been exposed and infected.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  The confirmed toll is 826, but that number's a week old, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:15.000 --> 28:23.000]  And did they stick this doctor, this medical doctor, and the other one that's flying into Mara in Atlanta?
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  Did they stick them in the Level 4 Bio Weapons Lab?
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  Or maybe they could contain it? They've already failed containing it?
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  In other countries? No, they stuck them in the Atlanta Medical Center.
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  Don't worry, the patient gets part of a wing.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you have any idea what they have to do in England now?
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  They have robots that look like dollocks. Just type into a search engine.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  UK hospitals use robots in fight against drug-resistant bacteria.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  It was in the BBC, you name it, last week.
[28:57.000 --> 29:04.000]  And they've got these fumigators that go in. Humans can't even be in the rooms with the drug-resistant TB, the rest of it.
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  Actually, you guys have a BBC report I want to play a clip of about that.
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  And they go in and they fumigate with basically poison gas everything to kill everything in the crannies.
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  And they have to seal the vents, because the stuff's living in the vents.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  Then they have to close off part of the hospital and do that.
[29:20.000 --> 29:28.000]  There it is. R2-D2 zaps away the superbugs. Hospital trails roving Star Wars robot that uses UV light to kill bacteria.
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  Yeah, that's not the one. There's one that uses poison gas.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  Robots to aid high-dependency care at Daisy Hill Hospital. That's another one.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  That's for 2012. No, it's a certain headline about the poison gas, but it doesn't matter.
[29:42.000 --> 29:48.000]  The point is, that's what's going on. They're going to stick that in the hospital knowing full well it could get out.
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.000 --> 29:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.000 --> 30:06.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[30:06.000 --> 30:11.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing Diamond Gussets.
[30:11.000 --> 30:20.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make Blue Diamond Gusset jeans.
[30:20.000 --> 30:28.000]  They're so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[30:28.000 --> 30:33.000]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it. Others don't.
[30:38.000 --> 30:45.000]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond Gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combined Gusset Comfort with Kevlar Protection.
[30:49.000 --> 30:54.000]  So you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it. Others don't.
[30:59.000 --> 31:02.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[31:02.000 --> 31:09.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest-purity iodine available.
[31:09.000 --> 31:17.000]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the Earth
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[31:20.000 --> 31:30.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient, 300 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the Earth.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.

[33:58.000 --> 34:04.000]  Waylon Jennings Son, who is an incredible and very successful musician in his own right,
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  tears of Willie Nelson, you name it, is a listener of the show.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  His last album, he produced it with Stephen King.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  And it dealt with the New World Order in tyranny.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  That was a couple years ago. We premiered it here.
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  In fact, it premiered here and the bots of the record company came after us saying,
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  how do you have something that hasn't even been released yet?
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  But we're going to premiere his new album that was dedicated to George Jones
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  even before George Jones died, Old Possum this year.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  So we're going to premiere Never Before Heard songs today
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  and he's going to put something out to the public today as well.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  Some are already out there, some will be premiered.
[34:43.000 --> 34:50.000]  Don't wait up for George and that's the name of the album, Shooter Jennings.
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  Of course, Old Possum was a big influence on his dad.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  Waylon Jennings, one of my favorite country music singers ever.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  Don't we think this outlaw country thing's gone a little too far?
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  No, I don't think it has.
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  So that's coming up for 30 minutes today.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Of course, he did Summer of Rage last time.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  It was more of a rock album.
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  Let's talk about Shooter Jennings, man. His rock albums are awesome.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  And I mean awesome. His country music is awesome.
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  He just certainly is a chip off the old, chip off the old block.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  So Shooter Jennings is coming up to give us his breakdown on what's happening in the world.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  Guys, one of my papers just fell off. You might have given that to me. Sorry.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  Now, let me just race through the news here and then I want to give the number out.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  I specifically want to hear from you.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  The media is pointing out that they're getting threatening letters and phone calls
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  at the Atlanta Medical Center saying,
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  why are you bringing Ebola to the middle of a populated area?
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  And this isn't a high level security facility that's designed to keep this stuff.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  The public is figuring this out.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  Do they know about level one to level four?
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Do they know the details?
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  No, most of them don't.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  But they know enough from medical shows and movies that stuff like Ebola is underground
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.000]  behind multiple sealed entry ways with all sorts of disinfection systems
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  where people go through chemical disinfection, ultra violent disinfection.
[36:19.000 --> 36:25.000]  The rubber suits they use are generally thrown away after one use.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  When you get around this kind of stuff, you got to stay in quarantine
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  depending on how long the passage in chest dates
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  or develops as a vector inside the body until it's communicable.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  There's a lot of things.
[36:39.000 --> 36:49.000]  So why did they bring really strong strains of Ebola into Atlanta and into areas of Germany?
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  Well, there's a larger question.
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  I'm going to do a whole report on this in the nightly news tonight.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  So get ready for a special report.
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  I want to shoot today with the crew.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  I'm so busy, folks.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  I just direct people while I'm on air.
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.000]  Get me everything on the bipartisan bio shield program and bio weapons labs maps
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  previous to 2002 and after 2002 news articles about mainstream media complaining
[37:13.000 --> 37:19.000]  about the level four bio weapons labs being built in major U.S. cities
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  and on major transportation hub lines and on earthquake lines.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  But expanding on that, we can then show how I complained about it in 2002
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.000]  and then show whenever the last big hurricane hit was a 2005 or six hit Galveston.
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.000]  They built the level four facility on the beach in a level two area.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  It's not really level four.
[37:43.000 --> 37:49.000]  And then it was hit by hurricane and the deadly pathogens like Ebola and smallpox
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  that were being weaponized, of course, in the name of learning how to treat them.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  That's how they get around the biological weapons conventions.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  Let's get the guy that wrote the U.S. Treaty on that that got passed.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  Let's get Francis Boyle on this week if you can do it.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  That's a guy to talk about bio shield.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  Then they had a bipartisan move after 9-11 to quote and, of course,
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  the anthrax attack that turned out to be staged by porting down and certain individuals.
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  That was a government false flag.
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  We caught them red-handed on that to create fear and sell camouflage and other goodies
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  and to distract off 9-11 itself in the official story and to keep the fear going.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  So there are the data points.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  We can kill two birds with one stone.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  I can give you some of the history of bio shield and all of this
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.000]  and then move forward while preparing that report for tonight.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  But that's the issue.
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.000]  Since when did they build nuclear reactors on fault lines and not even maintenance them, basically?
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  Since when did they tell nuclear workers,
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  hey, don't worry if you get a dose of radiation now.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  Used to be said, worry about it.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  It's not bad for you.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  Since when, 1990, did they tell the military that DU is not bad for you?
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  Go ahead and be around it.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  Wipe it all over your face.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  Breathe it.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  Sit on top of the ammo cans.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  Use it at army-proving ranges and other military ranges all over the world.
[39:07.000 --> 39:15.000]  Use them in places like Hawaii and places like Puerto Rico, right by public beaches.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  You ingest just a tiny amount in your lungs.
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  It's a death sentence.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  It may take 20 years to kill you. It's a death sentence.
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  And I've had the top radiologist, nuclear physicist, biologist,
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.000]  former head of the Army, DU program, Dr. Doug Rocky on probably 25 times or more.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  I mean, it's an absolute open and shut case.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  Since when did the government get to the point,
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  who'd done plenty of evil stuff before?
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  Secret testing, atomic soldiers, Tuskegee, the list goes on and on,
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  radiating foster children.
[39:45.000 --> 39:51.000]  Since when did they get to the point of just going,
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  hey, we don't care if reactors are leaking 94% of, 93% of worldwide,
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  a 420-something or 430-something?
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  Of course, there's more.
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  There's reactors in submarines, secret reactors, and university reactors.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  So there's actually about 2,000 reactors that we know of.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  If you count known submarines and research reactors,
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  including the one underneath UT that's still operating because you can't shut it down
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  in the one up north.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  People walk up to me, you're a liar, there's no reactor.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Okay, you said there's no reactor, there is not.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  I mean, it just shows the, maybe just say it's racist.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  I said there's a reactor.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  Don't want to worry about the reactors under UT.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  Don't want to worry about the reactor up at JJ Pickle,
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  a very dangerous experimental unit that they're constantly messing with,
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  doing all sorts of dangerous experiments with.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  You know what the answer is?
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  Don't turn on the federally mandated alarms when they off gas,
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  or when they dump it in the water supply.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  And, you know, just say it's racist.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  If you talk about nuclear reactors, racist against radiation.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  That's fine, Alex.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  What do you say about your racism?
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  Hey, Alex, you caught bribery down at the State Capitol on video.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  Is it racist because they're black?
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  I just throw that in, folks.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  My son this morning looked at me and I was talking about 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  And he goes, yeah, the Hulk is green and the sky is blue.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  And I think I'm going to try to use that term,
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  or maybe he didn't coin.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  He said, I don't know about coin.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  He goes, I just, I just think, you know, that's a nice statement when people say,
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  is the Hulk green?
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  He goes, it's better than you saying there's a bear crap in the woods.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  You say that too much, Dad.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  So I'm going to start saying, is the Hulk green?
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  No, he's racist.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  And see, I'm being racist against the Jolly Green Giant right now.
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  If the Jolly Green Giant had Ebola, if we don't bring him into the U.S., we're racist.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  So here's the issue.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Ebola is now airborne.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  I'm going to break that down.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  The question is how airborne?
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  Is it airborne like a seed in the wind that can blow and then sprout, you know,
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  a thousand miles away?
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  No.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  Is it airborne like some forms of the flu that you can get, you know, from a hundred feet away
[42:09.000 --> 42:18.000]  in a shopping mall that somebody sneezes and a globulate of nasal, you know, fluid goes out?
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.000]  Or is it airborne and that you got to be around it right up close to it five feet away?
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  We're going to look at that.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  It's unprecedented to bring this into the country.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  Why is that happening?
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  And why are Ebola patients being brought into level two hospitals plausible deniability?
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  Why did they put in a bio shield?
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  Of course, it's an oxymoron like the Patriot Act.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  It creates bio weapons, but also studies the treatment of them.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  So you call it bio shield.
[42:46.000 --> 42:53.000]  You call Obamacare care and you call, you know, death panel, something else.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  Why are Ebola patients being brought into level two hospitals?
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  Those are some of the questions.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.000]  If you go up to info wars.com, we have some of the headlines there.
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.000]  We have video.
[43:05.000 --> 43:15.000]  Border Patrol agent sums up startling gravity of immigrant crisis.
[43:15.000 --> 43:21.000]  I would just change it to Border Patrol agent issues desperate plea for help says we're in a stage crisis.
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.000]  That's the headline.
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  I change it.
[43:23.000 --> 43:32.000]  Continuing agro terrorism fed shut down seed library in Pennsylvania war on self sufficiency intensifies.
[43:32.000 --> 43:40.000]  Yeah, they got six man SWAT teams for a guy that has a 20 year old range Rover that they don't think went and got the emissions test you were supposed to.
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  But boy, I'm sorry.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  We got to let people in with drug resistant TB.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  It'd be racist to test them when they go to school.
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  So sorry, all your kids have got to get it now.
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  And then nobody will be held accountable by government doctor.
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  There's not enough panic to justify cure for Ebola.
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.000]  That's a Paul Watson article 25 critical facts about the Ebola outbreak that every American needs to know.
[44:04.000 --> 44:13.000]  That's a very important article upon info wars.com Tennessee doctor and self quarantine on return from Liberia Ebola hotspot.
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  The bizarre growth of the Ebola outbreak.
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  The graph says it all.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  We're going to look at that graph.
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  It's up on info wars.com.
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  We could put that up on television for folks and people punch up my computer.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  But there it is.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  There is the growth of Ebola.
[44:31.000 --> 44:37.000]  They call that a parabolic growth curve from March to July 30.
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  That's the latest graph we've got from the World Health Organization.
[44:42.000 --> 44:53.000]  We've gone from 22, 23 cases up to 154.
[44:53.000 --> 45:00.000]  And you could see the growth just in one country alone.
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  So that's what's got everybody so concerned about the situation.
[45:04.000 --> 45:11.000]  Now, as I give the phone number out, as I said to my crew this morning, I said, can you feel it?
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  It's the age of the contrived or exacerbated or stage crisis.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  It's the age of order out of chaos.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  They are overthrowing Ukraine.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  Russia responds when weapons are moved off their border by taking an area that's been part of Russia for 600 years.
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  Not defending Russia.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  I'm just stating facts.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  The West started it with George Soros.
[45:30.000 --> 45:46.000]  They turned ISIS and ISIS everywhere, 300 plus thousand people dead in Iraq and Syria, most of them Christians, zero news coverage by most of talk radio Christian organizations.
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  It's just incredible.
[45:47.000 --> 45:54.000]  Total freaking out protests everywhere about Gaza, which I think Gaza is very sad and very terrible for both sides.
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  A thousand dead, we're supposed to hear about it until the cows come home just forever.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  But then 300,000 Muslims and Christians and others being murdered.
[46:03.000 --> 46:10.000]  Our own government behind it to a great extent with NATO, zero coverage almost, just very little.
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  There were airplanes flying around Austin saying, free Palestine, save Gaza.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  And I was downtown doing some work and just saw probably a thousand protesters.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  I shot some video of it.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  It's on my iPhone.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  We ought to pull that off.
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  And again, I mean, I want the people to be free.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  I wish Gaza was a nice place.
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  I wish there was an ancient travel warfare between them and the Israelis.
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  But why is that all you ever hear about?
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  And a lot of the folks that want to quote free Palestine are now running around murdering Christians everywhere.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  It's a complex issue is the point here.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  Do I like seeing piles of dead Palestinian children?
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  Absolutely not.
[46:50.000 --> 46:57.000]  But the radical groups the West is funding in the Middle East.
[46:57.000 --> 47:03.000]  If they could get into Israel and run it would kill every single Jew in that country and would say they deserve it.
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.000]  They're fundamentally evil.
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  Well, what's Israel saying?
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  They're saying radical Muslims are fundamentally evil.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  I mean, it's just a mess and I don't want to be part of it.
[47:11.000 --> 47:19.000]  So I want to ask the listeners, ladies and gentlemen, the dollar is the valuing quickly.
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  The government is getting us in deep of debt as they can.
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.000]  The government's militarizing and came out in the news again today and said liberty and patriot groups,
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  homegrown groups are the number one terror threat when that's pure bull and we've done nothing.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  They're getting ready to false flag us.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  So I'm telling you, what's the next big crisis is what I want to ask you.
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.000]  Are you mad about the Ebola being flown in?
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  How does Obama think he won't get in trouble when the buck stops with him if it ends up getting out?
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  Do they want plausible deniability?
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  Well, they ended up releasing some.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  What's the next big crisis?
[47:53.000 --> 48:00.000]  Dollar going belly up stock market going belly up a new a new going off in Manhattan claiming the Patriots did it.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  Obama's already set the stage for that.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  We got missing nukes for real.
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  The borders wide open.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  Do they want plausible deniability there?
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  Because you used to politicians would want an open border and then have a terror attack as they get in trouble.
[48:13.000 --> 48:19.000]  Now things are so upside down, they'll blow something up and say I did it.
[48:19.000 --> 48:29.000]  I got MSNBC and singing in both saying Alex Jones influenced the Boston bombers and is to blame.
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.000]  Excuse me with no proof.
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  Just like saying you're racist if you don't like Obamacare.
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  He doesn't make any sense, but they don't care.
[48:42.000 --> 48:52.000]  Believe me, they're going to blame Rand Paul, Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Ted Cruz because that's the only people they ever blame already.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  And they'll throw Rush Limbaugh in for good measure.
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  And even if you don't like Rush Limbaugh, at least he's pro-gun.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  At least he wants lower taxes.
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  Is he a warmonger?
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  Yeah.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  Maybe he's not sophisticated enough to understand all this.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  I don't think that's the case.
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  But the point is he's not our enemy.
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  And if they can shut him down with boycotts and the rest of it, they can shut us all down.
[49:13.000 --> 49:22.000]  That's why if they were arresting Michael Moore, even though I disagree with them across the board, like I did a Dinesh Jesus at the filmmaker, I would come to Michael Moore's aid.
[49:22.000 --> 49:30.000]  Because you see, I believe in the First Amendment and hanging together and I realize if they can get him, they can get me and they can get you.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  It's called common sense, folks.
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.000]  It's called not doing to other people stuff you don't want done to you.
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  It's called treating people like you want to be treated.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  Jesus Christ told us to do that.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  And I don't care what you think about Jesus if you don't believe he's the Son of God.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  I know he is.
[49:48.000 --> 49:56.000]  The point is you better know what he says is true and is a lot better to follow than what's going on in this world today.
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  Now briefly, we fund this operation with people being PrisonPlanet.tv members.

[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  John just takes on so many duties.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  There aren't even his to keep things running so well.

[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  I'm sure you know, this economy sucks.
[51:06.000 --> 51:12.000]  We all realize that the American economy is tremendously unstable right now and will likely get much worse.
[51:12.000 --> 51:18.000]  There's monumental debt, government bailouts, stock and real estate bubbles that are primed to pop at any moment
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  which can flush away most or all of your retirement savings.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  This type of movement has enormous consequences.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  Financial trouble is right here at our doorstep.
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.000]  But if you move right now and develop a backup plan immediately, this could be the most profitable time of your life.
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.000]  Proportionately, more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in our history.

[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  Are you happy doing your laundry with perfume detergents that irritate your skin?
[52:33.000 --> 52:38.000]  Are you happy washing your hands with stinking fragrances that give your skin rashes?

[53:26.000 --> 53:32.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  Mypatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[54:13.000 --> 54:18.000]  I guess it'd be good to give the phone number out for folks to give a sure take on what the next shooting drop is.
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.000]  I wonder why there's no, I mean all the phones are loaded with red lights but none of them are showing we have callers yet.
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  Because I'm having them the number out, that's the cue for them to answer the phone, sorry.
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  I want to hear from callers about what you think the next big crisis they're going to pull is.
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  Or maybe you don't think they're pulling any of these, even though they are on record, many of them.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  And how bad do you think it's going to get?
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  And are you angry about them bringing Ebola in?
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  How does government think they can get away with doing stuff that's illegal?
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  It's illegal to do things like this, you can look it up under the US code under law.
[54:50.000 --> 55:02.000]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  And first time callers are always welcome, we're having open phones right now.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  All I ask is you have a good phone and you not be drunk.
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  800-259-9231.
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  Here's some of the headlines.
[55:15.000 --> 55:22.000]  Ebola terror at Gatwick as passenger collapses and dies getting off Sierra Leone flight.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  Isn't that just special?
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  That's all over the British news, Daily Mail, you name it.
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.000]  Second America want the Ebola to return tomorrow to Atlanta to the hospital treating sick people.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  What a wonderful idea.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  Ebola fears swirl around US Africa summit.
[55:38.000 --> 55:53.000]  The Hill reports that people may bring it back from the summit in Africa where you've got all these hundreds of African officials and 50 African leaders meeting all from different areas that may have Ebola.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  US government seeking to test Ebola vaccine on humans.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  Yeah, the polio vaccine it turned out gave most people polio.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  It's still doing it today.
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  Look it up.
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  That's a great idea.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  Let's roll our sleeves up for that.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  Ebola death toll rises to 826 as outbreak spins out of control financial times.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  US government seeking to test Ebola though.
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  They'll keep us safe.
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  Emirates suspends Ghana flights over Ebola.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  Oh, they're being racist.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  You're not allowed to control your border.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  You're racist.
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  I think the babies should all bathe in Ebola to prove they're not against Africans.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  Of course, nothing to do with Africans except the titting Africans.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  Atlanta hospital receives hate mail for treating aid workers stricken by Ebola.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  Yeah, how dare people want the law to be followed?
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  Supposed to treat them on military bases or on ships.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  There's level four protocol.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  Supposed to have nothing but volunteers around that are doing this.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  Not people at a university hospital.
[56:52.000 --> 56:58.000]  I watched singing in live as they brought them in in the front door of the hospital.
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  But they had a plastic tent over him. Everything's fine.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  I mean, it makes me sick how reckless this government is.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  They're a bunch of mental patients.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  See, it's criminology.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  The globalists run things.
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.000]  They have a plan, but elites always end up just going crazy and marrying their horses
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.000]  and attacking Russia like Hitler did and Napoleon and just starting fights with everyone
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  and murdering their family members for no reason and starting fights they can't win
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  because any cop will tell you criminals love to brag
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  and they love to push it too far when they don't get caught.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  They get more and more reckless, more and more reckless.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  And the government is just completely out of its mind crazy now.
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.000]  At the top, do we have the border patrol people leaking the secret high-level document
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  about diseases coming in and about criminals exploiting it?
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Did good people leak that? Yes.
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  Are there good people in the CIA, the FBI, probably even the ATF?
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  Some of them expose fascist furious.
[57:51.000 --> 57:57.000]  Yes, but the people running the show, the committee chairman, the Democratic Party,
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  John Boehner are committed to this takeover and this fraud.
[58:01.000 --> 58:09.000]  We're going to start the next hour and take a goblin of your phone calls to quote an old Texas saying,
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  we're going to cover some Larepin information.
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.000]  That means super important, super good cream of the cream.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  Nobody knows what Larepin means, we just know it means it's Larepin good.
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  And again, if I'm laughing, folks, it's Gallows Humor.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  I am not going to get down over all this.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  I'm just going to fight as hard as I can, but it is Gallows Humor.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  Because I feel like laughing like Woody Woodpecker, folks.
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  I mean, this is crazy. We'll be back.
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  Now your friends and family tune in right now to this AM and FM affiliate.
[58:41.000 --> 58:48.000]  Tell people to tune in. We're warning folks. Only sunshine is going to expose this globalist virus.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  It's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[59:15.000 --> 59:21.000]  The Info Wars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two ounce bottle
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  and it's not recommended for extended continual use.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  This is not a low grade formula.

[59:30.000 --> 59:37.000]  to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water

[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  InfoWarsLife has a bombshell article, but we're going to change the headline because it's not even bombshell enough.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  The headline is video. Border Patrol agent sums up startling gravity of immigration crisis.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  The headline is shock video.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Shock video. Border Patrol admits that there's no such thing as citizens anymore.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Shock video. Border Patrol says citizens don't exist, basically.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  How many people on board?
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  Me.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  You're a citizen.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Yeah, but does it really matter?
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Not anymore, unfortunately.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Thank you.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  You too.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  And then they have an interview in there in the article breaking it all down. I mean, that is just bombshell.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  I mean, this is just crazy town, folks.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  I told FreeNumber to join us 800-259-9231. We're going to break down all the newest breaking news as well, but let's go to your calls first.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  That's New York.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Okay, so you're where the country started up there in New York. Well, I guess the globalists couldn't take over.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  The British couldn't take over with weapons, but I guess the globalists took over with propaganda and BS and red tape, didn't they?
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  Right. That's New York state, not New York City. Big difference. A lot of people won't get that.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  No, I know it's a big difference.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  All right, but Alex, big supporter. Okay, I called him before, previously.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  I'm really getting sick and tired, man. Please stop saying that you're going to be leaving.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Okay, I can understand the science behind that, but you know, you got a lot of loyal listeners and there's no difference if you...
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Brother, here's the deal. I'm not leaving the country, but I'm so honest that it's like an instinct.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  It'd be like if you were married, but Marilyn Monroe and her prime was saying, come on, baby.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  It'd be really hard even if you were a good preacher or, you know, or if you were Moses.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  It'd be really, or King David, you know, couldn't say no.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  So the whole issue is it's like running the South Pacific, getting out of here with my family.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  Just literally is just a constant draw.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  So I'm honest with people, but then I say there's nowhere to run even medium term.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  So I'm going to stay, but it's just go ahead and make your point.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Yeah, well, you know, I'm just saying my point is it frustrates a lot of people.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  I'm one of them. They get really frustrated with that comment anyway.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  Also, with the border crisis, you're talking about, you know, saying that I don't understand why you coddle in these people.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  You're saying, oh, it's not their fault. You know, it is their fault.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  They intentionally want to come here and destroy the country. A lot of them.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Yeah, but I mean, folks, I mean, listen, do you have any idea how ignorant just the general public is that's blue collar busy working all day?
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  I mean, they have no idea how the world even works. These people are desperate.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  And I think it's important to humanize them, but to point out they're being used as weapons.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  But, but I mean, sure, a lot of them are criminals. I mean, the whole world, if you're a criminal, just get to the US and you're fine.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  So I get your point. But I mean, what do you say about some poor woman from Guatemala who shaves up all our money and gets a bus ride up to Texas?
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  I mean, obviously she's being exploited by the mafia. This is a Democratic Party.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  But, and obviously she's going to vote to take my guns and literally rule me and my family. But, but, but still, I don't hate her.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  You understand that gives me the moral high ground, though, as well.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  I understood. Can I give you just a tiny bit of background?
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  I have a wife that's immigrant. I'm not going to say what country or origin, but played the cards, right?
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  Went to school here, came here as a young, young child, played the cards, right?
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  High school, graduated high school, college, had two children with me and still had a problem getting her citizenship until I spoke to a legislator that helped me out.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  I want to hear about this because no, no, it's true. They make it nearly impossible to come here legal.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  But then if you go to the Democratic Party route and pay them off and get in their system, then you can.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3888-533139.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  I didn't taste dirt in it.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  God knows what's in this.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet. Next we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  That one is better.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like. It's good water.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  It's good water.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Refreshing.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  It's good.

[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs. Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  You already have a large assortment of interesting bumper stickers from Don't Tread On Me, Molan Lobby, InfoWars.com, you name it, spread the word.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  But I want one that says 2 plus 2 equals 4. If you guys will punch up my screen, TV viewers can see this.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  I sent it out on Twitter at Real Alex Jones a few minutes ago and it is getting retweeted everywhere right now going viral.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  And it says 2 plus 2 equals 4. George Arwell, the Hulk is green Rex Jones. That's my son.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  And you're like, what's the point of that? We know 2 plus 2 equals 4. No, no, no.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  When we have a bumper sticker of 2 plus 2 equals 4 under an InfoWars.com, in fact, I want that very design that our graphic people did as a square bumper sticker or as a rectangular bumper sticker.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  People will say, what does that mean? And you go, well, common core, 2 plus 2 equals 5. The ability to be free is what Eric Blair, a.k.a. George Arwell wrote.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  In 1984, it says 2 plus 2 equals 4. Citizen spied on without warrants, checkpoints on the highways, armored vehicles, search at the airport.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  But the border is wide open. That, my friends, is 2 plus 2 equals 5. That is discriminatory.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  Illegals get to go have a baby free at the hospital. A citizen doesn't. That's 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  The revolution, 2 plus 2 equals 4. People love stuff like the equal sign or rainbow or, you know, whatever.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  I know what's our title and what will be picked up and become a signant, a symbol of freedom, part of the pantheon of logos that promote liberty.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  And 2 plus 2 equals 4 is it. Join me at Real Alex Jones in retweeting that tweet.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  Because it's like a riddle. People say, what does that mean? 2 plus 2 equals 4. The Hulk is green.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  Tyranny is tyranny. World government's tyranny. Obama's a tyrannical thug, not a liberal. The Republican leadership are a bunch of scum.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  I also sent a tweet out yesterday, and my buddy Shane Steiner sent me a photo of a woman taking the mark of the beast.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  That's up on Real Alex Jones in the photos. It's a woman getting on a giant Obama tattoo on the back of her neck. It's a joke.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  Now, I want to race through your calls now. I want to go back to the article upon infowars.com by Steve Watson with the headline video,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Border Patrol Agent sums up the startling gravity of immigration crisis and says that it means nothing to be a citizen.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  That's what he's saying. Because to be a citizen, sometimes they can script you for war.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  It means you have rights. It means you can go and vote. It means you can run for office. It means you are the government.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Well, now they're saying, oh, no, anybody that comes here, Colorado has seen a 90 plus percent increase the last year.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  That was in the news last week for illegals wanting their driver's license and they're giving them and then they're allowed to vote.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  I can't go to Mexico and vote. They would laugh at me. They would beat me up and rightfully so. At least they have nationalism down there.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  They're a failed third world country, but at least they have nationalism. It's been drummed out of us.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  Let's play the clip of the truck driver. The full video is up on infowars.com in Texas, 70 plus miles from the border.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  And they say, are you a U.S. citizen? And he says, yeah, but does it matter?
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  The Border Patrol Agent says, yeah, not really anymore because if illegals show up to him, he just loads them, takes them to ICE, who's Obama run.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And then the Democratic Party and the former head of the Ford Foundation, who set all this up, decides where to send them.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And the cops in Dallas said this week over the weekend, they said, we had an article, anybody protest, we're coming after you.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  You don't protest in Texas. You do what you're told.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Just like all over DFW, they say you can't stand with political signs on the side of the road.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  But if it's a pizza place or Liberty tax, you're allowed to. Dallas is shameful, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  My hometown calls itself Republican. What a joke. It's turning blue right now.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  And the Republicans are all too busy going to their Baptist churches and visiting their hookers at night to even know what's going on around them.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  Makes me want to vomit.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  I'll hand this to at least so-called liberals in old liberal bastions like Austin. They leave the First Amendment alone, at least partially.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  Because the liberals won't put up with it.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  But see the new liberal, oh, it's not allowed.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  William, you were finishing up about how hard it was, your wife, all the stuff she went through to try to become a citizen legally.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Describe that versus coming here illegally. You're just instantly legalized, but put on the Democratic Party assembly line. Break it down.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  I said, well, here it is, Alex. You know, my wife, a really good girl. Every husband thinks their wife that way.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  But come here, a whole family, work hard, pay taxes, always work. Like I said, graduated high school, graduated college with honors.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  You know, pay taxes, which a lot of people aren't too into these days, it seems, but had problems getting her citizenship, which I don't know.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  Because we had two children. This is 20 years later, mind you.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  And then was also told she couldn't vote unless she had citizenship.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  You know, I got through the red tape somehow by luck and spoke to a legislator.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  Legislator put me in touch with my local congresswoman and somehow...
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Well, that's another thing. Americans have been taught how to not work the system, even legally and lawfully.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  But I've noticed that La Raza and Metchah people are always on my website going, you're going to get it.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Whitey, we're going to get you one day, we're going to kill you, blah, blah, blah. And they'll say, we know how to work the system, you don't.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  And really what it is, and then they'll say, and blacks don't know either, ha, ha, ha.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  You can literally type that in and you'll find it on InfoWars in the comments.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  And that's not your average Hispanic American, but that's who the Democrats are behind.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  That's who they're empowering. That's who they're saying is normal so they can bully other people to join their racial club.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  It is exactly like the Ku Klux Klan, it's just Hispanic, and it's run by the Department of Defense, Ford Foundation, and the Rand Corporation on record.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  And you want to know how they're going to break this country? They don't let you come in legal.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  They bring you in illegal to make sure you're the very poorest people who don't want to follow laws and things.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  You fit right into Akron. Again, Veritas Project, and I appreciate your call, walked into facility after facility
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  and said, we want to run small children, children were trafficking in here to run sex operations with them.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  They go, great, wonderful. We'll set you up with that. We've got all the operators to help you.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  I mean, it was just like, you're part of, because what do you think's going on in there? That's what it is.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  That's all they do is run in these Democratic Party affiliated operations is run criminal operations.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And of course, they don't want us having guns. If you're a Democratic operative in Chicago, you can have a machine gun.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  You're not getting in trouble with the cops. You can beat people up at bars. You can kill your neighbor. You don't get in trouble.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  Unless you go against the system, then they take you down. Let's see, then your country collapses.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  So that's how this country now works in these areas controlled by them. And the Republican leadership has sold out to the mafia
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  and has decided that they're going to go along with this because they're being blackmailed by the NSA on record.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  I've had William Benny, number four in the NSA, go public and say there's blackmail across the board.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  And others have gone public saying the same thing. And then they run these operatives out there that pose as conservatives going,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Alex Jones claims he has whistleblowers on like Wayne Madsen and William Benny, who claims he was an intelligence agent.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  They won't even say where he was from, hoping that the people watching him on TV don't go look it up.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  And William Benny is on record who he was in hundreds of newspapers, New York Times, Associated Press, London Guardian.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  But they have people come out to their Republican audiences and go,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  all right, let me tell you who you got to look out for. It's this KGB agent, literally this one guy.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  It's incredible humor. People send it to me. I only watch it because of humor.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  The little secret around here is I love being attacked, not in a sadomasochistic way, but it's like a joke.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  It's entertainment, but I swore it off six, seven years ago and have really cut back.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  But I was watching one of these videos and this guy talks with a get smart type accent.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  And guess who else we've got? KGB operative Alex Jones. That's right.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  And he's got these intelligence agents he claims and they claim work for the government.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  That's right. Wayne Madsen, William Benny.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  It's not for anybody, but when he's that and the crowd's like laughing.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Next he's going to say two plus two equals four.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  Thanks all, baby. Let's go to your calls. Wesley in Tennessee. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, for anybody who, you know, feeling sorry for, you know, I get it.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  I get it. I feel sorry for these people that are, you know, living in several countries and want to come up here.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  But the answer isn't to bring them here. Like you say, it's a fixed their country.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  But regardless of that, you know, I'm going to Japan just to study here in a month or two.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  And you would not believe the amount of protocol you have to go through just to go study, let alone becoming a citizen of Japan.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  Yeah, that's because we're called first world nations and we don't want to collapse into disease.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  Does anyone have any idea how scary third world countries are?
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  Geraldo Rivera says we're just fair monitoring.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, or racist, you know, so just play that car over and over your racist.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  I challenge Geraldo Rivera to come back on my show and defend his ideas here fairly.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  I'll give him 50, 50 times, 30 minutes of it on his radio show, his TV show.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  He's come on my show a couple of times. He needs to come on.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  And don't give me that news core won't let you come on, Geraldo.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  I actually got a lot of respect for him when he came on your show that one time and, you know, he admitted you're right up to NSA and stuff like that.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  But then, you know, I'm losing respect for him again right now.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  Well, no, he said, I'm sorry, you're right. They're off air. He said there's a lot of evidence.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  9 11's like you say, to a great extent, there's a lot of evidence of government drug dealing and there's a lot of evidence.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  The NSA and well, I got to say we're right. And I grew up watching her all though.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  When like the Klan broke his nose and all that. I loved her all though when I was a kid.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  And, you know, I'm not somebody enamored with stars now.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  But if I was a fan of somebody when I was a kid, like Dave Mustaine, it's really weird than when you're having dinner with them.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  And yeah, it's very irritating. I mean, come on, Haroldo. Why don't you live in Guatemala if it's so great?
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  Anything else caller?
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  Yeah, I want to ask you, you know, I was I was big on the, you know, pro-Palestinian thing, you know, I understand it.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  It's Israel's government people. It's not the Jews that live in Israel that are wanting, you know, that are.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  I want to get your take on the Palestinians briefly. I want to cut you off.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  Then we'll go to Paula, Jared, Will, Justin and others.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
