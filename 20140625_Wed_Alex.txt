[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:21.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.240 --> 00:28.880]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be your host today on this Wednesday
[00:28.880 --> 00:36.520]  June 25th 2014 going very quickly we're about halfway through 2014 today we've
[00:36.520 --> 00:41.960]  had a landmark decision I think from the Supreme Court they actually endorsed
[00:41.960 --> 00:45.360]  the Fourth Amendment who would have thought that the Supreme Court would
[00:45.360 --> 00:48.080]  endorse the Fourth Amendment we're going to be talking about that and we're
[00:48.080 --> 00:51.160]  going to be talking about the police state we're going to have Paul Joseph
[00:51.160 --> 00:54.680]  Watson joining us at the bottom of this hour and the third hour we're going to
[00:54.680 --> 00:58.760]  be joined by Cheryl Chumley and we'll talk about the book that she wrote
[00:58.760 --> 01:03.720]  police state USA and Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the second hour
[01:03.720 --> 01:11.080]  with a report about the America being destroyed by design this is all connected
[01:11.080 --> 01:14.880]  it's not that we have Homeland Security that is pushing this police state on
[01:14.880 --> 01:20.960]  local police departments the Defense Department equipping them with mine ready
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.440]  vehicles that we see everywhere it's not just that kind of militarization it's
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.800]  also Homeland Security has the control of the borders they're the ones who are
[01:30.800 --> 01:34.880]  standing down at the border they have control of border patrols they have
[01:34.880 --> 01:40.400]  control of ice and they also have control of the TSA where they are not
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.360]  standing down so what is this all about this is a planned design this is
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.520]  treason and that's what Alex Jones is going to be talking about in the second
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.880]  hour as he joins us and of course we're going to have updates on what's going on
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.160]  with the collapsing borders but today primarily we're going to be talking with
[01:58.160 --> 02:01.880]  Paul Joseph Watson and Cheryl Chumley about the other aspect of it and that
[02:01.880 --> 02:08.000]  is how do they treat us within the borders well it's a police state just
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.160]  yesterday evening we had an article from info wars.com that Paul Joseph Watson
[02:13.160 --> 02:17.280]  wrote we're going to talk to him about is picked up on Drudge woman says DHS
[02:17.280 --> 02:23.720]  forced her to strip naked at gunpoint during a terrifying dawn raid yeah see
[02:23.720 --> 02:29.960]  the problem is is that our police state is essentially stripping us all naked in
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.400]  our person places affects our data they are constantly watching everything we
[02:35.400 --> 02:40.800]  do and we are not allowed to even look them in the eye just like this lady they
[02:40.800 --> 02:43.880]  handcuff us put us on the floor and tell us to shut up and don't look at them
[02:43.880 --> 02:49.840]  we're tired of this we're not going to put up with this it's amazing for me to
[02:49.840 --> 02:53.520]  see as it was we got Cheryl Chumley and we're gonna be talking about her book
[02:53.520 --> 02:58.520]  police state USA it's amazing to see an article from the Guardian today talking
[02:58.520 --> 03:02.920]  about the very same thing of course she documents this going way back documents
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.920]  it very very thoroughly but this article from the Guardian that came up today is
[03:06.920 --> 03:11.960]  talking about the exact same thing the militarization of the police force they
[03:11.960 --> 03:17.800]  start out with a case of a family that was hit with a SWAT team raid they
[03:17.800 --> 03:21.880]  threw a flash bang grenade in the baby's crib we've talked about this when it
[03:21.880 --> 03:28.360]  first came out have critically injured that baby throwing a grenade in its
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.120]  crib this is the type of thing that's happening if this was only happening
[03:32.120 --> 03:37.600]  once if it was only the baby with the flash bang grenade in the crib we should
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.720]  do something about it if it was only this lady who was stripped naked by the
[03:42.720 --> 03:46.720]  Homeland Security people a SWAT team coming into her home trashing her home
[03:46.720 --> 03:50.800]  not telling her what it's about that's the other aspect of the police state
[03:50.800 --> 03:55.480]  you're not allowed to know why they're doing anything they won't give you any
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.640]  answers she still doesn't have answers people who've been put on the no fly
[03:59.640 --> 04:03.760]  list still don't have answers as to either why they were put on or when they
[04:03.760 --> 04:06.880]  were taken off why they were taken off we cover the story one of the first
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.320]  stories when I came here back in October 2012 was about Wade Hicks who was on
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.440]  his way to Japan to see his wife on a military plane he was taken off of that
[04:16.440 --> 04:22.280]  plane in Hawaii not given a reason this is a guy who had just recently before he
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.720]  traveled he had been this was on a Department of Defense plane he had been
[04:25.720 --> 04:30.560]  vetted by Homeland Security itself had a special pass as a worker he was taken
[04:30.560 --> 04:34.280]  off eventually he's taken off the plane and stranded for days in Hawaii because
[04:34.280 --> 04:38.640]  he couldn't get anywhere from there without flying and so eventually he
[04:38.640 --> 04:41.520]  was taken off of that list who was eventually brought back to the US but
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.560]  he never got an explanation as to why he was put on or even if he was in fact
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.120]  taken off that's the kind of police state we have today there's been some key
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.840]  Supreme Court decisions and we're gonna talk about that we'll be right back stay
[04:53.840 --> 04:56.120]  with us

[07:09.720 --> 07:14.200]  is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid I
[07:14.200 --> 07:18.920]  discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival

[07:38.320 --> 07:42.120]  ladies and gentlemen this is innovating and the best part is it helps fund

[08:11.400 --> 08:19.120]  disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:19.120 --> 08:23.720]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Wednesday June 25th
[08:23.720 --> 08:30.440]  2014 today we have an amazing Supreme Court decision and it was unanimous the
[08:30.440 --> 08:35.120]  unanimously upheld the Fourth Amendment didn't think I would ever live to see it
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.160]  but that's good news and we're gonna talk about that what it means for you and
[08:39.160 --> 08:43.360]  some of the some of the inherent contradictions now that are left hanging
[08:43.360 --> 08:48.400]  out there but before we get into that I want to talk a little bit about Hillary
[08:48.400 --> 08:52.480]  Clinton about the lifestyles of the rich and infamous you know the mail online
[08:52.480 --> 08:59.600]  just pointed out today that she's getting $225,000 to speak at the
[08:59.600 --> 09:05.280]  University of Las Vegas University of Nevada in Las Vegas that's happening at
[09:05.280 --> 09:10.640]  the same time that the University just announced a 4% tuition increase for
[09:10.640 --> 09:16.480]  those same students and they're kind of seeing the the cognitive dissonance of
[09:16.480 --> 09:19.800]  this you know here here's this person who loves to put herself out there as
[09:19.800 --> 09:23.640]  someone who is for the little person standing up against the wealthy elite
[09:23.640 --> 09:29.960]  she said she was dead broke when she and Bill left the presidency the co-presidency
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.680]  I guess and yet here she is the same person and the Clinton Foundation has
[09:34.680 --> 09:40.680]  gotten half of a billion dollars half a billion dollars from Goldman Sachs alone
[09:40.680 --> 09:45.880]  for their Clinton Foundation they have fundraisers at the Goldman Sachs
[09:45.880 --> 09:50.000]  headquarters for their Clinton Foundation I'm reminded of what I think it was
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.160]  H.L. Meakin it might have been Mark Twain out now he said elections are
[09:54.160 --> 09:59.680]  advanced auctions of stolen goods well that certainly is the case in this case
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.600]  with Hillary Clinton now they say the course at this $225,000 that she's
[10:04.600 --> 10:09.600]  getting to speak to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas that money will not
[10:09.600 --> 10:14.160]  go into the Clinton fund that's going to go to her personally and we have an
[10:14.160 --> 10:19.000]  article up on info wars.com says if the Clintons are worth $50 million why do
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.440]  they get nearly a million dollars a year from the taxpayers this is by Michael
[10:22.440 --> 10:25.600]  Schneider economic collapse he says since leaving the White House the
[10:25.600 --> 10:29.320]  Clintons have earned at least a hundred million dollars and currently have a
[10:29.320 --> 10:36.120]  net worth of $50 million so why do we need to give him $944,000 a year to
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.280]  fund his extravagant lifestyle and he points out that it's not just Bill
[10:40.280 --> 10:46.480]  Clinton it's also George W. Bush who actually gets more he actually gets one
[10:46.480 --> 10:50.360]  point two eight million dollars a year and listen to the kind of stuff that W
[10:50.360 --> 10:54.720]  spends his money on he spends a hundred and two thousand dollars for telephone
[10:54.720 --> 11:00.560]  expenses in 2014 $135,000 more on furniture computer office supplies
[11:00.560 --> 11:06.480]  and other miscellany I left it there as a pause for that to sink in $102,000 in
[11:06.480 --> 11:09.560]  phone expenses and as he points out Michael Schneider points on his article
[11:09.560 --> 11:16.920]  does W have the world's worst calling plan how do you spend $102,000 on phone
[11:16.920 --> 11:20.760]  calls I don't know but then he also points out that other members of royalty
[11:20.760 --> 11:27.600]  Obama has 469 senior staff who work directly under him 226 of them make
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.720]  more than a hundred thousand dollars a year his dog handler for the family dog
[11:31.720 --> 11:36.960]  bow reportedly makes a hundred and $2,000 a year there you go guess we are
[11:36.960 --> 11:42.400]  going to the dogs but you know Will and Kate of the UK are just remodeling
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.920]  their one of their palaces and they're spending four million pounds but they
[11:46.920 --> 11:50.960]  said don't worry we paid for it ourselves where did they get that money I
[11:50.960 --> 11:56.320]  mean you know that that kind of kind of brings back memories of Obama's you
[11:56.320 --> 11:59.280]  didn't build that you know they didn't earn that money and I don't think the
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.080]  Clintons have really earned this money either it just strikes at the hypocrisy
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.760]  and hopefully the people who would tend to vote for someone like Hillary who
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.120]  would be taken in by her rhetoric would be wise enough to see this we're also
[12:12.120 --> 12:16.360]  going to be talking about the hypocrisy not today but we're going to we talked
[12:16.360 --> 12:22.040]  about this on Sunday with Alex Jones we talked about the hypocrisy of Hillary
[12:22.040 --> 12:26.840]  appealing to women they're all about seeing a woman in the White House and
[12:26.840 --> 12:32.680]  yet information has surfaced about Hillary Clinton one of the early things
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.040]  that she did when she was just a 27-year-old lawyer how she got off a
[12:36.040 --> 12:43.000]  rapist a pedophile rapist who had raped a 13-year-old girl caused her to have
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.480]  health problems the rest of her life and the audio tape is now surfaced of that
[12:46.480 --> 12:50.720]  and gone viral where you can actually hear Hillary Clinton laughing about the
[12:50.720 --> 12:54.960]  fact hey this guy actually passed a lie detector test that destroyed my
[12:54.960 --> 12:59.520]  confidence forever in polygraphs she knew this guy was guilty she got him off
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.080]  on technicalities and she laughed about it okay we've heard this story about
[13:04.080 --> 13:10.000]  Hillary Clinton many many times about how she has been the war on women and
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.960]  yet this is I think the most damaging thing the hypocrisy of the Hillary
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.840]  Clinton candidacy the fact that she thinks that she's for the people think
[13:19.840 --> 13:23.600]  she's for the little people people think she's for women's rights nothing of the
[13:23.600 --> 13:30.520]  sort she is a corrupt elitist just like Obama just like George W. Bush now I was
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.560]  talking about the Supreme Court decision and we're gonna be talking about the
[13:34.560 --> 13:38.120]  police state predominantly today we're gonna have Paul Joseph Watson joining us
[13:38.120 --> 13:41.400]  at the bottom of the hour we're gonna be talking in the third hour to Cheryl
[13:41.400 --> 13:47.000]  Chumley who wrote a book police state USA cataloging what has been happening to
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.840]  our country where it is going what we can do about it we're gonna be talking
[13:50.840 --> 13:54.200]  to her in the third hour and Alex Jones is gonna be tying a lot of this together
[13:54.200 --> 13:58.280]  because you know it's Homeland Security that runs not only the police state and
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.160]  pushes that at the local level but they of course are in charge of our borders
[14:02.160 --> 14:05.320]  and so Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the second hour with a
[14:05.320 --> 14:11.080]  report treason America destroyed by design but as we're talking about the
[14:11.080 --> 14:14.800]  the police state let's look at the Supreme Court decision that came out
[14:14.800 --> 14:18.920]  today upon info wars.com we see an article here from Steven Diner in the
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.120]  Washington Times Supreme Court bans warrantless cell phone searches this
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.440]  just came out they rule today that police cannot go snooping through people's
[14:26.440 --> 14:31.680]  cell phones without a warrant and a unanimous decision that he says amounts
[14:31.680 --> 14:37.000]  to a major statement in favor of privacy rights it's a 21st century update to
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.240]  the legal understanding of privacy rights it is long long overdue and when I
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.920]  look at this and I look at their past record of things that they've decided
[14:46.920 --> 14:50.640]  as USA Today pointed out when they covered this story today they said in the
[14:50.640 --> 14:55.000]  past two years the Supreme Court has ruled that police can swab a suspect's
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.720]  cheek for DNA in order to put it into an unsolved crimes database they can
[14:59.720 --> 15:04.600]  conduct strip searches of prisoners without reasonable suspicion and they
[15:04.600 --> 15:10.000]  have said that police need a warrant to attach a GPS device to a suspect's car
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.640]  and yet we still see these cases of the stingray devices that local police
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.560]  stations are using throughout the country police departments are using
[15:20.560 --> 15:25.160]  stingray devices to track people's whereabouts without actually attaching
[15:25.160 --> 15:28.840]  it see that's the kind of prevarication around the bush these guys like to do
[15:28.840 --> 15:34.360]  when the Supreme Court does slap them down and say you can't attach a GPS
[15:34.360 --> 15:39.160]  device to the suspect's car they say well okay we've got this new device called
[15:39.160 --> 15:43.040]  stingray which we first talked about a couple of years ago here in info wars
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.880]  we're telling people about it now we've had several cases where local to police
[15:46.880 --> 15:52.280]  departments are exposed we just had one this last week and when they're exposed
[15:52.280 --> 15:56.280]  and criticized for it they say well of course we couldn't tell anybody about
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.600]  it and we couldn't get a search warrant for it because we signed a non-disclosure
[16:00.600 --> 16:05.880]  agreement with the company that sells this saying that we would not get search
[16:05.880 --> 16:12.920]  warrants to perform this you understand that the non-disclosure agreement with
[16:12.920 --> 16:18.040]  the company that sells it is more important to them than the Constitution
[16:18.040 --> 16:22.600]  does that make it clear to you that we're living under a corporate fascist
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.000]  state their legal agreements with these military industrial police state
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.520]  surveillance companies and their equipment that they're selling that
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.320]  takes precedent over their oath to the Constitution over the supreme law of the
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.440]  land it means that they're not going to get a search warrant well today
[16:41.440 --> 16:45.480]  fortunately the Supreme Court says that they cannot pick up smartphones and
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.120]  search them without a warrant now the case that happened here is this guy was
[16:49.120 --> 16:53.320]  pulled over he had expired tags then they found out that his driver's license
[16:53.320 --> 16:56.000]  was suspended then they searched his car and they find that he's got a couple
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.560]  loaded guns at that point they arrest him then they grab his phone they start
[17:00.560 --> 17:04.520]  looking at they find photos that show that he's part of a gang then they find
[17:04.520 --> 17:09.160]  a photo of a car that had been used in a drive-by shooting and based on that they
[17:09.160 --> 17:13.120]  charged him with attempted murder in a drive-by gang shooting they sentenced him
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.440]  15 years to life and that was the California Supreme Court rejected it they
[17:17.440 --> 17:22.200]  took it all the way to the US Supreme Court and today they unanimously said
[17:22.200 --> 17:28.360]  that cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense
[17:28.360 --> 17:33.320]  from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee's person that can be
[17:33.320 --> 17:37.400]  searched without a warrant now I have a problem with that because the fourth
[17:37.400 --> 17:42.400]  amendment clearly says that you are secure in your person your houses your
[17:42.400 --> 17:49.000]  papers your effects now that's pretty inclusive and I think that that makes it
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.480]  very clear that they can't go through your wallets your purses your notepads
[17:52.480 --> 17:57.080]  which they say have been for a fair game and our fair game I don't think those
[17:57.080 --> 18:03.080]  are fair game when you are secure in your person in your house in your papers
[18:03.080 --> 18:07.800]  in your effects that's very comprehensive and just because they don't
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.560]  label every single thing and say electronic cell phone because it didn't
[18:12.560 --> 18:19.120]  write electronic cell phone in 1789 that doesn't mean that you don't have that
[18:19.120 --> 18:22.960]  protection they're laying down a principle here and of course that those
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.520]  principles don't change even though technology does change and the fourth
[18:27.520 --> 18:32.880]  amendment says that the government needs to have a warrant and listen to what
[18:32.880 --> 18:38.160]  they need to have a warrant for it needs to be specific specific to the place
[18:38.160 --> 18:43.320]  to the things to the people that they're going to search you have to
[18:43.320 --> 18:49.600]  specifically say I want to look at this particular device or this purse or
[18:49.600 --> 18:54.840]  whatever to go through that you don't have the legal authority the government
[18:54.840 --> 18:58.960]  does not have a legal authority to just stop people on the street and demand
[18:58.960 --> 19:03.280]  like Nazi Germany give me your identity papers please you can't do that
[19:03.280 --> 19:06.920]  that's a totalitarian police state that's what we're going to be talking to
[19:06.920 --> 19:09.920]  Paul Joseph Watson about at the bottom of the hour is what we're going to be
[19:09.920 --> 19:14.600]  talking to Cheryl Chumley about in the third hour but that's what we have had
[19:14.600 --> 19:18.640]  and I have a problem with the fact that they're still carving out exceptions for
[19:18.640 --> 19:23.920]  these other things if we were secure in our person places our homes we would not
[19:23.920 --> 19:29.520]  be having these kind of no-knock SWAT team raids even whether some cases
[19:29.520 --> 19:33.240]  they've got out search warrant some cases they don't and the saddest thing
[19:33.240 --> 19:38.160]  about it is that we see Supreme Court justices like Scalia say well hey you
[19:38.160 --> 19:42.520]  know obviously these rights that are in the Bill of Rights are not absolute
[19:42.520 --> 19:45.800]  because if they were the fourth amendment would stop the TSA from
[19:45.800 --> 19:51.360]  searching people at the airport boy it's that upside-down logic we're gonna be
[19:51.360 --> 19:53.840]  talking about that and we're going to be talking about the police state stay with

[24:21.520 --> 24:30.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're gonna be joined
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.880]  by Paul Joseph Watson in just a moment he's gonna talk to us about this appalling
[24:34.880 --> 24:38.800]  story that he reported on yesterday was picked up by Drudge a woman who was
[24:38.800 --> 24:44.080]  forced to strip naked at gunpoint during a terrifying SWAT raid this is
[24:44.080 --> 24:49.000]  Homeland Security coming into her home and of course as usual we don't get any
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.160]  explanation as to why they did this still as far as I know there's no
[24:54.160 --> 24:58.240]  explanation about it but Paul's gonna go over those details of this Paul welcome
[24:58.240 --> 25:03.440]  hi David good to be back it's good to have you this is amazing to me and of
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.240]  course as I said in the very first segment I feel like we've all been
[25:07.240 --> 25:12.480]  essentially stripped naked by Homeland Security they watch everything we do
[25:12.480 --> 25:18.080]  nothing escapes our scrutiny and we dare not question it or look them in the
[25:18.080 --> 25:20.760]  eye and of course they don't give us any explanation have they ever given any
[25:20.760 --> 25:26.480]  explanation to this woman or to her her boyfriend husband no this this merely
[25:26.480 --> 25:31.040]  came out on YouTube and a tea party website over the past couple of days so
[25:31.040 --> 25:36.160]  DHS has said nothing about it so far all we know about it is what the woman
[25:36.160 --> 25:40.160]  involved in the incident told us so while it's still up in the air as he said
[25:40.160 --> 25:44.120]  that the details that she described were shocking to say the least yeah tell us
[25:44.120 --> 25:48.080]  some of those details that are in the article well this is basically a couple
[25:48.080 --> 25:53.360]  in Florida they were the victims of a dawn raid on their home by both police
[25:53.360 --> 25:59.800]  and DHS agents they basically burst into the house at 6 a.m. the couple were in
[25:59.800 --> 26:03.880]  the shower they just got out the shower so they were wrapped in towels and the
[26:03.880 --> 26:09.880]  DHS agents pointed guns at them and demanded that they disrobe so you had
[26:09.880 --> 26:15.840]  basically a naked woman being forced onto the ground at gunpoint the the
[26:15.840 --> 26:20.400]  woman's boyfriend said that the one of the DHS agents then proceeded to ogle
[26:20.400 --> 26:25.480]  her naked body up and down like quote a piece of candy and after that they
[26:25.480 --> 26:30.680]  spent two hours trashing their house said apparently they were looking for
[26:30.680 --> 26:35.760]  electronics and laptops now they did have a warrant they claimed they were
[26:35.760 --> 26:38.880]  looking for that for electronics and laptops but the woman claims that they
[26:38.880 --> 26:43.480]  didn't even remove any electronic material they showed little interest in
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.760]  what was on the computers and the laptops and basically it was described as a
[26:47.760 --> 26:52.960]  feeding frenzy she cut she described it as quote two hours of pure hell they
[26:52.960 --> 26:58.360]  trashed the house and left again so as he said it ties into these fears which
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.920]  were again brought forward by John W. Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute
[27:02.920 --> 27:07.760]  earlier this week which is that the DHS itself is turning into this kind of
[27:07.760 --> 27:13.960]  national police force this standing army that is increasingly becoming outside
[27:13.960 --> 27:19.280]  of the law it's being used for numerous different purposes spying on protesters
[27:19.280 --> 27:23.640]  conducting raids as we see in this case so it's part of this growing fear that
[27:23.640 --> 27:28.280]  the Department of Homeland Security is turning into this feared federal
[27:28.280 --> 27:33.200]  national police force with no regard for the Constitution whatsoever yeah
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.720]  exactly you know there's an article from the Guardian today talking about another
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.000]  egregious case where they basically did a SWAT team raid through a flash bang
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.240]  grenade into the crib of an 18-year-old and if he survives he's going to be
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.600]  severely impaired for life and they're sounding the Guardian is now sounding
[27:51.600 --> 27:56.920]  like the new American it's amazing you know 30 years ago the John Burr society
[27:56.920 --> 28:02.200]  warning us about the federalization of the police well because that they're
[28:02.200 --> 28:06.640]  targeting both left and right I mean we've seen the DHS they post their
[28:06.640 --> 28:11.720]  FPS agents outside Tea Party protests we know that they were also involved in
[28:11.720 --> 28:16.080]  cracking down on the Occupy movement they were caught spying on environmental
[28:16.080 --> 28:20.640]  protesters via the Federal Protective Service so they're targeting both left
[28:20.640 --> 28:25.080]  and right of the political spectrum which is why as he said now the Guardian's
[28:25.080 --> 28:28.960]  reporting on it people starting to realize that this this crackdown is on
[28:28.960 --> 28:33.640]  all of us no matter our political persuasion I think the wider point is
[28:33.640 --> 28:37.760]  the fact that we know they're treating the American people more and more as the
[28:37.760 --> 28:42.800]  domestic enemy that's why they're buying these armored vehicles these bear cat
[28:42.800 --> 28:47.920]  vehicles not even buying them being given by the Department of Defense they
[28:47.920 --> 28:51.160]  don't they just have to pay for the cost to go and pick them up so they're
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.720]  becoming more militarized they're buying equipment that was used on insurgents in
[28:55.720 --> 28:59.720]  Afghanistan and Iraq so again we asked the question who are the new insurgents
[28:59.720 --> 29:04.640]  and as the DHS itself and other federal authorities have said you know it's
[29:04.640 --> 29:08.840]  veterans it's Tea Party people it's anyone that's basically political but
[29:08.840 --> 29:12.560]  we've seen scenarios these raids exactly we've seen training scenarios coming out
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.360]  over and over and over again from the military from training institutions
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.600]  where where they train people in the army about counterinsurgency and of
[29:21.600 --> 29:26.440]  course the villains are typically going to be Tea Party people and that's what
[29:26.440 --> 29:32.320]  we saw when we covered the the counterinsurgency in Virginia now this is
[29:32.320 --> 29:35.320]  an organization asymmetric warfare that's always worked on counterinsurgency
[29:35.320 --> 29:38.920]  but now they're training for America and we know which Americans are training
[29:38.920 --> 29:43.640]  for we're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson and that was an 18
[29:43.640 --> 29:47.560]  month old not an 18 year old that was in the crib just to clarify that I miss
[29:47.560 --> 29:53.640]  spoke earlier we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[32:17.840 --> 32:21.600]  chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the
[32:21.600 --> 32:25.460]  United States well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to
[32:25.460 --> 32:29.160]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[32:29.160 --> 32:32.240]  with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these
[32:32.240 --> 32:36.880]  statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order
[32:36.880 --> 32:40.560]  to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back

[33:00.120 --> 33:06.200]  present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is
[33:06.200 --> 33:11.120]  the problem from time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has
[33:11.120 --> 33:16.040]  become too complex to be managed by self-rule that government by an elite
[33:16.040 --> 33:25.200]  group is superior to government for by and of the people if you've been
[33:25.200 --> 33:29.240]  successful you don't you didn't get there on your own
[33:32.760 --> 33:38.400]  if you've got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made that
[33:38.400 --> 33:45.240]  happen you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly worn of government is
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.440]  nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our
[33:49.440 --> 33:53.720]  problems they'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner
[33:53.720 --> 33:57.400]  you should reject these voices
[33:57.400 --> 34:11.400]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.620]  security objectives that we've set we've got to have a civilian national
[34:15.620 --> 34:23.960]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well-funded the
[34:23.960 --> 34:31.640]  Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind welcome back to the Alex
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.240]  Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin and I'm joined by Paul Joseph Watson in
[34:35.240 --> 34:38.320]  the UK we've been talking about his article yesterday this picked up on the
[34:38.320 --> 34:43.280]  drudge report about a Florida woman whose home was raided and she and her
[34:43.280 --> 34:47.720]  boyfriend were stripped naked by the police handcuffed and held for a couple
[34:47.720 --> 34:52.440]  of hours without explanation and although they had a search warrant the
[34:52.440 --> 34:58.440]  question is is this the way we want to live in our society because we see this
[34:58.440 --> 35:01.760]  happening to innocent people all the time and even whether or not the people
[35:01.760 --> 35:07.320]  are innocent we see them we see innocent casualties many times they raid the
[35:07.320 --> 35:11.440]  wrong place or the wrong people I have sometimes they don't have a search warrant
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.240]  we were just talking before the break about the Guardian how both people on
[35:15.240 --> 35:19.160]  the left and the right are starting to wake up to this militarization this is
[35:19.160 --> 35:23.200]  an article that just came out yesterday US police departments are increasingly
[35:23.200 --> 35:28.000]  militarized finds report and this is the Guardian talking about an ACLU report
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.280]  interestingly enough and the bullet point items here as they say ACLU sites
[35:32.280 --> 35:36.440]  assuring use of war zone equipment and tactics SWAT teams increasingly deployed
[35:36.440 --> 35:41.240]  in local police raids seven civilians killed and 46 injured an incident since
[35:41.240 --> 35:46.320]  2010 you see how even our language is talking about this as if it is a
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.320]  military occupation as if we've got some kind of asymmetric warfare going on
[35:51.320 --> 35:56.400]  fighting insurgents in our own country even they talk about civilians and this
[35:56.400 --> 36:00.920]  is something that it actually crept into the lexicon in America I think first
[36:00.920 --> 36:04.160]  noticed it in the movies back in the 1970s where they're talking about
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.040]  civilians and they kind of did it as a I took it as a joke at the time but it's
[36:08.040 --> 36:13.120]  not a joke and so now here we are 30 years later you've got publications like
[36:13.120 --> 36:17.840]  the Guardian talking sounding like the John Burt society they were sounding
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.040]  the alarms on this decades ago and of course still are sounding the alarm so
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.720]  it's good to have the left complaining about the militarization of the police
[36:25.720 --> 36:30.320]  and we're just talking to Paul Joseph Watson about this article Paul this is
[36:30.320 --> 36:34.160]  an amazing story here about this baby this was about a month ago they broke
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.560]  in 18 month old baby they threw a flash grenade in landed in the crib and they
[36:39.560 --> 36:44.080]  said as they've got the parents taken down they told them that they'd taken
[36:44.080 --> 36:46.960]  their baby to the hospital they'd only lost a tooth and they wanted him for
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.120]  observation when she got there she found out this is what she said his face was
[36:51.120 --> 36:57.360]  blown open he had a hole in his chest that left his rib cage visible the
[36:57.360 --> 37:03.720]  flash bang grenade had landed in his crib and detonated in his face she says
[37:03.720 --> 37:07.880]  his her son is clinging to life he's hurting and there's nothing I can do to
[37:07.880 --> 37:14.120]  help him these are insane tactics and they came in first with the war on
[37:14.120 --> 37:18.160]  drugs I remember the first SWAT teams were in LA about 30 or 40 years ago and
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.040]  of course they justified it with the war on drugs now they're justifying it and
[37:22.040 --> 37:26.160]  still predominantly the way it is running isn't it Paul yeah they're
[37:26.160 --> 37:29.440]  justifying it in the case of the militarization of the police buying the
[37:29.440 --> 37:33.280]  armored tanks and so forth by saying there's an increase in violence there's
[37:33.280 --> 37:37.080]  an increase in people with more powerful weapons we need to you know get the
[37:37.080 --> 37:41.160]  upper hand but if you actually drill down into the figures of violence and
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.320]  gun crime and so forth they're not going up they're going down in most cases so
[37:45.320 --> 37:49.000]  you know you ask what what is the real reason behind this tooling up behind
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.720]  treating Americans as terrorists or drug dealers as you said and of course we had
[37:53.720 --> 37:57.880]  the story the other day about the 90 year old veteran World War two veteran who
[37:57.880 --> 38:03.880]  refused to go to hospital the police were called the beanbag granaded him to
[38:03.880 --> 38:09.080]  death so again another outrageous abuse but why are they employing military
[38:09.080 --> 38:13.720]  tactics against civilians well I think it's because that they're preparing for
[38:13.720 --> 38:18.520]  domestic dislocation and civil unrest I mean we had a story again this time out
[38:18.520 --> 38:23.840]  of the UK about this where police have set up this entire town just south of
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.360]  London where they've got mock buildings mock streets etc and that they're
[38:28.360 --> 38:34.640]  training to carry out to confront angry mobs in riot control situations of
[38:34.640 --> 38:39.920]  course we had the London riots back in 2011 we had massive riots across
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.840]  Europe over the past few years in places like France and Italy and now we're
[38:44.840 --> 38:48.280]  talking about this possibly happening in the United States there are several
[38:48.280 --> 38:54.080]  economists who are warning about this based on things like food inflation and
[38:54.080 --> 38:58.240]  a declining economic picture because I don't think this is going to be born
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.600]  out of political grievances it's going to be born out of economic grievances
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.600]  and it's likely to begin in the poorer areas like Detroit as a result of things
[39:07.600 --> 39:13.000]  like soaring food price inflation because if you remember just last October we
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.640]  had that ebt card glitch where on their food stamps they suddenly had no limits
[39:18.640 --> 39:24.160]  for a few hours it prompted riots in several Walmart stores just for a few
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.640]  hours based on this one glitch so you can imagine if that was dragged out over a
[39:28.640 --> 39:33.440]  matter of days and weeks which is why people like Martin Armstrong who
[39:33.440 --> 39:38.960]  predicted the 1987 economic collapse is talking about riots in the poorer areas
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.480]  of America potentially as soon as next year and he actually wrote a good
[39:43.480 --> 39:48.040]  article entitled will society ever wake up he makes the point that quote the
[39:48.040 --> 39:52.400]  more a society relies upon government the greater the damage to its economic
[39:52.400 --> 39:58.280]  potential it requires a control or delete reboot so he's talking about how
[39:58.280 --> 40:04.640]  dependency fosters instability and ultimately revolution when the system
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.440]  collapses under its own weight so you know when governments become too corrupt
[40:09.440 --> 40:13.800]  to impose this centralized Marxist planning that they promise will be the
[40:13.800 --> 40:19.440]  land of milk and honey for the for the poorer people it collapses because the
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.400]  underclass don't realize that it's a pack of lies until it's too late which
[40:24.400 --> 40:29.280]  is why they're now talking about potential unrest in 2015 and which is
[40:29.280 --> 40:33.480]  why now the police are becoming more militarized in preparation for this
[40:33.480 --> 40:37.960]  situation one more quote which I've got in the article today about the British
[40:37.960 --> 40:43.000]  police preparing for riots is that the US Army War College from a white paper
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.640]  from 2008 called known unknowns unconventional strategic shocks in
[40:47.640 --> 40:52.680]  defense strategy development and it warned that quote violent strategic
[40:52.680 --> 40:57.480]  dislocation inside the United States could be provoked by quote unforeseen
[40:57.480 --> 41:02.520]  economic collapse purposeful domestic resistance pervasive public health
[41:02.520 --> 41:06.760]  emergencies or loss of functioning political and legal order it predicted
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.760]  widespread civil violence so as far back as six years ago the US Army War
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.680]  College was preparing for these that for this civil unrest this domestic
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.880]  disorder in America I think it's going to arise out of worsening economic
[41:20.880 --> 41:26.040]  picture yes and and other documents that we've seen from them they also talk
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.400]  about conditions that could bring this on and one of the ones I mentioned was a
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.840]  collapse of the border and uncontrolled immigration surge and of course
[41:33.840 --> 41:38.600]  they're the ones who are doing it I look at this and it's we see a massive
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.600]  amount of money that's being made and of course in the past it's the military
[41:42.600 --> 41:45.960]  industrial complex that I believe has fundamentally been behind all these
[41:45.960 --> 41:50.000]  incessant wars we've had all over the world now they're bringing that home
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.640]  because they found a new profit center where they can sell these police state
[41:54.640 --> 42:01.080]  surveillance state weapons and tools to local police departments and it's a very
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.680]  very dangerous thing you know you were talking about the stability and security
[42:04.680 --> 42:07.760]  one of the quotes that I saw when we were doing research on the asymmetric
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.600]  warfare center before we went out there and looked at that facility that they
[42:12.600 --> 42:17.280]  they're building to train with one of the things that they said was the way
[42:17.280 --> 42:21.520]  that you can identify a legitimate or an illegitimate regime and of course they
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.880]  were talking about the Middle East was how much security do they need to have
[42:25.880 --> 42:32.000]  in order to get stability now if you use that same yardstick on America what
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.080]  does that tell you about the legitimacy of our regime use a lot of security and
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.480]  they don't see what they're doing and what they're going to be doing as very
[42:42.480 --> 42:48.000]  legitimate because they're really are stepping this up now exactly that's
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.480]  why they're building these fake cities I mean it was 96 million dollars to build
[42:52.480 --> 42:57.920]  this fake city in Virginia they had a mosque but they also had a Christian
[42:57.920 --> 43:02.120]  church remember a chapel you know all all the signs were in English they had the
[43:02.120 --> 43:06.600]  subway all the signs there were in English so again it's dual use yes it's
[43:06.600 --> 43:10.760]  going to be used to train troops who are going abroad and occupying foreign cities
[43:10.760 --> 43:14.080]  but when it's when it's all in English and when of course as Alex has
[43:14.080 --> 43:18.800]  documented these urban warfare training drills they're actually bringing in
[43:18.800 --> 43:23.200]  foreign troops to train them to deal with the American citizens they had gun
[43:23.200 --> 43:28.600]  confiscation programs aimed at American citizens in those programs then you know
[43:28.600 --> 43:33.680]  it's also going to be domestic well you know you know hurricane Katrina yeah
[43:33.680 --> 43:37.360]  when we went when even the people who weren't in the line of it who weren't
[43:37.360 --> 43:42.040]  affected by it had their guns confiscated after after an emergency so
[43:42.040 --> 43:47.400]  the blueprint is already there to do so again in the future in America yes you're
[43:47.400 --> 43:51.680]  talking about how Americanized it was I mean Biggs and I walked through the
[43:51.680 --> 43:55.720]  streets of that town it was really an eerie experience to walk through this
[43:55.720 --> 44:00.720]  town everything was was there fully functional from the outside we go inside
[44:00.720 --> 44:03.880]  the buildings that's unfinished sender block anything but everything on the
[44:03.880 --> 44:08.760]  outside was completely finished and what was really eerie I think to me was the
[44:08.760 --> 44:13.000]  fact that the the stop signs are still our stop lights are still cycling you
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  know as you're going through it I mean it was like a city that had just had
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.320]  some kind of a biological attack and everyone was gone and I thought you know
[44:20.320 --> 44:23.000]  that's something that's very different because always in the past when they've
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.360]  trained about urban warfare it's always been from the scenario that they came
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.440]  in first with an airstrikes and so they're essentially going through bombed
[44:31.440 --> 44:36.480]  out shells of buildings and kind of a desert scenario where they're already
[44:36.480 --> 44:39.640]  you've had airstrikes take out the city and they're just going in for an
[44:39.640 --> 44:44.200]  occupation for a cleanup but this is very different because here they're going
[44:44.200 --> 44:47.440]  into buildings that are completely intact I mean we stood at the corner of
[44:47.440 --> 44:51.160]  first in Maine I took Biggs picture there I mean it was bizarre and
[44:51.160 --> 44:54.600]  everything in those buildings is completely intact and you talk about
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.160]  being Americanized the only thing there that wasn't like small town rural
[44:58.160 --> 45:03.280]  America or a city was that mosques they put it up on the side so they but it's
[45:03.280 --> 45:07.640]  not driving into the place that was about the main thing that you saw so if
[45:07.640 --> 45:11.760]  anybody just drives around the perimeter of it instead of going into it what they
[45:11.760 --> 45:14.600]  see as a mosque it's like oh yeah they're just training for the Muslims
[45:14.600 --> 45:18.160]  they're not training for the Muslims they're training for the Americans for
[45:18.160 --> 45:21.920]  the conservatives for the libertarians for the people as they pointed out in
[45:21.920 --> 45:28.640]  scenario after scenario are concerned about government overreach exactly and
[45:28.640 --> 45:33.200]  I mean we've had document after document we've also had things like you know the
[45:33.200 --> 45:37.760]  paper targets that what they call it no hesitation yes and it was kids in
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.800]  playgrounds it was pregnant mothers and these were being sold to police
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.760]  departments they were being sold to the Department of Homeland Security so we
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.000]  know repeated examples where they're targeting the American people domestically
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.720]  it's dual use and as I said I think it's because they know the veneer of
[45:54.720 --> 45:59.240]  civilization is very thin they know that if you know the food supply gets cut off
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.960]  going into New York for 10 days then there will be absolute bedlam and they
[46:03.960 --> 46:09.360]  know that this this fiat money system is collapsing people starting to notice
[46:09.360 --> 46:13.240]  their quality of life is declining people households are having to work two
[46:13.240 --> 46:17.120]  three or four jobs just to maintain the standard of living and then you've got you
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.480]  know like the G GDP figures today are completely atrocious the economy seems
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.800]  to be back on the slide again so this is what they're preparing for and what
[46:25.800 --> 46:29.680]  you're referring to there Paul is the Commerce Department said today that the
[46:29.680 --> 46:34.600]  gross domestic product fell 2.9% annual rate instead of the 1% that it
[46:34.600 --> 46:37.880]  reported last month they always do that don't they they always come out with
[46:37.880 --> 46:41.680]  something that it looks better than it really is and then revise it down the
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.800]  next month or the next quarter the next report so they can show an increasing
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.000]  trend but they're having a hard time putting a happy face on this number
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.320]  these numbers and they're coming out and saying well actually it's a downturn
[46:53.320 --> 46:58.920]  that's three times larger than we told you just last month yeah and it's you
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.160]  know these are the worst figures in five years and again I think you could
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.920]  connect it to the point I made earlier about dependency on government and all
[47:05.920 --> 47:09.960]  those Obama quotes you played as we were coming in from the break because you
[47:09.960 --> 47:13.840]  know the regulations aren't getting any lighter it's becoming harder and harder
[47:13.840 --> 47:18.080]  to start your own business people are being cracked down on in a manner of
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.000]  different ways so I mean that's that's how you sack an economy and that's
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.920]  that's the way the United States is going unfortunately at the moment more
[47:25.920 --> 47:30.000]  government control more bureaucracy more regulation you look at what happens to
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.040]  countries that do that I mean look at France it's in a complete mess because
[47:34.040 --> 47:38.560]  of a socialist government that's completely oppressed and suffocated
[47:38.560 --> 47:42.920]  private free enterprise and entrepreneurship so I think that's the
[47:42.920 --> 47:45.960]  danger in America that it could well go that way and that's why they're
[47:45.960 --> 47:50.040]  preparing for this unrest you know one of the things Paul is is the story that
[47:50.040 --> 47:53.600]  came out on Reuters today the picture that's at the very top of it is a
[47:53.600 --> 47:59.240]  picture of a of a Ford manufacturing assembly line and as I'm looking at this
[47:59.240 --> 48:02.520]  picture put this up on the screen guys this is the US economy contracts
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.080]  sharply consumer spending revised down as I look at this picture this up on the
[48:07.080 --> 48:13.440]  screen there's not a person at all in this picture it's nothing but a sea of
[48:13.440 --> 48:18.200]  robots and it was just last week at the Margaret Thatcher Liberty Conference in
[48:18.200 --> 48:23.360]  the UK Paul that David Petraeus was talking about how you know what comes
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.800]  after America well North America NAFTA is what comes after that and he was
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.600]  talking about how how are they going to deal with the people who don't have
[48:33.600 --> 48:36.160]  their jobs anymore he says instead of having an assembly line where we got a
[48:36.160 --> 48:39.560]  hundred workers now we're going to have two workers and a hundred robots so what
[48:39.560 --> 48:42.840]  do we do with those people his answer was well we educate them for the new
[48:42.840 --> 48:47.600]  economy I think what they do is I don't think that there's gonna be jobs for
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.120]  them in the new economy I think they're looking at ways to get rid of them so
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.720]  when we look at this and you say if they've got this kind of a near-term
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.800]  horizon where they're going to have robots replacing people in factories
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.360]  robots replacing people in service jobs and transportation jobs why are they
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.600]  bringing in so many workers well that's not what it's about at all I don't think
[49:08.600 --> 49:13.780]  I mean we had Jeff Sessions a senator said that the pro-amnesty elites are
[49:13.780 --> 49:16.880]  treating people like commodities in other words the Chamber of Commerce wants
[49:16.880 --> 49:20.440]  massive immigration so they can get cheap labor maybe that's what they're
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.600]  looking at it's just a short term the next five to ten years max and then
[49:24.600 --> 49:29.680]  after that we've got a massive army of people who have become dependent on the
[49:29.680 --> 49:33.080]  government who have been raised by the government from being young teens that's
[49:33.080 --> 49:40.320]  Obama's army I think exactly and tying into that we were contacted today by a
[49:40.320 --> 49:45.200]  University of California professor Darrell white hammer moto and he's
[49:45.200 --> 49:50.480]  about to embark on a big campaign speaking out against this influx of illegal
[49:50.480 --> 49:54.400]  immigrants and he came out with some quite astounding statements given his
[49:54.400 --> 50:00.840]  position as a professor obviously what is a very liberal university he's already
[50:00.840 --> 50:04.280]  being attacked he's already being harassed by the university for coming out
[50:04.280 --> 50:08.800]  with these statements and after the break we can get into that because that
[50:08.800 --> 50:12.320]  that's an info was exclusive and he's going to be coming on the show later
[50:12.320 --> 50:17.640]  this week well that'd be great yeah it's a is an amazing scenario that's
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.680]  unfolding before us and when we listen to people like David Petraeus they
[50:21.680 --> 50:26.120]  understand he says hey we're 20 years and in after in other words Americans
[50:26.120 --> 50:31.640]  have not really understood how our economy has been fundamentally transformed
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.400]  how our sovereignty has been taken away in the eyes of the elite and so that's
[50:36.400 --> 50:39.480]  why Americans are looking at this and saying this doesn't make any sense this
[50:39.480 --> 50:44.240]  is something that Obama is doing it's not just Obama I wish it were just Obama
[50:44.240 --> 50:48.440]  it would be much easier to deal with if it was just one person this is both
[50:48.440 --> 50:52.600]  parties this has been going on for decades and it's only getting worse this
[50:52.600 --> 50:56.720]  is where it's really being brought in at this point where they're opening the
[50:56.720 --> 50:59.800]  borders and collapsing the economy we'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson

[53:59.320 --> 54:13.160]  Ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here with a maximum alert last week we were
[54:13.160 --> 54:22.440]  contacted by Army personnel by MPs and then by Air Force MPs about United
[54:22.440 --> 54:27.280]  Nations advertisement solicitations that were being hung up in the barracks to
[54:27.280 --> 54:32.480]  recruit them for gun confiscation during collapse in America that happened
[54:32.480 --> 54:36.760]  about a week and a half ago almost then in the middle of last week we were sent
[54:36.760 --> 54:41.560]  the United Nations career advertisement that just went up by the same
[54:41.560 --> 54:46.240]  people saying look we've looked into it here it is for during a collapse gun
[54:46.240 --> 54:49.840]  confiscation to stabilize things and the rank operation came up with the plan
[54:49.840 --> 54:53.840]  20 years ago for this national stability police force this is what the UN does
[54:53.840 --> 54:57.080]  worldwide they're taking everybody else's guns you understand this is what
[54:57.080 --> 55:01.280]  they do and it's in their own documents they want it now it's broken now we were
[55:01.280 --> 55:05.840]  waiting on the report not to confirm it but to get undercover information which
[55:05.840 --> 55:10.040]  we're getting right now and it shows how great the alternative media is the
[55:10.040 --> 55:14.120]  drudgereport.com already had it last night that the you know what they hit
[55:14.120 --> 55:20.200]  the fan plan with Max Lavo broke it it's awesome we are ferreting out even more
[55:20.200 --> 55:24.960]  confirming the specifics but they admit in their own career plan right here
[55:24.960 --> 55:30.080]  disarmament demobilization and reintegration officer these are
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.800]  commanders to carry this out and it gets into all of it small arms disarmament
[55:34.800 --> 55:40.120]  their mission they've got to have serious command you know from third world
[55:40.120 --> 55:43.000]  takeover operations they've got other countries here's the article in
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.040]  infowars.com mirrored Max Lavo and he goes through it all I've got Paul Watson
[55:48.040 --> 55:51.960]  doing a more detailed article showing the whole history of it now let me show
[55:51.960 --> 55:56.920]  you this we broke this a few months ago so did the new American DOD director
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.440]  provides for a federal authority and quoting civil unrest then look who ends
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.280]  up carrying it the London Guardian just a few days ago Pentagon preparing for
[56:05.280 --> 56:10.440]  mass civil breakdown type in civil unrest click Google news ladies and gentlemen
[56:10.440 --> 56:14.320]  and you will see this literally everywhere the armored vehicles the
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.600]  drones the tanks the preparations using the border collapse that's just begun
[56:18.600 --> 56:24.440]  like a tsunami sheriffs have called it like Katrina every day to bring down
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.800]  those areas and then to basically bring in civil emergency or martial law food
[56:28.800 --> 56:32.120]  prices are doubling everything is starting to get more and more hardcore
[56:32.120 --> 56:35.960]  worldwide and here this is the globalist collapse clowered and piven
[56:35.960 --> 56:40.320]  problem reaction solution but getting this out and exposing that they're
[56:40.320 --> 56:43.760]  preparing for it will cause a public debate and they will fail that's why
[56:43.760 --> 56:48.080]  they want to deny the NSA spying and deny all the things they're doing and
[56:48.080 --> 56:51.760]  deny their funding al Qaeda and ISIS because then there can't be a debate
[56:51.760 --> 56:55.360]  about it we're going to force the debate we are the real media we are the true
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.240]  media not the state-run media and this stuff is getting out regardless of what
[56:59.240 --> 57:02.880]  happens to info wars there's drudge and so many other great outfits out there
[57:02.880 --> 57:07.600]  that know the truth and care about freedom and great job to Mac getting
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.000]  this out again we've got a big story on this with video audio we're working on
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.040]  right now it'll all be covered on the radio today 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. info wars
[57:16.040 --> 57:21.120]  calm if you're watching this transmission you are the resistance
[57:21.120 --> 57:26.440]  or is up on Alex's YouTube channel the Alex Jones channel on YouTube you can
[57:26.440 --> 57:30.000]  see that in full and we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson as soon as we
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.520]  come back about this we're the article is United Nations seeks a U.S. based
[57:35.520 --> 57:40.320]  disarmament demobilization and reintegration specialists and this is
[57:40.320 --> 57:44.600]  something that as Alex pointed out we were told that they're putting up job
[57:44.600 --> 57:48.320]  offerings and now we see the actual posting and the interesting thing about
[57:48.320 --> 57:53.680]  this is if you look at it it says the duty station is New York Paul what do you
[57:53.680 --> 58:00.360]  think about that I think although it's listed as New York if you go on the UN's
[58:00.360 --> 58:05.120]  website they talk about this DDR program disarmament demobilization
[58:05.120 --> 58:09.760]  reintegration and it's currently active in countries like the Democratic
[58:09.760 --> 58:14.800]  Republic of Congo Ivory Coast and height and Haiti so whereas it says it's based
[58:14.800 --> 58:17.320]  in New York I think that's just where they're being trained and the actual
[58:17.320 --> 58:22.280]  programs are based in Africa but as Alex has said you know again these programs
[58:22.280 --> 58:28.560]  are dual use we had Hillary Clinton last week talking about how supporting the
[58:28.560 --> 58:31.920]  Second Amendment is an opinion that terrorizes America and you shouldn't be
[58:31.920 --> 58:35.720]  allowed to have it we had a bomber earlier this month talking about the U.S.
[58:35.720 --> 58:40.240]  mimicking Australia absolutely we're gonna be right back stay there Paul thank

[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:28.160]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.000]  me from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson we've just been talking about this
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.320]  article and report that Alex put up United Nations seeks a US based
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.720]  disarmament demobilization and reintegration specialists and of course
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:46.680]  Paul and in context we know that in 2012 as it points out in the article by Max
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:54.040]  Slavo Obama as well as Hillary Clinton signed a an agreement of the small arms
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.600]  treaty we've also seen the similar thing happen with the UN arms trade treaty
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.640]  where they try to stop the flow of arms across the border I was there when they
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:11.040]  were trying to push that through and in let's see that was July of 2012 and they
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:18.000]  had just had the fast and furious arms smuggling thing blow up in their faces I
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.920]  believe that they had set that up as New York Times pointed out that was a false
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.200]  flag attack that was a false flag attack on the Second Amendment and they were
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.040]  trying to make a case that was going to peak right about that time that we had
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.360]  this massive problem of guns flowing across the border into Mexico so to
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.400]  control that we needed to have massive registration like we've never seen before
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.400]  details like we've never seen before here in America that was what the UN arms
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.680]  trade treaty was about but it kind of blew up in their face when that agent
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.600]  got killed and that was what happened in in July so then they postponed it till
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.480]  after the election the night of the election when it looked like they'd
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.960]  picked up some more Democrat seats they said we're gonna revisit this in the
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.880]  spring and when they came back in the spring they finally did pass it as a
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:09.040]  body Kerry said that Secretary of State Kerry said that he wanted to go with that
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.600]  but still it hasn't gone through the Senate has not ratified that fortunately
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.720]  and there's a lot of people who question legally whether a treaty can
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.040]  supersede the Constitution so I don't know but it certainly looks like the UN
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.120]  is spearheading this in multiple areas not just the trading of arms the
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.160]  movement of arms across borders but also trying to confiscate arms within a
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.680]  country and as you pointed out even though this is in New York you believe
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.840]  that this is for disarmament demobilization reintegration abroad
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.920]  but there's nothing that I've seen that says that the UN wants to limit it just
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.760]  to being abroad I think they would certainly love to see that happen in
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.080]  the United States as they've been working for a long time well I mean I
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.720]  don't think the majority of police in America will want to get involved in
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.160]  mass gun confiscation I mean that would be a total bloodbath in fact I think
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.440]  we've seen polls that evidence that in the past so if they really wanted to do
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.880]  it and it would be complete stupidity but they would need some kind of foreign
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.920]  mercenary troops to do it so you know that I think that's why people remain
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.520]  concerned about the UN being involved in gun confiscation yeah one one other
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.600]  thing that I wanted to touch on was this University of California professor
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.680]  Hammer Motto contacted us and he's warning about the illegal immigration
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.880]  influx being about quote the reeducation of society he said that the
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:37.120]  it's part of a deliberate plot quote to exclude the American middle class from a
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:42.240]  UC education center and create a new demographic of largely immigrant or
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.400]  foreign national undergraduate population that can be reeducated from
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.920]  the ground up and controlled much more readily so this is what we've been
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:55.120]  talking about for years is that this illegal immigration push is not
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.240]  necessarily about you know creating jobs for people or amnesty in terms of
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.360]  humanitarian aid like we now see with the Department of Homeland Security
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.040]  paying for them to be brought in but it's about fundamentally shifting the
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.360]  foundation of society it's about creating a voting block and it's about
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:18.680]  the reeducation of society destroying that rugged individualism which defines
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.440]  America creating a whole class an underclass that knows no rights has no
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.080]  history of freedom or liberty and can easily been manipulated into following
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.800]  the dictates of the state so for a live for a professor from a liberal
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:36.760]  University UC Davis California to come out with these quotes is is quite a
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.720]  story and he's coming out to us exclusively so we hope to get him on the
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.920]  show probably next week but this article is going up after the show ends
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.280]  today that's very true yes thank you for joining us Paul Joseph Watson from the
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.600]  UK I believe Paul that that's precisely what's behind this I think there's a
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.720]  tie with the FEMA youth corps with what he said he wanted to have that's what
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.040]  we're gonna be talking about right after the break stay with us in the near

[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:14.000]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm david night here in austin and we were
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.160]  just talking to paul joseph watson about a couple of articles that have gone up
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.800]  the last yesterday and today the one yesterday about the swat team raid in
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.760]  florida against the lady where she was stripped naked they have still not
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:41.320]  received any information as to why they were swat teamed and then of course
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:45.840]  another article about the british now having their own fake towns to prepare
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.040]  against attacks and riots from their own citizens as we've seen multiple places
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.720]  here in the united states of course ford ap hill has the asymmetric warfare
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:09:00.880]  center that staff sergeant joe bigs and I went through and filmed a very chilling
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.520]  experience and again at camp lejeune and north carolina the marines have another
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.760]  facility that one is really kind of targeted more towards rural and
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.800]  suburban america they have neighborhoods they have farms both of these look like
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.440]  americana the only thing that you would not know typically associate with a
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.880]  small rural town was a very large mosque and as I point out we were talking
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.000]  when paul joseph watson I were talking that mosque is kind of positioned in a
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.320]  way so that if you drive past that training center that's what you see from
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.440]  the road because the asymmetric warfare center is a secure area within a secure
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.000]  area so you have to get into the fort and then it is surrounded by high fences
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.040]  with concertino wire we were led in by the security guard there and it was
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.680]  amazing to walk around there very chilling thing to look at that especially
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.640]  with the knowledge of how they have been training for domestic unrest and now as
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.480]  we see as alex jones pointed out in the report that we had just before the top
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.880]  of the hour as alex jones point out we see this massive preparation over and
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.320]  over again for economic collapse and of course one of the reasons that they have
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.800]  given for economics collapse is a collapse of the borders that is being
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.440]  done now that is being done the borders are being opened up and collapsed by
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.680]  homeland security the same people who are militarizing our police pushing us
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.520]  into a police state equipping our police with equipment that is typically used
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.800]  in counterinsurgency wars abroad now in the next hour we're going to be talking
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:42.280]  to Cheryl chumley about her book police state usa she says it's a layman's guide
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.960]  to the latest in constitutional hits that this nation has taken she uses
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.600]  recent examples from across the country to illustrate how technology
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.200]  environmentalist businesses and politicians are stripping the American
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.680]  people of their god-given rights so make sure to talk to her this is something
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.440]  that is in a good way starting to explode both people on the left and the
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.400]  right are starting to understand where this is headed for the longest time you
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:15.040]  only heard people like the john burt society 30 years ago talking about this
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.320]  alex jones has been talking about this for decades now we've got not just
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.960]  conservatives and libertarians talking about it but now you've got the aclu
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.880]  and you've got the guardian talking about the militarization of the police
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:33.240]  as a article that just came out today in the guardian hopefully people can
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:38.560]  stand back and see where this is going this is not a left-right issue and many
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.600]  times as she's pointing out this is a country where government is replacing
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.840]  God you know I see so many times that people who are conservatives would push
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:53.160]  back in favor of a lot of these draconian meth techniques and police
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.040]  state techniques that are being used because they were being done as part of
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:04.000]  the war on drugs see government's job is not to save people's souls and that's
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  essentially what you're talking about when you're talking about addiction
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.520]  you're talking about a medical issue you're talking about a spiritual issue a
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.840]  psychological issue that is not government's job as we said over and over
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.840]  again you know that the people who have only a hammer everything looks like a
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.280]  nail if you think that everything needs to be done by government then you're
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.840]  going to wind up by definition with a police state you're going to wind up
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.400]  trying to use government force to solve every problem that's not the way every
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:39.160]  problem is solved and there's a very sad story out of out of Seattle Washington
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.920]  Eric Holder is there they just had a massive crackdown on some people five
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.240]  individuals who were cracked down for medical marijuana which is legal in the
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.320]  state of Washington and yet the federal government says those those laws
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.000]  don't apply here is that the state of where we are is that where people on the
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.680]  left want us to be is that where people on the right want us to be do we want to
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:06.320]  pursue this insane prohibition policy so much so that we will throw in jail
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:11.680]  people who use these things for medical purposes is that why we're doing this is
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.920]  are we doing that to protect the big pharmaceutical companies are we doing it
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.160]  to protect the CIA's drug running operations out of Afghanistan because
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.640]  you know it was it had fallen to 10% of the world's heroin supply then after we
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.240]  occupied it is back up to like 90% of the world's heroin supply in Afghanistan
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.840]  we saw what was happening with the Iran Contra affair where the Republicans
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.640]  were running drugs and starting the crack cocaine addiction craze in
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.800]  California and were to fund their secret wars this is something we need to all
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.800]  wake up it's not a Republican versus Democrat a left versus right thing this
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.480]  is something we all need to wake up to and see where this is headed because now
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.400]  it's not just the war on drugs it's the war on terror that's how they're
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.480]  justifying this police state we've had some good news today we've had a
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.960]  Supreme Court come out and say that the police may not search smartphones
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.960]  without a warrant that's very important because we've seen that happening over
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.080]  and over again but it leaves some glaring inconsistencies of course and our
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.160]  legal standing of course the NSA is still going through our smartphones without
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.400]  warrants are going through our computers without warrants they're looking at
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.600]  everything that we're doing without warrants and so I'm glad to see that
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.120]  this was a unanimous decision that's that's pretty amazing it's very rare
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.080]  they have a unanimous decision that they supported the fourth amendment to say
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:36.600]  that the government needs to have a search warrant in order to go look at
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:41.760]  our personal effects our our person our property our house that's something that
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.960]  needs to be applied to these violent SWAT team actions that are going on out
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.680]  there and we also had another Supreme Court case that just came up actually
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.120]  it's not a Supreme Court case this was a state federal case where a federal court
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.880]  has struck down a no-fly list as unconstitutional one of the first stories
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:05.160]  when I came to info wars was about a man Wade Hicks who got stuck trying to get
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.400]  to Japan he was taken off of a army plane going to visit his wife who was in
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.080]  the military in Japan he was taken off the plane just before it left in Hawaii
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.000]  it stopped there for refueling he was given no explanation as to why he was on
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.120]  no-fly list he'd been vetted by the FBI he'd been vetted by TSA he'd been given
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.880]  passes to work as a transportation worker just prior to his trip and yet they
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.400]  pulled him off they would not tell him why he was on no-fly list eventually he
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.560]  got back with pressure from the military and still never heard as to why he was
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.800]  put on this no-fly list see that's the problem that we have that's what
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.040]  everybody should be concerned about whether they're Republican or Democrat
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:50.920]  left or right the idea that we have a government that can operate in secret
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:56.440]  this is like so this is not like a police state this is a police state this
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:01.840]  is something out of Kafka out of East Germany out of the Stasi you cannot have
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:06.600]  a situation where you have secret warrants going out after people and
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.960]  you're not allowed to know if you're on the list or why you're on the list or if
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.480]  you ever get off of a list well this is a story that's up on info war today from
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.920]  Kurt Nemo federal court strikes down no-fly list as unconstitutional the
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.800]  freedom to travel is considered an unenumerated natural right that's
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.200]  right the 9th amendment says that 10th amendment say hey if we left something
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.760]  out we still have those rights and and just because it's not there specifically
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.440]  doesn't mean that we don't possess that right now this is a federal court in
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.920]  Portland Oregon they said that the no-fly list is unconstitutional because it
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:44.240]  violates a right to do process exactly but they're modifying our constitution
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.720]  they say by using this secret FISA court the foreign intelligence surveillance
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:55.640]  act of 1970s was put in place to stop precisely the type of thing that they're
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.880]  using it for that's the way the government gets around these things they
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.000]  had the church committee hearings where they were talking about how the CIA was
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.920]  getting to be an out of control they pointed out how it was out of control in
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.880]  so many different areas they were very concerned that the CIA and the federal
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.360]  government in general was going to start spying on Americans so they created
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.760]  this foreign intelligence surveillance act say you cannot spy on Americans
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.960]  without going before this court and and getting a warrant and everything and yet
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:28.600]  what they're doing is they're using that very court that secretive court which is
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.840]  not a court at all because in a court you have openness in a court you have
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.440]  presumption of innocence before you're proven guilty in a court you have an
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.760]  adversarial relationship so you're not only told that you're being scrutinized
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.800]  or tried in abstentia whatever which is what they're doing secretly trying
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.480]  people in abstentia you have an advocate there in that court you have
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.840]  somebody arguing for your side of the case that doesn't happen in the FISA
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:58.640]  court and the FISA court it's done in secret there is one judge no jury no
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.760]  defense attorney simply a judge and somebody from the administration saying
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.080]  we want to do this or that to that person or follow that person and as
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.000]  they're going through these various quote-unquote cases as they make their
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.360]  secretive rulings which were not allowed to see they're maintaining the
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.600]  fiction that their court rulings are modifying the Constitution I would say
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.880]  along with Jefferson that the idea that the courts any courts including the
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.200]  Supreme Court are modifying the Constitution with their decisions is one
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.400]  that is going to destroy our country for the longest time I mean we can look at
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.520]  this court case we can say what a wonderful thing here that the Supreme
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.480]  Court has now affirmed the Fourth Amendment that's nice but we have to
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:48.560]  understand that we have by ignoring this given over to the the Supreme Court
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.800]  essentially an implied power to modify our Constitution which is really really
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.680]  dangerous as we've seen over and over again because they have in many cases
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.840]  given incredible power to the police state and we've seen Scalia essentially
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.960]  echoing Hillary Clinton where she was saying well you know rights anybody that
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:13.040]  maintains that the Second Amendment is an absolute right is terrorizing the
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.080]  public see she's that close to calling people who believe that the Second
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.440]  Amendment is a right and not a government privilege because that's what
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.840]  it means when you say it's absolute you say it's a right it's a God-given right
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.480]  it's not something that they can infringe that they can incrementally move
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.480]  upon and take away little pieces of it when you say that she says that you're
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.800]  terrorizing people she's implying that you're a terrorist and yet we've seen
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.920]  one of the so-called conservative judges Scalia say essentially the same thing
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.160]  he says if the Fourth Amendment were an absolute right then you wouldn't have the
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:51.400]  TSA to which I say it's an absolute right it's not a privilege the TSA doesn't
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.120]  need to be there and we don't need to have Supreme Court justices rewriting the
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.720]  Constitution stay with us we'll be right back with Anthony Gutiarty about some

[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.280]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in Austin I'm your
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.560]  host today and I'm joined this segment with Anthony Gucciardi and Anthony just
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.080]  I turn over here looking at you I'm looking at this new these new Milan
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.320]  Lave belt buckles those are sharp-looking buckles aren't they yeah
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.040]  they're pretty awesome actually it's a limited edition of 500 of them it's one
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.760]  way that you can help to support the operation here as well as look super cool
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.880]  I think those are nicely if you see in the t-shirts it's essentially it's very
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.680]  similar to that logo very nice-looking logo to go along with the 17 made in
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.880]  1776 line only 500 of those limited edition Anthony it looks like they're
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:55.440]  taking the mask off on all fronts doesn't it well I don't know if it means
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.160]  that we're winning which we are in many ways or if they're just all out going
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:03.880]  full frontal assault at this point because I'm looking at how they're
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.720]  manipulating every single piece of news and every single event in their favor
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.320]  and pushing the most ridiculous option and it reminds me of the story from
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.760]  Drudge today about the swine flu crossing the border from the illegal
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.560]  immigrants coming in mostly children as you know we've been talking about
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.920]  shipping them in by the bus load well now the whole angle is well let's not
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.120]  worry about that what we need is genetically modified meat because that
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:32.520]  would overall cure swine flu and it would cure everything else so I like to
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.240]  talk about this popular science article called how soon might we have
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.400]  genetically modified me just like begging people please just let it
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.920]  happen it's good for you and the sub headline is the state of diarrhea
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.680]  preventing goat milk flu resistant poultry and cleaner pigs and it goes on
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.720]  to talk about you know it's so strange that people aren't accepting
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:57.080]  genetically modified animals to eat because in the past they had genetically
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.000]  modified salmon and the FDA says that's perfectly safe you know in the
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.560]  right and fish yeah the first paragraph is seen gently modified animals have
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.720]  seemed to stalled in the approval processes despite the fact that
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:16.000]  positive scientific reviews found that aqua bounty fish the GM fish is safe to
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.960]  eat and safe for the environment right and it goes on to say that maybe what
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.200]  they can do is instead of giving pigs mouse genes scientists could make
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:31.080]  domestic pigs with genes normally found in wild pigs you know that's way safer
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:36.000]  mouse genes are okay but maybe of course the more domestic that Michigan
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.440]  farmer who was and the other Michigan farmers who were raising a strain of
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.200]  pigs that were hairy because they were essentially free-range pigs in a very
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.720]  cold climate and of course they got the Department of Natural Resources there
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.840]  and in Michigan to come in and most of those farms they shut them down and
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.840]  shot the pigs this guy fought them for over three years finally prevailed but
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.800]  of course you know he had to survive he had to depend on contributions from
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.680]  people giving sending him money and he's not getting any compensation from the
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.760]  government for that and they and they never came back and backed off of that
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:14.200]  they just said well we'll let you have those pigs but not necessarily other
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.920]  people that's the other tactic that they use but it's popular science seems to
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.800]  always come in with no matter how bad the technology or how bad the possible
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.600]  consequences they always take this gee whiz attitude to it it's a very dangerous
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:33.640]  attitude for any scientist say well just because we can do it we should well
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.320]  you're not allowed to have actual real hawks will kill all of them they could
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.560]  have mouse gene hawks those are good but that's a little bit of owner peace I
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.880]  wanted to tie this in though to for an understanding here the fact that we've
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.320]  already been through this and what I find most shocking is we keep having these
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.880]  reports come out that even federal scientists are saying no this is really
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.240]  weird we shouldn't release genetically modified animals specifically real
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.800]  environmentalists like that's phony environmentalism yeah we need to
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.040]  genetically modify all the animals it's perfectly safe and clean and we won't
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.240]  have any more diseases that's fake environmentalism globalist insanity
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.360]  propagated by you know the elite who are pushing all of this however you have
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.240]  actual federal scientists I've talked to some of them but here we have these
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.840]  leaked emails where they were talking about you know basically it's going to
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:24.960]  turn into Jurassic Park yes because what they claim is that the genetically
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.600]  modified animals are sterile completely sterile but they found that
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.320]  despite aqua bounties claim the producer of the genetically modified fish to
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.120]  produce only sterile salmon the company admitted that up to five percent of
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:41.600]  their genetically modified salmon eggs could be fertile and the FDA said well
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.920]  that could be potentially misleading but overall it's good and we recommend it
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:51.720]  but even Congress that passes the most horrendous things you can dream of many
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:57.360]  of which are you know true criminals said that no even this is too insane so
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.160]  they banned the FDA who was pushing it through pushing through all the
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.640]  genetically modified garbage saying no FDA you actually can't approve this they
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.280]  wanted to say that an advice advisory panel indicated that more studies would
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:13.600]  be needed before it could be served on the nation's dinner tables and if the FDA
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.440]  had approved the salmon it would be the first time the government allowed such
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.040]  modified animals to be marketed for human consumption and the FDA would not
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:24.240]  label them that's how we win that's how we get them to stand down just like we
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.040]  did in Syria just as Alex was pointing out in that report how in Syria people
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.120]  push back against this war narrative and we can roll back what's happening at
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.240]  the borders and we can roll back what's happening in genetically modified
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.960]  organisms well they don't even want people to know what's in their food well
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.800]  even the government is realizing now many of the employees are realizing this
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.920]  is too insane this is not even part of the plan even some of the federal
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:48.280]  scientists are saying no this is too insane thank you very much Anthony
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.440]  Gucciardi we're gonna be right back with a special report the Alex Jones on the

[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:04.200]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.760]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.520]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.360]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:19.720]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there

[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:11.240]  we are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:16.880]  network welcome back to the Alex Jones show now we've been talking about how
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.800]  collapsing the borders is a deliberate tactic to collapse America not only the
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.880]  American economy but everything about America we've sent info wars reporters
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.560]  down to the border and Alex Jones has put together this report to tie it all
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:34.760]  together. Ladies and gentlemen we have reached a historic crossroads the
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:40.200]  globalist are collapsing our Republic right now in front of our very eyes
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:46.240]  they're destroying national sovereignty to bring us into the North American Union
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:52.160]  crony capitalists that have created the planetary corporate system that we know
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:57.320]  as the New World Order have been very open about the fact that they want a
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:03.800]  homogenized dumbed-down poor global population that can be exploited for
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:10.040]  their labor and who will be very pliable in the social engineers hands and we
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:17.040]  have seen illegal aliens in the last 25 years or so pumped into this country
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.800]  most of them legalized now they want to legalize between 20 and 30 million that
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:26.960]  are left and Obama in the last few years has stopped deportations has given a
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:32.360]  wards to illegal aliens children that are here illegally to create a giant flood
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:39.560]  to accelerate of the deluge that was already there and that has now happened
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:48.160]  we sent our reporters Jacari Jackson and others down to the Texas border last
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:53.720]  week and what they discovered was even worse than what libertarian and
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:59.680]  constitutional media was reporting dinosaur media is saying oh America's
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:03.960]  evil we should have totally open borders and give everyone free welfare and
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:08.960]  you're hateful and racist if you don't take the immigrants in and Obama not
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.680]  having deportations has nothing to do with the increased surge any legals
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.920]  from Latin America and other parts of the world pouring across conservative
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:24.400]  media said gee it's terrible Obama is encouraging it what are we going to do
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:32.040]  we better pass amnesty to stop it which will only encourage it real media media
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:36.400]  that's been absolutely on target like info wars dot com drudge report dot com
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.520]  at worldnet daily dot com have been reporting on the fact that it's a
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:46.320]  premeditated plan to implode the borders swamp the western states so bad that
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.360]  the feds come in an emergency and basically use this as a false flag
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.920]  crisis to bring in even more levels of control and force the passage of the
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:01.560]  immigration reform act that supposedly gives them a legal way into the country
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.840]  when they're already being legalized by fiat it'd be like if your boat had a
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.800]  leak in it shooting more holes in the bottom of the boat and calling out a
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:18.080]  solution to the leak you have it's absolutely insane how they promote this
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.840]  level of nation-ending garbage and this is the end of the country
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:27.560]  mexico guatemala and other central and south american nations south of southern
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:33.800]  north america where mexico resides are in a freefall position crime rates have
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.080]  exploded across the caribbean not just latin america under the global
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:44.960]  depression and america is like a lifeboat as bad as we are economically if we
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.600]  take on more unskilled workers and women with three or four children and no
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:55.800]  husband who go directly on welfare this country will go bankrupt by design but
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.920]  that is the democratic party's own plan from the 1960s cloward and piven the
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.960]  sociologist a plan to use the welfare system to bankrupt the country and then
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:12.320]  bring in total socialism as a solution we know socialism and communism don't
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.200]  work for the average person it does make the political class the new royalty and
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.160]  that's why they've been promoting it with the offshore crony capitalist who
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.080]  are deeply in bed with them because the crony capitalist have written the laws
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:31.560]  to make themselves largely exempt from the socialism from the collectivism from
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:37.800]  the taxes and the regulation like france's socialist party on record that
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:41.960]  pays almost no taxes and have been caught with giant swiss bank accounts
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:49.440]  while making the general middle class have a 101% tax in 2013 and 14 to
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:56.760]  bankrupt them the socialist class is tax exempt in the political area again
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:02.920]  this is the key to the control system so I wanted to take all the reports they
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:07.560]  filed last week and the reports that the John bound and others when they got
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.520]  back gave us some of which haven't even been seen yet on the nightly news and
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.840]  condense it all into one big master report so you can understand just
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:21.880]  exactly what's happening because we didn't know how bad it was as much as
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:27.240]  info wars.com knew as much as I understood about this takeover plan I
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:32.880]  didn't realize that the border patrol lets the buses come in in Brownsville
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:39.680]  McAllen and other areas and then once they get here they give them vouchers to
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.600]  go wherever they want the United States where the illegal aliens say they've
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.760]  got family and it's not just children and teenagers it's mothers and its
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.360]  fathers it is the literal destitute to be attached to the government taxpayer
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:39:00.440]  funded system as the veterans don't get treatment as death panels are set up as
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.640]  old people are being euthanized as the pension funds are being rated as beef
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:10.800]  prices and other commodities are increasing because of dollar devaluation
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:17.880]  the collapsing system in Mexico is the battering ram to bring in all the other
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:23.200]  poor Latin Americans and literally implode this country we are seeing total
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.240]  treason unfold and take place right now in front of us now we're going to get
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.680]  into all the video evidence of this with jacari Jackson narrating here in just a
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:37.680]  moment and his special report but first off let's look at what we learned thanks
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.120]  to our reporters going to the borders that is now forced the mainstream media
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.760]  to cover this days after we broke this news last week you would see it on Fox
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:52.920]  and CNN in part thanks to drugs report calm picking up our articles by last
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.860]  Wednesday we had caught the border patrol red-handed and had the emergency
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:01.880]  manager head of McAllen admit that 90 plus percent of the illegals getting off
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:07.000]  the buses had been given again vouchers and tickets and authorization
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.320]  illegally violates federal law by the border patrol under Obama's orders to be
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:18.280]  sent into the interior or ever they wanted to go unprecedented I can't get a
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.600]  free ticket from Austin down to McAllen but they can get 1000s of miles to
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.920]  Chicago Illinois after that broke we were able to talk to a ice whistleblower
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.080]  who and that's coming up who confirmed that they're bringing in tuberculosis
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:40.720]  smallpox chickenpox you name it an absolute disaster and then MS-13 is
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:45.680]  pouring in and more and more border patrol is now just resigning in
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:51.160]  disgust over all of this because they realize now that their job is to quote
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:57.320]  make formula heat formula and change diapers of the illegal aliens and act as
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.840]  butlers as the illegals complain that the H.E.B. food store food is not gourmet
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:10.880]  enough continuing in the article that went viral Paul Watson of info wars.com
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:17.560]  discovered on the federal government's own website that indeed there is a
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:24.080]  purchase order out back from January showing this was premeditated to help
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:29.360]  bring the illegal aliens in to the country and deploy them around the
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:35.840]  nation and there is that particular document you can link through at info
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:42.760]  wars.com in this report DHS to pay for illegal immigrants to be escorted to the
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:49.800]  US and it breaks down here with a link to the federal government's own public
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:58.160]  website fedbizops where you can bid on carrying out this contract so huge news
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:04.360]  on that front we also documented that evangelical Catholic and Protestant
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:11.040]  churches getting government state funding through the church initiatives
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:16.360]  that Bush launched faith-based initiative they're being paid to pick up the
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:22.120]  illegals where the border patrol leaves off once their buses arrive and to
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.800]  ship them to other facilities and to get them their driver's license and a
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:30.960]  voter registration cards to begin voting to pass gun control and even further
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.800]  open borders so this is the political end of liberty in this country bringing
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:40.600]  in populations that are being made dependent from the very beginning and
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.600]  again there's that story from prisonplanet.com establishment church
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.960]  groups aiding illegal immigrant invasion of the United States and the
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.960]  establishment will not stop there if they are allowed to do this the sky is
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:58.600]  the limit Hillary Clinton said last week so did Obama that we need Australian
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:03.920]  style gun bans and that gun owners are terrorizing America and that our ideas
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:11.600]  our rights themselves are terrorism now I want to go to this report again filed
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:17.000]  by our great reporter Shikari Jackson, John Bown, Don Salazar, writing for
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.680]  info wars.com and Joe Jennings and then we will return back to the info wars
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:27.680]  radio show today being hosted by our very own David Knight I'm Alex Jones
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:33.280]  coming to you from the new info wars.com television studios again here is
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.480]  the special report please give this report out to your friends and family
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:43.000]  this is the end of this country being replaced by total squalor and tyranny
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.200]  under the North American Union if we don't speak up and say no now with
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:51.520]  daily reports of illegal immigrants crossing into the United States info
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:55.920]  wars headed to South Texas to investigate in McAllen Texas we found
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.880]  that church groups were working with the city of McAllen to transport and house
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:03.840]  illegal immigrants who had been recently released by the border patrol many
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.120]  immigrants were fleeing countries that could be considered failed states now as
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.040]  you can see behind me there's a van that's ready to transport some children
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.840]  I'm not sure if they're going to a military base I'm not sure if they're
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:17.320]  going to another church facility but as you recall our reporters went to
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:21.160]  San Antonio Texas and encountered some children at a base there the
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.160]  representatives we talked to did stress that the illegals they were housing had
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.560]  orders to appear in court for entering the country illegally we spoke to the
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:33.560]  emergency manager in McAllen who told us he had a reason to believe that border
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.200]  patrol was providing at least some of the Central American immigrants with
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:42.200]  travel accommodations the only ones that you'll see here are family units that
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.360]  are like a mom a couple of kids that they have determined don't pose any sort of
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:51.520]  security risk and have a criminal background and they've got relatives or
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:57.040]  help somewhere in the interior so that category of people again it was our
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.200]  understanding they provide them a ticket right and then they drop the border
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:03.960]  patrol provides them a ticket that's what we were told and that's what I
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.280]  understood with what we learned we went to the border in search of illegal
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:13.480]  crossings we spotted a border patrol unit telling us so we pulled over to the
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:18.440]  side to see if it actually was following us and indeed it was no longer
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:23.160]  being pursued we headed to South Padre Island on a side mission earlier this
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:28.640]  year info wars had tested radiation levels on the US West Coast and since
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.720]  the immigration story had brought us to the Gulf Coast we decided to test that
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.720]  as well during the trip we had been in contact with an ice agent who was
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:42.480]  eager to blow the whistle on practices in his organization his report revealed
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.280]  chilling health concerns what are you guys doing to help keep the diseases or
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.560]  the sickness to a minimum are you guys giving them any type of medication in
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:46:02.560]  your facilities absolutely yeah
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:38.520]  they can get together with what's the most common illness that you see coming
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:47:06.560]  from the Central American countries later our search took us to Brownsville
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:10.760]  Texas we tried to talk to the public information officer at the border crossing
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:15.120]  but he refused to comment on camera he told us to put in a media request that
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:19.960]  would be responded to within 21 days while I was conversing with the PIO a
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:24.080]  rifleman was dispatched to deal with the rest of our crew as they were filming
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.920]  the checkpoint report some illegals this guy has a gun this guy is a assault
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.800]  rifle our original mission to film illegals being transported to bus
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.360]  stations had exceeded beyond our expectations we even found out that
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:42.360]  FCC controlled media had followed in our footsteps in McCallan we headed home
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:47.280]  but with one last checkpoint separating us from Austin the security theater was
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:53.320]  impossible to avoid like the TSA border patrol screens at mandatory checkpoints
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.960]  it seems like the individual agents use their own discretion to judge who and
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:02.920]  who is not on the level info wars reporter John Bown decided to tell the
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:07.000]  border patrol that if they really wanted to do their jobs effectively he had a
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.800]  few suggestions on where they could find illegals
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:18.160]  hi how you doing hey I just want to make you aware of the fact that the
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:22.960]  organization you work for the border patrol it's funding illegals coming into
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.680]  our country completely illegally are you aware of that we got to talk to somebody
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.960]  of we got chased around by border patrol because we're American journalists
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:42.360]  now border patrol is part of an illegal act against the American people I'm not
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.240]  some whack job I just want to bring it to your attention and let you know that
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:54.160]  you may run into more people like me you can find more reports at info wars.com

[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:26.560]  there will be a job sucking sound going south you just heard Ross Perot talking
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.880]  about NAFTA that was 20 years ago I want you to listen to what David Petraeus
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:36.920]  said last week about NAFTA. America comes North America are we on the
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.560]  threshold of the North American decades question mark I threw that away
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:46.200]  threw away the question mark and boldly proclaimed the coming North American
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:52.480]  decades as the title now it's founded on recognition that if you put these three
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:57.160]  economies together as has been the case 20 years into the North American Free
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:05.520]  Trade Act implementation you find unique countries in terms of demographics yeah
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:09.440]  you find unique demographics he goes on to talk about how this is the only area
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:13.040]  where demographics are going up well that's because the borders have
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:16.120]  collapsed and of course that question I don't know if you caught that at the very
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.680]  beginning the question that he was answering in that conference was after
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:25.880]  America what next and his answer was North America and he made no bones about
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.720]  the fact that he considered to be NAFTA and a North American Union to be an
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:36.120]  accomplished fact 20 years ago Americans by and large didn't get that message
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:40.120]  are they getting it now are they getting it now that the borders are being
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:45.000]  collapsed that they're creating a demographic tension a surge that we
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.480]  cannot support it's a new kind of surge coming from General Petraeus and other
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.400]  global elitists stay with us we're gonna be right back and we're gonna be

[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:31.360]  lot of news breaking we had the Supreme Court decision today finally getting
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.480]  behind unanimously for the amendment I don't know you know when they swear
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:38.360]  allegiance to the Constitution wouldn't you think that they would be able to
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:43.160]  understand that you don't search people without a warrant and their person their
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.960]  places their houses their effects and yet that's what we see with the police
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:49.600]  state that's what we're going to be talking to Cheryl Chumlee about it's
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.960]  been a long time coming the justification has for the longest time
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.560]  been the I think unconstitutional war on drugs itself you know you had to have a
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.200]  constitutional amendment to have alcohol prohibition and then another
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.880]  constitutional amendment to take it away and we've only got that's about 10% of
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.120]  the constitutional amendments we've got where was the constitutional amendment
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:15.680]  that prohibited heroin or cocaine or marijuana where did we have those
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.920]  constitutional amendments where did the government get that power you know when
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.920]  they passed the prohibition cons of constitutional amendment for alcohol
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:28.280]  prohibition we had a government then that respected the rule of law they were
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:32.880]  wrong when they did alcohol prohibition it had all of the wrong
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.000]  consequences all it did was increased crime it gave organized crime a black
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.120]  market monopoly it increased drug use it increased the intensity of the of
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:46.960]  alcohol at the time and we've seen all of those things happen with the war on
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:51.200]  drugs except we've seen many consequences that are far far worse than that
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.800]  we've seen them using this not only has it increased an intensity not only has
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.480]  it increased organized crime but they have now taken the position where
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.000]  beginning with Reagan with his zero tolerance and he took the strategy that
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.260]  he would go after the end user something they never did during alcohol
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:14.120]  prohibition and of course the war on drugs has now gone on for decades what
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:17.320]  is happening with that well that's been one of the major things that's been
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:22.640]  pushing people out of central and South America into the United States we see an
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.520]  article today that the real push what's pushing the people in the United States
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:30.920]  is crime in their country and the implication that they're going to be
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.680]  able to live here free and under the state that's why it Obama has sent that
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:38.920]  message out to them but the other thing that is pushing them so there's a pull
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:45.640]  of amnesty of a carefree existence at the expense of American taxpayers that we
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:49.760]  cannot afford to do it'll collapse this country's economy but the thing that's
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:54.440]  also pushing them is the plague of violence in their country look at how
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.320]  many people have died just in Mexico well over a hundred thousand by most
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:02.520]  estimates this is a far worse in terms of violence and what's going on in
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:07.560]  Afghanistan in terms of casualties and yet that is a policy that is being done
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:12.120]  promoted by the United States that's what's pushing him in here that's what's
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:17.120]  been pushing the police state but now they've got a new method to build the
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.960]  police state and that of course is the fear of terrorism so we're going to be
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.560]  talking the next hour to Cheryl Chumlee about police state USA a book that is
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:31.520]  available at info wars at store.com stay with us we'll be right back

[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:26.040]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we're gonna be
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:29.680]  joined in this hour with Cheryl Chumley talking about the police state USA and
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:34.120]  of course there's many aspects of that how are they going to push that well we
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:38.760]  just had a clip in the last segment from David Petraeus where he was talking
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:44.160]  about how NAFTA has been in place for about 20 years and North America has
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:49.680]  replaced America that was his words that was his words and that's what we're
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:54.840]  seeing happening right now they're now rolling this out with essentially boots
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:59.000]  on the ground we've seen the bankers attack us from the air if you will
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:05.080]  taking our property with the financial collapse of the mortgage markets and
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:09.400]  what might happen in the future with other economic collapse well they're
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:13.200]  going to have a surge a demographic surge that's what's going on right now
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:16.640]  we've got a lot of young people a lot of teenagers being brought into this
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.280]  country being treated far better than anyone here they're not being harassed
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.840]  they're being brought in with dignity they're being treated with dignity and
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:29.480]  bust into the interior of our country that's what the requests on FedBiz
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:35.160]  FedBizops was talking about they said they wanted these people brought in with
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:39.680]  dignity who gets dignity when they come into the United States at the airports
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:45.120]  they haven't told TSA to stand down and yet our borders are wide open it shows
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:50.080]  the hypocrisy the false facade that we've been sold by Homeland Security the
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:55.280]  same agency that creates that the controls both our borders as well as
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:00.200]  militarizing the police and of course we need to remember that Homeland Security
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:06.160]  was created and the justification for it was the false flag attacks of 10 years
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:11.080]  ago 9-11 and this is what Dick Cheney chillingly had to say do you think we
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:15.440]  get through this decade without a massive attack on the homeland I doubt it
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:20.680]  I doubt it I think there will be another attack and the next time I think it's
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:25.640]  likely to be far deadlier than the last one let me imagine what would happen yeah
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:30.800]  if somebody could smuggle a a nuclear device put in a shipping container and
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.320]  drive it down the beltway outside Washington DC and do you by the way if
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:38.360]  that were to know somebody that would be the government reconstituting because
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:42.200]  it would have to be military rule for a period of time at least well there there
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:48.080]  was some years ago program called continuity of government program it was
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.160]  oh yeah that doesn't exist anymore
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:59.120]  strategy that we pursued here and then basically it involved having a government
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:03.160]  and waiting if you will ready to go in the event of a nuclear attack on the
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:09.440]  United States so that we could always maintain the constitutional based
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:13.640]  governmental authority this is what these guys have been fantasizing about you
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:16.800]  know when I saw remember that picture that we got a Hillary Clinton winner book
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:21.120]  tour came through last Friday she's in dark sunglasses on the back of the bus
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:25.440]  and everything and I was looking at that I told my wife I said you know that what
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.360]  does that remind me of it's like I got it it's Dr. Strange love you know picture
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.240]  the mad scientist this is what Dick Cheney is channeling and you know it
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.360]  we're laughing about it but it's not a laughing matter they're perfectly
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:42.080]  capable of doing this in a compartmentalized way I'm sure he knows
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:46.280]  just the guy to put in a suitcase nuke and to make this happen and of course
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:49.440]  this is what the neocons this is what the people who are pushing the
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:53.480]  militarized police state they're always scaring this are always holding that up
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:58.040]  what if we lose the city to a nuclear bomb that has been what people like
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:01.640]  Newt Gingrich is talking about you know when Ron Paul would talk in the debates
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.840]  about how we needed a rational and the same foreign policy and not to provoke
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.720]  everybody in the world to hate us which is part of their game as Alex has said
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:16.240]  many times these Muslim terrorists really do hate America they really do want to
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.280]  kill Americans what they don't realize though is that in many cases they're
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:26.480]  being used controlled equipped and supplied at the top levels by the CIA by
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:29.720]  the US government that's what we saw happening in Benghazi we saw that
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:35.880]  happening in Syria we can expose this and we can stop this just as we're
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:39.600]  exposing the police state and now we've got people on both the left and the right
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.200]  pushing back against it we've got the Guardian and the ACLU sounding like the
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:48.000]  John Burt society in the new American of decades ago people are starting to
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.240]  understand that this is the existential threat to America it's our liberty being

[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:36.760]  of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree it comes out to
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:42.880]  like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition today it is infinitely easier to kill
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.800]  and million people and to control and they estimated that they would have to
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.200]  eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation center and when I say
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:55.760]  eliminate I mean kill I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:05.360]  this isn't a game from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in Austin and we have

[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:30.280]  wide range of topics from politics policy and presidential elections to small
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.400]  town courts cops and county government and that's given her a front row seat to
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:40.080]  corruption government malfeasance bureaucracy and unconstitutional actions

[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:51.200]  latest and constitutional hits that this nation has taken in the name of the
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:55.720]  war on drugs and many other things welcome Cheryl. Hey David thanks so much
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.080]  for having me great to be here. Well thank you for joining us and thank you
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:03.400]  for trying to bring people's attention to what's going on because this is
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:06.560]  something that I I've seen unfolding for quite some time where would you say
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:10.120]  that things like a civil asset forfeiture and everything where did that all began?
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:16.280]  Well it began as you mentioned in your intro that that particular aspect
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:21.120]  started with the war on drugs civil forfeatures but I see the state of our
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:26.440]  nation as crumbling way back when the progressive error began and it really
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:31.800]  ratcheted up in speed after September 11th. Oh yeah yeah definitely now but
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:35.800]  before we get to that let's talk about civil asset forfeiture unpack that for
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.200]  the audience a little bit as to what's really involved in that because it really
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.440]  is kind of an Alice in Wonderland thing isn't it? It sure is just to put it
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:50.280]  bluntly civil forfeiture laws give police at the local level state
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:55.080]  and federal level the right to take your properties without due process of law.
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:12:00.120]  The way it works is police officers they get an incentive from the federal
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:06.960]  government for confiscating properties done based on causes of suspicion of
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:11.760]  drugs, suspicion of certain crimes and they get to keep those properties
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:17.840]  regardless of whether you are actually proven guilty or not in court and what
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:21.520]  that does is it puts the victims in a position of having to go to court if
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:26.120]  they are innocent of the crimes supposedly that the police officers
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:30.560]  pull them over for but if they are put in the position of having to go to court
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.360]  and prove their innocence to win back their properties. This is a million
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:39.080]  dollar business it's turned police departments into cash cow machines
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:43.720]  seeking out any cost to pull people over on the side of the road confiscate
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:48.120]  their cash their cars their properties their cell phones and so forth. That's
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:53.440]  right and what's really amazing is in many of these cases they bring charges
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:57.920]  not against a person but against the inanimate object that they seize so you
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:03.160]  see things like the US government versus $9,000 of cash the US government
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.360]  versus Learjet serial number such and such they'll never charge the person
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.240]  with a crime but they say well you know I think that maybe the money that you're
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:15.560]  you got on your person as you're flying on the airplane I think that that's maybe
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:20.200]  involved somehow with drugs so I'm just gonna say that it is and I'm gonna keep
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:25.000]  it and that becomes a major portion of the funding of a lot of these local
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.360]  police stations public police departments it's really corrupted them by
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:33.880]  allowing them to keep that money and I remember you know Miami Vice when that
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:39.000]  came out that that was a way for that to be glamorized to be made acceptable to
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.200]  the public that hey look these are really cool guys and their cops and they
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.760]  get to keep all these fast cars and fast boats so they confiscate from other
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.200]  people isn't that great you know that's sold that's the way they sold it to us
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:55.440]  in the culture isn't it well it's true these are egregious hits to the
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:00.120]  Constitution and there's more than one type there's criminal asset forfeiture
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:03.680]  and then there's civil asset forfeiture which has less of a standard
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.680]  for police to make and as a matter of fact the Supreme Court just ruled earlier
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:13.800]  this year that in civil asset forfeiture's police do not have to return
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:19.920]  properties to suspected criminals or you know suspects in these cases until the
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:24.600]  court rules you know for or against them so what that means in the practical
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:29.120]  aspect if you're carrying cash in your vehicle you're pulled over the police
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:33.680]  take your cash based on some nebulous charge they drum up and you need that
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:39.080]  cash to launch a lawsuit to win back that cash the Supreme Court says no you
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:44.240]  can't get access to your cash to even fight your own civil forfeiture case and
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:47.960]  I think the case that you're talking about if I remember correctly it was a
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.240]  couple who were accused of stealing medical devices this wasn't organized
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:56.720]  crime this wasn't drug lords that were working on this because that's the way
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.880]  they come at you you know they started asset forfeiture essentially with the
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.760]  Rico statutes if I'm not mistaken they started that first and said you know
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.080]  that's the only way we can get a conviction against these organized
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:10.760]  crime figures because they're so wealthy they can afford such good lawyers
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:14.440]  they're constantly getting off so we need to take their assets first well then
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.240]  what you wind up with is after a couple of decades you have this couple who is
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:22.120]  accused of stealing medical devices from the hospital where they worked they took
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:27.480]  out a mortgage against their home and then the cops seized the cash that they
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:30.040]  got from that mortgage so then they still didn't have any way to defend
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:33.120]  themselves I mean I look at that and I say well if they really did steal all
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:36.600]  those medical devices maybe they wouldn't need that mortgage against their homes
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:41.040]  to defend themselves but that's the kind of dangerous situation that we get into
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:47.160]  when we allow ourselves under whatever justification to ignore due process and
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:52.080]  to allow the system to ignore it that's right and David I just want to point out
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.080]  that these aren't few and far between issues as a matter of fact the ACLU just
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:01.960]  sued successfully there was a little portion of road through Texas in
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:07.400]  Tenahawk County where it was found over a period of a short span of years that
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:10.880]  the same local police department down there was pulling over out of state
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:16.120]  license plates drivers and they were targeting specifically blacks and
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:21.160]  Hispanics seizing their properties and there were a thousand of those cases
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:26.280]  where police seized properties without due process and without it turns out any
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:32.000]  any type of cause they were forced to pay you know some punitive measures for
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.560]  that and return properties and a lot of those cases but a thousand a thousand
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:40.200]  motorists pulled over for no reason except the police officers down there
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:44.200]  wanted to boost their revenues absolutely that's a good way to put it
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:51.320]  this is not a case a few and far between we report so often on these abuses of
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:55.400]  police power and the new quote-unquote rules of engagement that they have
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:59.280]  against the American public where they shoot first and maybe never ask
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:02.960]  questions we report on that so frequently that there's really kind of a
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:06.400]  fatigue that sets in because we keep talking about it it's happening over
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:10.480]  and over again everywhere and this is something that's being driven by the
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:15.600]  federal government isn't it yes it's a US Marshals office and in a department of
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.000]  justice program that started years ago and it just filters down to the local
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  level and you know local police officers they have dwindling revenues so they
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.360]  look at this it's just an easy cash way to boost their revenues buy some new
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:33.880]  equipment you know buy some more weapons get some more training and so forth
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:38.560]  and what's the biggest shame is that it rarely goes reported there's been some
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.640]  investigative reports about civil forfeitures and so forth but by and
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.760]  large these things are taking place in your backyard without your knowledge
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:51.040]  because when on when we when police report them on incident reports they're
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:56.280]  only reported as you know that they pull over a driver and it's a drug
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.960]  suspicion charge so you don't really get the follow-up that that people need to
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:05.960]  understand what's going on you know we just had a couple of supreme court cases
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:10.720]  come out just before we went on air the one where they said the police may not
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:14.880]  search smartphones without a warrant and we also had a federal court come out
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:19.400]  and say that the no-fly list is unconstitutional because it violates our
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:23.680]  rights to do process how do you feel about those those two decisions do you
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:27.600]  think we're starting to turn in the right direction and why well I would say
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.400]  the cell phone one was a little bit of a shocker based on the 90 decision it's
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.520]  very rare that the justice you know and any supreme court reaches a 90 decision
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:43.360]  especially this you know makeup of court justices so I find that very
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:48.200]  heartening in this in this battle we have going on in our nation to turn back
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:53.000]  the cultural and political tie toward founding father intent you know that's
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.560]  one case and you mentioned the other one I'm not as familiar as that one but
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:01.800]  those are two cases out of what two thousand that we have going on in the
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.920]  nation so exactly put it in context of that the battle is far from ended they
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:11.560]  still make broad exceptions for all kinds of confiscations and searches that I
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:14.600]  don't think are in there and when we come back from the break I want to talk
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:19.440]  to you about the difference between rights and against and privileges because
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.240]  we've seen this both from Hillary Clinton and the remarks that she made
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:25.480]  about a small minority who believes that the second amendment is about an
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:28.920]  absolute right that they're terrorizing the majority of Americans and we've
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:33.920]  also seen Justice Scalia say that hey the fourth amendment is an absolute if
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:38.440]  it were the TSA couldn't do what it's doing what is that upside down so we're
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:42.640]  going to talk to Cheryl Chumley again her book is police state USA is carried
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:48.520]  in info wars store.com great book about where we have gotten and maybe how we
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:50.880]  get out of this so we're going to talk to Cheryl Chumley right after the break
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:53.360]  we'll continue
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:05.960]  how long would you last if all grocery stores cease to exist not in America
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:10.560]  this can't happen in America because my concern about a government I was looking
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:14.320]  at survival stuff I was raised as a Girl Scout and their model is to be
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:19.120]  prepared for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put

[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:12.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:16.960]  Cheryl Chumley author of police state USA a book that we carry here at info
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:22.320]  wars store.com about the burgeoning police state and the impacts and why
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:26.200]  do we have this what have we lost in terms of the understanding of our
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:31.200]  Constitution of our rights what have we lost in those terms to even have
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:34.000]  something like the police state and just before the break we were talking
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.440]  about this Supreme Court decision aired just today just before we went on air
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:43.880]  saying that police may not search smartphones without a warrant and they're
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:48.240]  saying that cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:52.400]  from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee's person now
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:57.120]  unfortunately the Supreme Court in many years past has given them a go-ahead to
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:03.000]  search wallets purses notepads which I think are I would I would include that
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.800]  under the Fourth Amendment but certainly cell phones as I said are
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:10.200]  quantitatively and qualitatively different a massive amount of
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:14.680]  information I wonder if the Supreme Court justices are starting to realize
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:21.240]  that they themselves are prime targets for being blackmailed for surveillance I
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:25.840]  mean we've seen David Petraeus have to resign a lot of people raise questions
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:31.120]  about how Chief Justice Roberts would write the Obamacare decision he wrote
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:34.760]  both the dissenting decision and then abruptly turned around everybody was
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:38.640]  saying it was going to lose 5-4 then he switched his vote and wrote the other
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:41.800]  opinion a lot of us looked at that and said and I wonder if they found
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.280]  something on his cell phone or his computer to blackmail him with what do
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:50.680]  you think Cheryl we can speculate well yeah I remember that talk but it is
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:56.360]  curious and yeah what what I think your bigger point is it is something that I
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.800]  I think if all lawmakers and all politicians including court officials in
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:05.120]  this nation were subjected to the exact same standards and exact same laws that
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:10.240]  average Americans would most of this stuff will just go away yeah if the
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:15.200]  president Obama's daughters had to go through the naked scanners at the TSA
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:19.800]  checkout points how long were those scanners have stood exactly exactly and
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:23.760]  and that's why I think that they're so concerned about cell phones and we look
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.360]  at this as like whoa that's kind of an outlier you know especially as a
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:31.640]  unanimous decision that they somehow respect our privacy because that is
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:35.840]  something that does affect them as you pointed out we also have an article up
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:40.760]  on info wars.com today overwhelming number of false matches to come from FBI
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:44.920]  biometric database so Cheryl even though they're not looking at our cell
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:48.480]  phones they're still tracking us they're still recording our faces our
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:53.920]  movements and all other types of things about us and what the ACLU and the
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:57.720]  Electronic Frontier Foundation are concerned about is that those are going
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:01.360]  to generate false positives and you know what happens if you get a false positive
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.520]  you might get a no-knock SWAT team raid at your house right yeah and just ask a
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:11.440]  Georgia family how that no-knock SWAT team raid goes their 19-month-old
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:15.440]  toddler is still in the hospital yes we're covering from that flash bang
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:20.240]  grenade dropped in his crib a few weeks ago blowing half its face off you know
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.120]  that the police technology is something that I think all Americans need to
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:29.200]  really keep our eyes on it's not just the the government surveillance on on
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:34.640]  social media websites and so forth and and police you know they're getting the
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:39.520]  latest military-grade technology that allows them to spy and record on
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:44.000]  Americans who aren't even suspected of any crimes and if that's not a privacy
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.280]  hit I don't know what the definition of one would be and a good example of that
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:54.240]  is this stingray surveillance I'm just amazed that even though the Supreme
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:58.240]  Court decision has said that they cannot put a tracking device they cannot place
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:03.480]  it on a car now these police departments have said well that's okay we don't need
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:08.160]  to place it on the car we can use this new piece of equipment called stingray
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:13.200]  where we can triangulate your position using cell phone towers and other
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:17.680]  technology we can we can monitor where you're going and do that it will and
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:20.960]  Cheryl the thing that I find most amazing about that is that when they've
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:25.680]  been caught doing it a couple of police departments have said well yeah we can't
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:30.600]  get a judicial warrant because we've signed a non-disclosure agreement with
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:37.280]  the company that makes this saying that we can't get a judge's warrant isn't that
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:42.560]  amazing how how is that constitutional any definition of you know
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:48.480]  interpretation of our founding documents it just amazes me what the federal
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:52.040]  government the state governments local governments local police officers get
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:55.400]  away with now and that's just a drop in the bucket of the technology that they
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:59.800]  have you know they have cameras and street lamps in certain cities that
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:06.120]  record movements and and even audio of passersby and what happens is they they
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:10.840]  send this video and audio to local police departments who scan all for the
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:15.560]  cause of rooting out terrorism you know I'm sure your readers and and and
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:20.560]  listeners and watchers know all above fusion centers around the nation and the
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:25.000]  data collection that goes on there the reasons why for how long this data is
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.760]  being collected but what it's being used for nobody still knows that's right we
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:31.200]  got to go to break but we're gonna come right back and we're gonna talk a little
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:34.240]  bit about fusion centers and we're gonna talk about the solution and I think
[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:38.880]  you've got the right it's ideas that our rights come from God and not from
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:41.440]  government if you want to call in and talk and ask a question to Cheryl the
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:47.680]  number is 800-259-9231 that's 800-259-9231 if you want to ask a

[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:42.840]  forward slash Alex now Cheryl just before the break we were talking about the
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:48.280]  police state and in what we can do to roll this back and I think there's not
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.000]  an easy answer is there but you've got it on the back of your book you say our
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.720]  rights come from God and not from government I think that's the key
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:01.880]  realization that people have to come to that's exactly right and to me that's
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:05.680]  the biggest premise of my book I don't beat people over the head with it but
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:09.400]  you know our nation was founded on that principle that's what makes us the
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:13.120]  greatest nation in the world our rights come from God they don't come from
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:17.880]  bureaucrats on Capitol Hill and I think if people first off you know
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.800]  drilled that into their minds and into their hearts then it would it would
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:28.400]  just result in this dramatic mindset change that sweeps the nation and we'll
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:32.400]  put politicians back in their place their rightful role as servants of the
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:36.800]  people their employees and that includes the president of the United States that's
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:39.880]  right you know people always looking for an easy fix aren't they they're always
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:43.800]  saying well you know we need to pass this kind of law or make this kind of
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:48.300]  change or get this person elected and you know the the elections are pretty
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:51.640]  heavily rigged and they're pretty dishonest and slippery I mean just look
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:55.960]  at the thing with that Cochran yesterday I mean that that doesn't do much to
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:00.240]  restore my faith in elections but it's not that simple there's not a simple
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:04.760]  fix of getting a person elected somewhere there needs to be a fundamental
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:09.480]  understanding of people about the difference between rights and privileges
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:14.800]  and also about you know the role in the the role of government it's just not an
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:18.920]  easy fix with an external thing there has to be a massive understanding a
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:23.440]  massive point of view change of the American people that's exactly true and
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:27.880]  I think that's why you also need to teach your kids the Constitution because
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:31.680]  the school systems aren't doing it at least that way you know when you read
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:35.920]  the Constitution it takes what a half hour at least if you're aware of what
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:39.840]  the Constitution states you can watch that you can use read the daily
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.880]  newspapers and see how far we stray so at least you can know where the battle
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:48.680]  starts so that's a core that's a that's a core provision if you're trying to
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:52.320]  fight to turn this country back you know we've got an article today on info
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:56.680]  wars.com about the overwhelming number of false matches that are going to be
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:00.560]  coming from an FBI biometric database we talked about earlier Steve Watson
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.720]  article and he quoted from a letter from the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:08.240]  Foundation and they said the capacity of the FBI to collect and retain
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:12.160]  information even on innocent Americans has grown exponentially and this is the
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.760]  part that I like right here it said it's essential for the American public to
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:22.040]  have a complete picture of all the programs and authorities the FBI uses
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:26.120]  to track our daily lives and an understanding of how those programs
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:30.080]  affect our civil rights and civil liberties and when I saw that I bracketed
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:33.160]  that and I said you know that's what we're trying to do here at info wars
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:36.640]  that's what I think your book is doing we're trying to give people a complete
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:42.840]  picture of where we are what we've lost and the fundamental basis for what we
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:45.920]  had the government created for in the first place and that is that we have
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:51.560]  certain inalienable rights that we possess from God as human beings and
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:56.000]  that the government can't take those things away that's right they can't take
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.480]  them away unless we let the government take them away and that's where we're
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:04.000]  fighting right now and you know as things move farther left as our next
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:07.880]  generation of children in public schools are taught that government is the
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:12.160]  solution to all as our borders remain completely unsecured and we let people
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:17.160]  pour in this nation who have no concept of what a constitution republic is
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:21.280]  supposed to look like you know it won't be but a few years before the balance in
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:25.880]  this nation shifts and you know making the case with political elections it's
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:31.920]  gonna be a lost cause so you know you need to stop finding the main parties
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.400]  teach the Constitution and start some real grassroots swell to bring this
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:40.880]  nation back under control and you know it's not just the people who are coming
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:45.560]  into this country the four people that are being left and young people who are
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:52.200]  13 14 15 years old coming in without any concept of God-given rights it's our
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:56.840]  own Supreme Court justices and people like Hillary Clinton who don't have
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:01.480]  any concept of that or who know what it is and are trying to speak against it as
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:06.040]  I pointed out before Justice Scalia said hey you don't have any absolute
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:11.160]  protections under the Fourth Amendment if we did then the TSA couldn't be doing
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:14.440]  what they're doing to you in the airport so here's a guy who's supposedly a
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:19.000]  strict constitutionalist somebody who's supposedly a conservative essentially
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.560]  sounding the same as Hillary Clinton on the Second Amendment and of course when
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:26.800]  Hillary Clinton says that people who hold viewpoints that rights are
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:30.360]  absolute are terrorists she's essentially coming after the First
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:35.720]  Amendment as well yeah you know your quote that you just said about Scalia if
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:40.720]  that's the best we got then you know really we're in a lot of trouble we are
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:45.640]  here we are in trouble it's gonna be a hard fight that's right let's go to a
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:50.880]  couple of calls we would we open this up for questions hunter in Arizona hunter
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:54.720]  great job today on the show thanks for taking my call thank you what you want
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:57.840]  to say every question I just had a quick question I'm gonna throw it out there
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:01.240]  and then I'll hang up and listen to your answer was is the sheriff of Sacramento
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:05.120]  County now in violation of law based on the most recent Supreme Court decision
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:10.080]  thank you very much what he's referring to is the sheriff in Sacramento County
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:14.760]  using stingray and other things so you know now that we see that the Supreme
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:19.560]  Court says hey your cell phone has got as a qualitative and quantitative
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:22.280]  difference from other things we've allowed to be searched when the people
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.720]  are arrested but that's got too much information on it that needs to be
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:31.280]  included in Fourth Amendment protections so how does the NSA justify what
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:34.600]  they're doing how do police departments that are tracking people with stingray
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:38.200]  and other devices and and monitoring people in many different ways how do
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:41.320]  they justify that what do you think Cheryl is that gonna create some kind of
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:46.520]  an opening here for Liberty well I you know the federal government is pretty
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:50.440]  skilled at making the case that it's all in the name of security that they need
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:55.960]  to do all this spy technology to secure Americans from future terrorist threats
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:41:00.320]  you know against that backdrop though you can look at all the information that
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:04.280]  they've uncovered and all the spy and they've done in recent years it's not
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:08.120]  aligned with terrorism there have been Capitol Hill hearings to show that some
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:11.960]  of these data centers set up around America in the name of combating
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.520]  terrorism don't give any you know worthwhile terrorists related info at
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:22.400]  all they've been using them more to fight crimes so you know if people would be
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:26.480]  more aware of that but it's not a battle of terrorism anymore it's more used to
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:30.800]  justify fighting crimes maybe in a smaller communities will have a better
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:34.000]  chance of fighting local government officials to scale back police
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  departments that's right and of course as we pointed out here we we covered the
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:42.400]  Mayak report release about the Fusion Center that said that the people that
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:46.200]  the police department need to be concerned about was where people who had
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:50.680]  voted for Ron Paul or some other third-party candidates if you see a
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:53.920]  bumper sticker on the car these candidates those are the people you need
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:56.360]  to be worried about and we've seen over and over again that they say they're not
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.920]  worried about Islamists but they're worried about homegrown domestic
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:04.800]  terrorists people who believe that their rights come from God that they do have
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:09.240]  absolute rights and that's part of what makes what Hillary Clinton said so
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:13.080]  chilling just just by itself if it wasn't in the context of these other
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:16.200]  remarks you could say well you know she's saying that they're scaring people
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:21.520]  know when she uses the word terrorizing she's using that to to move that
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:26.120]  narrative along to say that people who believe that their rights come from God
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:29.640]  and not from government are terrorists that's what we've seen in all these
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:33.040]  different scenarios and I think that's clearly what she was saying let's go to
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:39.280]  Susan in Missouri Susan I wanted to thank you and Alex and Cheryl for
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:42.680]  everything you do oh thank you for listening how you're waking people up
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:48.560]  and right now there's so much treasonous information coming out with
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:57.640]  whistleblowers and exposure from people like you thankfully but it's amazing to
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:03.280]  people that are aware of all this that there are others that are still walking
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:11.160]  around as if in some kind of zombie apocalypse and I mean what what do we do
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:15.560]  to wake these people up or is there just no hope for these people
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:20.120]  sure you want to take that yeah I'm like you I don't understand people when
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.360]  they think it's crazy to say that we're a police state in America right now you
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:29.480]  know or that the government encroaches too far I don't understand the mentality
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:33.280]  I think there's a certain segment of our nation that is going to be happy in
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:38.760]  ignorance and you know all you can do is you know fight your own fight and and
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:42.520]  pray to God that you know you make a difference in this nation you know I
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:47.280]  remember when the Boston bombing took place and they had the police going
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:50.760]  door-to-door pulling guns on people and having them march out of their homes
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:55.400]  with their hands in the air we reported on that Dan Bonandy was there and I
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:44:01.560]  remember as that was going on we had a guy who was attacking Dan attacking us
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:05.680]  ridiculing him I remember Rob do going on and talking to this guy and this guy
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.480]  just insisted that this wasn't happening and I thought that is the most
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:13.680]  amazing example here is he's as he's talking to Rob do we're playing the
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:17.720]  video clips of exactly what we're talking about and he said that's not
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:20.680]  happening we don't have a police day here I mean you talk about being an
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:26.160]  extreme case of denial that was about as bad as as I've ever seen I was just
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:30.800]  like shaking my head and disbelief that somebody could be that ignorant that
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:36.920]  much in denial that much of a servant a servile slave to the government that
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:39.680]  they just couldn't believe that their government was capable of doing something
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:45.320]  like that yeah you had Mark Benny who worked for the NSA for over 40 years
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:50.400]  resigned a few years ago and his big reason was he said we are living in a
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:54.520]  police state yeah somebody on the front lines of government surveillance you
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:58.320]  know like that calls it a police state I certainly don't think it's crazy to
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:04.600]  agree yes he was head of the global head of technology for the NSA and we
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:09.800]  interviewed him on this show he said as William Benny he said I have watched for
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:12.640]  decades he worked for them for over 30 years he said I've watched for decades
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:17.440]  what's going on it what went on in East Germany in the Soviet Union and he said
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:22.360]  that is what is happening here now he had said about six to nine months
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:25.840]  earlier he said we're this close to police state held his fingers very close
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:29.640]  to each other but at that point he was saying we are in a police state there is
[02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:36.160]  absolutely no doubt about it let's go to Fred and Nevada Fred hi how are you
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:41.680]  doing good what's your question good good my question is how can the police
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:47.040]  department make an agreement with the stingray device through the manufacturer
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:52.680]  it's non-disclosure if it violates what the Constitution says because that would
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:58.080]  be an unenforceable contract if you and I made a deal for me to buy cocaine from
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:02.880]  you I take the cocaine and don't pay you I mean how are you gonna sue me it's
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:07.440]  an illegal contract to begin with but it seems that the same laws that are
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:12.480]  supposed to apply apply to everyone in our country and putting the president or
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:18.920]  a dog catcher has changed and when they're allowed to violate the law and
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:23.760]  not accountable for their actions then you have what our founding fathers
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:31.600]  feared the most and we become a country that that is has really become Wallace
[02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:36.360]  and I hate to use the term banana Republic but oh yeah that's really what
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:41.120]  it's headed toward so much far ahead of I think it's I think we're far more
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:44.840]  dangerous than a banana Republic because our government is far more powerful
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:48.200]  as I mentioned earlier in the program the asymmetric warfare group when they
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:52.240]  were talking about you know supporting these different governments throughout
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:55.640]  the Middle East they said if we're going to get in involved in a counter
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:00.400]  insurgency trying to put that down how do we determine which of these
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:03.800]  governments are you are legitimate and he said well one of the ways that you
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:08.960]  look at that is how much security do they need to apply in order to maintain
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:13.160]  stability and by that yardstick I would say that we are a banana Republic but
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:16.480]  but Cheryl what about accountability what do we do to hold these police
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.920]  departments accountable well police departments still have to go through
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:25.080]  local county governments and county boards for their funding so you can
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:29.600]  certainly attend some of your local county and city meetings and make your
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:33.920]  case you know petition your local representatives who rein in some of
[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:38.120]  these police powers there have been a couple of news stories in recent weeks
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:42.760]  that have shown people who do just that have alerted the county officials to
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:48.440]  some of these you know police police devices that they want to buy and and
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:53.560]  that the city councils have said no and put a stop to it so there is some action
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:57.440]  that Americans can take exactly a lot of places I think what you're talking
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:02.360]  about where they want to bring in MRAP vehicles into very small towns I mean
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:06.520]  close to where I live there's a community just outside of Austin and
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:11.240]  there's a body shop there that had this big sign up complaining about the
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:14.560]  deficit and how many trillions of dollars it was and then I needed some body
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:18.520]  work done on my car I looked them up on the internet and they're bragging about
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:23.720]  how they donated a paint job to the police department that just got a new
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:31.320]  MRAP and it's like why does my small town need a mine proof vehicle that
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:35.960]  they're using in places life at like Afghanistan in Iraq everybody ought to
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:40.120]  be asking themselves that question and if this guy is worried about the deficit
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:44.520]  he ought to definitely ask himself that question that's the kind of cognitive
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:48.800]  dissonance that we need to try to get to that's why I really welcome a book like
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:52.480]  yours that not only breaks this down for people and helps them to understand as
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:56.920]  you point out earlier these are not few and far between but this is a pervasive
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:00.280]  pattern that is happening all over this country and all the places where we've
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:04.240]  seen this stopped is in a few places like New Hampshire and other places where
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:07.520]  they saw that the police department was going to get one of these vehicles and
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:12.360]  they said we don't want that here we don't want that donated to our police
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:15.480]  department people have to get involved there but I think Cheryl there's also
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:19.760]  the another kind of accountability and that is when we see these kind of
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:23.240]  interactions between the police and the public that are now becoming commonplace
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:27.280]  where they shoot with tasers or just like they killed that 95 year old World
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:32.320]  War two veteran with beanbag shotgun at a close range they tried to shoot him
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:35.960]  with a taser and they didn't get him with a taser we see that the police do
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:40.240]  not want to physically engage people and they would rather kill somebody than
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:43.440]  take the risk that they're going to get a punch in the face and and we see that
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:47.200]  being encouraged by the federal government with new rules of engagement
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:51.520]  out in Albuquerque, New Mexico they actually have the state police academy
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.800]  teaching a shoot-first curriculum that's the way one of the police instructors
[02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:59.120]  described it before he resigned in protest refusing to teach that to
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:04.840]  people yeah it's ridiculous it because most people remember it was just a few
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:08.520]  short years ago that your local police department were tasked with the mission
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:12.680]  of serve and protect they were the friendly officers you know that would
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:17.480]  that would engage with the public chat they were they knew who people were in
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:21.960]  their neighborhood neighborhoods and on their beats and so forth and now the
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:25.680]  entire mindset of local police departments have shifted to one of
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:30.560]  intimidation and aggression where you know even the most innocent of American
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:35.200]  walking down the street is a suspect for something that may occur and this
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:40.160]  mindset is really something that should be alarming to most Americans because
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:43.680]  we've got to take a break and we're gonna come right back and I think there
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:47.600]  also needs to be an accountability to the police department itself and to the
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:50.720]  officers or you're gonna wind up with a situation just like we have at the
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:54.200]  borders where they're told that they can get away with it so they do it and
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:57.000]  that's what's happening at the police departments over and over again stay

[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:28.000]  new FBI biometric data system and they said it's essential for the American
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.040]  public to have a complete picture of all the programs and authorities that the
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:35.680]  FBI uses to track our daily lives and an understanding of how those programs
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:39.840]  affect our civil rights and civil liberties that's very true that's what
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:43.280]  this book is about that's what info wars is about we're trying to get people to
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:47.760]  understand what is happening to get a complete picture of what's happening and
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:51.720]  then to also understand as she points out here that our rights come from God
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:57.200]  not from government they're not privileges they are in fact absolute and
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:01.440]  if that terrorizes Hillary Clinton then so be it because that's what our
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:05.320]  Constitution what our Declaration of Independence says we possess certain
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:08.960]  rights as individuals and if we don't understand what those are and how they're
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:15.640]  being taken away we are just going to become sheep for the system we're taking
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:20.760]  some of your calls for Cheryl let's go to Gerald in Arkansas Gerald it says
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:23.800]  that you're a vet and you want to talk about the Constitution go ahead give us
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:29.360]  your question yes you guys are doing a great job I am a full supporter of what
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:34.920]  you guys are doing and it is an info war yes you got to do your homework and our
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:40.320]  rights come from God I and that's what we it's not taught in schools anymore you
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:44.640]  refer to the we I believe we need to quit referring to this as our government
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:48.760]  it's a corporate government that the bankers control through the five private
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:52.760]  federal reserve banking system now you guys know all about that but that's right
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:57.720]  the average public doesn't David and Cheryl now the other thing that I have
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:05.840]  not seen brought up I was fortunate I one of my tutors was a law barrister the
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:11.960]  word barrister is custom common law we're still under common law but you won't
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:17.880]  see that taught attorney and attorney is not a lawyer an attorney comes from the
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.120]  French word of torn I mean take from the people and give to the landowner so to
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:28.360]  be a lawyer a true lawyer a barrister you have to study common law and
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:33.600]  understand that all right come from God through the common law that the founding
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:38.560]  father set up now you can put this in you Google I say I wish more people would
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:46.720]  do it under uniform commercial code 1-103 colon 6 common law it says common
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:52.800]  law is still in effect we just don't see people educating themselves that you
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:58.000]  can make a common law act in which actually trumped the statute commercial
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:01.560]  realm uniform you want to comment you want to comment on that Cheryl talk
[02:57:01.560 --> 02:57:06.880]  about where our rights come from and how we get them back well I definitely of
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:10.440]  course our rights come from God I'll have to Google what it was that he was
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:14.760]  mentioning but going back to the federal reserve and so forth you know we could
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:18.600]  overcome quite a bit of government encroachment if we did return to the
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:23.520]  gold standard and you know we stopped you know the economic hearing that's
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:28.240]  going on in our nation too yes yes thank you thank you Gerald Arkansas let's go

[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:50.160]  weak in character lacking in knowledge and a weak moral stock will blatantly
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:57.360]  break departmental rules general orders and the law as far as a remedy a good
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:58:03.440]  place in my opinion to start as far as getting police departments acting right
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:11.440]  is to weed out these types and start looking for and hiring and making it a
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:17.680]  priority to hire folks who are looking for a profession they feel called to as
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:23.000]  an honorable duty and not just looking for a job very well said thank you so

[02:59:56.360 --> 03:00:11.000]  broadcasting network network big brother mainstream media government coverups you
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:18.520]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:26.320]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:29.800]  David Knight your host today and I just want to take a few more calls and
[03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:33.560]  overdrive some people who called in to talk about the police state we were
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:37.920]  talking about Cheryl Chumley's book police state USA people need to get the
[03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:43.000]  big picture and they need to understand the foundations of our country the
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:48.080]  foundations of their rights and that is that our rights are absolute if they're
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:51.480]  not absolute they're not rights their privileges their government granted
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:56.040]  privileges their suggested privileges that's why the second amendment says
[03:00:56.040 --> 03:01:02.160]  shall not be infringed the right of the people to keep in their arms shall not
[03:01:02.160 --> 03:01:06.560]  be infringed they knew that it would be a gradual incremental process and that's
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:09.280]  what we've been talking about the difference between rights and privileges
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:12.800]  and how out of control our government is now let's take a couple of calls we've
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:19.400]  got Jay in Wisconsin Jay what did you want to say hi I called first I'm gonna
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:25.040]  say how are you thanks for taking my call thank you for calling I called
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:30.520]  because I wanted to talk about the book I had a question one more soul for
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:34.400]  comment I'm starting to see what she was what you guys were talking about
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:38.160]  throughout the book about the police state and my state with the security
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:43.360]  cameras over the highway and you know they're like they're everywhere they're
[03:01:43.360 --> 03:01:46.920]  everywhere and they're really present you can see them very closely they're not
[03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:51.720]  hidden anymore and the news stations here are starting to talk about a lot of
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:56.280]  things that you guys are reporting now yeah but I did want to make one comment
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:02:01.760]  before I hang up the phone I had a question did you notice that on World
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:08.480]  Net Daily Obama forfeited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem to the Pope I haven't
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:12.680]  seen that article I I'm not familiar with that yep it's it's on the World Net
[03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:18.160]  Daily and I think a lot of what's going on with that has to do with the police
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:21.760]  state here well I'll tell you you say that everybody is talking about in the
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:26.920]  mainstream media now it is no longer escapable it has become so blatant so in
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:31.800]  your face but I think it's also a factor of the fact that they're it's a
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:35.240]  function of the fact that they've reached the end of their game they really are
[03:02:35.240 --> 03:02:38.920]  accelerating this they're rolling everything out they're collapsing the
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:43.520]  borders they're proceeding as planned all along they've had this time frame of
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:48.520]  about 2020 to 2025 as being a fundamental transformation and if you go back and
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:52.120]  look at the book by Strauss and how the fourth turning you'll see that there has
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:56.280]  been a pattern that about every 80 years of the generational cycle as we say
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:00.720]  before history doesn't repeat but it rhymes and it has a rhythm to it as well
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:05.760]  and you know we see that we are coming up to a crisis I believe that's going to
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:08.920]  be like World War two and the Great Depression or before that the Civil War
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:11.960]  before that the Revolutionary War I think there's going to be a fundamental
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:16.960]  transformation of our society and the question is will we understand the basis
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:22.440]  that this society was originally built on in 1776 are we going to allow them to
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:26.480]  set up something that is completely foreign completely alien to the way that
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:31.200]  our founders viewed power and society in the way they put checks and balances on
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:34.680]  it it's a very dangerous time and we need to be very awake about this it's
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:38.720]  just a few years away I believe that that's why you're seeing everything
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:42.720]  coming out and going blatantly in your face let's take a call from Michael and
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:50.560]  Louisiana Michael yes hello David hey how you doing oh fine I got a question for
