[01:02.480 --> 01:09.920]  place right now everything is accelerating intensifying the evil in the world is waxing or
[01:09.920 --> 01:17.440]  building and building on itself very very fast but at the same time love of liberty love of
[01:17.440 --> 01:25.680]  truth love of decency and honor and innocence is also growing to meet the challenge and we will
[01:25.680 --> 01:39.520]  be breaking that down today key witness to WTC 7 explosions dead at 53 this is in the news in
[01:39.520 --> 01:50.320]  focus section of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com I do have his home phone number
[01:50.320 --> 01:59.520]  Barry Jennings I called him last night his home last night and this morning and a woman's voice
[01:59.520 --> 02:04.160]  said this is the Jennings residents so we got this phone number from Dylan Avery and Jason
[02:04.160 --> 02:09.520]  Berners who have interviewed him in New York it is his own number and when I called back again
[02:09.520 --> 02:20.080]  this morning later in the morning the voicemail box was full Barry Jennings of course saw explosions
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.640]  go off in world trade center seven before the north or south tower had even fallen
[02:25.440 --> 02:31.520]  he was the deputy head of emergency management there in New York City and he reported dead
[02:31.520 --> 02:37.200]  bodies in the four-year front part of building seven this is before the north tower south tower
[02:37.200 --> 02:48.080]  collapsed he was in there with Richard Haas his boss who on television on multiple TV channels
[02:48.080 --> 02:53.680]  Fox and others reported the bombs explosions he had suddenly recanted a few weeks ago
[02:54.560 --> 03:03.040]  to the BBC the BBC reported that Barry Jennings had recanted but he hadn't recanted they had a actor
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.880]  playing the part of him in a reenactment that didn't have
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.000]  they didn't have the other people involved with the reenactment that that that really were there
[03:14.000 --> 03:23.920]  they had the actor basically recant Jennings had told the loose change crew during final
[03:24.800 --> 03:34.480]  cut last year there was big arguments about this I really had a hands-off approach to what
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.880]  they put in the final cut but it was one of the few places that I said look you know I have the
[03:40.880 --> 03:45.120]  executive producer position and I funded this when you guys were broke but I said you're making a big
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.440]  mistake but fine we won't put it in the film and why weren't we putting it in there because he had
[03:49.440 --> 03:54.240]  been quote threatened his pension had been threatened his job had been threatened and he said other
[03:54.240 --> 04:15.600]  threats Barry Jennings and then you know the rest of the story he after a year gave an interview
[04:15.600 --> 04:22.400]  to the BBC and they chopped it all up and never really had him recanting anything in it but then
[04:22.400 --> 04:27.360]  they just said that he recanted then they showed an actor playing the part of him playing out a
[04:27.360 --> 04:36.160]  false scenario and we of course preemptively we knew the BBC was doing that hit piece released
[04:36.160 --> 04:42.560]  the Barry Jennings video we printedly did that because the BBC accused Dylan Avery of being a
[04:42.560 --> 04:49.200]  liar and said the video Barry Jennings talking about dead bodies in building seven before the
[04:49.200 --> 04:55.680]  towers fell they said that wasn't true so we just released the video which of course proved it
[04:55.680 --> 05:05.200]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen on September 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my
[05:05.200 --> 05:10.400]  fellow troops I went to grounds here and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did

[09:07.040 --> 09:13.120]  home phone number uh dylan didn't want to bug him because the guy was saying he was so scared
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.200]  and had been harassed so much that he didn't want to talk so we were not given his home
[09:17.200 --> 09:23.360]  number when we had it to see if he was really dead uh and uh sure enough uh we uh erin dyke
[09:23.360 --> 09:29.200]  said he had a bad feeling and he started calling the different emergency management agencies in

[09:44.080 --> 09:49.520]  to contact the family for details we did deep google searches and other searches and could find
[09:49.520 --> 09:55.440]  no obituaries very unusual uh that you would have barry jennings as deputy emergency manager
[09:55.440 --> 10:02.720]  there in new york dead uh and somebody who was a victim of 9-11 somebody who was all over television
[10:02.720 --> 10:06.080]  that day talking about bombs going off in the buildings before the towers fell
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.800]  bombs going off explosions going off in building seven you would think that'd be newsworthy oh a
[10:12.800 --> 10:21.520]  9-11 uh you know emergency responder dies at 53 but that is not the case and and and families
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.960]  are easily intimidated you know uh the uh hit men they told them they were going to kill him
[10:26.960 --> 10:33.360]  Pulitzer prize winning author gary webb for the san jose mercury news he was writing a second book
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.040]  which uh even further documented cia drug trafficking they tried to discredit him but
[10:39.040 --> 10:45.760]  unsuccessfully uh he reported men in his house running out of his house when he got there threats
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.560]  i talked to some of his best friends and associates we played those interviews here on air with
[10:50.560 --> 10:57.920]  ricky ross from prison and they shot him twice in the head and then uh the media said oh it's
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.920]  quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head so we see this over and over again for heaven's
[11:03.920 --> 11:09.280]  sakes folks if they shoot me in the head i i didn't kill myself i love life i would never do it
[11:09.840 --> 11:16.640]  uh if i die of a heart attack at 34 35 years old i mean pretty good shape folks you know i jog
[11:16.640 --> 11:25.600]  every day lift weights almost every day um it's not true and i mean even the dc madam on this show
[11:25.600 --> 11:29.920]  said i'll never kill myself off air said yeah i'm being followed and stalked then we had her
[11:29.920 --> 11:34.400]  her landlord on or the manager of the condo saying yeah she said guys were following her she thought
[11:34.400 --> 11:38.960]  they might they might kill her and that if she died it would be murder she told her lawyer
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.320]  investigate if i'm if i'm killed it's not suicide then she supposedly goes home to her sick mother's
[11:44.320 --> 11:49.680]  house and hangs herself there so her mother will find it i mean on and on and on the point is they
[11:49.680 --> 11:56.160]  are tying up loose ends right now and they are killing people left and right sometimes they even
[11:56.160 --> 11:59.280]  get suicide notes out of it because they'll sit there and say you see your mommy you see your
[11:59.280 --> 12:04.000]  daddy you see your sister we're going to kill them let me show you a video about your sister

[14:55.280 --> 15:00.000]  in uh it it it it was a motion stirring i mean he's definitely a skilled artist and he was talking
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.960]  how he painted it in his own blood and there was demons eating babies coming out of women's
[15:04.960 --> 15:10.880]  wombs and there were these gorgeous women with him just going oh with sexual excitement

[16:10.720 --> 16:17.040]  don't just say that i mean they really are maggot worshipers i've talked about how i did a um
[16:18.480 --> 16:25.200]  in-depth uh like two-day search deep images uh on the web looking for images of uh
[16:25.200 --> 16:31.200]  Schwarzenegger and gay porn and we were able to find them from art sales and and photos of some of
[16:31.200 --> 16:35.760]  the private collections we put just a few of the lighter ones couldn't put the really pornographic
[16:35.760 --> 16:45.040]  ones in Arnold Schwarzenegger in um Marshall law 9-11 rise the police state and he's just like
[16:45.040 --> 16:53.040]  20 minutes of the three hour film it's one segment but the point is that during the deep search

[17:22.480 --> 17:28.160]  some of these dead baby pictures but you understand their real work of art is dropping abombs on

[26:18.160 --> 26:22.560]  i'm covering this is you know a culture by its music and its art
[26:25.600 --> 26:30.080]  and while the rest of the global economy is falling apart while people in arab nations are

[26:41.040 --> 26:47.440]  single artist with a sale of 218 pieces for an estimate for an incredible 111.6 million pounds
[26:48.320 --> 26:54.720]  or 230 million smackers defying critics who speculated that the auction may well tank
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.600]  in the face of current global economic crisis the elite aren't they got all those trillions
[26:59.600 --> 27:03.360]  of dollars that they created out of nothing they're just leaving us holding the bag they bought all
[27:03.360 --> 27:10.480]  real assets like cans of human feces uh that's worth something to the elite uh herst most expensive

[27:17.680 --> 27:25.200]  10.3 million pounds or 21 plus million dollars herst is said personally to have earned a little over

[27:32.480 --> 27:39.360]  that herst was now a billionaire the controversial artist best known for his um mainly for his use
[27:39.360 --> 27:47.120]  of animal cadavers trounced the previous record of 11.3 million pounds raised when 88 Picasso's
[27:47.120 --> 27:53.840]  were sold by southerby in new york in 1933 reports the times there were however five
[27:53.840 --> 28:00.160]  lots which failed to sell and others did not reach the dizzying heights anticipated nobody
[28:00.160 --> 28:08.320]  went for the piece killing theme a plastic box with a desk chair pills and a watch and a zebra

[34:59.680 --> 35:08.800]  that i uh have here in front of me and then i'll get into very jennings of 53 dead during a middle
[35:08.800 --> 35:15.040]  of a controversy with him at the center of it and discussions of subpoenaing him's discussions of
[35:15.600 --> 35:20.560]  calling him before a new york grand jury new york on the verge of passing a resolution
[35:21.120 --> 35:27.680]  a uh citizens referendum to have an investigation and he is dead as a doornail that is confirmed
[35:28.400 --> 35:32.640]  we called his office yesterday we called before but we're actually able to get through to people
[35:32.640 --> 35:37.600]  and they said yes he's no longer with us he's dead so that is coming up but i need to collect
[35:37.600 --> 35:41.760]  my thoughts and go through all that as calmly as possible coming up
[35:48.080 --> 35:54.320]  because in all the rigamarole i haven't even gotten too much of the news that needs to be
[35:54.320 --> 36:05.520]  covered first here's bloomberg financial there is going to be a new financial world order that will
[36:05.520 --> 36:13.120]  be born of this now remember the federal reserve took over the private federal reserve took over
[36:13.120 --> 36:20.160]  our banking system in 1913 and promised no more recessions while they engineered a giant depression
[36:20.160 --> 36:21.840]  which later came out they engineered
[36:28.560 --> 36:33.760]  and now they're doing the same thing and there's no discussion of inditing no discussion of
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.400]  investigating any of the firms that have been involved in all of this in fact
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.480]  they're now saying we're gonna have like the 9-11 commission a blue ribbon panel
[36:42.480 --> 36:49.280]  appointed by this president or the next uh no doubt represented by people that work for the
[36:49.280 --> 36:54.560]  very firms that did all this it'll be called independent like having jack the ripper said
[36:54.560 --> 37:01.920]  as the judge in the trial of jack the ripper and then the public will be told uh basically
[37:01.920 --> 37:06.160]  that it's all their fault or something and then the panel will recommend giving total
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.040]  power over the private banks as they're already recommending so that's where all this is going
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.600]  and the american people are going to have to bail this out every day
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.240]  there's a new 50 or 70 or 85 billion or in the case of two weeks ago
[37:24.240 --> 37:32.480]  with fanny man freddy mac a 50 something trillion dollar bailout i mean these numbers
[37:32.480 --> 37:36.080]  we're talking about the entire gdp of the country's little over two trillion a year
[37:38.640 --> 37:41.840]  right up at three trillion i mean we're talking about numbers that
[37:43.280 --> 37:46.880]  and again these robber barons and their families and their allies i mean even the
[37:46.880 --> 37:53.600]  minions of these international bankers own giant 10 bedroom yachts and castles and homes
[37:53.600 --> 38:01.280]  in every major capital of the world and huge flocks of servants
[38:04.400 --> 38:07.280]  they never get in a bathtub that isn't solid gold or platinum
[38:09.200 --> 38:14.480]  hundreds of mistresses of peace in some cases that's why they're into killing little kids because
[38:14.480 --> 38:19.680]  they they're so decadent that it's like the new caviar for them these people when you see them
[38:19.680 --> 38:27.120]  they revel in yachts and revel in money and revel in jewels oh yes oh but specialties delicacies
[38:27.120 --> 38:33.600]  you see are very important to them snuff films the rest of it after they watch enough snuff films
[38:33.600 --> 38:41.040]  become solid from that it's ideally want to participate and then hollywood tells you what
[38:41.040 --> 38:47.440]  they're into their films like eight millimeter and so there's no doubt this is deepening fast
[38:47.440 --> 38:51.920]  there's no doubt it's going into a depression now we had hoped in the last year that this would not
[38:51.920 --> 38:58.320]  be the case the quote bailouts are the real scam they're the final coup de grace because
[38:58.960 --> 39:04.400]  instead of it just being hundreds of billions of dollars of fiat currency and and and false assets
[39:04.400 --> 39:11.760]  and dummy assets and ponzi assets they created they are now somehow fooled the american people
[39:11.760 --> 39:17.360]  and and and the congress i don't want to say they fooled in fact the american people are actually mad
[39:17.360 --> 39:22.640]  about the bailouts and polls but they fooled some people into believing that this is saving the economy
[39:22.640 --> 39:29.200]  to now have these offshore corporations who all got laws passed to to for tax free for them to move
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.600]  offshore in the last two years if they got all their money offshore they made the law or the
[39:33.600 --> 39:38.640]  middle class or what's left of it can't escape and basically can't take anything offshore
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.600]  or they are real bastards man because they got to keep us here to keep milking us
[39:47.040 --> 39:53.600]  so us to take over aig and 85 billion dollar bailout central banks inject cash as credit drives up
[39:55.120 --> 40:02.080]  emergency loan effectively gives government control of insurer historic move would cap
[40:02.080 --> 40:10.400]  10 days that reshape u.s finance see the insurer of all these fake securities going bankrupt there's
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.400]  lots of media spin that maryl lynch wasn't in trouble in bank of america took it over
[40:14.400 --> 40:22.880]  two days ago of course it is just like everything else but pelosi says the dims bear no responsibility
[40:22.880 --> 40:30.560]  for the economic crisis now speaker nancy pelosi when asked whether democrats bear some
[40:30.560 --> 40:36.480]  responsibility with the current crisis on washington has one word answer no
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.240]  pelosi rip president bush's mismanagement of the economy and lack of regulation
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.760]  the lead of the current situation again they're all together they vote lockstep 95 percent of
[40:47.760 --> 40:53.760]  the time and that's an average it's a real number 95 percent of the time in the senate it's like
[40:53.760 --> 41:00.880]  80 something in the house the senate really runs things and it was bill clinton
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.840]  would try secretary summers and others that loosened all of these regulations up
[41:05.840 --> 41:12.560]  where they could sell thin air as triple a rated securities and then have it backed up by the us
[41:12.560 --> 41:19.040]  taxpayer and she's voted for the war since they've been in office another trillion dollars has been
[41:19.040 --> 41:24.400]  spent on the war that's just currently set the three trillion but while she's been speaker
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.720]  while the democrats have been in control almost two years and uh she just says oh no we're not
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.120]  involved in any of that and the republicans are pointing their finger at clinton when they're all
[41:35.120 --> 41:42.960]  doing the same thing they're just puppets they just follow orders while the heist of all history
[41:42.960 --> 41:51.680]  took place and on a daily basis on a daily basis because you hear that this is an 85
[41:51.680 --> 41:58.880]  billion dollar bailout but then it's admitted that they were leveraged conservatively hundreds of
[41:58.880 --> 42:05.840]  times hundreds of times so let what is let's just be conservative a hundred times 85 billion
[42:05.840 --> 42:13.040]  that's really what taxpayers just signed on to and uh fanny man freddy mac leveraged
[42:13.760 --> 42:21.440]  close to a hundred times the media saying so what's a hundred times 54 trillion
[42:25.520 --> 42:27.520]  i mean are you starting to get an idea here
[42:30.800 --> 42:35.200]  and we're supposedly bankrupt but they got money for presents and cops like it's going on a style
[42:35.200 --> 42:41.680]  because they are the repossessors they are the robbers men you understand that
[42:43.760 --> 42:45.920]  now the individual cops are going to lose their future too
[42:47.120 --> 42:50.320]  their grandpa their grandma their brothers sisters you weren't they're all going to be in
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.680]  trouble it won't matter it's still about being bowed down to in that uniform it's still about
[42:55.680 --> 43:02.480]  people getting out of their way and so hey go ahead don't let me get in the way or happiness
[43:02.480 --> 43:10.320]  and success us to take over aig and 85 billion dollar bailout central banks inject cash as credit
[43:10.320 --> 43:15.600]  drives up emergency loan effectively gives government control over insurer the u.s government
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.320]  sees control of american international group one of the world's biggest insurers and an 85
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.480]  billion dollar deal that signaled the intensity of its concerns about the danger of collapse
[43:24.480 --> 43:28.320]  could pose in the financial system collapse that's the wall street journal
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.680]  who's been telling you about this for at least nine years in detail that fanny
[43:33.680 --> 43:37.920]  man freddy mac would go under who told you all this because we actually study here
[43:40.160 --> 43:44.000]  and when we tell you that children are on the menu with the elite literally
[43:47.280 --> 43:52.720]  and car zoom marzoo live maggots are on the elites menu you know fine italian restaurants in
[43:52.720 --> 43:59.360]  new york serve cars in marzoo they also serve i can't i forget the italian word for it catacomb
[43:59.360 --> 44:07.120]  bones boiled that's even more expensive i'm kind of digressing here you see this is who were oh
[44:07.120 --> 44:12.000]  don't laugh google cars in marzoo google italian soup made of human bones
[44:16.080 --> 44:20.000]  that's what it's all about who can be the darkest who can be the most evil
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.880]  who can revel the most with the dumb smiling schmucks that think this is mayberry rfd
[44:26.880 --> 44:33.440]  oh no it's not mayberry it's not kansas it's eighties the gates of hell are now opening for us
[44:34.720 --> 44:40.080]  we could at least fight back probably not most of you will just deny all this and cheerlead it
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.600]  soros compares mishandling of current crisis to great depression though he's been
[44:45.600 --> 44:51.040]  helping the engineer and trying to collapse the dollar all along story about paul joseph watson
[44:51.040 --> 44:55.520]  millionaire investor george soros has slammed u.s treasury secretary hank paulson for behaving in
[44:55.520 --> 44:59.760]  the same manner as the bankers of the 1930s the mishandling of financial crisis that threatens
[44:59.760 --> 45:04.640]  a repeat of the great depression he told bbc news that the world was merely at the beginning
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.720]  of an angel storm and warned we mustn't allow the financial system to collapse as it did 1930s
[45:09.600 --> 45:12.000]  so he's now posing as the good guys he always does
[45:12.000 --> 45:19.200]  treasuries three-month bill rate drops to lowest since 1954
[45:20.160 --> 45:23.680]  u.s treasuries three-month bill rates dropped to the lowest since
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.360]  nine fifty four i'm concerned that credit market losses will widen after bankruptcy
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.040]  of leeman brothers holdings and the federal takeover of america international group
[45:31.040 --> 45:36.160]  so now the credit of the u.s government's going down what paul craig roberts said last week he most
[45:36.160 --> 45:41.360]  feared even hearing these rumors about a collapse in late september for a few months down i said
[45:41.360 --> 45:47.120]  they're probably just rumors though historically september october is when depression start
[45:48.320 --> 45:51.040]  but hey the news can just say there's not one when you're out of work
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.200]  now again they've looted the country got rid of all the industry moved overseas
[45:59.200 --> 46:03.040]  had tax shelters for themselves had the laws written they could move overseas now they've
[46:03.040 --> 46:08.480]  passed laws where you can't get basically any of your money out that's what global government's
[46:08.480 --> 46:13.760]  about me we see these about it's coming and getting anybody that runs except for the elites
[46:13.760 --> 46:22.160]  who are selectively enforced on and now they are running the dead out just to infinity in our name
[46:22.160 --> 46:31.040]  and then they're busy buying diamond encrusted skulls for 99 million dollars
[46:31.040 --> 46:40.080]  and jars of maggots for 10 million and photos of dead babies for five million
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.760]  and and why not that's an expression of it i mean you think that's the wealth those are just
[46:47.760 --> 46:57.920]  little bobbles and trinkets that's nothing right now george bush has been selling off
[46:57.920 --> 47:02.480]  most of the federal lands to international corporations and others not to american citizens
[47:02.480 --> 47:07.760]  and most of its land stolen from ranchers and farmers and his daddy runs the big brokerage
[47:07.760 --> 47:14.160]  firm that's running at all just a mass criminal stealing everywhere and a public still in denial
[47:14.160 --> 47:18.800]  i like the democrats they're anti bush i like the republicans they're anti-democrat
[47:19.360 --> 47:25.280]  don't you talk about george w he's a real taxing still believing that pipe during that madison

[57:58.000 --> 58:04.080]  and notice once you put the symbol of evil on your uniform it didn't take long for everything to
[58:04.080 --> 58:10.080]  degrade did it until now we're known as the bad guys now they put human skulls on the tanks and

[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:51.520]  in an article posted on info wars dot com called the denouncement
[1:00:51.520 --> 1:01:01.600]  and when you get into the report you can read these quotes the central bank is an institution of
[1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:08.240]  the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of our constitution
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.840]  and the american people allow private banks to control the issuance of the currency
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.800]  first by inflation and by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:21.920]  will deprive the people of all their property until their children wake up homeless on the
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:27.760]  continent their fathers occupied thomas jefferson said that more than 200 years ago and you're
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:37.040]  about to wake up homeless listen to this quote by indra jackson you are the den of vipers and thieves
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:45.600]  i intend to route you out and by the eternal god i will route you out if the american people
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:50.720]  only understood the rank injustice of our money in banking system there would be a revolution
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:58.560]  before mourning andrew jackson they tried to kill seven times the great depression was
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:04.320]  and it just goes on from their bunch of quotes
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:12.640]  listen to this the drive of the rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:19.760]  all under their control do i mean conspiracy yes i do i am convinced there is such a plot
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:26.080]  international in scope generations old and planning and incredibly evil and intent congressman larry
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:32.240]  p mcdonald 1976 and they landed his airplane and tortured him to death boy they killed him
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:41.360]  permit me to issue and control the money of a nation and i dare not and i care not who makes

[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:57.440]  and it goes on and on but uh
[1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:05.200]  that's the type of issue we're dealing with here and we're now at the final phase see generationally
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:10.000]  these private bankers first they can control your banking system and your treasury then they control
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.120]  the issuance of currency and credit then they buy up the media other banks getting incredible power
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:19.280]  generation by generation and from time to time they fully implode economies we have their own
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:25.040]  imf whole bank documents on this to fully bring economies down so everything comes to a standstill
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:32.720]  so only they have wealth then they also control the military and police and like take argentina in

[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:31.920]  every form of wickedness and corruption is expanding and multiplying as well the battle
[1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:38.800]  is joined just masses of news coming up youtube's version of homegrown terrorism prevention act
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:48.800]  out in the open censorship of anti-war anti-corruption views anti-vaccine news
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:55.040]  any video of us military atrocities being banned we're talking about stuff that's on front line
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:09:00.880]  and on cnn but they're forced to report on it after it breaks on youtube and other places
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:05.760]  but but we've seen cases where mainstream media is covering something but youtube will ban it
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:09.760]  and say it's not authorized while michelle malkin you know said that the marines throwing the
[1:09:09.760 --> 1:09:14.240]  puppy off the cliff was fake was already admitted to be real youtube was banning and saying it was
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:21.520]  fake so all working in the concert together big news there big attack on the first amendment
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:26.240]  not in europe where they're getting rid of the free speech but right here in the united states
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:35.680]  uh so it is uh all coming down the bottom line on the economy is we allowed private families to
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:40.880]  take over the issuance of currency and credit in 1913 they bought control of the military the police
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:46.080]  the governments uh the media every sector of the economy the universities with endowments
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:54.480]  and uh now they're in the final ponzi scheme they've done this in third world countries but
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:00.880]  nothing ever on this scale we're under the current credit of the currency and credit
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:08.480]  of the nation the united states they are now in a frenzy these are not bailouts these are
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:14.240]  mass consolidations by the private fellow reserve families backed up by the united states with
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:20.720]  trillions of dollars uh being transferred into their accounts and then instantly leveraged into
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:30.720]  gold silver uh diamonds manufacturing yachts land intellectual properties media defense uh
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:36.960]  they're just buying everything art they are just gobbling and grabbing everything that's why gold
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:42.880]  that's why gold uh went up over 50 dollars today we told you that was only a respite
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:47.920]  while all these quote bailouts happened of hundreds of billions of dollars a day for the
[1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:53.360]  last few months hundreds of billions a day the elites were just grabbing everything up i mean
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:11:03.600]  again yachts gold diamonds uh museum pieces just uh companies anything of real value
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:10.480]  oil and and let you know how bad the corruption is uh it's in the texas news with even clinton
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:15.920]  williams and oilman and people where where oil companies aren't even paying them their royalties
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:20.800]  right now it's just it's it's it's as if nothing's gonna be here soon this has never happened before
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:27.040]  it's just lawlessness everywhere land grabbing grand you'll pay in three four five times what water
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:35.760]  systems are worth what water aquifers are worth mass stealing everywhere it is all coming down right
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:45.200]  down and we told you this would happen it's all in the imf and world bank documents they told
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:53.280]  us what they do uh and it is just completely shocking to me to know this was coming and to
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:58.080]  know this was the plan but to talk about it for all these years and to see it manifesting
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:05.040]  and that creates an incredible chill in my gut but also a burning desire then that overrides
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:10.400]  that to warn people it's like when you know the dam's broken and you're up the river five miles
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:14.400]  and you know in a few minutes it's going to hit the town below and kill everybody you get on the cb
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:18.640]  and you try to raise the sheriff's department saying the dam broke the dam broke you know there's
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:22.720]  50 feet of water moving fast coming you only got a few minutes 10 minutes or so to get out
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:29.680]  and the sheriff's deputy just starts laughing at you and you're like listen i'm not kidding around
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:37.120]  with you this is coming but in this case the water's already overrun half the town and and
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:43.440]  the sheriff's deputies are still laughing and picking their nose god help us god help us
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:47.760]  they've built FEMA camps they're poisoning us through eugenics they're involved in all manner of
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:53.680]  evil it comes out mainstream news that haliburton and dinecore run giant child kidnapping and and
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:13:00.240]  female kidnapping rings and nothing happens major news reports it it comes out that bear
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:05.280]  ships out over a million ampoules of blood that's going to get every person that takes it hiv and
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:09.840]  hepatitis and then it happens and it turns out they knew and did it on purpose i mean that's
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:15.920]  that's just one i keep mentioning that because that's confirmed these people are deadly dangerous
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:22.960]  and then you find out the rage for decades by the entire elite by billionaires is is is is
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:27.760]  his car wrecks dead children and maggot covered dead children and that's what they hang in their
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:32.640]  private areas of their homes i mean god help us folks more door has been opened
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:43.520]  and more door hell the black gate whatever you want to call it an archetypal imagery god help us
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:52.080]  you know girt yourselves for battle steal yourselves just gut up i've got to gut up every
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:56.320]  hour now just looking at this come down and i see people around me they don't understand how
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:14:01.200]  serious this is people in the quote truth movement or patriot movement they don't understand this is
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:04.400]  life and death ladies and gentlemen this is the real thing
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:13.280]  because that's what it means the fact that they're doing everything they said they do and every time
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:18.160]  it just is as bad as they said they would do it and even worse it lets me know they are following
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:23.360]  the exact trajectory they promised and my god that means at the end helicopters flying over
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:29.760]  our cities nerve-gassing us to death and just orderly grid patterns killing us you know they've
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:36.720]  said that's the plan and god help us and i'm staying here at the helm of my little attack
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:41.600]  frigate in this fight i'm staying here right in the middle of the battle and the amazing thing is
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:46.960]  the average person has no idea there is there is world revolution going on all around them the
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:52.640]  elite waging war against humanity war against the family war against your health war against the
[1:14:52.640 --> 1:15:01.280]  economy war against rogue nations they don't control a handful just absolute pit of hell nihilistic
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:10.880]  warmongering just hyper dominance gone to seed with a sadistic psychopathic overlay mindset that's
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:17.680]  the modus operandi that's the assessment i mean come on fbi assessors assess yourselves assess
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:25.360]  your bosses assess what you've done assess how you are slowly twisted in the 20s taking pay
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:30.240]  officer and prohibition to look the other way for liquor and prostitution to what that led you to
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:38.240]  today what you turn a blind eye to today child kidnapping rings and ask yourselves is that what
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:46.320]  life is all about and i'll give you the analogy again my friend darrell gave me you know i've
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:50.800]  had people say i'll sell out to the new world order i'd sell out for money and power and i say
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:55.760]  to them what is it profit a man to gain the whole world loses soul my friend darrell said we'll give
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:03.360]  him you know one of them go even further ask him would you give ten thousand dollars i'll pay a
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:07.840]  ten thousand dollars to go to a clinic remove your eyes you know people can sell kidneys they can

[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:33.600]  the eyes are the window to the soul it's people always see that as well i can look into somebody's
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.600]  soul through their eyes and you can but it's other but but it's more important from the inside out
[1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:44.160]  that's how you look out now there's other senses and those that are blind are able to develop the

[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:08.640]  than some big luxury yacht or you know the most beautiful number 10 woman wanting me
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:14.240]  and i'll tell you there was a time when i was maybe 1415 16 more worldly where i wanted those
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:19.120]  things but i realized they are rags they are dirt they they they they they crumble in your hand
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:25.200]  they mean nothing they are nothing the only thing wealth's good for is to help others and protect
[1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:31.120]  yourself from evil because the evil you know is scared of a little bit of money a little bit of
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:36.960]  power and they feed on the weak but this as this evil waxes and expands it feeds on the innocent
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:51.520]  i'm begging you from the bottom of my heart i'm begging you they teach you to be committed to
[1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:56.480]  the lies you've been taught they teach you to be committed to the false reality and end these
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:04.080]  pipe dreams you're given but really assess what we are as a country assess what the world is assess
[1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:09.520]  what fallen man does and realize that all that matters in this life is that you get yourself
[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:16.640]  straight and that you be a good person and that you not be turned over to evil and the delusions
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:21.760]  of evil and that you help others it's a great honor ladies and gentlemen to be in the new
[1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:28.400]  order's cross there is actually a great honor to be persecuted it is a blessing because it it
[1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:34.720]  fulfills you you are meant to be warriors for the innocent warriors for the week you are meant

[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:04.640]  reality and into delusion and then the truly wicked take control because the truly wicked
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:08.720]  they want the levers of power whereas the average person doesn't want that responsibility

[1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:59.680]  about wtc seven still hot as the bbc hit piece and this report have been released to counter
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:08.080]  Jennings exclusive testimony on explosions inside building seven now we interviewed him for loose
[1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:14.240]  change final cut he then word got out about it he begged us saying he'd been threatened
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:20.320]  saying his pension had been threatened his job been threatened and other threats wouldn't specify
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:26.080]  what those were if he didn't shut up then he didn't really work can he said yeah there were
[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:32.000]  explosions yeah before the towers fell in building seven and he said well it could have been bodies
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:42.560]  but earlier he said they were bodies on the ground then his boss just came out in the last few weeks
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:49.040]  and was interviewed by the bbc saying i never saw explosions though he had said that on news that day
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:57.760]  along with mr. Jennings very suspicious that he's dead at 53 now it was erin dykes who confirmed
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:04.160]  this yesterday we kept hearing about it for weeks but can find no news articles we earlier and others
[1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:08.960]  had called where he worked with the city they'd said we know no we're not going to talk about it
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:14.240]  we finally got them to admit yesterday that he indeed was dead but they wouldn't say the cause
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:21.120]  we've now talked to his bosses they've said yeah we knew Barry he is dead we can't say why he's dead
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:25.040]  others said at the office we don't know why he's dead and acted very very suspicious
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:37.120]  so we're going to be breaking this down the next 45 minutes or so with erin dykes and jason
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:43.600]  bermus who personally knew Barry Jennings let me just read over this article for everybody
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:48.560]  and then make some added points on it emergency coordinator 9 11 witness Barry Jennings has passed
[1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:54.400]  away with controversy by wtc 7 still hot as the bbc hit piece and niss report have been released
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:26:01.040]  to counter Jennings exclusive testimony of explosions inside building 7 now that's we
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:06.080]  could say exclusive but really his boss talked about explosions firefighters and police talked
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:10.640]  about it emt's talked about it there's cops on cnn saying get back they're going to blow it up it's
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:17.280]  going to come down and the owner said they blew it up so the problem is see he's credible because
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:22.160]  he was the deputy emergency manager of that area so that's why they had to get rid of him
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:26.400]  and i have no doubt they killed him in this 95 chance especially now they're being very secretive
[1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:31.600]  Barry Jennings the key 9 11 high witness who was an emergency coordinator for the new york
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:35.440]  housing authority has passed away at age 53 from circumstances not yet disclosed
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:40.480]  this is almost a month later folks very suspicious kind of like it was very hard to find
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:45.840]  out that dr ivans with the anthrax who they now admit was a patsy was killed inside government
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:50.880]  facilities a spokesman for the housing authority has now confirmed his death of the weeks of rumors
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:54.880]  circulating online but refused to give any further details we talked to him again this morning
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:02.160]  Aaron's coming up the office has not yet been able to contact anyone in the Jennings family and the
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:07.440]  official cause of death is not yet known but online reports have reported the date of the death as
[1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:22.000]  august 19th 2008 since yesterday we have confirmed with his office the date is the 19th in a very
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.120]  unusual it is very unusual that a prominent controversial 9 11 witness would die only days
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:31.440]  before the release of the NIST report see people say well why seven years later was he killed
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:36.000]  this was all coming out there was talk of subpoenaing him that they're about to probably
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.480]  with again get enough signatures to have it on the ballot for a new york investigation of 9 11
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:46.400]  talk of calling him before a grand jury it is very unusual that a prominent
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:52.640]  controversial 9 11 witness would die only days before the release of NIST report on WTC 7
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.720]  and shortly after a firestorm erupted over the testimony that he had heard explosions
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:03.200]  inside the building prior to the collapse of either tower and that they were dead bodies
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:07.360]  in the building blown out of the lobby
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:17.520]  the bbc aired the third tower in july in an attempt to debunk Mary Jennings account
[1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:22.480]  which is both contradictory and damaging to the official 9 11 story making an issue of the
[1:28:22.480 --> 1:28:27.360]  whether or not he saw dead bodies in the lobby and see we hadn't released this video because he'd
[1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:33.040]  asked us not to then the bbc came to the loose change crew into dylan and said you're lying
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:39.360]  he didn't say that and dylan showed him the video and uh so they went and had an actor play the part
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:47.920]  of Jennings to basically re-enact things in a false fashion very suspicious yet Jennings own
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:51.920]  statement in an exclusive interview with dylan avery jason mermas which is which has not been
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:58.240]  denied was the firefighter who took us down kept saying don't look down and i say why and we are

[1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:31.200]  him the bbc goes to him to do this hit piece but he didn't really say what they want they all heavily
[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:35.840]  edited they have an actor basically say what they want him to say in it uh they don't show him with
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:40.000]  other people in the building they only show him alone in the reenactment but it's not him as the
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:46.960]  uh you know as the uh person who's reenacting it and uh so he becomes this big figure in this big
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:51.280]  controversy because you've got the firefighters and police outside live news footage them saying
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:56.480]  get back building seven is going to be blown up uh we have the the owner slipping up and saying yeah
[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:02.240]  we ordered it blown up we have all of this coming out and so jenning starts becoming a key figure
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:08.000]  and a couple days before the niss report which then said all its other five reasons 25 percent
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:15.040]  of the building scooped out by the north tower uh fires bad craftsmanship you know improper building
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:22.320]  fuel oil tanks all of that they said no that no we were wrong about all that it didn't scoop out
[1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:27.280]  the building it didn't do any of this it was uh magnetic forces and thermal expansion never before
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:33.280]  seen magic and then the guys on nister all got government contracts government operatives
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:39.840]  who happen to be some of the only few living experts on explosive thermite for uh for uh
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:46.560]  nasa coupler rings when the rocket separates in the different stages and for classified pentagon
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.760]  programs with weaponized um thermite just so happens in the samples i'll show that in the
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:56.160]  video that pouring out i mean we're getting very close to the ultimate surelock homes here
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:01.920]  i mean this is dangerous some secret service agents and fbi guys were on the trail of this
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:07.840]  and they got killed and had their bodies thrown in uh two building seven and the media lied about
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:12.800]  that but later had to admit okay there were some dead feds in there so it was also a way to get rid
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:20.400]  of people that that uh noticed what was going on so so finishing up this story key witness to
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:28.240]  wtc seven explosions dead at 53 now comes the release of jason bermas his fabled enemies and
[1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:33.360]  giving further exposure to jennings controversial account the film features a full interview with
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:41.360]  berry jennings as well as the statements by michael hess who was also um trapped with him inside the
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:49.120]  wtc seven made to news media on the day of the attacks he said the same stuff now he went with
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:53.680]  the bbc the same guy that did the first hit piece who he know went back and interviewed jennings again
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:36:00.880]  and then jennings dies soon after and then his boss the head of that emergency management
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:06.720]  my division he says i never made those statements when he's on video saying kind of like before
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:12.480]  congress uh and on abc news juliani says yeah we were told to get out of building seven that day
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.600]  before it either tower fell and we had had a terror attack drill with fema set up the night
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:21.600]  before so we'd already moved out of the building the night before in tripod too then people said
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:27.440]  what of course fema deputy director earlier kennedy had said just that and then it was a
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:31.120]  big controversy the day of 9 11 that well we already arrived the night before for the terror
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:35.440]  attack they said oh no that was a mistake slip of the tongue then it came out they indeed had
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:40.960]  and it was called operation tripod too of an anthrax attack on building seven in the world
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:45.040]  trade center complexes which they'd used in months before to evacuate the whole building
[1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:51.920]  several times for drills and a billion dollar renovation of the service floors it has service
[1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:59.440]  floors every few floors and side passages and marvin bush running that of course no no big deal
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:05.920]  confirm it you'll confirm for yourself our source on that is barbara bush um her memoir written
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:13.040]  four years ago about her great son running security there nice people um barry jennings
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:18.880]  reiterated in the exclusive interview from us his confusion over the explanation from wtc seven's
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:28.480]  collapse uh given that he clearly heard explosions inside the building i'm just confused about one
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:32.640]  thing and one thing only why world trade center seven went down the first place i'm very confused
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:39.280]  about that i know what i heard i heard explosions the explanation i got was it was the fuel oil tank
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:45.040]  i'm an old boiler guy this was a fuel oil tank it would have been on one side of the building
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:50.240]  and of course now the government admits that's not the boiler tank they just tell the dumb
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:55.120]  down public that the interview was not fully released until 2008 the request of mr jennings
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:59.440]  who had received numerous threats to his job and asked that it be left out of loose change final
[1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:05.440]  cut because of those threats he'd still be alive folks i'm almost 95 sure that it was a murder
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:11.600]  especially now how they won't say what caused it jennings statements have led a fire to questions
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:16.000]  about what really caused the sudden collapse wtc seven justice nist had hoped the release of their
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.920]  report would quash widespread beliefs that the buildings was brought down by controlled demolition
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:28.400]  now news of jennings death comes on the heels of losing another 9-11 hero and eyewitness kenny
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:34.560]  joneman who reportedly committed suicide 12 days before the seventh anniversary
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:40.240]  he's credited with saving at least one man's life on 9-11 and was also a witness to explosions in
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:45.520]  the towers nist report as well as not the 9-11 commission which is not even mentioned building
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:49.840]  seven completely ignored statements from the building seven leaseholder larry silverstein
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.600]  as well as numerous police and firefighters and other eyewitnesses who have testified that they
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  were warned about the building's collapse and told to get back because it was going to be a controlled
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:02.880]  demolition one rescue worker even heard the countdown from the building's implosion over the emergency
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:08.480]  radios unfortunately bary jennings whose testimony was ignored by the 9-11 commission can no longer
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:13.920]  raise questions personally about his experience inside wtc seven but his account will remain
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:20.000]  on the record and available in full on fable enemies dvd so that he's uh what he witnessed about
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:25.760]  9-11 cannot be ignored the truth about wtc seven will continue to come out and bary jennings testimony
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:30.240]  will not be in vain please contact erin info wars dot com if you have any information about the
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:35.360]  circumstances of bary jennings death or any other reports we extend our condolences to any family
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:43.040]  or friends regarding this for their loss and erin i want you to go add specifically that who you
[1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:48.400]  called who you talk to in what agency it's not enough to say you did a good job here that we
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:54.320]  confirmed it with his agency because the disinfo trolls know the public doesn't really pay attention
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:58.640]  so as you know they're running around saying oh we got this off youtube post
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:04.000]  no we ignored this for two weeks and investigated and could never get them to tell us we've now
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:09.040]  got calls into the head of public relations at his agency we've talked to four or five secretaries
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:13.120]  we've talked to his former assistant we've talked to the person that took his job we have his
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:22.720]  extension we have his home number bary jennings is dead and he died a month ago he died uh just shy
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:29.680]  two days it'll be in two days it'll be a month ago or 30 days uh he's dead okay now now when we
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:34.640]  first posted the larry silverstein video five years ago people said it was fake they said it
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:38.560]  wasn't real the larry silverstein saying then they well then we posted the building seven footage of
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:45.280]  bbc saying it had been blown up and had fallen building seven people said that was fake that we
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:49.440]  made a fake video that it was a blue screen and then bbc said no it was real and then
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:55.280]  turned out two bbc channels reported at the same time and a and a cnn and that's now confirmed
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:59.120]  that they reported building seven fell before it fell exactly how it fell how like they reported
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:06.080]  that lee harvey oswald killed kennedy and it was in newspapers in asia and and in the other
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:11.200]  hemisphere the other side of the planet uh in australia over an hour before he was even caught
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:16.640]  his name was publicly they got their time zones screwed up okay they do and we said it was probably
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:24.400]  roiders or ap and because they have pre-release feeds that bbc and cnn reported the fall of building
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:30.720]  seven and then we were right bbc now admits that so so we know how the new system works and we're
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:37.760]  giving you cutting edge bullet surprise type investigative journalism okay and all we ask
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:47.360]  is that you look at it and understand what's happening now close your mic let me
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.520]  let me just explain something to you here before i go to jason bermas and erin dykes about this
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:02.640]  in the last two months i have seen hundreds of articles by the mainstream by the alternative
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:11.360]  by former 911 truth people showing their colors hundreds i saw without me in my email box five
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:17.360]  or six last night that did a google search for like two hours and was just blown away by different
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:25.520]  people on youtube google dig on videos on alternative websites saying one thing unanimously
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:35.840]  over and over and over again are they all feds no that's what operation mockingbird is a few feds
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:42.320]  put it out and then it's snowballed it picks up mockingbirds repeat it state bird of texas
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:46.480]  it here's a lawnmower it makes a lawnmower noise it here's a dog barking makes that noise amazing
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:50.160]  little birds little black and white birds little brown and cream and black colored birds that
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:57.440]  part doesn't matter the point is you've got governors and and movie stars and best actors
[1:42:57.440 --> 1:43:02.000]  and willy nelson and german defense ministers and famous italian presidents and italian
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:08.720]  intelligence chiefs and leaders of major japanese parties and physicists and scientists and peer
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:14.240]  reviewed reports and peer reviewed journals saying impossible what happened with tower one two and
[1:43:14.240 --> 1:43:21.520]  seven and exploding and now inside job and false flag terrorism and self-afflicted wound
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:26.320]  is now in the general nomenclature
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:38.000]  people now know about this this is one of the most incredible grassroots movements ever
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:45.600]  ever by any yardstick it is taking the tool of stage terror events and smashing it is
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:53.440]  exposing people to how government stage crises whether they're economic or environmental to
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:58.400]  then poses the saviors and get even more control and people are reading the philosopher haigle
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:04.400]  and the straussian economist ideas of the unjustifies the means the macky valiant system at the
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:08.880]  chicago business school they're reading the peanut documents were dick chaney said we need
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:15.360]  stage terror attacks they're reading this in army war college reports there this is an epiphany
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:20.720]  this is a huge thing it it's it's exploding exponentially you know we had rob on early in
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:25.520]  the morning uh we're at the first show in the middle of the day there were like 300 400 people
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:29.760]  out there there were 3 000 i've seen the videos and the news reported biggest 9 11 truth ever in new
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:35.360]  york but see the system knows that the public is watching the mainstream media so they have to be
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:45.360]  careful about our own movement is in a concerted fashion saying 9 11 truth is dead 9 11 truth
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:50.880]  peaked in 2006 i'm seeing the same terms in in in just put out and and that's what these guys
[1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:54.640]  will do they'll come on the scene they'll they'll be patriots for about a year we've seen this over
[1:44:54.640 --> 1:45:00.880]  and over again they'll try to gain credibility and then they'll just just run their operation and
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:04.560]  that's kind of like telling somebody if you don't want them to come to say an auction
[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:08.400]  all that auction's canceled that's happened a lot in the news people that want to bid on
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:12.080]  something will find out the email list they'll break into the auction house or have an employee
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:16.960]  give it to them and send out a thing to all the auction regulars saying oh the tuesday night
[1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:23.280]  auction uh firearms or paintings or whatever it's canceled and then they'll show up or
[1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:26.640]  there's going to be a city council meeting to steal some private property or do something
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:31.760]  that's unpopular they do this all the time with the different trans texas corridor boards
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:35.600]  they're always canceling it but then the day of well we're not going to cancel it now
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:42.400]  well they just so they've been announcing oh 9 11 truth is dead 9 11 truth's over
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:47.840]  meanwhile it's bigger than ever and their operatives are being forced to show themselves
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:53.200]  because they are afraid of you taking over live media like in the running man but peacefully
[1:45:53.200 --> 1:45:57.040]  they're afraid of you getting in front of news cameras and bullhorning and holding up signs
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:02.160]  and creating buzz they're afraid of not just 9 11 truth but that idea of getting in front of
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:07.200]  media and going to media events and disrupting the stagetown halls where only supporters of
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:11.840]  whatever it may be toll roads or republicans or democrats or open borders or gun control or
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:18.000]  environmental land grabs they are scared of that idea of you getting out in the streets getting active
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:23.360]  not just dressing up you know having the fake paid off hippy leaders dress up in wizard outfits
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:28.560]  and levitate mints foundation paid off you know to make everybody look like clowns they're afraid
[1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:33.360]  and they saw just a few hundred nine eleven truth in denver take over and get all the media attention
[1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:41.120]  and absolutely dominate and they are panicking and attacking everywhere i mean they are so upset by
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:45.920]  all these prominent people going public and it's exponential we have passed critical mass
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:52.880]  we have passed flashpoint you have done an incredible job but they're telling you oh the
[1:46:52.880 --> 1:47:00.960]  party's over it's over it petered out it's dead when it is bigger than ever all the 9 11 truth
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:06.880]  sites getting more visits than ever all i mean my side is getting more visits from ever uh than
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:12.800]  ever uh just just people all over waking up it being mainstream going from the police being mad
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:18.400]  at us eight years ago or seven years ago and six years ago uh when we talk about inside job
[1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:22.640]  to chanting 9 11's an inside job with us in new york that happened there's video of it
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:31.200]  the system is panicking right now and so they're killing people there will be no more there will
[1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:36.720]  be more murders no doubt uh they are trying to intimidate witnesses uh they are running around
[1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:42.000]  saying you know mark twain is dead and he said no rumors of my demise are been greatly exaggerated
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:50.400]  it's the oldest trick in the book do not buy this but they noticed that from their own mainline
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:54.480]  media people weren't buying it so they're activating their officers they're activating their agents
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:59.920]  they're activating their sleepers right now everywhere to tell you it's dead because they
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:04.480]  are panicking and they know it's dangerous to reveal themselves they know it's dangerous to
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:10.320]  expose themselves they know it's dangerous to show everybody who they are but they're being forced
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:16.880]  to right now we're gonna go to jason bermas and um erin docks and others in just a moment
[1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:21.920]  but bary jennings could have said more would have said more he could have been hauled in
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:27.280]  before a grand jury and been forced to talk about everything he saw his testimony could have
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:34.320]  contradicted michael hesses and was he wasn't giving the bbc the type of interviews they wanted
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:40.080]  and that's a spook outfit all the way and he's dead deader than a hammer right now deader than
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:46.800]  doornail and again our condolences go to the family and so i'm gonna bring up jason bermas i'm
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:55.600]  gonna bring up uh erin docks but before we go to break just just briefly erin describe how you
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:00.960]  made some phone calls and confirmed this what we did never reported this off of youtube postings
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:06.400]  that's where we first learned of it uh we we reported this from his agency so so tell folks
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:11.840]  about that first that's right we saw the youtube comments and i had a horrible feeling in my gut
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:16.160]  but we of course did not report the rumors and for weeks we couldn't get the numbers
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:23.040]  finally i contacted the new york city housing authority at their publicly listed numbers
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:28.800]  and i was able to finally reach barry jennings i spoke to four people who all confirmed he's dead
[1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:35.280]  none of them would say why that's the basics and uh we've got the numbers we've got their names here
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:41.520]  you talk to secretaries you talked to his former assistant uh you talked uh to his replacement uh
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:46.880]  you talk to managers and they all will not tell you yeah but even people on the switchboard knew
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:51.760]  who he was they knew he was dead but they still couldn't tell me why at least not at this time
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:57.120]  and we're 28 days later he dies right before the news report comes out this testimony contradicts
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:01.440]  and then we've got hess who's contradicting his tv interviews he did seven years ago
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:06.560]  yeah it's amazing it's just i don't know how i could get away with that he's on record
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:10.640]  we have the recording and now he says he heard no explosions michael has as a liar
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  it's unbelievable jason bermas on the side he knew barry jennings met with him several times
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:20.400]  we have the jennings home phone number they're not answering the phone but we have a right as
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:24.000]  the public to find out how he died and what happened they also threatened families and
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.440]  tell them to shut up so we'll see what happens there in fact i'm going to skip this break we'll
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:32.880]  continue i'm going to skip the break for prison planet dot tv viewers we are streaming live right
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:39.680]  now and info wars dot com stream listeners uh i want to just give out some facts right now in
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:47.840]  this three minute behind the scenes then we'll go to uh bermas after the break but i would challenge
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:54.880]  everyone out there watching to go read this story for yourself from info wars dot com
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:51:02.000]  key witness to wtc seven explosions dead at 53 now now i want to explain something
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:07.520]  the first people that always come on the scene on our message board we have their ip addresses
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:11.280]  we can go look them up and the first people to come on the scene on youtube on the comments with
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:16.880]  any of these videos or stories they don't even hide it you will go to their pages and then use
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:20.960]  their handle and then find their myspace or facebook and they're almost always sent come
[1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:25.440]  they're they're military paid to do it and they'll arrive and then they have mockingbirds that copy
[1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:35.840]  them you know just kind of the uh verbose unhappy uh just just real negative toxic
[1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:42.240]  population morbid and then they'll pile on but but but within minutes of the intelligence is
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:46.480]  watching our websites within minutes of this going up it was oh you got it off youtube huh you got
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:52.080]  off rumors which we never even said in the article they were on it folks they were they were waiting
[1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:57.360]  and you know we say no we got this from the new york housing authority that he was the deputy
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:02.000]  emergency you know head of emergency management for during the attacks and was promoted after that
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:07.520]  and he was there with the head of it during it michael hess and so here it is in plain view we're
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:13.200]  saying what it is but they psychologically divert people to then make that about the debate kind of
[1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:17.040]  like we never have a debate about do we want a north american union because it doesn't matter if
[1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:20.480]  we have all the documents and it's official being done and the pentagon signing deals with
[1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:24.640]  canada to use their troops here in the u.s against the american people in mexico and it's in the army
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:29.680]  times but then you say we don't want that and they say it doesn't exist it's the same thing here
[1:52:29.680 --> 1:52:34.240]  they'll just say no michael hess never said that doesn't matter if you have video of it on two different
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:40.160]  news channels doesn't exist you know uh and then you have a debate about well yes it does he said
[1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:46.720]  it here and then you never move on to your evidence it's just a stumbling block it's a basic psychological
[1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:51.440]  warfare operation and and that's what we have being run against us here and and and so on the
[1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:56.160]  subject of 911 truth don't let Barry Jennings die in vain don't let all the other people that have
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:03.280]  died in vain have been murdered over this um i mean luke was getting death threats at the time he
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:07.440]  first started confronting politicians but we're told by the people in our own movement oh it's not
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:12.480]  effective to go take over media events and ask embarrassing questions of of of politicians oh
[1:53:12.480 --> 1:53:17.200]  really of juliani where it then became national news that he did lie about being told to get out
[1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:23.120]  of building seven and then he was warned i mean breaking news over and over again they're scared
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:29.280]  to death of you you have incredible power so keep it up let's go back to the full show
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:38.320]  all right i'm gonna get into all the economic news attacks on free speech they're they're going
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:43.280]  ahead and implementing on the web uh the free speech attacking homegrown radicalization act
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:49.520]  the bill hr 1955 before it's even passed the senate just like they implement national ID card
[1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:55.040]  before it came law eight years before uh they're doing that now to come after your free speech
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:54:00.000]  that's coming up later big economic analysis next hour of course the media tells you everything's
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:05.520]  fine uh i want to bring jason bermus up now i want to cover this first and then get into how
[1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:10.080]  you knew jennings and what he said to you in private and and and and what's in fabled enemies thank
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:16.160]  god we have this to discredit and expose the bbc so this dead man can tell tales uh but but first
[1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:21.120]  off i'm i'm worried about dylan and i won't talk bad about my friends until they're in danger
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:26.000]  here and i'll give people advice and they seem to think i just fell off a turnip truck or something
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.200]  we're just you know my listeners and us together are leading the true revolution against herring
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:36.000]  doesn't mean we're doing the best job either but we're the best there is no brag just fact in
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:40.480]  fact that's a dangerous mantle it's dangerous to be on the front lines wearing a general hat
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:46.800]  okay in fact i try to play that down but the bottom line is dylan avery had more discussions
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:52.480]  with jennings about i remember dylan telling me um threats against his pension threats against his
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.640]  job and more that he was worried about his family and that he said more but dylan wouldn't say
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:01.200]  because it was off the record well he's dead now and and dylan's all freaked out hey dylan let me
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:06.160]  tell you how this works if they think you know something you're not safe till you let that out
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:10.000]  look at the hundreds killed the new stuff about the kennedy assassination and then their family
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:16.960]  members they told stuff got killed this isn't a joke so dylan you better i told the dc madam this
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:21.520]  she's dead she didn't listen i said on air and off air you better spill the beans
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:26.400]  and man every time i talk to her off air i'd say you know the ns says listen right now
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:30.000]  ma'am you better tell everybody she goes well i just i she'd say look they can just leave me
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:35.040]  alone i just want to retire just just drop the prosecution i never gave up my client list
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:38.720]  and yes of course it went up to people in the white house that's all i'm gonna say and i said
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:45.120]  they're gonna kill you she said no no i just want this to go away she thought she'd be safe if she
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:50.320]  shut up they killed her dead in a hammer she told me if she was killed it would be murdered she
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:55.280]  told her lawyer have an autopsy but lawyers came and blocked that she said if i'm killed i'll be
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:56:01.120]  murdered she told the condo manager her friend that we had him on now listen dylan avery
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:09.680]  they know you talk to jennings now you better go on this show or another show you better write it
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:13.920]  up on your blog or do a video blog right now i know you've never taken any of my advice
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:20.640]  but the point is you better take it now i'm going to go to uh is when people's lives are in
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:25.040]  in the balance i'm just not going to be nice about it anymore i was too nice to the dc madam
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:30.560]  about it this is common sense stuff i you know i read the book written by jim garrison who went
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:37.680]  through this stuff this isn't a game people these people run child kidnapping rings they kill children
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:43.440]  they don't care they like it oh i'm getting mad because i don't want my friends getting killed
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:48.800]  out of intimidation dylan is scared to death right now he said he is and i'm going to bring up uh
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:58.960]  jason bermus who also knew jennings uh bermus this is incredible what do you say well just the whole
[1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:05.600]  chain of events from erin calling me about a week after uh jennings had actually died and said you
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:10.640]  know we're getting these emails and there's these posts and i said to him well let me see what i can
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:15.360]  find out so i called up dylan and of course you know right away dylan didn't want to believe it
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:19.600]  but i said well who can you get and wouldn't call him had the home phone number and wouldn't give it
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:25.200]  to us um he had uh jennings his cell at the time he didn't have the home phone number which we got
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:29.760]  last night but he had the cell and he didn't want to give him a call and be like you know are you dead
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:34.080]  or whatever but he would you know basically he pawned it off on michael ruden who did that
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:39.920]  bbc hit piece and this is what really disturbs me now ruden probably had more contact information
[1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:45.360]  than anybody on jennings he had a sit-down interview with him on the bbc obviously had his cell
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:50.400]  number obviously knew where he worked and dylan contacted him that day and ruden said he would
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:55.760]  look into it now i was down at ground zero on 9 11 and i ran into dylan and dylan said you know
[1:57:55.760 --> 1:58:01.920]  i just ran into uh ruden again and stay there let's hear this and who this ruden creature is
[1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:06.000]  i've debated emie's an unbelievably wicked creature we'll be right back stay with us

[2:00:09.280 --> 2:00:15.200]  pre-reporting building sevens collapse on two channels live and seeing in doing it their disinfo
[2:00:15.200 --> 2:00:19.680]  ops tried to say it was fake video wasn't real blue screen later they had to admit it was live it
[2:00:19.680 --> 2:00:25.520]  was real so just incredible deception their their news anchor was interviewed about we are changed
[2:00:25.520 --> 2:00:29.120]  england and said i didn't work that day i was at the theater and they said there's video and he said
[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:36.320]  oh i remember it all now yes i mean just incredibly transparent operations uh he's dead we've confirmed
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:40.960]  that we're also buying a very expensive data package right now you can do that online of all
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:45.280]  jennings info we know his wife's name everything right now we're getting all that info he is dead
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:51.280]  this emergency management deputy head there for the housing authority uh and uh for those that
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:55.600]  just join us we have new laws every few minutes and other talk shows don't recap recap what happened
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:01.840]  in your words jason then we'll get into the bbc all right well just just to start things off you
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:06.160]  know um in the making of loose change file cut me and dylan were combing through loose change
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:12.400]  second edition and we noticed that two people had said that they were on the 23rd floor and
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:17.680]  it only made sense that that would be the office of emergency management so dylan started looking
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:23.280]  into uh barrier jennings and because we we named michael hess right away and he was the city corporation
[2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:27.920]  council at the time but uh my phone calls were never returned my emails were never returned i even
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:32.960]  faxed his office to try to get an interview they had no desire to be interviewed about world trade
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:38.720]  center building seven and nine eleven that day however dylan got barry jennings's information
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:44.320]  and he called up barry and uh we went down there uh that happened a little over a year ago now
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:49.200]  and when we got there he didn't really know who we were we were just kind of talking uh
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:53.280]  you know lightheartedly and he's like you know i was in one of those nine eleven movies and he said
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:57.280]  that you know the michael mayers when i go michael more Fahrenheit nine eleven he's like no not that
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:01.360]  one he's like uh you the conspiracy one i said loose change and he said yeah it's a really good
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:05.760]  movie and we then explained to him who we were and we said you know we're the guys that made loose
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:09.760]  change and that's why we're here we you know understand that you experienced explosion on
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:14.640]  the 23rd floor he's like oh yeah of course you know that wasn't the only one so we're in his
[2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:18.640]  office he finds out who he is he's introducing us to other people very friendly very cordial
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:22.720]  pictures of his family key to the city we have that in fabled enemies he actually had a key to the
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:27.200]  city from his experience that day probably the most credible witness eyewitness that we could get
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:31.680]  so we took him out to the pier and all the way over he's telling us uh the story of the lobby
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:36.240]  and how there were bodies in the lobby now we didn't cue that story up and he later told that on
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:40.880]  camera i mean you can see that we didn't say anything about bodies or try to direct him in
[2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:47.120]  any way he volunteered that information now it really wasn't that information that got him into
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:52.800]  hot water dylan called him up about two months before the release of the film and he said hey
[2:02:52.800 --> 2:02:56.000]  you know i just want to make sure everything's all right he was going to try to go have lunch with
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.280]  him and he didn't even really know who he was and they explained himself and he's like oh
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:04.480]  well i need to talk to you he's like i'm getting all sorts of phone calls at my job my my work has
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:08.000]  been threatened my pension has been threatened he's like man i'm a family man that was the first
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:12.240]  thing i said to you you know he told us straight up that he was two years away from his pension
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:16.480]  and he couldn't wait to retire and be with his family more often and he's like you know i i need
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:21.040]  to pull this interview he's like i'm getting all sorts of pressure you know so dylan you know being
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:26.400]  the good person that he is he said yes of course and he understood completely now the cards kind of
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:30.880]  went off the table when we found out that he was going to be doing an interview with the bbc
[2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:36.560]  now the only thing that he seemed to change in his interview and you watch the interview was
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:41.440]  very well edited but the only thing he changed was that dead bodies comment and i think that
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:46.160]  that's where the real threats were well i wouldn't say very well edited very sneakily very short
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:51.200]  tiny clips yeah and then like of course when he would talk about explosions they would talk about

[2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:35.600]  90 year old grandmother at some length here recently and she was talking about the great
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:40.080]  depression and we were talking about the gas prices the food prices this economic uncertainty
[2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:43.840]  we're in these you know really kind of perilous times no one knows where we're headed or where we
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:47.840]  might end up and she was reminded of the great depression and how in those days folks who lived
[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:51.760]  in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their
[2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:55.760]  food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:59.200]  didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how and they didn't have the chickens and the
[2:05:59.200 --> 2:06:03.520]  livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain right now we're headed
[2:06:03.520 --> 2:06:08.400]  into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage now what can you do to prepare

[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:40.960]  all right jason berness knew the deputy head of emergency management for the housing authority
[2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:47.440]  in new york barry jennings talked about explosions dead bodies this is before tower one or two fell
[2:07:47.440 --> 2:07:53.760]  and they interviewed him because he was on the news that day saying that everybody forgot about
[2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:58.480]  that and we had the fireman the police the medic saying yeah get back the government says they're
[2:07:58.480 --> 2:08:03.600]  blowing up building seven it's all on video larry silvestine saying it was announced on local radio
[2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:10.160]  they were going to blow it up bbc said it had already fallen uh cnn i mean they did this folks
[2:08:10.800 --> 2:08:15.680]  and this is a big deal so they had to kill jennings and he was 53 he could have had a heart attack
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:20.800]  maybe five percent chance and right around the news report coming out uh we know that the bbc
[2:08:20.800 --> 2:08:26.720]  was trying to interview him again uh we know that his boss was now contradicting him but conveniently
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:32.960]  he is now gone continue and i want to have erin actually some questions uh continue uh with uh
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:37.840]  what we're covering and going over here jason berness well before i even get back into that i
[2:08:37.840 --> 2:08:42.400]  just like to say you know i suspect that they're going to say heart attack and that's suspicious
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:49.040]  enough for me but if the cause of death is anything outside of a heart attack like you know a car accident
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:55.120]  or a slip in a fall or something that's even more suspicious but continuing so he's going to go on
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:08:59.760]  this that's right there's nowhere in the newspaper is this cause of death we did deep searches uh no
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:05.600]  one has any details no one knows anything his family's being closed live his bosses and others
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:10.400]  are being closed lipped his employees and people are wondering are being closed lipped uh i mean
[2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:15.920]  we have a right to know this is very the fact that it's being covered up that is so suspicious
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:21.920]  and when this happened is so key go ahead and so we released our full interview because we
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:27.440]  wanted people to see exactly what Barry Jennings had said because the bbc had gone to dylan and
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:31.200]  others when you guys were in denver and said no you don't have video of this he says it didn't
[2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:36.480]  happen and then you show them the video absolutely and they actually did have a courtesy to show
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:42.720]  that in there but i hung out with rudin who did this whole piece for about 35 45 minutes off a
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:46.400]  camera because he didn't want to interview me because i'm a little bit too much of a bulldog
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:51.920]  i guess for him and we argued up and down you know he was telling me he had special video inside
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:57.040]  world trade center seven that was going to prove the damage and i said sir i have the video inside
[2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:01.280]  world trade center seven it's going to be in my next picture and it clearly shows it wasn't
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:05.840]  scooped out and then you watch the program and they're trying to say that it's scooped out
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:10.320]  from a picture that one man is holding that they zoom into it's not even scanned in it's
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:15.360]  subtly done it doesn't show a quarter of the building scooped out you know nist had to retract on that
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:21.920]  so that's right they are showing a gray building not a red face building clearly the world financial
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:29.600]  center across the street understand nist has retracted what bbc said yeah so i contact dylan
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:34.480]  and dylan contacts this character and he says that he'll get right on it and he'll let dylan know
[2:10:34.480 --> 2:10:40.640]  as soon as he knows something so again me and dylan meet up on 9 11 in new york city and he says
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:45.040]  oh i i just happened to cross michael rudin and i asked him about barry and he said he still
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:50.240]  hadn't come up with anything now this is a bbc journalist again who has all of this man's contact
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:56.720]  information two plus actually three weeks almost after yeah this is huge three weeks after his death
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:03.440]  and he can't confirm it however we got to call the bbc we got to call this guy and then magically
[2:11:03.440 --> 2:11:08.800]  this same gentleman finds michael has the only other i witnessed in the building the head of the
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:14.160]  city corporation council part of the office of emergency management program when a disaster
[2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:18.640]  struck the other guy that showed up there with with jenny they showed up separately and for
[2:11:18.640 --> 2:11:22.720]  different purposes but they went up in that elevator together and were trapped there and he is on a
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:28.560]  separate news network other than barry jenny and he is saying the same exact thing that there was a
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:34.080]  huge explosion in the building as they tried to evacuate stop right now stop right there
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:42.000]  we are not going to glaze over the huge thing you just pointed out you have this bbc reporter if
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:48.160]  you can call him that and he comes sliming around saying jennings didn't say this doesn't matter
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:53.360]  that jennings is on tape saying it on tv news from the day of 9 11 they're acting like we're just
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:12:00.560]  making this up when he's already made the statements on national and local tv then two and a half weeks
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:04.800]  after he's been contacted and when we need his number right now we need to contact him so get
[2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:13.120]  that for me varmas please uh... he sees dylan at 9 11 last week in new york and says oh i haven't
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:18.560]  nailed that down i don't know if he's dead or not now that right there he needs to be interrogated
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:23.840]  on that subject boy i tell you this is amazing yeah and then and not only does he not know if
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:28.720]  he's dead but he finds the only other witness in world trade center seven and he's more than happy
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:34.160]  to go along with the official version of that he now says there was no explosion it was just dust
[2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:38.800]  coming up the stairs really dust coming up the stairs trapped you in the building for another
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:44.240]  two hours mister has to have anything to do with the fact that he heads up juliani partners in the
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:51.280]  private sector and and he retracted conveniently after a very jennings went by by yeah yeah just
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:56.480]  just magically and so you know i mean we're we're almost at the end of the month now alex it's
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:13:01.840]  september 19 uh... michael ruden never contacted us so you know i got on the phone with erin
[2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:06.240]  last night and erin was great enough to dig up the information call up the housing authority
[2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:12.080]  and finally confirm it when i did when he did that i uh... contacted dylan and dylan looked around
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:16.640]  for a cell number couldn't find that but then actually contacted uh... another nine eleven
[2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:21.280]  truth activists and was able to get his home number and you know that's where we're at right now
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:25.040]  and yes i mean dylan does feel very very uncomfortable right now
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:30.240]  he's freaked out uh... he did do a small blog post about how freaked out he was
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:35.280]  on our loose change site and you know i can understand that for him you know this is a
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:39.360]  this is uh... a kid that just wants to be a dog yeah and uh... we can understand too about the
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:42.480]  dc madam when i said they're going to kill you if you don't speak out
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:48.000]  about what you know and so hey okay fine then just just don't say that i didn't try
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:49.360]  if something happens
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:51.360]  hey i wash my hands i wash them
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:57.280]  but i i wish he was more vocal as well done he wanted to reiterate to me you know he said to me
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:02.080]  again you know they had nothing to do with the body he said you know that he was getting threats
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:06.960]  at work that was his initial conversation with barry you know he said barry really wasn't upset
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:11.520]  at him he was just upset about what had happened and he said he thought that we had given away
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:15.360]  where he worked when you know that was one of the things that we we covered up very well
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:19.280]  in our interview we just said that he you know worked for the city uh housing department not
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:25.120]  where not what he was doing there and uh... you know it it's very unnerving for him because again
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:29.200]  he never thought that this would be a reality well let's just move on then he wants his that
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:34.240]  is where he wants to do that's good for him uh... that's the thing is also kind of unnerving for
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:38.960]  me that if this man was murdered that there's a possibility that you know i may have something
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:43.280]  to do with that because we did see come out and it sucks that the truth can bring that
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:47.760]  you know but we tried our best to get to make this as public as possible as soon as possible
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:52.320]  and like you said alex some people just aren't willing to go that route it can have disastrous
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:57.440]  effects well here's the deal the elite or psychopaths and have no conscience and then
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:02.000]  the good people invent reasons not to do the right thing through through cowardice
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:07.200]  and and and we are not engaging in cowardice uh... the the monday morning quarterbacks can
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:11.840]  second guess us all day uh... people can sit up in the peanut gallery and and and and talk
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:16.960]  about nine eleven truth but we are a movement making history and we didn't commit those murders
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:23.600]  we have exposed those murders and if in the expose a of three thousand murders the enemy
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:30.800]  murders some more people that is on their hands and any asinine uh... uh... extrapolation or mental
[2:15:30.800 --> 2:15:37.520]  gymnastics that it's our fault is just that the product of a disease modern decadent uh... mind
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:41.920]  but i want to tell everybody out there who knows about information about inside job police officers
[2:15:41.920 --> 2:15:47.520]  firefighters others they killed hundreds to cover up the jfk murder they've already killed
[2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:53.360]  hundreds to cover up this one they will kill hundreds more you are safe as history has shown
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:58.720]  us when you dump it all out and have nothing else to tell then if they kill you it makes everybody
[2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:05.440]  come and look at what you've said and what you've done and so that's my bottom line here is that
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:10.320]  nine eleven truth by every yardstick is bigger than it's ever been and people say well it's
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:15.600]  about seven years ago no it's about the whole agenda of the police state and wars in afghanistan
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:21.040]  iraq and now the one i ran and sneak attacks on russian uh... held areas uh... by the globalist
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:25.440]  in nato and the domestic police state in the patriot act and the end of our bill of rights
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:29.760]  in constitution and the federalization of our police and i've got articles about other putting
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:34.480]  up sonar cameras on the streets that look through your clothes now same stuff in the airports
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:40.400]  you know it's happening this is the military industrial complex full spectrum dominance
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:44.800]  continuity of government taking over and i tell you every one of their spooks who claims their
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:48.720]  nine eleven truth right and hit pieces about nine eleven truth are all former military
[2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:53.040]  these these bastards think they owe their allegiance to this criminal government that's
[2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:57.440]  hijacked our military they don't think we don't see right through them this is incredible
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:17:02.400]  anybody saying nine eleven truth dead as a liar goes against all the evidence
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:06.000]  and they're either a fed or they're being handled are useful idiots
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:10.240]  and and and and burmese i'm seeing this chant nine eleven truth dead nine eleven truth dead
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:15.600]  everywhere when we're exploding exponentially they are scared to death burmese what do you say to that
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:21.040]  well i'd have to agree with you you know i mean last week again the night before nine eleven it
[2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:26.160]  was standing room only at fable enemies premiere and you know there was over two hundred people
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:31.440]  there i was shocked to see how many people actually came out to the city uh... as the day went on i
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:37.280]  mean literally you know wrapped around the corners again as they did their march and yeah i would
[2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:41.520]  i was watching videos of that it was thousands and thousands of people everybody says it was
[2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:47.040]  more in the march than it's ever been there it was a very big march i was i was very surprised
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:51.840]  as i saw that take place and saw people grouping together from because it was really hard to get
[2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:56.560]  together i mean the entire front is now blocked off alex uh... the sides are pretty much blocked
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:01.840]  off really the only place where you can congregate is towards the back of but but but that's not even
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:08.400]  the issue jason what i'm saying is there's a concerted effort with the same script being put out
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:15.120]  by hundreds of people saying nine eleven truth is dead right as presidents and and and leaders and
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:20.240]  and former defense chiefs go public right as governors and in hollywood people and the best
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:25.680]  actress and willy nelson and george carlin all these people are going public and bruce willis
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:29.360]  comes out and says the same people that killed kennedy are the ones running things now and
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:34.000]  staging the terror we tell you that three months before it comes out in the news michelle malcolm
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:40.880]  says i'm a liar she won't give her source and then he tells vanity fair yes i mean the point is we
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:48.240]  are winning we are waking people up and and and and so that's my point and i'm not gonna let these
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:53.440]  stop stop i'm gonna put you on over coming back i'm not gonna let these bastards sit here and take
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:58.560]  this movement that is kicking the new orders but taking their favorite tool of government sponsored
[2:18:58.560 --> 2:19:06.000]  terrorism i mean just introducing the public's mind to somebody else may have staged this who
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:12.400]  really stands to gain from this changing history all our work all our success and we see him running
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:18.160]  a black op on us and it's disgusting to know there's that many feds in our movement we are kicking
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:22.480]  their butt stay there and talk behind scenes for info wars dot com stream listeners and prison
[2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:26.720]  planet dot tv viewers everybody else will be right back websites are prison planet dot tv and info
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:36.480]  wars dot com stay with us let okay barmas let's get back to the to the issue of barry jennings i mean
[2:19:36.480 --> 2:19:43.680]  look really a lot of evidence i mean this whole thing stinks to high heaven we're doing a p i run
[2:19:43.680 --> 2:19:49.360]  on all this info that will have the next hour or so but i want to get your comments so we're the
[2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:55.680]  jason erin that's right uh jason the first big question we have to address is uh where is his
[2:19:55.680 --> 2:20:01.680]  obituary i've done searches for hours online it's nowhere to be found if he has an obituary printed
[2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:08.640]  i can't find it others have found other people named barry jennings in an obituary who died
[2:20:08.640 --> 2:20:15.200]  sometime in the last month um but we need to find out what his official cause of death is when he
[2:20:15.200 --> 2:20:20.880]  officially died because the people have spoke to at the housing authority have soap in their mouth
[2:20:20.880 --> 2:20:25.680]  there's something stuck in their mouth and they're him and hauling uh they all admit they knew who barry
[2:20:25.680 --> 2:20:30.560]  was they know that he's dead but they won't say anything else about it other than to contact the
[2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:35.840]  family who have thus far not answered the phone we don't know anything about their circumstances
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:40.480]  right now and there's a lot of questions we need to find out well here's a commenter on info wars
[2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:45.200]  dot com on the story i wonder what he knew that he hadn't disclosed yet perhaps they knew he knew
[2:20:45.200 --> 2:20:49.920]  more than and wanted to shut him up before he revealed more information and perhaps they wanted
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:54.400]  to send a message to others to stay quiet i have a hunch he didn't just die for natural causes
[2:20:55.040 --> 2:20:59.680]  in this day and age energy weapons exist that can give you cancer if they want to
[2:20:59.680 --> 2:21:03.920]  even the victim will think he or she is dying from a natural cause and that's what they
[2:21:03.920 --> 2:21:09.600]  admit they've got bob woodward uh then again uh maybe he did die from a natural cause after all
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:15.440]  look at all the other coincidences of 9 11 and you know that's the whole point here is it's the
[2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:21.680]  cover-up of how he died that adds all this weight to it bernice yeah absolutely the timing the cover
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:25.680]  up the fact that the only eyewitness comes out to the only reporter that's able to get
[2:21:26.400 --> 2:21:32.400]  an interview with mr jennings to put on dream television days after you know well weeks after
[2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:37.840]  his death and no longer become contradicted right after the nist report comes out yeah i mean it's
[2:21:37.840 --> 2:21:42.960]  absolutely absurd and you know like you were discussed before of how 9 11 floating mean rosy
[2:21:42.960 --> 2:21:49.040]  o donnell did on the front page of her blog for 9 11 a 9 minute speech with willy rodriguez and
[2:21:49.040 --> 2:21:54.640]  their testimony willy rodriguez's and barry jennings of explosions inside the building
[2:21:55.200 --> 2:22:00.320]  uh they corroborate each other that explosives were planted in one two and then rodriguez has
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:04.640]  all these other firefighter and police and and other witnesses that he was there getting him
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:08.880]  out of the building like he always said and what is the bastard control corporate media do they
[2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:15.520]  say he's a liar i mean that's what they do but just like barry jennings there's news clips from that
[2:22:15.520 --> 2:22:21.760]  day of the same story neither of them ever changed a word they're the same but willy rodriguez went
[2:22:21.760 --> 2:22:27.360]  public and now the story is known to more people if you check out fabled enemies in the extras we
[2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:33.680]  actually have a full interview with anthony santa lemacia who was willy rodriguez's supervisor
[2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:39.200]  and he tells the same exact story as rodriguez explosions underneath them prior to the plane
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:43.680]  strike you know that didn't happen until a moment later and you know this is a guy that would be
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:48.640]  willing to go in front of a grand jury as well i mean again alex there are more survivors than ever
[2:22:48.640 --> 2:22:52.800]  that are coming out and telling their stories there are more people interested in 9 11 truth
[2:22:52.800 --> 2:22:58.800]  than ever across the country uh if you go on youtube i literally handed out 100 dvd in less
[2:22:58.800 --> 2:23:05.200]  than three minutes and by the way just the action just the action of taking action sets the precedent
[2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:10.800]  to resist tyranny just getting involved and to see the enemy operations saying making copies of dvds
[2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:16.240]  does nothing marching does nothing taking over tv live tv does nothing you're making us look bad
[2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:19.760]  getting involved what are the founding fathers did they tartan feathered and hung people and
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:24.560]  burned things down we're not doing that so these people claiming it's unamerican to go bullhorn
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:30.960]  live media uh that's covering up the truth they are unamerican they are feds and they will be exposed
[2:23:30.960 --> 2:23:34.480]  all of that trash unbelievable we're going back live right now
[2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:42.560]  they're scared to death of you taking over live media they're scared to death of you getting out
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:46.080]  in the streets are scared to death that you're starting blogs calling it a talk shows making
[2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:51.280]  your own 9 11 truth videos they need false flag tear they need to be able to blow stuff up and
[2:23:51.280 --> 2:23:55.200]  get everybody to cower and love them we're taking one of their favorite tools and exposing it
[2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:00.480]  everything we've warned people about is coming out in the mainstream news the drugs they put
[2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:04.880]  in the water it levels higher than it could just be from sewage how they poison us the
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:09.680]  chemtrails are now declassified they are spraying us mainstream news we told you what happened with
[2:24:09.680 --> 2:24:14.720]  fending fanny may and freddy mac eight years nine years ago it's all happening we have the
[2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:20.880]  credibility we know what's going on and the establishment is panicking the people are waking
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:25.840]  up we can win this fight half a battle is realizing you can win you can't fight and showing up for
[2:24:25.840 --> 2:24:30.320]  the fight they're telling you hey there's no fight going on there is a fight going on ladies and
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:34.000]  gentlemen and i'm not going to put up with it i'm going to get into economic news attacks on the
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  first amendment that's why they're trying to restrict us now they're coming out all over the
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:43.360]  place trying to attack free speech in the us because they can't win if we have our free speech
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:49.440]  because we do have power for those that don't know recapping in from your perspective what's
[2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:53.120]  going on with this very jennings case who was he what's developed what are we looking into
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:25:00.080]  well buried jennings of course hurt explosions and that opens up a whole basket of questions about
[2:25:00.080 --> 2:25:04.560]  building seven that were certainly never on the table since no one ever heard of this building
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:10.320]  anyway and what really brought down that building buried jennings himself volunteered he didn't just
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:16.080]  answer to questions when jason bermus and dylan spoke to him he volunteered that he was an old
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:22.160]  boiler guy he didn't believe the official story of building seven was whatsoever possible not only
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:27.440]  because he heard explosions and reiterated he knew what he heard he knows what explosions sound like
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:33.280]  but he also knew that an oil field tank couldn't bring the building down in a symmetrical collapse
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:39.360]  he knew those questions were outstanding and yet when they portrayed him on the bbc uh which was
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:43.680]  really the first time he was known to a mass audience they twisted his words what i want people
[2:25:43.680 --> 2:25:49.440]  to know is that on your dvd jason bermus fabled enemies that's where you can watch the entire
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:54.000]  unedited buried jennings interview that no one's ever seen those are his words and you can see
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:59.520]  what he volunteered and also the questions he answered well i mean make no mistake and i'm
[2:25:59.520 --> 2:26:03.760]  not asking for people sympathy or anything but my god folks you got all these cowardly feds
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:10.000]  out there saying we don't have courage in 911 truth to go out and stand at 911 events and say
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:14.960]  it's an inside job or takeover tv live shows and be beat up and attack and have knife-wielding people
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:19.920]  cut up our equipment and they tell us we don't have courage or that we're bad or we're maniacs
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:25.600]  they're scared of you not being gelded or neutered they're scared of you taking action they're scared
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:33.280]  of that american spirit shining and expanding and i'm telling you uh you know we do get death threats
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:38.080]  folks i have been physically attacked i've had all kinds of crap happen and you know i do this
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:42.640]  because i know i believe in a higher power and i know evils got to be confronted or it always
[2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:47.760]  takes over and like cancer and kills societies and look around you you know evils growing you know
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:54.800]  things are out of control and i just want to commend all of 911 truth and my crew and everybody
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:27:02.240]  who puts up with all the stuff we put up with for you know a serious cause a very important
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:06.960]  cause the highest of causes and uh you know this is real ladies and gentlemen and the globalists
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:12.800]  want to make you cynical want to get us in fighting because they know how much personal power you have
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:17.520]  and that's why this show has come under attack in a concerted effort i mean just look at it
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:21.840]  and that lets me know we are hurting them and later we're going to get into all the web censorship
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:27.280]  but uh bernice when you're over the target you're getting all the flack i hear you but i'm just
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:31.840]  going to keep pushing forward alex i mean we have to we have no choice you know this is a very
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:36.560]  unfortunate event but hopefully we can use this event to wake up even more people than 911 truth
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:42.080]  well we've passed the point of return and uh we don't have a choice i mean we are committed to this
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:47.360]  fight uh we are committed to this and it's a good feeling to be committed and no there's no turning
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:54.960]  back plus we now see where the new order ends bankruptcy depression being peons having no wealth
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:59.920]  being slaves living in a total control grid uh where every move is watched and controlled with
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:04.000]  all these new social service police i mean i've got articles here today about them going into
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.640]  schools unannounced and saying we're militia going to kill you teachers having heart attacks
[2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:11.680]  and the cops just say we're going to do it again we we're going to unannounce do this
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:16.240]  it's mind control and and and adults at major parks being told you're not allowed to be there
[2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:20.400]  because you might be a pedophile meanwhile the government of the pedophiles uh you know i mean
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:24.160]  if they're just getting on our lives getting in our business totally doing things they shouldn't
[2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:29.520]  be doing it's out of control erin yeah i mean once you realize you've been trapped in a world of
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:35.520]  watching tv and not knowing anything about the world around you once you realize any part of
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:39.520]  the truth how could you not want to pursue it and i mean what have you got to lose at that
[2:28:39.520 --> 2:28:44.800]  point you've got only the whole world to gain uh in terms of knowing what's really going on
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:50.720]  and nine eleven truth is just an emblematic case of that well you knew in your gut you said two
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:55.680]  weeks ago he's dead and i said no no it's probably hoax and then i know in my gut they killed him i
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:29:00.880]  mean you know i have no doubt they killed barry jennings and as the commenter said on info wars
[2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:06.080]  he may not even know that he may not you know the way they kill you know they kill you with fast
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:10.880]  acting cancers uh they just microwave gun you out of the back of a van you kind of feel weird you

[2:29:51.920 --> 2:29:56.240]  an obituary we need to make this public we need to make building seven an issue again
[2:29:56.960 --> 2:30:06.800]  all right we're going to come back and we're going to play uh the your talk about a month ago a
[2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:10.240]  little more than a month ago right before he was killed right before he died mysteriously
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:16.240]  under probable murder circumstances i'm going to play that seven minute clip when we get back the
[2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:22.400]  audio of that the video is in the story that's up on info wars dot com it's it's in those moving
[2:30:22.400 --> 2:30:27.760]  boxes at the top the feather sick story up there from yesterday key witness to wtc explosions dead
[2:30:28.560 --> 2:30:33.600]  at 53 so that is coming up i'm going to throw this back into break and take a two minute
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:38.080]  break and then we'll be right back thanks jason bermas thank you you know what erin anything
[2:30:38.080 --> 2:30:43.840]  else you want to add not really only that when you look at one individual under a microscope
[2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:47.680]  you can wonder if it's suspicious or not but when you look at the big picture it's clear it
[2:30:47.680 --> 2:30:53.520]  happened over and over as you said in the jfk case and if this is a specific suspicious death we
[2:30:53.520 --> 2:30:58.960]  have to get to the bottom of it we have to find out the truth and we have to honor his death if
[2:30:58.960 --> 2:31:02.960]  indeed he was killed we have to honor well that's the thing we have three thousand people that were
[2:31:02.960 --> 2:31:07.600]  murdered i assure you if we could talk to him right now everyone would say absolutely find out who
[2:31:07.600 --> 2:31:11.680]  did this and the majority of the victims families have set on record and the heads of the biggest
[2:31:11.680 --> 2:31:15.600]  groups have said the most of us believe it's an inside job that was years ago and we got polls
[2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:19.680]  years ago or 84 percent believe the government's lying fifty something percent believe total inside
[2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:24.880]  job and you know that's the majority of the polls they got a few cooked ones were only
[2:31:24.880 --> 2:31:29.520]  half believe they're being lied to you know we're the majority and that's what 9 11 truth did
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:33.600]  we went and when it was the first time a major hoax was exposed in a matter of
[2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:40.400]  months instead of a matter of 20 30 years like jfk and we taught people how to culture jam
[2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:44.400]  how to take over live media events how to be active how to break people out of their trance
[2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:49.600]  watching tv to take over events i mean it's just revolutionary it's beautiful it's gorgeous
[2:31:49.600 --> 2:31:54.400]  and you know what you dirty lowdown feds we're not going to stop and you can't stop us and i

[2:32:54.320 --> 2:33:01.280]  really understand the truth around them they can never truly graphs the full beauty of the world or
[2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:09.920]  nor can they see the true darkness in it as well they are blinded but it's more than a
[2:33:09.920 --> 2:33:16.080]  physical or mental blindness it's a deep spiritual blindness and i come as all truth tellers
[2:33:16.080 --> 2:33:23.840]  throughout history come to unlock people's minds to simply take the blinders off so they can see
[2:33:23.840 --> 2:33:29.200]  for themselves and then they unlock their own minds i'll say this again about 9 11 truth
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:33.040]  i'm so busy doing so many different things so many different irons in the fire
[2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:40.480]  military movements uh police state actions domestically economic activities 9 11 information
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:48.480]  films i've making and you know employees staff articles family illnesses you know things like
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:53.280]  that that that that it takes me a few weeks sometimes to pick up on a pattern even though
[2:33:53.280 --> 2:33:57.200]  it's there in plain view i'm like everybody else it takes a while for me to see a pattern
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:02.160]  and i just started seeing all these reports about 9 11 truth is dead 9 11 truth is dead 9 11
[2:34:02.160 --> 2:34:06.640]  truth is dead 9 11 truth is dead 9 11 truth is a disgrace 9 11 truth is doing a bad job
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:12.000]  9 11 truth you know it's just pathetic it's not good all from people who claim they're part of it
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:16.160]  and i kept thinking oh that person's just an ego maniac because they're not prominent in it
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:21.120]  they're attacking then i'd see another totally separate person saying the same thing and then
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:27.120]  i'd track them back and i'm like wait there's like 20 of these people and 18 of them are former army
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:33.680]  or naval intelligence wow you know and i'd go get data packets and pay money to look into who they
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:39.840]  are like we just did on jennings you know you can buy that stuff we just paid 50 bucks for it
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:44.000]  when they pay a couple hundred more i get even more info and you go my god these people are
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:48.320]  black ops and then you see what they're all saying but even if you don't have that data
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:54.000]  you could sit right there and see they're all saying the same thing the same catchphrases
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:59.040]  to get it moving because they're scared to death man best actress willy nelson governor ventura
[2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:04.160]  uh... italian president highly respected former italian intelligence had high-level
[2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:08.960]  japanese you know members of parliament in europe uh... open calls by u n commissions
[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:15.280]  for nine eleven inside job investigations uh... architects and engineers nine eleven truth
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:21.120]  getting multiple peer reviewed and prestigious journals about controlled implosions of tower
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:27.840]  one two and seven uh... the niss report imploding being discredited all these eyewitnesses coming out
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:34.000]  out all these you know martin sheen amy goodman george carlin all going public and then the
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:39.280]  citizens are only doing a shadow of what the founders did the uh... sons of liberty from eight
[2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:43.520]  from seventeen sixty to seventeen seventy five handing out pamphlets little handprinted
[2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:48.720]  things to get arrested for uh... burning down police stations tar and feathering corrupt bureaucrats
[2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:53.040]  the bureaucrats came and put somebody in the stocks for their speech they would just go to the
[2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:58.400]  police the the head constable's house and burn it down i'm not saying do that but you grab the
[2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:03.200]  patriot for his free speech they would go burn you out or they would write and burn down the city
[2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:08.640]  hall uh... they would hang up dummies in the streets of who the next public official was servant
[2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:13.760]  they were going to kill now that's what our founders did and we praise them and hail them
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:20.000]  but nowadays you go to an event and you say nine eleven's an inside job so people watching
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:24.400]  national tv realize they're watching a controlled program that makes them think or you put out
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:31.440]  websites people can hear it and it's attacked as bad and uh... you know it's not good you just
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:35.520]  stay in your house you need to not go out and interface with people and nine eleven truth is called
[2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:45.600]  all manner of names let me give you the straight scoop just like we told you fanny
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:51.680]  man freddy mac we're gonna plunge just like we told you basically everything else that's happened
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:55.120]  years before because we have the globalist documents we know their program we know what
[2:36:55.120 --> 2:36:58.240]  they've done in hundreds of other countries we know what they say they're doing in this country
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:07.120]  we know what we're talking about and nine eleven truth did better than i even thought it probably
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:15.600]  would i knew there was a potential to cause a grassroots movement and a massive epiphany or a
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:20.560]  flashpoint and awakening the inside job false flag to have a revelation of that understanding
[2:37:21.520 --> 2:37:27.440]  to understand that that that that if we exposed problem or action solution government sponsored
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:32.160]  terror their favorite tool that one of their main weapons would be destroyed
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:39.360]  and i made personal sacrifices two months before to go on air and say they're gonna probably blow
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:43.520]  up the world trade center blaming on their asset bin laden and they're probably going to launch
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:50.080]  an anthrax attack you know that's also in that video in a two hour tv show i did radio shows because
[2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:54.480]  because i knew they'd done drills before and everything they did a drill for
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:57.520]  they ended up doing i knew they done a drill attack on the world trade center
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:38:02.240]  just like the fbi did attack at 93 about cooking the bomb train the driver giving him the detonators
[2:38:03.360 --> 2:38:06.960]  and it was a hidden in plain view and they were doing drills and had done drills before
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:14.720]  in and around a federal building being bombed like okc and so i saw the dark winter exercise and
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:19.840]  top off and others and so i went on and i saw the media getting everybody ready the terror is
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:23.040]  about to happen give your rights up when it happens so i went on air and said that and a few
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:26.320]  affiliates called up and said you're you're crazy we're dumping your show and i said
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:31.680]  please don't but do what you have to and they did dump and then i the show was bigger am and fm
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:36.640]  wise it's bigger internet shortwave satellite you know overall now that it was seven years ago but
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:43.040]  affiliate wise i almost got up to 80 affiliates i mean it was big and we had stuff like liberty
[2:38:43.040 --> 2:38:46.640]  works and a bunch of other little networks carrying us that's how we got about 80 affiliates
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:51.360]  and man i went on air that day and said it's an inside job i said they're probably gonna launch
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:57.120]  an anthrax attack that day and let me tell you i mean we had like 25 30 stations that day turned
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:02.400]  it off fact they called and they said promise not to say that anymore the program director called
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:05.840]  me and said we never told you what to say but here's all these stations that give me their phone
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:12.240]  numbers so i called them that day and that next day and they'd say look buddy uh uh you're not
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:16.000]  going to say that on here you know uh we know you're right about the u n in the new world order
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:19.840]  but you're not i said look it's going to come out it's an inside job but you're aware of operation
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:23.360]  northwoods you're aware of and they said look i don't care you're not going to say that on the
[2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:29.360]  station and i said well do what you got to do now there's a lot of talk out there about how people
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:34.000]  won't be censored and they won't compromise but then i've seen everybody do it a station calls
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  these other hosts or other networks up they crap their pants and they say we're not going to talk
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:43.360]  about the new world order period that you know that's selling out all the way from the beginning
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:49.760]  not me and you know why because i don't care about gold and silver diamonds or property
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:54.880]  i care about life i care about my family i care about my family name i care about
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:40:00.400]  who i am that's my value my value is not being con not being manipulated and standing up to bullies
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:05.440]  and and and having the courage to study and be a scholar of this does that mean i'm the perfect
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.360]  person to bring this information forward no but i'm the person that's willing to do it
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:15.360]  and that's why the enemy wants to pull me down they're they want to kill me
[2:40:16.640 --> 2:40:20.240]  they have told me they plan to kill me i don't know if that's the case they've even threatened
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:24.240]  my family i'm passed a point of return i can't give into that i will not give into that
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:31.200]  and none of us are perfect and and and and and and in some cases years ago i wasn't in this for
[2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:36.400]  all the right reasons i mean overall i was but i had problems i had vestigial problems but i all
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:41.040]  that is literally peeling away it's almost completely peeled away from me i'm a completely
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:45.280]  different person i was already an interesting person overall a good person with a big heart
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:58.320]  but to face my fears time and time again to go to that next level and to see the people we've
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:03.440]  woken up to see the people we've energized to see the movements that we have spawned together
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:10.240]  i'm a very small part of it it's you the listeners of the show you did it 98% of it
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:18.800]  the go-getters the people that know and so many of them are great veterans and school teachers and
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:25.200]  old black men and young white women and hispanics it doesn't matter everybody farm folks doctors
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:32.960]  lawyers you know who you are out there and if i've got it you know early on i had to be the
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:38.080]  bad man i had to be the you know the dark night as they say i had to be the bad guy i had to be
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:42.400]  the one that had got all the attacks heaped on me and all the laughing and the giggling and the
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:46.960]  nut who thought it was an inside job i but you know what it was a blessing to hit the barb wire
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:51.600]  for everybody else it was a blessing because i knew what it would lead to and i don't care
[2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:57.760]  if people laugh at me i don't care if people degrade me it doesn't matter if if you know i was
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:03.840]  covered with uh you know cream pie naked in front of a million people with them giggling at me or
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:13.280]  throwing tomatoes at me in the stocks because what matters is what reality is and what decency is
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:20.320]  and what the truth is and folks you know come in for the big win be part of history be part of
[2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:28.640]  honor be part of courage be part of saying no to evil and shed your worldliness you won't feel
[2:42:28.640 --> 2:42:34.160]  inadequate anymore about how fancy your car is or how big your house is you won't feel an addict
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:39.600]  you won't have that that spot in your heart missing anymore you're you're you you have a spot you a
[2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:46.240]  vacuum in you because you're not getting the truth you people feel inadequate out there because
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:51.520]  they've never tied into reality and what it really is to be human when to be part of something bigger
[2:42:52.640 --> 2:42:59.040]  and that amazing journey one life to live one life to make or to break it what is your destiny
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:04.320]  going to be to serve evil or to serve good now that's the question i ask you
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:11.600]  and it isn't about alex jones you know i don't want people to defend me as i'm attacked by the
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:16.320]  enemy you know i mean it's kind of like we're going over bar bar here and i've been hit by a
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:20.480]  mortar and my guts are hanging out folks if we don't take those machine gun nests we're all
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:25.680]  going to get killed i want you to just leave me lying i have done my work and i and and figuratively
[2:43:25.680 --> 2:43:29.520]  my guts aren't blown out we're bigger and batter and having a bigger effect on the new world order
[2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:35.760]  than ever but the point is don't defend me on the message boards the websites the radio talk shows
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:41.920]  us when you call in don't make it about alex jones don't that's what the enemy wants they want to
[2:43:41.920 --> 2:43:48.240]  tie you up in that debate make it about is sodium fluoride poisonous is it bad for you here's the
[2:43:48.240 --> 2:43:54.880]  evidence make it about is mercury in the vaccines and is it bad if it is yes it is or are the troops
[2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:59.360]  having to serve four or five tours and mentally destroying them or is du deadly for the troops
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:06.320]  and is it being used and do the army manuals admit it was deadly or have the private banks set this
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:11.200]  up to turn america into a police state and steal all of our wealth in a quote bailout and yes they are
[2:44:12.880 --> 2:44:19.200]  or did i witnesses report bombs going off in the buildings and are those witnesses being killed
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:26.400]  two witnesses have died in the last month killed definitely what are we going to do right now
[2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:33.360]  now that's our choice that's the decision we have to make we've gone this far we've literally
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:39.040]  gone 80 percent of the way in the fight for 9 11 truth and it isn't just about 9 11 truth it's
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:45.200]  about stopping future stage terror attacks it's about stopping the globalist from blowing up more
[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:52.000]  buildings releasing bio weapons launching new wars setting off suitcase nukes all these things
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:45:00.080]  they've said they do and they always keep their promises unless confronted are we going to continue
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:04.720]  to expose inside job so that it exposes it into the future and so that's the first thing people
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:10.480]  think of it happens so the enemy with the nsa can sample what the public's really saying and realize
[2:45:10.480 --> 2:45:13.120]  a false flag terror attack isn't going to go over with these people
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:21.840]  and so people in government like the ones that leaked it to see more hersher than
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:28.320]  yorker magazine that dick chaney was planning to make fake iranian speed boats military patrol
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:33.760]  boats paint them up blue and have navy seals dressed up in iranian uniforms pull up under
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:38.240]  orders and attack a us destroyer and the destroyer was then going to destroy that ship and say it was
[2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:45.600]  iranians but shows the dirty stuff they've had seals doing good god they were ready to attack
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:52.800]  our own ships the point is that came out and we stopped it because of 9 11 truth the key and the
[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:57.040]  enemy hates that it's the key to grassroots organization the key to people getting in
[2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:01.680]  government's face with real issues not the control left right paradigm it's the key to the gorilla
[2:46:01.680 --> 2:46:06.240]  media it's the key to people handing out information not just on this subject but hundreds of others
[2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:10.080]  we're defeating the north american union right now with all the data and the information the
[2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:16.080]  activism and the confrontations and going to city halls and university lectures
[2:46:17.680 --> 2:46:22.400]  and corporate lectures and confronting all the former attorney generals and senators and congress
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:28.000]  people and presidents with real issues and it's easy to monday morning quarterback and say well
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:32.720]  some ask the questions wrong or some ask him right the point is it's the process they're on the field
[2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:39.040]  they're engaging the enemy i salute you that's what it's all about it's about taking action do we
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:43.600]  do perfect every time do we make a first down every down no we go out there we do the best
[2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:50.720]  job we can and we learn from it and we commit our lives our names our sacred honor our families
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:56.400]  fully the enemy is going to take it all regardless so all the chance we've got of survival the only
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:08.800]  chance we've got of a future is to fight these people 110 so i'm begging you to realize we've
[2:47:08.800 --> 2:47:14.240]  had a massive effect and we've gone supernova it's exponential the chain reaction is beautiful
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:22.080]  and there have been many battles in history where the enemy with cavalry going back thousands of
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:28.080]  years would learn the horn signals of the other side and if they started losing they would play
[2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:33.360]  a dirty trick or it's like a fake handoff in football they'd blow the horns for the retreat
[2:47:34.640 --> 2:47:38.400]  they'd have their scouts go around behind the other army and come up on a rock and blow the
[2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:44.480]  retreat horn and that would a lot of times make an army that was winning go oh my god the battle's
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:53.200]  over the signal to pull backs been given so that's why they started going to horns drums and flags
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:58.880]  so that there'd be flag signals from the back and the officers and flag signals in the front
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:05.040]  you're having military operations launched on you these people think it's cute what they're doing
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:10.720]  all of you first year good old boys you sign on to it you get some of the graft and payoffs
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:15.440]  in the black ops system and then your your your sheep dipped into bloody corruption and now you
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:20.480]  think it's funny what you're part of you've signed on to the abomination desolation you've signed
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:26.480]  on to every evil committed against innocence you have signed on to the destruction of your soul
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:32.800]  and let me tell you something deep down you know you got a soul in your gut you know you do and
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:37.360]  that's why right now you're uncomfortable listening to this and watching this if you serve evil
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:41.840]  and I want you to know something you're not going to escape judgment and you're going to be judged
[2:48:41.840 --> 2:48:48.160]  while you're alive that's a little secret oh yeah there's a second judgment there's a first one
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:55.120]  and I wouldn't want to be you you are blind don't you want to have sight don't you understand

[2:49:12.640 --> 2:49:17.200]  and it's that evil idea that expands and grows from there and our enemies rationalize everything
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:23.920]  they do they make up bad things about us so they can persecute us they exaggerate things about us
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:28.240]  so they can persecute us and feel good about what they do but they're going to fail on the end

[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:15.600]  trillions and trillions fanny may friday mac trillions leveraged hundreds of times
[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:22.800]  just unlimited robbery and the federal government saying they'll bail out the automakers they'll
[2:54:22.800 --> 2:54:29.760]  bail out any banks they'll bail out anything and everything but it's not a bailout these banks were
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:38.800]  used as fronts to sell packages of securities that were basically based on nothing and then
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:43.440]  leverage that out 10 times and then leverage it out 10 times and then 10 times and so now
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.200]  they've got to leave somebody holding the bag and that is us and god help us
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:56.320]  85 billion dollar bailout today of aig that was the big insurance the insurer of the stocks and
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:55:04.160]  bonds the u.s treasury three month bill rate drops to lowest since 1954 more than 50 years
[2:55:04.160 --> 2:55:12.800]  so the united states credit is now beginning to suffer worldwide that's why suddenly gold which
[2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:18.560]  they have artificially been suppressing so they could buy it up spiked more than 50 dollars
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:24.480]  today and they can drive it down but only for a matter of time morgan stanley's weighing
[2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  possible merger report to try to stay afloat that's out of Reuters that's one of the other big five
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:39.120]  two of them gone under this week reduced dominance is predicted for us analysts previews report to
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:43.520]  next president this is the washington post saying the u.s will basically be a banana republic
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:48.720]  that was always the plan that's why all the industries tax incentives to move offshore
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:54.240]  and then again put everything on the hated americans back and as long as they put an american flag
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:56:01.120]  in our face we will do whatever they say while these anti-americans rape us financially
[2:56:02.960 --> 2:56:11.200]  so i mean we are just seeing the worst possible scenarios in all of this economically happening
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:16.320]  and there's no talk of criminal charges no talk of investigations in fact the news keeps saying the
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:21.360]  government officials keep saying oh well nobody did anything wrong nobody at fanny mary friday mac or
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:27.760]  leeman brothers or uh you know any of these companies are going to get in trouble nobody at
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:38.000]  goldman sacks nobody at uh bare sterns it's just you know trillions of dollars is missing and
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:42.400]  trillions from the pentagon's been stolen and nothing's going to be done because it's planned
[2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:47.920]  to happen that way and then it's not another just going to run off and run a scam where they
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:52.880]  bought real assets see see they keep saying well governments can print money but they can't make
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:58.640]  wealth with it that's not true during the first part of the ponzi scheme it's still valued and
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:05.920]  people will accept it for yachts and skyscrapers and companies and then it's us that gets handed it
[2:57:05.920 --> 2:57:10.560]  at the end when all the corruption's been about like this and now the next year or so it'll just
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:15.200]  be to the moon just just you know a few inches of corruption is enough to overthrow the entire
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:22.560]  financial order but now at the end they just run it all the way out to infinity and have their
[2:57:22.560 --> 2:57:26.880]  paramilitary continuity of government system stand by to control everybody
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:35.120]  this is their plan and so they tell us here an intelligence forecast for being prepared for
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:39.760]  the next president and global risk and visions a steady decline in us dominance in the coming
[2:57:39.760 --> 2:57:46.800]  decades as the world is reshaped by globalization so they use the substance like a baby bird uses
[2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:55.440]  the yolk in the egg to feed itself or not the yolk the outside part the white and then now
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:57:59.520]  what they're done they've consumed it and little cockroach creatures emerging from its shell

[3:00:04.880 --> 3:00:13.600]  assaults on the republic on the bill of rights on the constitution i talked to ten anderson this
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:22.560]  morning when gold was up $50 it's up 85 almost $90 today exploding and we had said that when the
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:27.920]  winner got here it was guaranteed to go back up past its previous high of 1100 bucks an ounce
[3:00:27.920 --> 3:00:33.760]  remember it was just 260 something bucks five years ago but they can only suppress the price
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:39.440]  of gold and commodity so long when the dollars devalued and the announcement that the that the
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:45.840]  u.s treasury stand through the private federal reserve stands behind tens of trillions which
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:52.880]  has been leveraged into thousands of trillions every day you know 100 billion 50 billion 87
[3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:59.120]  million one day 50 something trillion that was two weeks ago bailouts and the world is saying

[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:13.120]  attack on free speech because you know we can always get our economy back even through a
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:17.040]  depression but if we don't have liberty none of it will come back i mean folks it's all happening

[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:26.000]  racing down it into the pool of alcohol as they say down the razor blade into that
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:32.080]  but just massive stuff developing here but but ted is going to offer gold at the same
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:39.680]  price he offered it yesterday at $85 an ounce under what it was now now he's never offered

[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:10.160]  up and down before it goes to the moon the point is fundamentally the dollar is going to zero

[3:08:18.800 --> 3:08:23.040]  because you have the stores of gold and silver at the lower price well we had a note we had the
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:29.520]  ability to lock in when the market was low and and and i'd rather pass it on to the people that
[3:08:29.520 --> 3:08:36.720]  listening i tell you alex i got the same lecture from my buyer mona who actually she's she manages
[3:08:36.720 --> 3:08:41.680]  all my buyers i've got about five of them and she's what are you doing she says if we sell more than
[3:08:41.680 --> 3:08:46.560]  this we're going to be you know that's okay i mean i'll take the risk i mean we here the people

[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:02.640]  you don't you don't understand how much that means to me to be able to see that and and and having
[3:09:02.640 --> 3:09:07.200]  about 80 percent of the people in the place already know who i am and thinking me for what i've done
[3:09:07.200 --> 3:09:10.960]  it's not what i've done and it's not necessarily what you've done alex all these people have set
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:15.840]  forth and done so much you know talking about 9 11 truth ventura did it at the ron paul event

[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:31.680]  that have tens of millions of supporters i mean 9 11 truth from your perspective are you seeing it
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:35.760]  get bigger or smaller oh it's getting way bigger alex where you can remember what it was like
[3:09:35.760 --> 3:09:40.320]  years ago and we first started all this stuff in fact you remember that you and trudeau got me on
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:43.760]  the phone you said look we're not going to tell you what to say but all these affiliates are dumping
[3:09:44.480 --> 3:09:49.280]  we're not telling you to stop it just just be advised i mean you remember that ted don't you
[3:09:49.280 --> 3:09:54.080]  oh yeah because everybody was so wigged out about this thing i mean it was yay raw raw let's go in
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:10:00.000]  and get how sad i was saying i'm not sad i was saying but um uh i can't remember his name well
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:05.600]  someone in london and uh and let's march off into war it was like the 90 percent of the people in
[3:10:05.600 --> 3:10:10.800]  this country wanted to kick some rear end you know and the we're kicking the wrong people's rear
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:16.800]  end that's the problem and it was so distracting at that particular time and uh and and here we've
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:21.840]  just grown into what you know alex honestly i mean even you go back before that the oklahoma city
[3:10:21.840 --> 3:10:26.400]  bombing there's been so many different oh yeah my my first film in 97 was about government sponsored
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:31.200]  terror i've always been on this subject you know we always talk about july 25th is when i said
[3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:34.640]  they're gonna attack the world trade center blaming on their asset bin laden i'd really been
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:40.480]  saying similar things the months before i just named names and was specific uh two months before
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:45.120]  and i and you know it i took a big hit and i went on air and said they're gonna launch an anthrax
[3:10:45.120 --> 3:10:50.720]  attack you know how did i know that well hundreds of different points sources things i'd witnessed
[3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:55.840]  but the point is folks you get hardcore info on the show and talk about the manipulation how they
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:11:00.320]  were able to drive down gold by over a hundred dollars an ounce well that was i mean i really
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:04.240]  feel sorry for the people that are in that uh that futures market right now the people that are
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:08.560]  short on the marketplace that thought it was going to be going down are getting margin called up the
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:12.240]  rear end man i'd they'll be lucky if they have any ass but see that's that's what the globalists do
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:16.640]  they have been caught in lawsuits they've been convicted they manipulate the metals prices and
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:22.080]  other commodities and uh down here in texas there's a lot of oil executives and people that my dad
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:26.400]  knows and i've talked to and they say oil's going to go back up in the winter back up in the summer
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:30.640]  this is only the beginning we'll see what's going to happen but bottom line announcing that
[3:11:30.640 --> 3:11:35.680]  i mean you are treasury former you know treasury director i had a policy a few days ago on the
[3:11:35.680 --> 3:11:40.400]  show saying he's afraid this will destroy the treasury's solvency and now foreigners giving
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:46.320]  us one of the lowest bond rates in u.s history the lowest in 54 years uh i mean they can't
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:52.560]  announce they're going to bail out trillions of dollars uh you know i mean this is unbelievable
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:57.760]  this folks when they print more money and issue it it devalues it and i know most of you know that
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:02.480]  for those that don't it's going to take more dollars to buy gold and silver they're talking
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:08.720]  about runs on banks in mainstream news and banks are going under every day mega banks i mean three
[3:12:08.720 --> 3:12:14.560]  of the big five are insolvent the other two are talking about going insolvent this is armageddon by
[3:12:14.560 --> 3:12:19.760]  design they've moved the real assets out the back door ted give them that offer one more time yeah
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:24.480]  sure i'll i'll tell you right now it's uh walking liberty halves over half pieces they're the ones
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:32.160]  from the 1940s uh 695 a coin they made the us eagle the new us eagle does to to emulate that
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:36.400]  coin because it's so beautiful to gorgeous coin i've got a bag of them and and the and the next
[3:12:36.400 --> 3:12:41.920]  thing is that british sovereign coin quarter ounce gold piece do the math 217 a piece that's
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:48.480]  that's below spot frank 173 that's one fifth of an ounce of gold uh right now at this particular
[3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:53.440]  time you can't find a better buy this is the best buy in the marketplace and besides the fact
[3:12:53.440 --> 3:12:57.600]  gold just went up like crazy and like you said alex there's enough financial institutions
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:02.800]  if you had your money into an ira or if you have it in the bank if you're if it's sitting somewhere
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:07.440]  in in some stocks or bonds or wherever you at you've got to get away from the us dollar you've
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:11.760]  got to get out of these markets and buy something that's solid and secure and gold and silver
[3:13:11.760 --> 3:13:18.080]  that there's nothing that meets that match that is it ted give folks the toll free number
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:29.360]  yeah 1 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7 again 1 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7 and again i stress get physical delivery of

[3:21:26.480 --> 3:21:30.400]  so i get a lot of the heat and they haven't killed me because they don't want to give what i've said

[3:22:11.120 --> 3:22:19.120]  care about them every immigrant uh that is uh coming to this country every single one of them
[3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:24.080]  is being forced to take the h pv Gardasil shot they admit kills people with a live cancer virus

[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:41.200]  know if i had to hire an attorney for religious exemptions or there really is no mandatory law
[3:22:41.200 --> 3:22:47.840]  that you have to take vaccines here's how the fraud works you never heard me explain this on

[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:14.320]  reality look everything's done through color of law fraud uh did we just lose her okay i just heard
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:18.560]  a big click they tell you what let's just come back to the full audience and answer the question
[3:23:18.560 --> 3:23:21.680]  the problem is i'll never get to all these callers of these are long questions but right how do i
[3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:27.840]  protect my life and the vaccines no i understand ma'am here we go here we go s a dot org today
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:38.240]  okay uh melissa in north carolina during the behind the scenes info wars dot com streams
[3:23:38.240 --> 3:23:43.760]  by the way uh we're on am and fm station shortwave satellite but hundreds of thousands of people today
[3:23:43.760 --> 3:23:50.160]  tune in via the streams i have my separate own streams at info wars dot com that's how you hear
[3:23:50.160 --> 3:23:54.160]  the behind the scenes discussions is by going there and clicking those were down for about 30
[3:23:54.160 --> 3:23:59.600]  minutes or 20 minutes this morning and uh so people are going to miss the behind the scenes
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:04.560]  discussions if you don't go over to those streams uh also when the show ends and the rebroadcast
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:09.360]  starts and i go through the what we believe could be the murder of barry jennings a key 911 witness
[3:24:09.360 --> 3:24:13.600]  all the you know uh details were covered in the first hour and a bunch of other key news you won't
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:19.280]  be able to hear that unless you're listening uh to those streams so that's all at info wars dot
[3:24:19.280 --> 3:24:28.720]  com and prison planet dot com melissa had asked the question about how does she protect herself
[3:24:28.720 --> 3:24:35.360]  you know is it really not a law that she has to take vaccines is there a law that you've uh
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:43.200]  got to have an abortion by melissa yes sir but under eugenics since the 20s through the 80s
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:49.120]  they sterilize over 500 000 women by just grabbing them by kidnapping them i have newsreel clips in
[3:24:49.120 --> 3:24:56.000]  my film in game uh so so they came through color of law with brainwashed police and they did that
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:02.320]  now do you remember uh last school year started i had the prince george county state attorney on
[3:25:02.320 --> 3:25:06.960]  and he admitted his children don't vaccinate but they had police dogs out 2000 children and their
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:11.040]  parents were told it was the law they had to take vaccines and they showed up with police dogs
[3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:15.120]  barking and growling and took the shots but then i had him on and i said there's no law and he said
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:21.200]  no there's not so that shows the government it's criminal and so they lie and they say
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:26.480]  you won't be allowed to be in school you'll be arrested but what they do is they suspend you
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:32.800]  for not having your child for not having the shots then truancy kicks in but under federal and state
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:38.000]  law they can't do that for something that isn't against the law they say it's school policy
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:44.080]  so then they expel you then they trigger truancy and then they come arrest you for that and then
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:49.120]  they they color of law because you're ignorant it's for your own good they say give your kids
[3:25:49.120 --> 3:25:53.760]  shots and we'll drop the charges and then you get the shots they let you back in school and now
[3:25:53.760 --> 3:25:59.040]  your kid's just on probation there okay now let me let me let me finish here how the fraud works
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:08.720]  then when they're introducing a crime a mass crime operation on us they they get you to contract
[3:26:08.720 --> 3:26:14.080]  your rights away so they announce for those that do know it's not the law we want you to sign a
[3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:19.120]  waiver form and most waiver forms say i've met i'm a bad parent i'd met i'm putting them in danger
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:24.560]  but it's my conscientious objector religious right to do this but there's no triggering law to make
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:29.200]  you do that and the parents i know just threaten to sue them and say look that's a fraud as well
[3:26:29.200 --> 3:26:33.600]  i'm not signing a form there's no law triggering that health department and i appreciate your call
[3:26:34.240 --> 3:26:40.960]  it's the same thing with the hpv shot there's no law as they announced in texas it's the law
[3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:48.000]  you've got to take the shot there's no law there's no law the health department got a mandate from
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:55.840]  the governor to make it their list of mandatory recommended see it's all lawyers speak mandatory
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:05.280]  recommended then they run a giant hoax on the cattle drooling population drunk on fluoride
[3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:12.480]  and aspartame that it the governor says you have to take it then the feds say all the immigrants
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:19.840]  have to take it i love to talk to you all day but i got to get all the calls here now and i gave her
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:23.600]  like six seven minutes i i've got to give people less time because i've got to get to all the points
[3:27:24.320 --> 3:27:29.040]  ma'am i've asked my webmasters curtain ammo and paul watson i think they created sections and they
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:33.920]  get buried because there's so much new news every day we need permanent vaccine center on the site
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:38.560]  that has the state exemption forms first but even that's bad because it introduces you into the
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:45.120]  fraud of having to get a waiver see it's a waiver to a law that doesn't exist see right there the
[3:27:45.120 --> 3:27:53.280]  government's rogue it's criminal ben and virginia you're on the air hey how you doing alex i just
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:57.680]  wanted to uh point out that i know one of the vortices of this uh nine eleven truth movement
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:03.040]  is dead sort of things if you go to the latest issue of skeptics magazine they've got an article
[3:28:03.040 --> 3:28:09.200]  in there talking about how since uh loose change has uh dropped in viewing which we already know
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:13.760]  that's manipulated then that means that the whole movement is dead if we can get enough letters
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:20.240]  sent into skeptics magazine say this is the fraud this is bs we can't have a screw that nobody pays
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:26.560]  attention to that pathetic cider scopes urban legends that says uh that says there's no such
[3:28:26.560 --> 3:28:31.680]  thing as cross species chimeras i mean you know let them say that there's no such thing as the sun
[3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:36.640]  or no such thing as a dog or no such thing as a chinese selling political dissidents organs
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:42.960]  but that's my point they're all the government ops and our quote own people are all saying it
[3:28:42.960 --> 3:28:49.360]  right when valhalla is here and i'm telling you whoever says that is a fed or is under their
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:55.360]  control period anything else i just wanted to say uh that to elicit all the rest of these
[3:28:55.360 --> 3:28:59.280]  people who are still afraid you can't let the fear paralyze you've got to get out there and
[3:28:59.280 --> 3:29:05.040]  you've got to be a bulldog be polite but don't back down that's the key oh hey we don't have a hope
[3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:09.440]  all you can do is fight that's right it's a good feeling to be cornered because then you know there's
[3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:13.840]  nothing you can do but fight exactly thank you for the call we're going to continue with phone

[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:25.760]  it'll be tough when the government takes their entire pension fund everybody else's pension

[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:07.520]  you're talking about her the subject was the economy in 911 if you go to a movie called
[3:37:07.520 --> 3:37:12.640]  the truth and lies in 911 by michael rupert we basically had an economy that was going to implode
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:18.640]  right before 911 he talks about how trillions of dollars go of drug money goes no no he was right
[3:37:18.640 --> 3:37:24.240]  about all of that he was wrong about peak oil and and and pro eugenics you know pro population
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:29.440]  reduction uh but i don't i disagree with him on peak oil too he was right about a lot of the
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:32.960]  finance oh well they're certainly going to artificially take everything we got that's
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:37.360]  kind of the left agenda they tell the leftist oh it's everything's gonna get real bad and
[3:37:37.360 --> 3:37:40.960]  our standard living is going to go down but we deserve it because of the peak oil that's kind
[3:37:40.960 --> 3:37:46.080]  of oh that you know it's it's kind of a higher level disinfo plane you know each strata of
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:51.680]  society is given their own disinfo yeah yeah and i want to confirm about barry jennings is that

[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:59.760]  i'm alex at this point with your dynamic personality um you're really bringing to the
[3:38:59.760 --> 3:39:07.840]  four the the extreme and urgent need to expose the evil in this world i i strongly feel and
[3:39:07.840 --> 3:39:17.440]  understand that we are as we speak here today at the giant and main fulcrum point which is at
[3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:24.480]  the center of the struggle spiritual and global between good and evil in this world it's going
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:30.320]  to go one way or the other i've mentioned the phrase a short time frame to you before i think
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:37.440]  i got it from you as a phrase applicable to the pace of the enemy on a global spiritual level
[3:39:37.440 --> 3:39:47.600]  over recent year well they've got a window yeah they do they do and the the extreme vulnerability
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:55.440]  of the enemy is the greatest right now and that's why people are now for the first time ever ready
[3:39:55.440 --> 3:40:02.080]  to hear ready to know the truth ready to wake up uh the i mean there has never been more fertile
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:08.160]  fields uh to to expose the tyranny people are now ready to hear it and we need to understand we are
[3:40:08.160 --> 3:40:12.880]  having a big effect we have discredited them congress has a nine percent approval rating
[3:40:12.880 --> 3:40:17.200]  and anybody that tells you we i mean i see all these patriot people and all they do on their
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:22.480]  websites and radio shows to say we're losing it's pathetic we're bad nobody's waking up 911
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:27.760]  truths bad those people are feds yeah because i because i noticed it's all the same things they're
[3:40:27.760 --> 3:40:33.040]  saying and it's kind of shocking to go whoa man there's that many of them or some of them are
[3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:39.280]  just being handled or copycats kind of repeating but it's bad you're directly over the target alex
[3:40:39.280 --> 3:40:44.240]  and you have been ever since you began you have been hammering on them and hammering on them and
[3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:49.200]  now when they have to go and expose themselves to any degree that shows that you have actually
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:55.040]  gotten a chink going in their armor and the way i've done nothing you all of us through god and
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:40:59.920]  that's real folks all of us i mean you you got to have a relationship with god to be able to
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:04.160]  deal with this but to know i mean i mean it you think i like knowing the government blew up the
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:08.880]  buildings that's scary as hell you think i like knowing the kidnapped little kids when i have
[3:41:08.880 --> 3:41:12.960]  children you think i like all this i've had and then i can see our own movement but i realize
[3:41:12.960 --> 3:41:17.440]  that's feds that's going tell pro and the good news is people aren't listening to them so just
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:22.640]  thank god praise god and on the other side of it alex their strength is the greatest right now
[3:41:22.640 --> 3:41:27.600]  they have been building up to that point too and that comprises the fulcrum point and whether
[3:41:27.600 --> 3:41:32.480]  it'll be their strength or will be the exposure of truth of what you have been the leader as you
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:37.440]  say and there have been multitudes and are multitudes and now it's increasing at an exponential
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:42.640]  rate i believe almost because people are becoming desperately see the dangers in this world and the
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:49.360]  enemy is telling us our movement's nothing right when it's just i mean they're trying to belittle
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:54.640]  you in the eyes of the public that's one of the tactics in order to stop this influence that you
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:59.920]  have and bring people exposing they want to discredit me so they can kill me they have to discredit
[3:41:59.920 --> 3:42:06.080]  me first that's the greatest danger if they ever cook up some scandal or make some crap up about me
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:10.800]  that then they'll kill me soon after god watches over you i think they would have tried that and
[3:42:10.800 --> 3:42:15.920]  it's if they thought they could they may have tried it not succeeded and saw that there was really
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:20.720]  no way to do that there are other factors that come into it that god protects you by that in
[3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:26.160]  their own mind it's just an inconvenience it's a situational thing the situation just happens to
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:32.640]  turn into a protection for you on a actual physical reality level and they don't see that's the hand
[3:42:32.640 --> 3:42:38.160]  of god but the hand of god is upon the alex jones because you have been the leader sir you if it
[3:42:38.160 --> 3:42:43.280]  wasn't for you imagine where we would be today in this world how much more progress they would have
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:47.280]  made it would have been a little bit but they i believe they would have already implemented it
[3:42:47.280 --> 3:42:55.520]  so you play a part in in god's in the picture of reality as god sees it he's put you here
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:43:00.560]  and uh... all i can say sir is god bless you i have one other quick point if i could mention it to
[3:43:00.560 --> 3:43:07.280]  you i would sure go ahead when it comes to the the steep rise in in gold today i thought that the
[3:43:07.280 --> 3:43:19.600]  the only way to actually counterbalance the uh... demand on the market by just john q public is to
[3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:25.600]  dump gold on the market that's what we've been experiencing all along here as far as we see the
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:30.640]  repression of the market i believe this to be the main vehicle and tool and method that they use
[3:43:30.640 --> 3:43:35.280]  is just simply to dump the gold on the market from what i've understood from yourself and other
[3:43:35.280 --> 3:43:40.240]  enlightened people that you've had on such as bob Chapman and i believe that's what we're seeing
[3:43:40.240 --> 3:43:46.320]  today and i believe they use this vehicle also outside of to repress the market to actually
[3:43:46.320 --> 3:43:52.080]  bring people into the market and now people are transferring their assets all of their assets many
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:57.760]  of them into the market of gold and they're not repressing the market today and i believe that
[3:43:57.760 --> 3:44:03.760]  or they were repressing it not as much as they have been and they're allowing the price to rise
[3:44:03.760 --> 3:44:07.840]  in order to bring oh it's admitted the whole stock market is completely fake a lot of the
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:12.320]  transactions aren't even real it's like enron with fake computer computers you know fake energy

[3:46:31.040 --> 3:46:38.560]  hour you know yeah that's um yeah i'm in the art world um in it you know the globalist
[3:46:39.360 --> 3:46:45.120]  you know that it's it's true that one percent of these these uh these i don't even know what to call
[3:46:45.120 --> 3:46:50.960]  them but you know they they're the ones that buy these pieces and that are just filthy and abominating
[3:46:50.960 --> 3:46:56.640]  and they say oh how wonderful how cool and and really you know the people that the people that
[3:46:56.640 --> 3:47:02.880]  are on the fringe of that but see and hear that you know if you're lucky and you're able to tell them
[3:47:02.880 --> 3:47:09.600]  that what those people are and you know who they are and what they're about um to speak you know
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:16.080]  the these these collectors um you're able to get through this you know somebody and and you know
[3:47:16.080 --> 3:47:21.360]  maybe let you know maybe be some sort of sort of an influence which is good but so many times you
[3:47:21.360 --> 3:47:24.560]  know people that are generally older me because this damian herst you know it comes to be the
[3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:29.840]  london and and you know that's you know you know real big hits looking cool with a lot of these
[3:47:29.840 --> 3:47:35.920]  people um in the art world but yeah well the point is the elites make death art dead baby
[3:47:35.920 --> 3:47:40.720]  maggot art it's what i call the genre a dead baby art is their favorite for decades they
[3:47:40.720 --> 3:47:46.160]  have a loving christian it it horrifies me and i know that sometimes that you know seeing these
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:52.640]  things that you know that that i you know am i in the right place god am i you know am i supposed
[3:47:52.640 --> 3:48:00.320]  to be here but you know just like you alex you know you uh if you're compassionate and working
[3:48:00.320 --> 3:48:04.960]  and striving to do good in the world you just have to have faith and you know trust just you
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:10.240]  know the lady was just saying how do you protect yourself and you know it you know the answer is
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:16.800]  you don't you don't exactly you move freely about the world and you and you just do what you can do
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:23.600]  well i mean that's really the answer is you turn loose you turn loose of of of even loving your
[3:48:23.600 --> 3:48:29.440]  life because you love life so much you realize you've got to put your life in danger to save others
[3:48:29.440 --> 3:48:33.680]  but but it sounds sappy but that's not even when you have an attitude to save others then you get
[3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:39.600]  saved you know i i mean that and if you're lucky you get to say be saved over and over again and
[3:48:39.600 --> 3:48:46.560]  be active and in doing your part well you don't grow till you realize you're part of the larger
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:51.920]  species and until you realize your willingness to sacrifice is the attitude that will save you
[3:48:51.920 --> 3:48:57.040]  and everybody else i appreciate your call i've got to jump jc ship in michigan go ahead ship
[3:48:57.040 --> 3:49:03.280]  yeah alex hey i'm a little confused about the gold and silver uh possession thing um
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:10.720]  i'm curious if the economy tanks completely right banks closed if you have physical dollars
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:16.640]  they wouldn't be worth anything anyway now this is gonna cause complete chaos literally okay people
[3:49:16.640 --> 3:49:21.520]  are just gonna the criminals are gonna think it's a free for all and now i live five miles from
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:28.240]  downtown detroit which is right with criminals especially the mayor now i'm thinking how is
[3:49:28.880 --> 3:49:35.040]  having physical gold and silver in my possession gonna benefit me at that well well you're not
[3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:40.240]  listening you're not listening it's better than having the bank just close and say you don't get
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:45.120]  your money at least you have something that's small and portable and where you can store a great
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:50.160]  amount of wealth in a small area and at some later date find someone who wants that or barter it
[3:49:50.160 --> 3:49:54.640]  or sell it so see there's no perfect equation there's no way to save yourself people always want
[3:49:54.640 --> 3:50:01.520]  solutions there is no perfect silver bullet the best thing is friends and family that love you
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:06.880]  and knowing how to be self-sufficient and having some property but then down the road and the
[3:50:06.880 --> 3:50:11.600]  dollars devalue they have a new currency you'll be able to cash gold in to get that new currency
[3:50:11.600 --> 3:50:16.320]  to pay your taxes with you understand yeah yeah that's always going to be worth something but
[3:50:16.320 --> 3:50:22.400]  my my concern is that i guess because of my location so close to a big city is that you
[3:50:22.400 --> 3:50:26.400]  know do i invest in this golden silver now or stay there i'll talk to you behind the scenes
[3:50:26.400 --> 3:50:35.680]  gotta go to info wars dot com folks okay listen uh everybody looks for a perfect solution for me
[3:50:35.680 --> 3:50:39.440]  and see i'm not like a politician it'll tell you i have a perfect solution i'll give you
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:44.560]  information and what i see happening historically in the info info i have and a lot of it's going
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:49.200]  oh look youtube says no more free speech you know i mean i mean i mean it's simply just
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:54.320]  reporting the facts it's not hard right the i have a world bank said they do this to our economy
[3:50:54.320 --> 3:51:01.200]  they are this is a planned occurrence uh so people then say well what do we do i mean do you have a
[3:51:01.200 --> 3:51:08.320]  better plan if you happen to have some wealth of storing it in a portable private way no actually
[3:51:08.320 --> 3:51:12.960]  um what i was asking i wasn't really asking you for a solution i was just sort of throwing it out
[3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:17.360]  there you know i mean it is the best solution it's just not foolproof there's nothing full right
[3:51:18.400 --> 3:51:19.840]  right that's true that's true
[3:51:22.560 --> 3:51:28.720]  only thing foolproof is that you're gonna die it's foolproof yeah that's true that's true i'm good
[3:51:28.720 --> 3:51:32.880]  thinking you know golden silver is not going to protect my family because i mean if the chaos
[3:51:32.880 --> 3:51:38.320]  happens i'm thinking i'd rather invest in a pistol i don't have a whole lot of money oh absolutely no
[3:51:38.320 --> 3:51:43.200]  no no no no no no no golden silver for people that have some wealth i got an average american
[3:51:43.200 --> 3:51:47.360]  doesn't i got a jump thanks for the call okay absolutely no if you don't have a lot of money
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:54.160]  uh a little bit of storable food uh handgun ammo and the willingness to use it to protect your
[3:51:54.160 --> 3:52:00.400]  family and having a talk with your family now see children start behaving and wives start listening
[3:52:00.400 --> 3:52:04.320]  and husbands start listening when the stuff gets serious they find out what family is all about
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:09.840]  and all this you watch tv the soul sucking shows with yachts and champagne and everybody feeling
[3:52:09.840 --> 3:52:14.240]  envious to make you feel inadequate and to make you feel pathetic and to make you hate your husband
[3:52:14.240 --> 3:52:18.480]  and wife and to make you not appreciate what you've got these wonderful children wonderful
[3:52:18.480 --> 3:52:24.160]  outs the sky the wonderful food all the good stuff we've had you see they make you not appreciate
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:30.320]  that and they take it all away from you they give you these false idols of what you've got to have
[3:52:30.320 --> 3:52:35.360]  let's go ahead and talk to david in virginia go ahead david i really appreciate you taking
[3:52:35.360 --> 3:52:40.240]  my call i've enjoyed your show for a long time never called before um i'm a 32 year old man
[3:52:40.240 --> 3:52:44.880]  who uh decided i got married this summer i left my job and decided to go back to college and
[3:52:44.880 --> 3:52:49.680]  finished my degree and i decided to go back and get a degree in sustainable development
[3:52:50.480 --> 3:52:54.000]  and very quickly in my studies i realized that there's really
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:58.560]  sort of two two schools of thought within sustainability there is the yeah they have
[3:52:58.560 --> 3:53:03.600]  the they have the outside sustainability people that mean to do well but that never was implemented
[3:53:03.600 --> 3:53:08.560]  and then they have the eugenicist absolutely as a matter of fact i was doing i'm doing research
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:13.760]  on a paper right now that i'm writing for a class and i'm making the argument that sustainability
[3:53:13.760 --> 3:53:20.320]  cannot happen without democratic ideology without um private property protections
[3:53:20.880 --> 3:53:25.120]  and civil liberties and people because that actually brings true sustainability and true
[3:53:25.120 --> 3:53:30.320]  stewardship by sustainability they just mean taxing your breathing and then cross bc genetically
[3:53:30.320 --> 3:53:34.480]  engineering and dumping toxic waste all the real environmental degradation intensifies
[3:53:35.040 --> 3:53:40.480]  but then humans are made evil that's according to the cfr richard and haas you know i i sometimes
[3:53:40.480 --> 3:53:42.880]  hold on we're gonna go back live right now we're gonna go back live here we go
[3:53:42.880 --> 3:53:53.200]  i went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns the ring of fire the
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:59.840]  ring of fire and it burns oh the taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet i'm only gonna
[3:53:59.840 --> 3:54:04.640]  do eight minutes overdrive on the info wars dot com streams because what i covered after that was
[3:54:04.640 --> 3:54:09.280]  just too important about the what looks like a murderer buried jennings nine eleven uh whistle
[3:54:09.280 --> 3:54:13.120]  blower about bombs in the buildings deputy head of emergency management there in new york over
[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:21.280]  his department uh the economy the gas all the information but i also want to get into youtube's
[3:54:21.280 --> 3:54:26.560]  version of homegrown terrorism prevention act so um but but this is so big here i should have
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:31.280]  started the show with this actually this is just so massive it's up on info wars dot com and it's
[3:54:31.280 --> 3:54:38.400]  actually happening i can't even believe this uh but uh the phone systems just dump out uh
[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:42.480]  okay david virginia finish up you were saying you're taking you got a degree in sustainable
[3:54:43.360 --> 3:54:47.520]  development and you see where you're in the green sustainable development and i'm i'm taking the
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:52.160]  slant that sustainability can't happen without democracy and without people feeling empowered
[3:54:52.160 --> 3:54:56.960]  and and really the the the really bright minds i find the sustainability field are those people
[3:54:56.960 --> 3:55:02.080]  who realize that power needs to be decentralized economies need to be decentralized distribution
[3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:07.280]  systems food production all those things need to be decentralized not only because you know
[3:55:07.280 --> 3:55:12.640]  even if you believe in global warming to some extent the point is oil is toxic
[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:20.480]  in its refining with the chemicals and byproducts and it's old and it's wasteful and so that's why
[3:55:20.480 --> 3:55:25.520]  we should get away from it absolutely and one of the things that i wanted to touch on is as i
[3:55:25.520 --> 3:55:29.360]  started digging into some of these organizations that are as a matter of fact there's a website
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:34.640]  called sustainability dot com and if you wanted a lesson on the new world order go to this website
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:38.720]  and just see who supports these people and this was in just some cursory examination i was doing
[3:55:38.720 --> 3:55:44.320]  i find three organizations all of which have the exact same people on their boards of trustees
[3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:48.160]  one of these organizations you know what let's do this fax me some proof of your degree and that
[3:55:48.160 --> 3:55:53.280]  i believe you you ought to be a 30 minute guest with us someday get his number right now uh bob

[3:56:14.720 --> 3:56:19.600]  i i got a few things i got a plug here right at the end of the show and then there's eight minutes
[3:56:20.240 --> 3:56:24.000]  of overdrive where i'm going to cover the biggest news story of the day that i never got to
[3:56:25.040 --> 3:56:27.600]  but i would do more overdrive but
[3:56:27.600 --> 3:56:34.480]  but that's really a shadow of the show you know a few maybe 10 000 internet listeners

[3:58:47.440 --> 3:58:53.440]  i want to thank all of you at youtube and daily motion all the other great sites and now because
[3:58:53.440 --> 3:58:59.600]  youtube and google are censuring openly in policy don't desert them because that's still a big viral
[3:58:59.600 --> 3:59:08.480]  spread area to get into the enemy matrix any program but doubles you know put it up on blip tv or
[3:59:08.480 --> 3:59:15.360]  daily motion or lively doppelganger attack pattern when the enemy tries to move with censorship you
[3:59:15.360 --> 3:59:24.000]  intensify the attack on their operation i mean we are really hurting them bad right now now this
[3:59:24.000 --> 3:59:30.160]  story this story needs to be turned into a youtube clip so i'm requesting this right now huge
[3:59:30.160 --> 3:59:34.480]  development we know the internet too they want to tax and regulate shut down the old hubs and
[3:59:34.480 --> 3:59:38.880]  foreshadow the new ones we know in france and germany and europe they're banning a lot of free
[3:59:38.880 --> 3:59:42.640]  speech on the internet setting up internet commissions and making people register websites
[3:59:42.640 --> 3:59:48.320]  and they use firewalls at google and yahoo run in china and other areas to restrict free speech
[3:59:48.320 --> 3:59:57.760]  and censor the web so our nsa founded a DARPA founded internet grid run by google and yahoo
[3:59:57.760 --> 4:00:00.800]  and others that control the infrastructure not even the infrastructure of the software
[4:00:02.800 --> 4:00:09.040]  they're killing the web but a few months ago this man Lieberman who openly calls for fascism in
[4:00:09.040 --> 4:00:14.720]  the united states and it's basically a foreign agent not even really an american says that he
[4:00:14.720 --> 4:00:18.720]  wanted youtube and google anything that criticized the government anything that criticized the
[4:00:18.720 --> 4:00:23.040]  military anything that made the military look bad is helping terrorist troops massering
[4:00:23.600 --> 4:00:27.200]  children killing animals and i noticed that
[4:00:31.040 --> 4:00:32.560]  even after youtube
[4:00:35.280 --> 4:00:38.560]  had pulled the videos over and over again the marines throwing the puppy off which
[4:00:38.560 --> 4:00:43.200]  was later been about the marines be real abc fox were playing it saying it's horrible
[4:00:43.200 --> 4:00:48.960]  but youtube wouldn't allow you to upload that and they would erase it and videos of troops for fun
[4:00:48.960 --> 4:00:56.240]  shooting families off the road they take those down and now they tell you in the rules area of
[4:00:56.240 --> 4:01:04.080]  youtube that that is terrorism now they also mention hr 1955 entitled violent radicalization
[4:01:04.080 --> 4:01:09.120]  and homegrown terrorism prevention and in that it's past the house and they had hearings
[4:01:09.120 --> 4:01:14.720]  last year and earlier this year where they showed on c span during the hearings architects and
[4:01:14.720 --> 4:01:18.880]  engineers for 911 truth which have gotten peer review that the buildings were blown up basically
[4:01:18.880 --> 4:01:23.760]  you bet that threatens the people that blew them up the real terrorist and they show them with al-qaeda
[4:01:23.760 --> 4:01:29.520]  videos training videos that this is al-qaeda needs to be banned so i mean i mean it's so over the top
[4:01:30.880 --> 4:01:35.040]  yeah 911 truth is dead the government keeps saying that it's bigger than ever they're scared to death
[4:01:35.040 --> 4:01:39.760]  of it folks their operatives are out there telling us to stand down youtube's version of homegrown
[4:01:39.760 --> 4:01:46.720]  terrorism prevention act youtube has implemented its very own version of hr 1955 entitled the violent
[4:01:46.720 --> 4:01:55.840]  radicalization homegrown terrorism prevention act or 1955 which is in the senate and is not law as of
[4:01:55.840 --> 4:02:01.040]  this writing it's past the house of the senate but for the millions of people who post on youtube
[4:02:01.040 --> 4:02:07.920]  however it may as well be law you may recall senator joseph Lieberman earlier this year
[4:02:08.480 --> 4:02:14.720]  barking orders from on high down at google the owner of youtube demanding the popular
[4:02:14.720 --> 4:02:20.320]  video site block content depicting assassinations death of us soldiers as well as weapons training
[4:02:20.320 --> 4:02:24.880]  and speeches that encourage violence and could be used as a tool to create homegrown terrorist
[4:02:25.600 --> 4:02:30.720]  you show a mainline ap clip of a tank getting blown up they'll suspend your account
[4:02:30.720 --> 4:02:36.080]  or you're a marine and come back and show your own video they ban it so it's it's horrible as a d
[4:02:37.440 --> 4:02:42.640]  chismera writes for efflux media at the time youtube called foul and said we respect and
[4:02:42.640 --> 4:02:46.800]  understand Lieberman's views youtube encourages free speech and defends everybody's right to
[4:02:46.800 --> 4:02:52.000]  expect unpopular points of view so it's okay to show simulated murder of soldiers all day and
[4:02:52.000 --> 4:02:56.800]  of women women and children in these games or the rape of prostitutes are ultimate fighting for that
[4:02:56.800 --> 4:03:00.880]  matter but and i'm not calling to restrict them by the way my point is now they want to restrict
[4:03:00.880 --> 4:03:05.840]  our right because we're destroying the mainstream media the newspapers are falling apart mainstream
[4:03:05.840 --> 4:03:12.480]  media is imploding because they've been caught lying so much now Lieberman now has released a
[4:03:12.480 --> 4:03:16.320]  press release saying he appreciates youtube he wants google to do more to ban free speech
[4:03:17.040 --> 4:03:22.240]  four short months later after media attention is long since shifted elsewhere youtube and google
[4:03:22.240 --> 4:03:27.760]  have sent the first amendment to the recycle bin youtube has posted a warning in its community
[4:03:27.760 --> 4:03:32.240]  guidelines meant to stop such videos for being uploaded on youtube a move that apparently pleased
[4:03:32.240 --> 4:03:36.640]  the neocon Lieberman at least someone senator Lieberman hailed youtube's decision to strengthen
[4:03:36.640 --> 4:03:42.080]  its standards however he also continued to urge google who owns youtube to remove all videos produced
[4:03:42.080 --> 4:03:47.280]  by foreign terrorist organizations you mean those uploaded by the cia and they've been caught doing
[4:03:47.280 --> 4:03:52.800]  it fake ones yeah go check it out they've been caught on record not just those that violate
[4:03:52.800 --> 4:04:01.360]  community guidelines explains so if you read the bill for yourself it says anything basically
[4:04:01.360 --> 4:04:08.720]  criticizing the government hr 1955 and they mentioned architects and engineers from 911 truth
[4:04:08.720 --> 4:04:12.880]  now 400 and something architects engineers and physicists i mean that that scares them and
[4:04:12.880 --> 4:04:20.800]  paired reviewed journals now i mean big journals are peer reviewing and saying yeah bombs uh it goes
[4:04:20.800 --> 4:04:24.800]  on even so Lieberman insisted youtube represents a tool for islamist terror organizations recruit
[4:04:24.800 --> 4:04:29.520]  and train followers that said it's time to pull out all this info perspective first and foremost
[4:04:29.520 --> 4:04:34.080]  the validity of al-qaeda and other supposed terrorist videos that inevitably end up on youtube
[4:04:34.080 --> 4:04:41.040]  must be challenged and major studies have been done at the intel center run by former black ops
[4:04:41.040 --> 4:04:46.400]  commanders from psychological warfare under rumsfeld in the pentagon and cia run intel center
[4:04:46.400 --> 4:04:52.160]  they upload their intel center logos in the same video layer as the al-qaeda scroll i mean come on
[4:04:52.160 --> 4:05:00.560]  folks it's white guys adl heads sons and grandsons are white al-qaeda saying i'm gonna kill you
[4:05:01.200 --> 4:05:05.840]  they use computer generated bin laden's that have been exposed to be fakes that are video game
[4:05:05.840 --> 4:05:13.360]  quality i mean this is this it's incredible and it goes on in other words Lieberman and google
[4:05:13.360 --> 4:05:16.960]  should have banned the cia and massage from posting fake videos and a number of videos
[4:05:17.520 --> 4:05:26.400]  are so obviously fake as to be ridiculous and the article goes on understand folks america
[4:05:26.400 --> 4:05:32.880]  is america the bill of rights the constitution because we do have a first amendment and they
