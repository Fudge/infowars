[00:00.000 --> 00:18.360]  Coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart of Texas it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.040]  Ladies and gentlemen the world is in the middle of an epic struggle that is heated up to white
[00:48.040 --> 00:54.520]  haunt levels between individual citizens and nation states and against a global government
[00:54.520 --> 01:04.720]  establishing a worldwide tyranny that it calls a technocracy they admit they are authoritarian and
[01:04.720 --> 01:11.920]  the whole Davos meeting is kicking off as we speak George Soros says the EU is on the verge
[01:11.920 --> 01:21.320]  of breakdown oh my gosh I've been telling people that for at least six years saying it would happen
[01:21.320 --> 01:28.400]  in the next decade and our guests have been saying it for at least six years including
[01:28.400 --> 01:40.200]  former high-level directors of operations inside the CIA like Steve Picenic has told you oh but
[01:40.200 --> 01:49.280]  so you get the news of six years from now today oh but George Soros is telling me now it's on
[01:49.280 --> 01:55.440]  info wars dot com and again it's not bragging they're trying to shut us down they're saying
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.960]  we're fake news everywhere I don't like having to sit here and say oh look we told you this six
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.880]  years ago oh look we told you this 10 years ago oh look we told you this 15 years ago oh look oh look
[02:05.880 --> 02:13.880]  oh look oh look oh look oh look oh look oh look but we're under attack because we're on target I
[02:13.880 --> 02:18.200]  know you know more than I do about all this stuff that's why you've got to get out there to speak
[02:18.200 --> 02:26.840]  out because the war just kicked in to high gear they're launching their counter-offensives things
[02:26.840 --> 02:33.640]  are getting crazy by the way Trump did deliver yesterday he did have his fake news awards but
[02:33.640 --> 02:40.640]  he didn't do it in a video format he did it by putting out a press release I know the argument is
[02:40.640 --> 02:43.800]  your presidential sir you can't stupid this level that's what they're trying to keep him from
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.520]  fireside chats no Roosevelt would go on and say what people were saying about him you know that
[02:48.520 --> 02:55.400]  was true or not true so this is what the president needs to do the idea that it's authoritarian
[02:55.400 --> 03:03.280]  the idea that it is evil for the president to punch back when they lie about him is
[03:03.280 --> 03:10.800]  authoritarian is stylistic like Jeff flake has been out spouting and putting out drudge report
[03:10.800 --> 03:20.680]  dot com has linked to info wars dot com with the results of the 2017 fake news awards because we
[03:20.680 --> 03:25.840]  had the most extensive thanks the great work of a Don Salazar Kit Daniels and the rest of the
[03:25.840 --> 03:31.720]  amazing crew we're going to also add to that our own boil down of the award shows and the
[03:31.720 --> 03:39.360]  videographic you just saw us rolling that shows the awards in order so when we come back we're
[03:39.360 --> 03:46.080]  going to do that we're going to go through the awards here and then I said that we would announce
[03:46.080 --> 03:51.000]  the winners of our people's choice award those of you that nominated the person that ended up
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.200]  matching up basically with the president it's $2,000 the person that matched up the second one
[03:57.200 --> 04:01.720]  gets a thousand and then a set of steak knives and folks are going to get mad because we took
[04:01.720 --> 04:05.840]  like a hundred calls or more a lot of people said the same thing so we're just picking who was the
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.760]  most cogent most focused and got it out there you were all great amazing calls we didn't get it
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.680]  announced last night we're still waiting until like you know seven o'clock or whatever for the
[04:14.680 --> 04:21.000]  president to put out the fake news awards he's got a lot on his plate you can tell production wise
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.560]  they didn't have time to do TV so they put out the press release that we've added to and added
[04:26.560 --> 04:33.360]  some video and other graphs and things to on info wars dot com news wars dot com and drudge
[04:33.360 --> 04:38.680]  report dot com has it right there easy to find on the left-hand side I'm going to retweet though
[04:38.680 --> 04:46.360]  the winner of the 2017 fake news awards from the president we're going to put that out again on
[04:46.360 --> 04:51.080]  Twitter right now at real Alex Jones to make it easy for you to find stay with us we're going to
[04:51.080 --> 04:56.640]  go through these announcements coming up and so much more there's been well just wait till I
[04:56.640 --> 05:03.560]  get back to the big news we come back introducing cell force by info wars life cell force focuses
[05:03.560 --> 05:09.280]  on mitochondria efficiency and protection mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy
[05:09.280 --> 05:15.360]  they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.640]  supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria
[05:20.640 --> 05:27.200]  don't run at 100% efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen species top scientists
[05:27.200 --> 05:32.440]  agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive
[05:32.440 --> 05:38.680]  oxygen species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on
[05:38.680 --> 05:43.960]  the market the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive
[05:43.960 --> 05:51.280]  oxygen species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force from info wars
[05:51.280 --> 06:07.920]  life head to info wars life dot com or call 1-888-253-3139 crashing through the lies and
[06:07.920 --> 06:14.760]  disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:22.760 --> 06:31.360]  ladies and gentlemen last night I saw reports on zero hedge dot com and on rudge report dot
[06:31.360 --> 06:37.200]  com reporting that the FBI is investigating the clinton foundation and millions that was
[06:37.200 --> 06:45.240]  improperly handled out of just the australian sector billions and billions was given so I
[06:45.240 --> 06:52.400]  ferreted in to the information that had been released by the FBI and it just hit me this
[06:52.400 --> 06:57.520]  morning so we have an article that dr. Jerome course he's written for info wars dot com we
[06:57.520 --> 07:03.760]  have a tendency here in the real media to kind of downplay big things but when they're big you
[07:03.760 --> 07:11.400]  need to play them up because they're big we saw three weeks ago the criminal investigation
[07:11.400 --> 07:18.320]  reopened under a new group not a bunch of clinton appointees and clinton sick offense and minions
[07:18.320 --> 07:29.760]  and toadies and butt boys okay so that's a new criminal investigation got almost no coverage
[07:29.760 --> 07:36.880]  including here we mentioned it talked about it boom moved on then another criminal investigation
[07:36.880 --> 07:42.080]  got announced a couple weeks ago into uranium one new indictments of the very people connected to
[07:42.080 --> 07:46.880]  the clintons and to the deal they're now following down the FBI original investigation and the
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.080]  informants and the people did a great job at the bureau who were stopped by Mueller and then
[07:52.080 --> 07:57.200]  comey subsequently that's all on record so that's a second criminal investigation that's been
[07:57.200 --> 08:03.120]  opened new criminal investigation because the last two were spiked and then the other big one
[08:04.160 --> 08:11.280]  they reopened the criminal investigation into the secret server the foundation
[08:12.960 --> 08:19.440]  the which is the money laundering the secret service that's the dropbox the secret server in
[08:19.440 --> 08:27.440]  her bathroom the dropbox the database her her parallel government she was co-president with
[08:27.440 --> 08:34.240]  obama the democrats admit that so you've got the secret server in the bathroom you've got the
[08:34.240 --> 08:40.240]  money laundering in the foundation paper play and then you've got uranium one that's the trifecta
[08:40.240 --> 08:50.560]  three criminal investigations of hillary rottem clinton and william jefferson clinton but he's
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.760]  only on the hook so far for the foundation she's in there for uranium one and the other
[08:57.760 --> 09:04.320]  and he was involved in uranium one as well so ladies and gentlemen the story is on info wars
[09:04.320 --> 09:11.520]  dot com it is extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely important and i hope that
[09:11.520 --> 09:20.000]  everybody gets it out now again we might even change this headline because it gets into criminal
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.760]  investigation opened into the clinton's paper play and that's basically what all three of these
[09:25.760 --> 09:37.040]  get into and they all intersect together but the real headline here is
[09:39.520 --> 09:46.000]  three new criminal investigations have been opened into the clinton's criminal activity
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.640]  and their crime syndicate that's the takeaway that's the news hiding in plain view that i guess
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.080]  mainstream media hadn't made a big deal about it so even info wars doesn't because a lot of times
[09:58.080 --> 10:04.000]  we kind of ourselves kind of toadie along behind them you know whatever whatever their big story is
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.760]  we we kind of give our two cents on it or punditry that's not that's not what made info wars great
[10:10.400 --> 10:14.560]  that's not what made us change the world it's not what made you change the world it's going out
[10:14.560 --> 10:20.240]  and doing original reporting or a government document it's released by the pentagon admitting
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.640]  obama's plans to put americans in femacamps well a lot of folks didn't cover it because it sounded
[10:24.640 --> 10:29.440]  crazy but it was real we broke it they had to admit it was real but no one wanted to touch
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.640]  it because it sounded so crazy well if what the enemy's doing is crazy if what the globalist
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.280]  is doing is crazy then we have to report it whether or not the media attacks us because
[10:39.280 --> 10:45.680]  it's our job when we learn in 2006 that samsung and google and all these platforms were using
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.760]  hidden cameras and microphones uh both hidden and in plain view to watch and listen to you
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.560]  they were selling the data so what have we got attacked for being crazy to push that out there
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.280]  first now it's ubiquitous they admitted and they were doing it back then just like we told you
[11:01.280 --> 11:07.920]  because we had their internal engineering documents and then later their own internal but not secret
[11:07.920 --> 11:17.200]  investor shareholder reports shareholders we're doing quite good in 2006 we're patented and
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.720]  we're rolling out system-wide with people that have google enabled on their dashboards and we're
[11:22.720 --> 11:30.000]  watching and listening to them and selling the data the third parties plain black and white
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.560]  right they didn't deny it so i'm going to explain to the washington times it has an
[11:38.560 --> 11:41.520]  article out almost every two days attacking yours truly and i think they do a lot of good
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.880]  work but they got some people embedded in there that are bad news going a lot of establishment
[11:46.880 --> 11:52.800]  republicans and people and you know don't want to be on the fringe uh like info wars or bright
[11:52.800 --> 11:58.000]  barter whatever and but bright barts trying to be more establishment we don't want to be
[11:58.000 --> 12:05.040]  establishment that means we repeat old news watered down off teleprompters that's not what
[12:05.040 --> 12:16.240]  we do here you don't change the world chasing somebody else's story you change the world like
[12:16.240 --> 12:23.120]  matt drudge did get any intel mainstream media had it they didn't want to run with it he put it out
[12:23.120 --> 12:29.680]  so they were forced to report it and that's really what info wars main job is you don't think the
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.960]  secret service hadn't gone to the wall street journal it hadn't gone to others and said hillary's
[12:34.960 --> 12:40.160]  having convulsions every 45 minutes and has a black ambulance they all went to the media none of them
[12:40.160 --> 12:46.640]  would touch it so they came to us and said just follow her around she's got a medical tent she's
[12:46.640 --> 12:51.440]  falling down every 45 minutes we don't know what it is we're not giving you medical information
[12:51.440 --> 12:58.560]  but we don't know i know through our sources his brain tumor was removed back in 2013 took
[12:58.560 --> 13:08.720]  her over a year to recover and she's got serious brain tumors okay but again we went out we caught
[13:08.720 --> 13:13.280]  her millie weaver and gabin wintz caught her collapsing in a tent but didn't get it on video
[13:13.280 --> 13:18.960]  she was inside the tent for an hour emergency stretchers going in but hey a week later on
[13:18.960 --> 13:25.440]  september 11th she fell like a ton of bricks symbolically because they helped protect and
[13:25.440 --> 13:30.720]  shield al-qaeda and a lot more and the media cut it off when she fell down and said she only stumbled
[13:30.720 --> 13:37.280]  and that we lied but it didn't matter you could go see it for yourself as well so it's our job
[13:37.280 --> 13:41.680]  really to keep clips like this in the future where they try to remove them off the web and say no
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.560]  here it is and re-upload it that's your job it's my job it's our job to go no you said obama care
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.160]  would be free here's where you said it or you said the doctor you can keep it it's our job at every
[13:52.160 --> 13:58.400]  level to just document reality put it out there many times without even editorializing on it
[13:58.400 --> 14:05.440]  so that reality can stand there in the annals we are here to keep libraries of information we are
[14:05.440 --> 14:10.080]  here to keep it on hard drives we are here because they want the worldwide web to be nothing but a
[14:10.080 --> 14:18.240]  giant grid they want the worldwide web to be nothing but a huge cloud where they all have your
[14:18.240 --> 14:26.560]  data so they can go in and erase whatever they want in mass google can hit one button and in a
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.840]  matter of minutes every alex jones video with my voice print on the internet would be removed or
[14:31.840 --> 14:37.200]  they can even just block out what i've said in a matter of minutes they can hit one button and
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.480]  everything i've ever done on google's erased everything that's the control they've got and
[14:42.480 --> 14:47.600]  they're now launching the algorithms and they can do it to me they can do it to you so we're in a real
[14:47.600 --> 14:54.800]  war here they're trying to make us obsolete they're trying to make us totally domesticated and that's
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.640]  why knowing how to farm and knowing how to garden and knowing how to machine shop and knowing how to
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.800]  gunsmith and knowing how to skin a buck and run a trot line and knowing how to be a good person and
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.720]  knowing how to work hard and knowing how to communicate and knowing how to have community
[15:06.720 --> 15:14.160]  that's the secret is the reassurgence of a world based on building a good future for humanity
[15:14.160 --> 15:18.240]  not one where the globalists have decided we're a fungus that has to be removed
[15:18.240 --> 15:23.440]  so they can have more parkland for themselves because that decision's been made and he on musk
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.640]  and many others are now warning you exactly as i told you and they're now being attacked
[15:28.640 --> 15:35.120]  because if you aren't anti-human and you're just a sane person who doesn't want to kill everybody
[15:35.120 --> 15:42.560]  you're the bad guys so when we come back trump did announce the awards we've got him from his

[20:19.920 --> 20:24.320]  when suddenly i realized there must be some mistake
[20:24.320 --> 20:31.360]  and they know half the things i've done they'll never let me in
[20:33.360 --> 20:38.000]  and then somewhere from the other side i heard these words again
[20:39.840 --> 20:45.040]  and they said let me tell you a secret about a father's love
[20:45.920 --> 20:52.400]  a secret that my daddy said was just between us we're back live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting

[21:12.480 --> 21:21.920]  you can go on for a long time go on for a long time but sooner or later gonna cut you down
[21:23.840 --> 21:33.440]  and so trump with a full plate did deliver the 2017 fake news awards that he picked
[21:34.080 --> 21:37.520]  and he put out a press release that drudgereport.com
[21:37.520 --> 21:42.960]  uh decided to link to our posting of it because it has some graphics and videos and things that
[21:42.960 --> 21:49.760]  are added so right now we're going to go over the president's uh video graphic presentation it wasn't
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.520]  the president in person doing it but they put together uh some nice awards that for tv viewers
[21:55.520 --> 22:02.480]  i'll be able to see radio listeners i will now describe those trump announces 2017 fake news
[22:02.480 --> 22:09.600]  award winners and a lot of folks would start you know at number 10 or number 11 and and
[22:09.600 --> 22:16.800]  count down we're not doing that we're just going to take you right to uh the kingpin the new york
[22:16.800 --> 22:21.760]  times paul chugman planned on the day of president trump's historic landslide victory that the economy
[22:21.760 --> 22:29.440]  would never recover and he said 3.0 growth was impossible it's now on its way to 3.3 it's at
[22:29.440 --> 22:37.840]  3.3 check to hit 7 to 10 within one year uh so absolute total uh and complete turnaround
[22:38.640 --> 22:47.360]  number one paul chugman saying that you would never bring the economy back and you know i think
[22:47.360 --> 22:53.360]  i'm the only person yesterday during that four-hour transmission than i did that said that the fake
[22:53.360 --> 22:57.680]  news saying that he'd never bring the economy back uh and that uh he'd never get over a three
[22:57.680 --> 23:02.160]  percent growth rate who would have thought see trump cares most about delivering to you and that
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.240]  means putting money in your pocket and and have good jobs in a good future because you got to
[23:06.240 --> 23:11.120]  have a job to feel good and to not just sit there on welfare and be a ruined person you look at the
[23:11.120 --> 23:15.520]  animals that get domesticated you're not in parks you feed them they're obese they're mentally ill
[23:15.520 --> 23:20.880]  they're hateful they're absolutely you know out of control whether it's monkeys or squirrels well
[23:20.880 --> 23:28.000]  look what it does to people so another curveball from the trumpster in the trump dimension uh where
[23:28.960 --> 23:35.920]  he goes with the economy about you betting you'd fail no we had one caller that said trump bet on
[23:35.920 --> 23:41.440]  america they said we'd failed but trump bet on america and we had brought the economy back
[23:41.440 --> 23:47.680]  we had one caller and what was his name or her name it was a man so we're so we're choosing
[23:47.680 --> 23:51.680]  who's winning now from the people's choice that lines up with trumps i think that's the best way
[23:51.680 --> 24:02.480]  to judge it so paul krugman says markets will never recover from trump dow hits record at high
[24:02.480 --> 24:10.560]  26 000 i think right there that is absolutely on target not just the russia gate because that's all
[24:10.560 --> 24:18.960]  fake about trump not not other things but the economy stupid wow that's smart so uh number two abc
[24:18.960 --> 24:24.720]  news brian ross chokes now i thought this would be number one or number two and since markets in a
[24:24.720 --> 24:31.840]  downward spiral with false report abc demotes brian ross after he lied and said that basically

[25:04.960 --> 25:11.200]  michael flinn promised full cooperation to the muller team and is prepared to testify that as a
[25:11.200 --> 25:17.040]  candidate donald trump directed him to make contact with the russians yay he's a trader we can screw up
[25:17.040 --> 25:23.520]  the economy and stop the recovery yay we're gonna have the country over with a big lie none of it's
[25:23.520 --> 25:30.320]  true turn those c-hacks off thank you so continuing um cnn falsely reported the candidate donald trump
[25:30.320 --> 25:35.920]  and his son donald j trump had access to hack documents from wikileaks totally fake they were
[25:35.920 --> 25:40.640]  months old documents and i was the first by the way because i just have a memory i'm not bragging
[25:40.640 --> 25:45.840]  ago right when that all broke we were on the air when that broke and i was like wait a minute
[25:47.760 --> 25:52.160]  that's not true those documents were out they were being doled out for months before but those
[25:52.160 --> 25:59.520]  particular ones almost three weeks before so again um wikileaks provided the president's son
[25:59.520 --> 26:08.080]  the secret code key to release wikileaks bs baloney bravo seara and like our listeners were saying
[26:09.120 --> 26:14.080]  cnn with all of its crap hole comments i did coin it i'm glad handy's gone whether they
[26:14.080 --> 26:23.120]  may not even know we coined it here but i said you know cnn is the s bleep whole network and i
[26:23.120 --> 26:30.560]  said and they run the chicken bleep dimension the chicken sh dash t and i said see they're allowed
[26:30.560 --> 26:35.600]  to cuss but we're not because the regulators won't touch them they're god you see i don't even want
[26:35.600 --> 26:41.200]  to cuss but the fact is we should be able to if they can't it's not fair but they are now known as the
[26:42.480 --> 26:49.520]  sh dash t network that's a really good name for them and that's what comes out of the mouth of
[26:49.520 --> 26:57.280]  all of them when they get on the show they go i'm a proud holder i'm a proud holder and that's
[26:57.280 --> 27:05.520]  that's that's phil mud's new name is phil holer mud and i guess that's why his last name's mud
[27:06.160 --> 27:12.400]  who would have known it i guess it translates into piled steaming you know what excuse me that's
[27:12.400 --> 27:17.520]  i mean they're talking about her seeing in falsely reported can i eat donald trump and his son
[27:17.520 --> 27:24.000]  junior had uh access to hack documents from what he looks more bbbbbb boulder dash
[27:25.520 --> 27:30.240]  number five we'll get to that in a minute number four time falsely reported that president trump
[27:30.240 --> 27:37.360]  removed a bust of martin luther king jr from the oval office so that was a good one and they were
[27:37.360 --> 27:44.880]  in the room with it there was even video of it in the room and again that's the same cnn people
[27:44.880 --> 27:49.440]  that said that trump didn't really visit scolese remember that number five washington
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.000]  post falsely reported the president's massive sold-out rally in pennsylvania florida was empty
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  dishonest reporter showed pictures of empty arena hours before crowds started pouring in
[27:58.000 --> 28:05.600]  they did that on the inauguration day too new york times guilty of large screw up on climate
[28:05.600 --> 28:16.880]  change story and it just goes on and on and on we're going to uh i think they skipped a page on
[28:16.880 --> 28:24.480]  this murphy's law but ha there's no need to fear i have a backup right here so let's move on to
[28:24.480 --> 28:33.200]  number six now here ladies and gentlemen number five washington post falsely reported that president's

[33:38.560 --> 33:43.120]  michael schneider feel like i know this guy for 20 years uh he's been on so many times
[33:43.120 --> 33:49.840]  via sky running for congress with all the all sorts of political uh systems and uh education
[33:49.840 --> 33:53.600]  of the economic collapse blog dot com michael schneider for congress dot com we're gonna talk
[33:53.600 --> 34:01.760]  about 2018 really if you think 2016 was key 2017 was amazing 2018 is to infinity and beyond this is
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.360]  sudden death overtime and not in a football game of the future of the republic and the world there
[34:07.360 --> 34:13.440]  is not a more critical year than 2018 not just in my analysis the countless others will talk about
[34:13.440 --> 34:17.920]  that with michael schneider here in just a moment and get his take on it but first finishing up if
[34:17.920 --> 34:23.680]  you just tuned in i went a little bit over and didn't finish up going over the president's choice
[34:24.240 --> 34:32.560]  of fake news awards the worst fake news in 2017 and he did release a press release yesterday the
[34:32.560 --> 34:38.000]  media had said that he wasn't that he was choking that there was no fake news so how could he possibly
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.680]  have that and of course he chose michael so i'm gonna kind of go back through these and hit the
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.480]  last few paul krogman as the economist of the newt time saying you'll never get above three percent
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.280]  you'll never get the three percent you'll never get the tax cuts you'll never get any of it america's
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.920]  done we're going into a depression and all the other big pundits set it and now the stock markets
[34:55.920 --> 35:02.080]  at 26 000 uh we're at 3.3 growth rate most economists say we're gonna hit seven in the next year or so
[35:02.080 --> 35:08.720]  if this continues uh the globalists are in total panic mode and i'm glad trump didn't choose fake
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.280]  russia gave even though all the callers and even i thought that's where he'd go a few callers got it
[35:13.280 --> 35:18.560]  right they said look we turn the economy around trump did that he was the leader in that and so
[35:18.560 --> 35:24.240]  that's number one and boy doesn't that rub it uh in paul krogman's face absolutely alex and you
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.800]  know what before trump came in we had not had a year of three percent growth since middle of the
[35:28.800 --> 35:33.680]  bush administration you know barack obama he was the only president in us history never to have a
[35:33.680 --> 35:38.880]  single year of three percent growth and he had two terms to try to get it done and so president
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.680]  trump is turning things around we got tax reform through lowered the corporate tax rate on par with
[35:43.680 --> 35:47.440]  the rest of the world which was so key and just today i picked up a newspaper on my way up from the
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.320]  hotel and apple apple's bringing the production they're bringing facilities back to the united
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.800]  states for they're going to be paying some taxes and that's what that's because of trump if hillary
[35:56.800 --> 36:01.840]  had gotten in and no telling what would have happened and admittedly trump is reportedly called
[36:01.840 --> 36:07.840]  cook more than 20 times and said man be nice to america bring some stuff back dude why are you
[36:07.840 --> 36:13.200]  out to get the country you got hundreds of factories in china bring something here bro yeah and we
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.400]  need to start bringing manufacturing back to china because since 2001 more than 70 000 manufacturing
[36:18.400 --> 36:22.800]  facilities have left this country millions of good paying jobs now trump is turning it around
[36:22.800 --> 36:28.240]  he's starting to bring manufacturing back uh companies like apple are coming back so trump
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.800]  is starting to turn it around but the mainstream media won't get off his back also we have the
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.920]  lowest black unemployment ever recorded since the bureau labor statistics was shut up what more than
[36:37.920 --> 36:44.080]  60 years ago yeah and yet the whole african-american community is being trained to hate trump but trump
[36:44.080 --> 36:50.160]  is bringing prosperity to everyone including the african-american community and so you know we
[36:50.160 --> 36:54.720]  trump knows what he's doing and so we need to get behind him we need to support we need to be
[36:54.720 --> 36:59.280]  proud of this president absolutely so again that was number one just going back through some of these
[36:59.280 --> 37:03.680]  abc news brian ross saying oh flint admits he's a russian you know he met with them they were in
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.640]  the campaign trump's a liar they're all they're all going to prison we've got that brian ross abc
[37:08.640 --> 37:13.920]  cnn falsely says that wiki leaks uh you know gave them the secret code and that trump released the
[37:13.920 --> 37:19.760]  wiki leaks i mean again this was most this was released months before a lot of it weeks before
[37:19.760 --> 37:24.800]  everyone was given the key the key was put out online i mean if you want to get down to brass tax
[37:24.800 --> 37:30.160]  paul watson was usually there in at first uh and the key was public and and ferreting it out and
[37:30.160 --> 37:35.360]  they'd say they're russians what because i can go read wiki leaks like like putin has to tell me
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.400]  like maxine water she said putin tells him to say the swamp and tells him to say locker up like
[37:40.400 --> 37:44.400]  trump couldn't think of that on his own putin calls him and goes listen say drain the swamp
[37:44.400 --> 37:49.600]  say locker up okay i mean those are like hundred-year-old terms and stuff but you know putin said it
[37:50.800 --> 37:54.960]  yeah meanwhile alex the mainstream media is completely ignoring all the evidence of hillary
[37:54.960 --> 37:59.600]  clinton's crimes where when she was secretary or secretary of state the people she had 101 meetings
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.600]  with alex more than 50 of them donated to the clinton foundation now i don't know any sales field
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.520]  where you can get that kind of closing rate but more than 50 of the people she sat down with
[38:09.520 --> 38:15.440]  101 donated to the clinton foundation massive crowd a lot of the emails read like yeah give us
[38:15.440 --> 38:18.960]  the hundred thousand we'll send her your email okay we got the hundred thousand you're ready for

[38:25.840 --> 38:32.080]  and then a million two three million i mean this is incredible let's continue time a false
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.080]  reported that president trump removed a bust of martin lucer king they go into the meeting
[38:36.080 --> 38:40.400]  all the reporters are there people are standing in front of it other videos show it's there
[38:40.400 --> 38:45.440]  the person's in the room with it lying saying it's not fair because they're being encouraged to
[38:45.440 --> 38:51.360]  they're not doing this on accident they are and the whole agenda is to say donald trump is a racist
[38:51.360 --> 38:56.240]  we hear this on cnbc we hear it on cnn they're openly calling donald trump a racist donald trump
[38:56.240 --> 39:01.680]  is not a racist and uh the people trying to keep everybody poor and under their thumb they're the
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.160]  anti-humans absolutely all those people farming us all i don't care what color you are trying to keep us
[39:06.160 --> 39:10.640]  in poverty and keep us on welfare keep us desperate so we can't you know stand around two feet number
[39:10.640 --> 39:14.880]  five washington post falsely reported the president's massive sold-out rally in pennacola had no one
[39:14.880 --> 39:19.760]  there because they showed photos again before it opened well why didn't he do that for the
[39:19.760 --> 39:23.360]  inauguration i was sure he'd do the inauguration i was there when they wouldn't let us get in for
[39:23.360 --> 39:27.520]  hours the anti-fun black lives matter and and then again they would show shots when they first
[39:27.520 --> 39:32.640]  opened the gates and said look nobody's there i mean think of the media that will lie that directly
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.760]  to you meanwhile can you guys pull up your how you did last time i don't know but the cnn photo
[39:37.760 --> 39:41.600]  from behind the president of the sea of people you can see me standing there too it's crazy it's
[39:41.600 --> 39:47.600]  so hd i'm down like in the fifth row or whatever and boom you can see all the way back miles and
[39:47.600 --> 39:55.360]  miles solid people and then juxtaposed cnn shows you at high new no one was there it's insane alex
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.160]  but you know the mainstream media they're not going to let up on trump because they want him out
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.720]  it's kind of like a foreign entity has invaded the system they desperately want to eject it
[40:04.720 --> 40:08.160]  and that's why you know what we need to get trump some backup because you know what they're
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.480]  going to keep lying they're going to keep lying and they call us fake news you know i on the fake
[40:12.480 --> 40:16.320]  news list my websites have been on there your websites have been on there because they hate us
[40:16.320 --> 40:20.080]  they hate the american people the elite want to continue to rule but we're not going to let that
[40:20.080 --> 40:25.600]  happen and you know cnn did it bbc did it where they would say here it is at noon no one's there
[40:25.600 --> 40:34.320]  but then their own hd photos showed the thing backed up for miles yeah and and so many people
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.320]  that we know personally came out from idaho came out to the inauguration they told us it was packed
[40:38.320 --> 40:43.600]  it was overflowing but it doesn't fit the narrative everything we weren't there there was no one there
[40:43.600 --> 40:49.200]  you weren't there i wasn't there we're all liars uh let's continue here now cnn says so uh let's go
[40:49.200 --> 40:54.560]  on to the ones i haven't gotten to yet cnn falsely edited a video that's uh number six to make an
[40:54.560 --> 41:00.560]  appear president trump defiantly overfed fish during a visit with japan's prime minister japanese
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.120]  prime minister actually led the way you get them up everybody does you do the same thing here we got
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.440]  a you know a tank in your backyard you feed the fish kids come over you go out with fish food
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.080]  you throw a little to get them there and then you throw the whole thing in i mean the japanese do
[41:14.080 --> 41:19.760]  it the same as us rednecks here in texas what do you know oh it's absolutely but every little thing
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.480]  trump does they they're on it you know and they want to focus on it make a real huge deal out of it
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.400]  meanwhile hillary clinton and bill clinton have that can have a trail bodies going all the way back
[41:28.400 --> 41:32.400]  to arkansas in the 1980s and they totally ignore it that's right let's move on to number seven because
[41:32.400 --> 41:36.720]  we already got to the number one saying our economy wouldn't come back shenan falsely reported about
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.760]  anthony square mooch he's meeting with russia but uh retracted it due to a significant breakdown
[41:41.760 --> 41:47.840]  in process number eight newsweek falsely reported that polish first lady uh did not shake president
[41:47.840 --> 41:51.760]  trump's hand another total lie there's video of that shenan falsely reported that former fbi
[41:51.760 --> 41:56.240]  director james comey would dispute president trump's claim that he was told he was on an investigation
[41:56.240 --> 42:02.160]  then comey did not because the president was courted him number ten the new york times falsely
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.440]  claimed the front page that trump administration had hidden a climate report and of course they
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.960]  later admitted it wasn't true number 11 but not least russia collusion russia collusion is perhaps
[42:12.960 --> 42:17.600]  the greatest hoax perpetrated on the american people there is no collusion and it's all been proven
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.800]  and i like how he took what we all thought would be first russian collusion stuck it last and said
[42:22.800 --> 42:27.440]  look that's all a bunch of bull we know it let's celebrate our victory the economy coming back
[42:27.440 --> 42:32.960]  the industry coming back but they're gonna try to steal it in 2018 2018 is everything you've got a
[42:32.960 --> 42:37.840]  shot at winning in idaho we're going to talk about it with michael schneider not just about his run
[42:38.480 --> 42:42.880]  as a family man an educator and a patriot when you show his website with his wife and great family
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.600]  but we've got to win all across this country because they showed us in alabama they're going to
[42:47.600 --> 42:53.280]  use fake polls fake news and they're going to have people come and vote the names of dead people
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.120]  so election fraud is the enemy we'll talk about it with michael schneider straight ahead

[48:04.320 --> 48:09.600]  big coverage of president trump's fake news awards last night uh that matt drudge thought our coverage
[48:09.600 --> 48:14.800]  was the best at drudge report dot com and on the left hand side is linked to us where you can see
[48:14.800 --> 48:19.200]  the president's coverage and we're going to take the last two segments that we just did post them
[48:19.200 --> 48:25.280]  to youtube and facebook and post that in the article so there's now a video element of the
[48:25.280 --> 48:32.640]  president's awards but we've gone through uh those uh areas now i want to shift gears into
[48:32.640 --> 48:40.560]  campaigns 2018 uh again michael we know it's in the wiki leaks but we knew this before they
[48:40.560 --> 48:45.200]  john pedestas says we got to go out two years ahead of the campaign start financing all the
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.240]  major pollsters like we've never done to over sample democrats not just the normal nine points but
[48:50.240 --> 48:56.800]  20 30 points will dominate up front in the primaries and in the general we cannot be stopped well they
[48:56.800 --> 49:03.120]  were stopped okay but with more they kept saying 15 20 points 10 points behind he lost by half a
[49:03.120 --> 49:08.400]  point and we know that was dead people voting so boom we know their strategy fraud to the core
[49:09.360 --> 49:14.560]  yeah absolutely and they want to steal 2018 too and 2018 is soky if you're concerned about the
[49:14.560 --> 49:19.200]  future of the trump movement you got to get involved in 2018 races all over the nation
[49:19.200 --> 49:24.640]  now look how real this is we have to fight really hard now because this is real it's not perfect
[49:24.640 --> 49:29.040]  but it's real yeah and they want to take out trump so it doesn't even get to 2020 but we're
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.640]  not going to let that happen we're going to get trump some friends in congress that's key if they
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.960]  if they get the house or senate impeachment they're going to go full bore for impeachment the democrats
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.600]  have already said we got to watch back he's delivering to us we got to watch his back yeah
[49:41.600 --> 49:45.760]  and Alex we want to focus on races around the country where we can win for right right now
[49:45.760 --> 49:49.600]  90% of the races we know who's going to win republican or democrat but there's some races
[49:49.600 --> 49:53.440]  around the country and my race is one of them where it's completely wide open now in my district
[49:53.440 --> 49:58.160]  in Idaho the first congressional district at this point two-thirds of the voters are completely
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.560]  undecided with four months to go until the primary the rest of the vote is split up very very tight
[50:02.560 --> 50:08.720]  race we're trending up we can win this thing right now it says the voter in terms of a voter
[50:08.720 --> 50:14.240]  identification candidate record name recognition is below 15% for every single person in this race
[50:14.240 --> 50:20.320]  unprecedented if we get the 30% voter identification name recognition we're going to win this thing
[50:20.320 --> 50:24.720]  so we need everyone out there to get involved to donate to go to michael snider for congress.com
[50:24.720 --> 50:28.800]  to go on facebook our official facebook campaign page spread ourselves anyway because if you want
[50:28.800 --> 50:33.280]  to abolish the federal reserve if you want to abolish the income tax if you want medical marijuana
[50:33.280 --> 50:37.600]  if you want to shut down the big brother spying get involved in our campaign because i'm just not
[50:37.600 --> 50:42.160]  representing Idaho but we're representing liberty freedom we're like we're going to be like a ron
[50:42.160 --> 50:46.960]  paul when we go for that's it we need imagine you up there i mean you're very eloquent very well
[50:46.960 --> 50:53.600]  red super smart a family guy get a bunch of michael sniders in there you'll be like 20 people
[50:53.600 --> 50:57.760]  because the bully pulpit you will be annihilating them on the news shows you'll be annihilating them
[50:57.760 --> 51:01.520]  on c span you'll be a you'll be a whistle blowing on everything you'll be back in the president when
[51:01.520 --> 51:07.040]  he's right uh shitting signals when he's wrong notice every time kelly comes out and says oh
[51:07.040 --> 51:11.680]  he's not going to build the wall because i didn't say that that's not true he is surrounded by people
[51:11.680 --> 51:16.960]  that do not have his back yeah we're gonna build that wall and in fact any person running for a
[51:16.960 --> 51:20.960]  congress that doesn't want to build the wall should not be running for congress so i'm very proud
[51:20.960 --> 51:26.000]  to say i'm 100 pro trump i love donald trump i want to be donald trump's best friend in congress
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.520]  and no one's really taken up that mantle so far no one wants that title the great wall of china
[51:29.520 --> 51:35.520]  wasn't perfect but it stopped the mongolian hunting invasions nine times out of ten okay and you're
[51:35.520 --> 51:39.200]  the wall around the vatican the rest of rome got taken over by the muslims for a while not inside
[51:39.200 --> 51:45.600]  the vatican because they had 200 foot walls so what kelly is doing is trying to moderate to look like
[51:45.600 --> 51:49.520]  the president's moderating he thinks he's helping because they're not going to build it across rivers
[51:50.080 --> 51:54.480]  and so it's not going to be in the middle of desert zones where there's a mountain range it's a
[51:54.480 --> 51:59.040]  natural wall and you can't get there they're going to put a fence up or something i mean obviously
[51:59.040 --> 52:03.680]  but where there's uh you know ridges come together and you've got a valley and there's people coming
[52:03.680 --> 52:08.160]  across and that's a spot no there's going to be a wall there and then they're going oh he didn't
[52:08.160 --> 52:12.960]  build it a hundred percent the point is we're moving in the right direction yeah and we've got to do
[52:12.960 --> 52:16.960]  something about illegal immigration because for years we've left the back door completely wide
[52:16.960 --> 52:22.480]  open meanwhile the front door legal immigration is super complicated takes forever and incredibly
[52:22.480 --> 52:26.400]  expensive i actually helped someone through that process that's been done by the democrats on purpose
[52:26.400 --> 52:30.560]  yeah but meanwhile we left the back we'll leave the back door completely wide open for drug dealers
[52:30.560 --> 52:34.800]  for gang members for lawbreakers for islamic terrorists whoever wants to come in the back
[52:34.800 --> 52:39.200]  door is completely wide open we need to shut the back door with a physical barrier so everyone
[52:39.200 --> 52:43.040]  that's coming into this country is coming through the front door absolutely we're not anti-immigrant
[52:43.040 --> 52:47.120]  because donald trump's wife is a legal immigrant well that's another thing that the fake right wing
[52:47.120 --> 52:52.240]  does is to score points and i'm not against inculter but she just gets cheap shots all the time
[52:52.240 --> 52:56.560]  or she says things like the japanese ought to be happy Fukushima happened because radiation is good
[52:56.560 --> 53:02.160]  for you that's a real quote she says things like you know trump's gonna sell us out on DACA
[53:02.160 --> 53:07.600]  and he screwed us over because he said it you know no DACA he said not that version of DACA
[53:07.600 --> 53:11.920]  where you bring all these unvetted people in but of course if you've lived here 20 years we're here
[53:11.920 --> 53:15.920]  when you were a kid and you're a good member of society we'll get you a sped up path to citizenship
[53:15.920 --> 53:21.200]  that's what he said back in the campaign the media misrepresented what he said absolutely and
[53:21.200 --> 53:25.520]  donald trump has been very generous with the democrats saying okay hey if you want to deal
[53:25.520 --> 53:29.680]  a deal on DACA okay give me money for part of the wall he didn't even ask for the whole wall
[53:29.680 --> 53:33.360]  just for part of the wall and the democrats are saying no and now we're facing this government
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.960]  shut down again alex and the democrats are spoiled brats they know that if they just stand firm
[53:38.960 --> 53:44.080]  and demand everything and say okay republicans give us everything and DACA too that eventually
[53:44.080 --> 53:48.480]  they'll fold and because the republicans in congress are spineless they what they don't
[53:48.480 --> 53:53.200]  stand up for anything they've been compromising for so long that and the democrats they know if
[53:53.200 --> 53:56.960]  they just have a backbone the republicans will just that's right and that's why they had banan
[53:56.960 --> 54:02.720]  not only bringing the wolves and sheep's clothing we all got fooled uh that then he's basically been
[54:02.720 --> 54:07.360]  going you know kind of running the other races letting those get sabotaged so then the media can
[54:07.360 --> 54:12.000]  say oh this whole libertarian populist insurrection the republican party it's been defeated by the
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.400]  republican establishment no the republican establishment's all retiring they know it's over
[54:16.400 --> 54:21.040]  this is the time for maximum effort and the globalists are really trying to fight us on that
[54:21.040 --> 54:27.040]  let's talk about good news here it's on info wars dot com three new criminal investigations
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.800]  opened in the last three weeks by the justice department and fbi so good for the fbi doing
[54:32.800 --> 54:37.680]  your job uh finally not being you know the top literal clinton minions as the emails and text

[54:47.840 --> 54:53.840]  important the clinton foundation has finally been opened for money laundering and the media is barely
[54:53.840 --> 54:58.400]  even reporting it's like oh they're looking at some money transfers of the foundation from australia
[54:58.400 --> 55:05.680]  no three criminal investigations have i mean they would say you know on the saturday morning cartoons
[55:05.680 --> 55:13.520]  with the super friends aquaman summon three giant whales i mean we have got three giant whales here
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.720]  that are real not like russia gate these things are bonafide like iraq a baby back ribs you can

[55:23.360 --> 55:28.160]  need to send hillary clinton to prison i'm not talking about nice country club prison i'm talking
[55:28.160 --> 55:33.520]  about put her in an orange jumpsuit it's a hardcore federal prison for the rest of her life i mean
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.200]  along with bill clinton along with james comey along with huma abedin along with john pedesta
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.680]  especially and so we need and we need republicans in congress who are going to be proud remember

[56:06.240 --> 56:10.880]  the 1980s so massive corruption but we've got to restore the rule of law and how good is it that we

[56:50.080 --> 56:55.200]  their crimes are open for all of us to see but they never go to prison so why don't we have a
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.640]  society where none of us get arrested none of us get in trouble for anything none of us and we'll
[57:00.640 --> 57:04.640]  see how that works out no we've got to restore the rule of law because we don't we don't have the

[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:47.840]  till later we're not going to have this chance again very well said um what do you make of three
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.520]  criminal investigations open to the clintons and even alternative real media is hardly making a big
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.000]  deal about it i mean myself included it's like oh the first new criminal investigation gets open
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.880]  back in their uranium one and then the server and now into the foundation for money laundering
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:09.120]  and i'm even myself like oh but it's not on fox news our job is to push it out on the fox news
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.800]  yeah and that's the role of the alternative media that that's why i've been writing the last seven
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.120]  years and in recent weeks i've been talking so much about hillary clinton and her crimes because
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.960]  this needs to be at the top of everything the mainstream media is trying to ignore it because
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.680]  it doesn't fit there and the clintons have killed a lot of people but they can't kill us all and
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.360]  their comeuppance is here it is and it wouldn't be it would be a great day for america to see
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.600]  hillary clinton clinton arrested and finally go to prison it would be a great day for america
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.240]  and we need to push it we need to push it as hard as we can absolutely people say i'll turn into an
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:46.560]  i'll turn her into a martyr i just came to say the name martyr with hillary clinton no it won't
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.560]  it's justice she's a wicked evil thieving witch that robbed haiti of two billion dollars and her
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.880]  direct adjunct got caught smuggling children out this woman is the spawn of hell yeah you know what
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.680]  there is all kinds of talk about human trafficking about all the things that are going on you know
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.600]  if we don't fight this is going to get worse it's going to get more hellish it's going to become more

[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.760]  so the number one winner in president trump's fake news awards yesterday we had the people's
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.320]  choice awards were going to be announcing in the next few days i've got to go over all the people
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:34.240]  that that were nominees all the people that came up with their points to really see who won because
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.120]  in our list is not the man that said trump helped bring back the economy they said we never get above
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.560]  a three percent growth rate he did it he helped take the boot off america's neck i also said that
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.440]  i'm not going to give myself the award but we predicted it was the economy well that one caller
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:57.760]  did they deserve first prize okay a whole bunch of people you know said the flin thing uh the ross
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.640]  report from abc news and and and quite frankly i thought it would be russia gate but see trump
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.160]  didn't want to make it all about their false reporting on him he made it about their false
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.160]  reporting and not believing in you that that is just pure genius so we're gonna have to go back
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:20.400]  and watch at least the first four hours of yesterday's coverage because two people called in and it's
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.560]  no the crew isn't bad we took over a hundred calls from not having it written down that they
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.000]  predicted it'd be the monetary return of america and the media saying it couldn't happen uh because
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.480]  i just kind of agreed with the guy uh if memory serves but i just that person deserves the two
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.640]  thousand dollars second place gets a thousand dollars third place gets the steak knives because
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.640]  i could just kind of rubber stamp it and you know give it to folks that uh you know got number two
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:51.120]  and number three and number four right but that's not fair so we're going to have to go watch that
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:55.680]  have to watch my my own show and i'm joking i actually don't like watching myself but the
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.760]  point is i love listening to the callers so that's very exciting you know i normally have commentary
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.080]  on things when i play it for fair use but i don't really know how i can add commentary uh to what
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.400]  sean hannity has come out and said because it's so accurate we're going to play that and then i'm
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.280]  going to come back and play uh tim cook saying hey we're bringing apple back to america because of
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:21.360]  the tax cut it makes it now where we can come back here uh because now it's the same as china's tax
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.840]  rate now china just lowered to zero to counter that but it shows how we had these internal tariffs
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.720]  basically tax tariffs on ourselves to sell our jobs out which was the globalist plan so that's
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.440]  coming up as well but hannity has come out and taken what the internet really started meaming
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:45.280]  over the weekend and that cnn is the whole network the whole network we don't do like
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.040]  they do and violate the fcc stuff but we don't like to be vulgar either but we sometimes we have
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.560]  to illustrate vulgarity by being vulgar and so hannity now on his big platform the biggest on
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.240]  cable news and one of the biggest on talk radio is helping us brand it uh and i think the group
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.200]  collective deserves coining it i do remember seeing it over the weekend saying it myself
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.520]  but a lot of others were saying as well that hey uh that the mouths of the reporters at cnn are
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.960]  holes uh that everything that comes out of them is that uh when phil mudd that says he wants to
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:24.240]  kill the president uh said he's a proud holder i mean i agree he is a hole everything comes out
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.520]  of his mouth is basically what he said he is so finally they're telling the truth maybe they can
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.280]  get an award for telling the truth saying that they are the whole network uh so there you go ladies
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.080]  and gentlemen and he lays it all out and goes over the lies and hysteria and then what happened
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.360]  well let's just go to the tape here it is so the president has heart disease those numbers
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.800]  qualify him for having heart disease and it clearly needs a plan to try and prevent some
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:56.720]  sort of heart problem down the road really he's never examined the president now we know that
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.680]  fake news cnn i have a new name in a second and we know they hate the president but really they're
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:07.040]  going to predict a guy that's never examined the president that he's going to have a heart attack
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:12.800]  now this type of behavior it shouldn't be surprising especially coming from what we're now calling
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:22.800]  you see it right there cnn the whole network or the whole fake news network it fits cnn somehow
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.760]  managed to say that word hundreds of times in one week alone here are just a few of the examples
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.480]  i promise i played them all i have too much news to cover tonight but here's some we'll put it on
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.600]  our website tomorrow what was your reaction when you heard the president called you know african
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:46.800]  nations holes it's not clear what he meant by whole countries are you shocked or surprised by this
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:55.280]  i'm not surprised and in one way i'm proud i am a proud holer no we are not all created equal
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:01.440]  at least not if you are born in as the president put it a whole country the word house instead of
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:07.840]  whole as in house countries not whole countries i guess he's a holer is there a difference if the
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.840]  president said uh holer house do you think these countries are holes john o trump has turned the
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:19.760]  oval office into a whole holer's built this country 110 years ago in addition to the president's
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:27.600]  whole comments yesterday a few more whole countries whole whole whole whole whole country rich do you
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.200]  have an example of any whole country that the president referred to that is predominantly caucasian
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:47.360]  and i work for i'm proud to be a a million years old i would be on television
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.920]  congratulations see it and you've done more than enough to earn your new nickname the whole network
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:02.080]  fake news network keep up the good work they really are desperate criminals that are aware that we're
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.920]  aware of them and it's a great report the full reports like six and a half minutes long it's on
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.800]  him full wars dot com steve watson wrote about it you need to send it out to everybody you know because
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:16.480]  this is a real grand slam that hannity has put out you know he he reportedly writes his own six
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:23.120]  minute intros and it's just all true uh video hannity dubb seeing in the whole network their
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.960]  hypnotized lobotomized robots oh yeah at the start he lays out how they believe their own bull
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.200]  and they keep saying that the president's super sick and mentally ill and has dementia and Alzheimer's
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.520]  and so the doctor comes out and says it is it true it's obviously not true they all flip out here
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:45.760]  let's go to some more of it all right so the sick the twisted the mentally unstable anti-trump media
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:51.760]  again working itself into a new manufactured frenzy now we have been explaining how the
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.640]  bias press operates in this country for a while here's how it works they rush from one fabricated
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.880]  meltdown to another and in the process these brain dead so-called journalists they bounce around
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.320]  the same talking points in their little fake news bubble echo chamber and it becomes a competition
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:14.000]  to see well who can say the most outlandish the most offensive the most completely false thing
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.080]  about president trump it's like they're hypnotized lobotomized robots they're kind of programmed
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.040]  every wake up hey trump it's really pathetic and it's sad and it's predictable and they are not
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.080]  serving you the american people now members of the media sadly their sheep their clothes minded
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.720]  they have actually convinced themselves this is the psychotic part through their own conspiracy
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.880]  theories that president trump is oh he's suffering from dementia he has early onset uh alzheimer's
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:46.160]  he's deranged now the newest fake news fixation is all about the president's health think he'd be
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:52.480]  happy now naturally after the president's doctor told them that he was in excellent i repeat
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.440]  excellent physical condition and this shock them could easily serve for two full terms
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.280]  the media media could not believe it it goes against everything they've all been telling themselves
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:08.720]  hour after hour day after day week after week month after month the press they can't stand the fact
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.600]  that the president scored a perfect 30 for 30 on a cognitive exam they never know when they give
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.720]  up most of the people in the media world would probably fail that test or put it themselves
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.040]  i'd love to test them now before we show you new examples it's important to highlight
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:30.000]  just how utterly insane the media was yesterday at the press conference with the president's doctor
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.320]  watch this if you keep a tally of how much gulf the u.s president plays some of the president's
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.800]  friends have told reporters in the past they think he's a germaphobe that he washed his hands
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:50.160]  obsessively and is concerned about that do you see any indication of that type of behavior
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:56.560]  that did that yeah like a bunch of mentally ill goons do you see any evidence of bones first
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.160]  which the president said that he suffered from if you limited to one step of my spring now
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.840]  i know i don't yeah twitter doesn't involve me as a doctor i don't i don't i don't have any
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.680]  concern on that so the president where dentures the president has no partial or dentures of any
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:19.840]  kind you said he doesn't drink and he doesn't smoke and other than the diet issue did you address
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.920]  drug addiction drug addiction i mean any other drugs yeah no no he has uh he has no drug addiction
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.760]  i'll stop there this is reportedly he doesn't even take aspirin but by the way notice what he's
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.400]  thrown down here is the gauntlet they're the ones that wanted him to have the cognitive test now i
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.760]  demand polosa you can't even chew gum can't even talk or maxine waters without other congressmen

[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.960]  dr ebra group one of my good friends great researcher somebody that going back even a decade
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.880]  ago before i was even having a show i would see things he was talking about riding him back
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.600]  that today is mainstream news uh and so we're going to get into so many of these topics
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.000]  i first remember hearing from you that diet soft drinks make you fat now that's mainstream news
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.880]  also heard it from dr blaylock a brain surgeon uh and you know so many other issues of course your
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:10.240]  dad was a famous chemist who helped to create bisphenol a and that's a whole other story but
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.800]  we're winning on a lot of fronts but we're also losing on a lot so i want to get into some of
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:19.040]  those and i wanted to recap something we haven't spent enough time on is that a caller call in
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:26.000]  links carlos from canada a few weeks ago and talk about what what true iodine does in the body
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.520]  and why the global is trying to keep it deficient and people said man that was a powerful three
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.400]  minute call is that true well absolutely you're going to go over the literature the history
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:40.400]  mainstream news 15 point iq reductions uh in people that don't get enough iodine uh the fda
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.080]  keeps lowering the level you're supposedly need then the bad halogens coming we're going to get
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.880]  to all that the next segment and a bunch of other news then return to mike adams people say we're
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:53.680]  mike adams go a few years ago the health ranger he has spent so much time building a world-class
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:59.040]  laboratory with certifications a lot of people don't even have that he you know unplugged from
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.520]  a lot of media for a while but he's back now i didn't ask him to do it he tested all of our
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.360]  products and just like buzzfeed did and found they were all super clean i said well you know
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.440]  what's going to happen they're going to get tested again and magically you know and and and that
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:16.400]  happened and the democrats don't give up california standards they said a few failed and they've sued
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.800]  me uh and and that's been in the news well i didn't even ask me to do it he tested it with the
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:26.000]  modern spectrometers and lo and behold chose the first test showed but i mean how do you even deal
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.680]  with this that's a whole other subject he wanted to get into that today i want to get into the big
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.560]  sludge conspiracy his big film coming out by a sludge and then just you know move on from that
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:40.080]  point people know what's going on they didn't buy into it and we're going to win that deal but
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:48.080]  it's just frightening when you realize the links that people will go to yeah no it is uh but but
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.800]  the good news is things are changing and we're starting to see those changes getting into the
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.120]  eye and we'll talk about later but it's glad i'm glad to see mike mike's done some incredible
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:03.600]  things over the last few years he's he's he's been around a long time great guy and uh really is
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:11.040]  one of those pioneers in just like us and changing the way people think providing people with the
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:18.960]  information necessary to make good choices and again it's all about how healthy your mind is
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:25.440]  how healthy your body is how much do you take care of yourself on a regular basis and waking the
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.160]  population up which i think that we are seeing that tipping point coming close right now i was
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.840]  my next point i want to ask you this because i even have family that said to me because they know
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.560]  about the behind-the-scenes stuff i mean my own mother and she's always been hey tell the truth
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.120]  charge action she said you have to do everything you have to be like literally pushing these people
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.360]  into a corner you have a family and i said it's because i have family i am pushing this hard but
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:53.200]  even people in my family that have never never balked they're like whoa because they've seen
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.880]  this stuff behind the scenes it is unbelievable but you know god's going to take us through this
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:01.280]  fiery furnace or i'm going to be used as an example in this fight i'm not lionizing myself think
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.440]  how much pressure trump's under the things you've gone through to say how mike adams gets persecuted
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.080]  the things that go on we tell the truth and that's what i wanted to say i'm enthusiastic about trump
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.360]  because he is delivering and and and his biggest enemies the fake conservatives that say oh he's
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.680]  going to screw us on docka when he said no i'm not and he didn't so far or he's not going to give us
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.600]  real tax cuts and then he does or you know oh he's not going to really have you know the fake news
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:29.360]  awards and he does and he's not a dictator and he's gotten so much done that it's it it makes
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:35.040]  my head spin and i just think morally in this instant gratification culture we should be more
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:42.160]  thankful that's all i'm saying all i'm saying is fast forward 50 to 100 years from now when our
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:48.240]  grandkids are reading the history books and it talks about the revolution in health and the
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:58.000]  revolution of america that happened between let's say the year 2000 and in 2050 or however long it
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.280]  takes to to get these things changed we can see that movement happening right now and our grandchildren's
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:10.000]  grandchildren are reading the history book saying what they used to inject vaccines into people they
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.720]  used to inject viruses into people they used to poison the water of the people they used to poison
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:22.480]  the air of the people and then there's going to be a whole section in those history books i mean
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.480]  we are part of that revolution we don't realize what we're doing right now and how important we
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.320]  really are in telling and getting this information out this will be in the history books and your
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.680]  grandchildren will be reading about it and they will be talking about you and they'll be talking
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:43.200]  about all of the the players and all of the people that came together to change the world
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:47.600]  better your children and grandchildren won't have their genetics completely ruined which we know
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:53.120]  generationally it's already pretty bad and and what changed the last 10 years uh because of Dr
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.040]  Merkola and the listeners and all the other great people that are out there what changed the last
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.120]  decade we're seeing in goes okay fluoride should be taken out of the water it's causing brain
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.680]  cancer and bone cancer and lower IQ and lower fertility i mean that's Harvard studies what
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.800]  change where they now are okay diet drinks make you fat i mean they they're suddenly coming out
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.720]  okay msg eats your brain okay prozac makes you kill people okay ridlin you know shrinks your
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:22.480]  kids brain physically i mean suddenly they know they can't cover it up anymore there's something
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:28.480]  going on with the sterility plan uh and i think it's backfiring on a lot of people because initially
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:35.440]  the plan was by taking the iodine out of foods by incorporating and telling people to eat more
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:40.720]  cooked and processed and microwave foods dead food by adding all the chemicals and artificial
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:46.320]  sweeteners by blanketing the earth with the endocrine disrupting chemicals and the pesticides
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:52.000]  and herbicides and the glyphosates and the gmo foods a lot of that 90 percent of it has to do
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.240]  with making the world sterile and a lot of that's not even going to come into play for two or three
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:03.360]  generations and there's thousands of white papers from all the globalists from the former white house
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.280]  science r john b holderan uh to all these people admitting that they're doing this is an admitted
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.920]  plan no absolutely there's nothing that we're saying up here that hasn't been in the mainstream
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:20.480]  media hasn't been documented the german government wants to drug germans in the water supply now
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:26.720]  with lithium to make them submit to islam you cannot make it up that is in der spiegel no you
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.360]  cannot make it up but i think that the reason one of the reasons why the mainstream media
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.760]  is coming out with some of these things is because those individuals that are involved
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.880]  are having problems with fertility they're getting the autistic children they believed in the game
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.480]  it's a mental thing so they the people that do believe in vaccines and that think that it's okay
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.320]  to eat a bunch of garbage food and use glyphosate and all that well those high level people too
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:57.360]  are having problems having kids and even the people that control the world are still having
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.480]  problems with the whole fertility issue and you're right it is the children that we're trying to
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.440]  protect especially looking at the the studies that have been done on rats with artificial sweeteners
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:13.440]  and genetically modified foods where by the fourth fifth or sixth generation they're completely
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:19.120]  sterile and there's no more uh ability to get pregnant and there's lots of post admitting it's
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.000]  a sterile and anguish cancers they knew when they approved it in the 70s and they admit it is a
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.320]  bio weapon plan a chemical weapon plan against humanity understand folks they admit it that
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:36.080]  they are putting hydrofluorosalicylic acid in the water at one part 1.3 parts per million
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.720]  to brain damage you and lower your fertility they admit and even though it's all admitted
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:46.640]  they're keeping it in the water and sell baby water with it in the water hiding the attack

[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:16.640]  controversy around this network about alex jones for google is being accused of hiding negative
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:22.720]  stories about hillary and her campaign by changing his algorithm to marry stories like the clinton
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:28.160]  body count story that's according to website info wars is currently confirmed are recent shooters

[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:52.160]  pancake i think this is a national security imperative we have clear things that we do
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:34:00.080]  not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control us is this global governance
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.360]  at last is it one world the central bank has been charged visual claims the fact was accidental
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.800]  some former us naval officers say it was on purpose they described today's action as part of a
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:17.760]  continuing color russian intelligence compiled a dossier on mr trump during visits to musko
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.880]  russian stop denied everything he called it all fake news and he accused cnn of being fake news this
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.800]  is a kill truck or remove truck it will cause a massive civil war in this country this is a
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:40.240]  female high-level emergency we are at war with russia are you aware that mr stone also stated publicly
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:45.040]  that he was in direct communication with julien assange which leaks the white house the president
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:52.240]  are citing info wars they can shut us down your next if you are receiving this transmission you
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:59.920]  are the resistance it's alex jones i'm alex jones dr ebbard group is with us and we're talking about
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:08.160]  history solved i i'm gonna ask dr group a critical question why suddenly is cnn msnbc
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:15.040]  the harvard medical you name it going okay hydrofluorosalic acid fluorine the water is causing
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:23.680]  massive iq reductions cancer dental fluorosis brain cancer we need to take it out okay there is runoff
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:30.800]  making the frogs uh basically be infertile okay sperm count is down 90 percent okay
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:38.080]  glyphosate is making you infertile and giving you cancer and dr group confided in me privately
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.320]  he's on the research and there's white papers on this that they admit it's having unforeseen
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:48.560]  chain reactions in the environment threatening to bring down the entire biosphere that to use
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:54.640]  these weapons against us the globalists to depopulate their soft kill they've caused a chain
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:00.000]  reaction because you see them kind of now hedging their bets going yeah there is vaccine protection
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.680]  since 1984 86 is when it went into full effect yeah these companies are causing people to die
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.000]  i mean we're not saying you can't learn immunity isn't we don't believe in that it's
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.600]  they what are they putting in you the same government's caught in all these secret tests
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:19.200]  giving black people sephals we only know the h1n1 was a simulant they put in a vaccine the year
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.600]  before that we got the next year everybody i know that gets the flu took the flu shot i mean
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:28.400]  it's incredible so you were getting into something when we were talking before we went live on air
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:35.760]  into why this is happening and what's going on behind it and and and and and why history solve
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.760]  we know their plan it's in white papers and now their plan's falling apart on at every front
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.320]  what's going to happen and then what comes into that vacuum well those of us that aren't you
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.800]  genus sister technocrats we better get involved and come into the vacuum not to run things but
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:57.360]  to culturally counter the globalists so dr group roll through this critical information for us
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:05.040]  okay well first of all there's more information available to the general public and there's more
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:14.640]  freedom fighters that are coming out and what i like to call real news broadcasters not the
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.600]  alternative media but real news broadcasters like yourself and everybody else then there's the next
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.440]  generation of children that have watched their parents and their grandparents die that are listening
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.880]  to this and that are putting a lot of pressure on these organizations so first thing you have
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:36.960]  is you have the flow of information out there so it's getting to the point where they just can't
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:43.200]  hide it anymore secondly their original plan was to control the population and they weren't thinking
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.960]  about the impact it was going to have on the atmosphere they weren't thinking about the impact
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:53.280]  it was going to have on the earth it was all about money because the government was allowing
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.680]  monsanto to move forward with their programs they were used allowing dagga dow agri sciences and
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:07.200]  genta and the big chemical manufacturers and oil and gas producers to drill as much into the earth
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:13.760]  to use chemicals on the earth to spray chemicals in the air through the chemtrails so even though
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:20.400]  the original plan was to poison the food and slow cause a slow death because the pharmaceutical
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.760]  companies are working unison with the big agricultural companies they work in unison with
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.560]  the oil and gas companies and they all work together in a multi-layered in a multi-layered
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:37.360]  binary weapon delivery system yes yes but it's but it's gotten out of control because of the money
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.680]  and because of different individuals that head up different departments or different companies
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:51.760]  that want to get rich so what what we've come to now is a massive chemical biological
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:58.800]  nightmare death orgy which it's almost at the tipping point where it's two that's why they're
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.520]  trying to control the weather i mean they put the harp systems in and and and have been controlling
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:10.640]  the weather as well to fix that into their spider web of all these different things that they're
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:14.400]  trying to do but now the way the department of energy admits that the Doppler systems aren't
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.080]  just for Doppler they're using Dubai as Doppler up to control the weather they just admit it on
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.320]  their news here they just control it and the general scientists meteorologists don't even know
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:26.640]  it's just got that other function but people are waking up and it's because they're starting to
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:32.080]  get healthy the best and the fastest way that you can wake yourself up is to become healthy and to
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:38.560]  cleanse your body and detoxify and to not buy these things and that is a trend that's been
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.120]  happening since the GMO movement since the organic movement it's like bottled water it's not perfect
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.320]  but everybody knows stop drinking the tap water and these people instinctively are moving away
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.800]  because the globalists themselves always they're into organic they're into not taking vaccines
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.040]  they're all the ones obsessed with this because they know and i think they're now realizing
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.480]  they're never going to get out of the things they've done they've been trapped again clean well
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:05.520]  hudder is more expensive by the gallon than gasoline is and that's why you have the big
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.760]  corporations that are getting into water they're buying up the land nestly is trying to take over
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:15.040]  our water supplies different countries are trying to take over the rights of the water the government's
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.400]  now passing bills that says they can come in and even if you own the land they can and you own the
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.840]  water rights on that land that they can take that over and take it away from you so going back to the
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:32.080]  whole control mechanism to control the air to control the water control control the food and
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.680]  dumb people down and make people non-aggressive and be able to control the amount of fertility and
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:42.720]  the amount of babies that are being bored through planned parenthood that you've talked about many
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.760]  times and they now admit in the family uh don't let you say mother or father on an entrance form
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:52.720]  for your baby because that's hurtful i mean this is literally the end of our biological you don't
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.760]  even have to classify your baby as a male or a female that's the new thing now on the birth forms
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.360]  that they're going to be so chemicalized that they're not going to be so there'll be a whole
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:05.600]  ready-made group to say look to point at them and say you've got to accept this kind of like they
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.520]  never want to find the the what's causing breast cancer to go up three thousand percent to go out
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.440]  of state and other things they always want to make it about oh let's run for it let's raise money for
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.320]  those that are dying to find a cure or whatever when they know full well what it is but they put
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.280]  it into a process you see oh everybody's not going to be able to have babies anymore so let's just be
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.800]  nice and it's who we are now that is a perfect statement because the one thing that they do
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:36.800]  not want us ever to find out is the root cause and that goes for everything alex the government why
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:43.280]  are we why what is the root cause of why the government has 30 trillion or more in debt what
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:51.440]  is the root cause of the usda allowing toxins to be sprayed on the meat what is the root cause of
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:58.320]  the fda toxins live viruses they legalized it 12 years ago live viruses a vaccine
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:04.480]  is sprayed on most meat that's right well who's looking into well isn't the fda is supposed to
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.800]  be looking into the root cause isn't the usda i mean they're taking our time and we wonder
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.680]  why we have record gut problems 50 years ago maybe one out of 10 million had crowns now they're
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:18.880]  saying one out of a couple hundred i mean it's just exploded and this is one of the reasons
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.440]  why we're at a tipping point this is how i know because the pharmaceutical companies right now
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:30.720]  are actively trying to buy all of the nutraceutical companies i know so they know that that the
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:36.320]  people are demanding health they know the people are getting away from pharmaceuticals and it's
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:40.880]  been part of their plan for a while so now they're in the process of buying all the nutraceutical
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:46.480]  companies they just wanted to push the pharmaceuticals as long as long as long as they can and then
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:51.840]  own the nutraceuticals when the people make that transition we'll be right back tomorrow's news
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:59.360]  today it's called the info war introducing fluorolife the new probiotic line developed
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:05.040]  exclusively by info wars life after years of research on the human microbiome not all probiotics
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:10.160]  are made the same fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:15.680]  the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect this is critical
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.640]  because stomach acid kills most probiotics so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:25.600]  then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet fluorolife supports your body's core
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.800]  where you need it most including digestion regularity immunity the gut lining and metabolism
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.520]  did you know that over 80 percent of your immune system is located in your gut that's why
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.800]  increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health fluorolife is sold as a 15
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:46.000]  billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced

[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.560]  percent of your energy they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:16.320]  cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:21.520]  when your mitochondria don't run at 100 percent efficiency then they start producing reactive
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:28.320]  oxygen species top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:34.800]  from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:40.240]  available on the market the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:47.760]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force from info

[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:39.040]  and the questions
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.920]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live dr ebra grips my guest he's got
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:57.120]  tons of government documents studies mainstream media in front of him getting into what's
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.600]  happening and going on and again how the globalists have all this fake environmentalism
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:08.560]  to cover up the fact that they're the ones involved in attempt to take over the very genetic
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.760]  biosphere of the planet and admitting it with all the genetic engineering pollution the kamiro's
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:19.920]  the cross species it goes on and on and then we talk about how to fight back against it well
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:24.720]  with very simple things i haven't even plugged yet today and i'm supposed to be some in here i
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.000]  guess i took it in my office take some of the x2 iodine with water at least once a day let's just
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:36.880]  specifically talk about iodine deficiency and the whole iodine conspiracy and how important that is
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:42.800]  well first of all cnn just came out with an article saying demand for anti-radiation drug
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:48.640]  jumps after trunk trumps nuclear threat and we've been getting calls too so basically apparently
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:53.360]  after trumps tweet everybody's been stocking up on iodine all over the world and most places are
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:59.600]  completely sold out of the potassium iodide tablets now that's a good thing because it's
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:06.400]  raising awareness to the benefit i found it there it is x2 that now that's the only iodine supplement
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.160]  in the world ladies and gentlemen i knew about iodine a long time ago in the in the effects of
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:19.520]  iodine because looking at again the root cause of what's going on we are all exposed to endocrine
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.600]  disrupting chemicals every single day we're exposed to lead we're exposed to mercury we're
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:30.960]  exposed to bromine chlorine and fluoride the other toxic halogens and this is so critical people
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:35.520]  need to listen very very carefully because back in college i was down at barton springs and there
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:41.680]  was some olympics swimmer folks that were retired down there swimming i remember they had jugs of
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:48.160]  water and it was yelling i said what is it they said it's iodine this is the secret so i remember
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:55.360]  some hippies drinking iodine when i was a kid so this has been known for a while in 1961 the royal
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:01.200]  society of medicine came out with a published study that said free iodine in the stomach
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:07.200]  was one of the most effective things in the world at killing off bacteria and microorganisms and even
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:16.480]  viruses that scared the pharmaceutical companies ever since then we've had a major campaign to
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:24.240]  take iodine out of everything a war on iodine a war on iodine and we've had an accumulation of the
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.680]  halogens that are toxic to the body we've had massive amounts of fluoride put in the environment
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:35.760]  chlorine and bromine bromine is in everything if you if you get a mountain dew or or any type of
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:42.000]  soft drinks most likely it has bromine most people don't know that mountain dew actually has brominated
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:49.200]  vegetable oil in it to use as an emulsifier and most people don't know that iodine is used
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:54.800]  and required by every single cell in the body now there was a study that came out also alex
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:51:04.080]  which is which is pretty shocking but it's great news for us a dose of 20 000 micrograms per day
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:16.640]  created urinary excretion levels of mercury lead fluoride bromine chlorine and other toxins
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:21.840]  what does that mean if you've been in this field as long as i have like 20 something years you know
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:27.040]  it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body iodine is one of those
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:34.400]  miracle substances that not only helps you detoxify the hardest things to eliminate they measured it
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:40.400]  in the urine of people when they put put them on high levels of iodine but think about what's
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:46.000]  going on right now in america and around the world what does what does an iodine deficiency do
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:51.200]  well causes you to gain weight think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:55.760]  right now around the world hypothyroid if you don't have iodine it will use the bad halogens
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:01.200]  bromine chloride fluoride and again this is so critical they know this the government put it
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:08.080]  starting in the 20s in the salt a crappy form because gorder was so problem lower iqs iqs went
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:14.560]  up 15 points according to the u.s government uh burt defects went way down china has added it as well
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.760]  but what's crazy is explain this to people because i want to sell them x2 and y it's the best and
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.720]  and when you look at it it is true iodine they test it they said it's just pure iodine well
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:29.920]  everybody else are these other types that aren't as absorbable why is it different you don't want
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:34.400]  to go to the store and get iodine drink it can make you sick how is it different with the x2
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:40.000]  from the deep breath crystals how is it pure so the body can absorb it because as you said it's
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.240]  this expectorant in the body you don't just die without it so they're lowering the level all the
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:49.520]  time everything what they say is allowable or what you supposedly want your your rda i mean this is
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:56.400]  so massive just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin c i would say it's even more critical
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:01.680]  because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body the reproductive tissue the ovaries
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:07.200]  the breast tissue and women the prostate gland fertility is king for fertility but any all your
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.880]  glands are what really your pituitary gland which gets calcified with fluoride the parathyroid the
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:19.760]  pancreas the gi tract actually the whole gi tract is a gland that needs iodine because the gi
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:26.160]  tract produces serotonin and all these things iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:31.360]  everybody needs and they they claim that 70 to 80 percent of the world's population is deficient
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:38.720]  in iodine uh-huh but what they're testing is do you have enough barely a tiny amount of iodine
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:46.000]  in your body and what prevents you from getting a goiter is 150 micrograms a day which is the rda
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:53.920]  is that the safe level uh that's barely anything right there so when you look at all of the tissue
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:54:00.000]  in the body and all of the things that iodine deficiency affects it's always been one of my
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.640]  favorite substances and the difference between like what what you're talking about alex is people
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.320]  going to the drugstore and seeing the povidine or the iodine in there that is iodine which has been
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:15.280]  bonded to something it's been processed it's not healthy as a matter of fact iodine coming out of
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:21.520]  the ground in the mineral form is toxic so what we have to do is we have to take first of all and
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:30.880]  process that into a very very very fine 99.999 percent iodine crystal form which by the way is
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:36.080]  illegal so we have to go through the dea certification on that because iodine in that form is used to
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:44.480]  make methamphetamine but we take that and we make what we wrap that around this process that we
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:50.480]  developed it took us a long time to develop i1 it's called nascent iodine and we wrap the
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.960]  glycerin molecule around that so it's easily absorbable and the study you're saying fine that
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:59.280]  then it absorbs better into the blood into the body all i know is i started taking it i started
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:04.080]  taking it like five years ago uh when you were just developing it and i mean i'd already was
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.720]  exercising really hard and not losing weight it made me lose like an extra 30 pounds i know
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.320]  still have a little bit of weight i'm a husky guy but i was at 280 you know went down to lowest
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.360]  about 230 have worked out as much back to about 240 but when i religiously take the iodine you
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:21.200]  name it my kids don't get sick when i give it to them as much they're more healthy people say why
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.160]  are your kids so radiant why are they so healthy because they have to have it especially in development
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:31.200]  especially as you said girls for all the different parts of their body it's insane and look how much
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:36.240]  worse uh the thyroid problems are for women and then you have the studies about thyroid
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:41.280]  uh you know issues with women if you don't have enough iodine being even worse so listen
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:48.480]  this is a total win win win win win ladies and gentlemen that's why i feel very good saying hey
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:52.320]  here's a problem the media goes look jones comes in and tells you have iodine deficiency and then
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:59.360]  he shows you the cyanide that's exactly what i'm saying is is that you have to have this to live

[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:19.600]  bombard us with the six or seven bad halogens that our body will use if it doesn't have iodine and
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:26.240]  you look at how they keep lowering the rda and just just the devastation the sickness the weakness
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:32.640]  the infertility the polyps and the ovaries just the issues with women the breast cancer and you've
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.840]  got all the studies all the documents absolutely we sell the very best iodine from our research
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:43.120]  and absolutely it helps fund warning more people about all of this if you don't want to get our
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:47.760]  really high quality stuff go out check it out find out the right sea salts some of the right other
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:54.160]  salts that do have the elemental iodine in there the problem is it binds up to things it's very
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:59.520]  iodine's purple blue folks it's not red and in groups iodine turns blue the stuff in the store
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:05.120]  turns red okay and again that's because the stuff he gets is so pure he has a special lab the dea
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.760]  has a license for it's inside a vault because this stuff you put it on the ground it eats through it
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.920]  like alien blood blows smoke like i dream of genie comes up i mean it's true i mean we have video
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:22.080]  we probably show people we have in there of of of the x2 and you told me you said when i you said
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:25.120]  you're gonna detox about two to three weeks you're gonna feel really crappy for a couple days and
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.800]  you're probably have a bunch of stuff come out of your skin and all this other stuff man i broke
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:34.560]  out about three weeks into it had oil coming out my scalp uh had some really bizarre bowel movements
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.880]  i mean i was be honest with you and then it was like when you're carrying your kid on your shoulder
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.440]  up a big hill and you get to take them off like you're flying all the sudden it was like boom
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:48.480]  started losing weight all this energy i guess the iodine was sucking garbage out tell folks more
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:54.960]  about it well that just goes to show you that the iodine is going to whenever everybody's different
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:58.960]  so depending on who you are and what kind of problems you have if you look at all the health
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:04.240]  supplements on info wars life dot com and you read the reviews you'll find the most broad spectrum
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:10.960]  reviews on the survival shield x2 because it works on so many different things talking about
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:14.800]  pregnant women being deficient the national institute of health just came out with an
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:21.360]  article the other day saying iodine deficiency may reduce pregnancy chances so now all the things
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:26.400]  that we've been saying for the last 10 years are actually coming out on the mainstream as far as
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:32.880]  pregnancy mental retardation they knew that pregnant women need twice as much iodine than
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:39.440]  non-pregnant women so they should be supplementing iodine for pregnant women most they are tracing
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:46.800]  back autism mental retardation mental problems nervous system problems heart problems glandular
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:51.520]  problems with iodine deficiency and you're only going to see more and more and more these things
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:58.160]  come out in the future that's why it's my number one product that i take and the number one product
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:03.760]  i think pretty much everybody out there should take i touched on it a little bit earlier with
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:09.840]  what's going on with fukushima with all of the nuclear reactors breaking down that has been
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:14.960]  an area that you can type in and you can do some research on that's not being talked about in the
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:21.280]  mainstream media but there are literally clouds of radioactive iodine 131 over different parts of
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:26.880]  russia they're handing out potassium my wife couldn't exactly my wife couldn't get pregnant we wanted
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:31.360]  a baby until i just said she's like oh i'm healthy i see if you don't need this and i said listen
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:36.320]  start taking it two months later pregnant when we try for like a year i mean it's a boom i mean
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.360]  it's it's incredible when people are deficient it's just how that it's the things it does so
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:49.680]  in one thing that's really popular with the iodine is how it brings back your memory and your focus
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:54.640]  because as you're in your it gets me high i'm like why do i this is better than a cup of coffee
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:58.800]  i'm like why do i a lot of days i forget to take it and you can't take too much you need to talk to
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.160]  your physician right there's a dose we have on there's a decent dose but you might want to
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.920]  try a little bit lower at first yeah you want it because of the detoxification i mean you're
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:10.320]  going to be pulling out chemicals and and possibly heavy metals and other things like that so what
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.640]  you do bind to it because it was like well the first thing it does so uh because i hadn't like
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:18.080]  had you know oil and stuff since i was like a teenager and it was like coming out everywhere
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:24.080]  so all those toxins especially the other toxic hallowed halides the fluoride bromine and chlorine
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.720]  those all get sucked in because the body can't tell the difference between those and and iodine so
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:34.000]  those get sucked into your glandular tissue so when you start taking iodine then the iodine
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.360]  starts going into those this is almost like stp stp fuel cleaner you know you put the old carburetor
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:43.600]  it's actually the good one you like let's say you're putting toxic fuel cleaner in there for
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:48.160]  years and years and breaking everything down and altering the body's biochemistry now you're
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:54.240]  putting the clean it's like dirty water versus clean water we'll be back this is so key stay with us

[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:42.640]  been trying for years going back five years ago to come out with an iodine that was palatable and
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:48.160]  not toxic like they put out in the stores but since we've been promoting true nascent atomic iodine
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:51.760]  suddenly you see it everywhere it's being added to supplements but it's not really the high quality
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:56.640]  iodine which again i want competitors i just want you to know we've been trailblazing with
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.520]  dr. group and others to where now you didn't used to go to the store and see coital silver you used
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.840]  to go to the store and see iodine it's there because the listeners and others have taken action
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:10.160]  and people have discovered it but we're not the ones that discovered it this is national
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:16.480]  institutes of health now you type in iodine deficiency women pregnancy losing their babies
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:24.160]  and so watch out real quick so we can see our guests thanks uh and they don't tell you this
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:28.960]  it's all government stuff and bs up top but then all the government's real info is buried by google
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:37.200]  now iodine deficiency may reduce pregnancy chances nih study suggests fallout from nuclear
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:42.240]  button tweak jumps and sales of radiation drug what is even the right kind on and on and on so
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:49.440]  this is right here that birth defects low iqs not being able to get pregnant iodine iodine iodine
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:54.960]  just one area and they will not tell i mean the government does the studies and admits it okay
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.240]  fluoride brain damages you harvard says you take it out of the water they won't do it so
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:05.920]  welcome back wanted to just set the table with that x2 fund the operation fund the info we're
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:09.760]  kind of doing a drive to that erase money the operation get something you need if you haven't
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:15.280]  taken the iodine you're crazy info or store.com thank you all for your support but uh i'm ranting
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:20.560]  you can get at its regular price or get it 40 off when you get it with secret 12 our high
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:26.240]  quality methylcobalamin vitamin b12 and info or store.com so mike i'm gonna let you guys really go
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:32.240]  here uh coming up or i'm gonna do my old interrupt and take over but i'm just get excited by realizing
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:37.440]  we have the answers and we don't even crow about it enough this is how we're gonna break the global
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:41.440]  is back so good to have you back it's great to be back alex you bet it's been a few years i really
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:46.640]  appreciate the invite uh just just to establish a little bit of background so yeah my lab has
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:52.480]  been running now four years where iso accredited which is a two-year audit process where a mainstream
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:57.520]  lab of one of the science papers that i'm a co-author of was the top or one of the top red
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:02.480]  papers last year in a journal called lcgc is about chromatography we have three mass spec
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:08.720]  instruments i've got three scientists and chemists at the lab and we require everybody in my lab to
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:15.200]  be proficient in firearms to work there so we have we are actually a pro second amendment science lab
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:20.080]  which i think we're the only one in america like that by the way but we do a really good science
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:25.440]  we publish papers we publish posters they're they're featured everywhere and we can now analyze
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.680]  anything almost anything whether it's food environmental samples nutritional supplements
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:35.600]  we can we can identify unknown molecules using mass spec instrumentation so we can look at heavy
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:39.920]  metals or we can look at pesticides or we can certify products to be the lack have a lack of
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:45.600]  pesticides and the big news of what we're seeing now alex is that you know how the mainstream media
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:51.200]  is infecting people's minds with all this hate all this bad information you know the cnn they've
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:55.120]  become journal terrorists they're just infiltrating people's minds you know with with false information
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:02.160]  that would not be possible unless people were also being poisoned and kept nutritionally deficient
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:08.160]  so what you just mentioned is right exactly on track it's the deficiency it's the poisoning of the
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.640]  food supply maybe we can talk about the biosludge thing it's the poisoning of the vaccines which
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.840]  they're pushing very heavily right now because of the whole flu push combined with the information
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:23.200]  war of the mainstream media it's a binary weapons system alex that's what's being pushed by the
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:28.960]  mainstream wow mike adams again a few years ago said listen i built the lab i got to get to this
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:33.600]  i got to get to this full time i'm cutting back on interviews but i'll be back and bam back and

[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:29.520]  well the health ranger is back and he's on fire with dr edward group this is a live global
[02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:33.760]  transmission uh gentleman i'm going to turn things over to you because i know with your
[02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:38.080]  spectrometers and analysis you're also looking into the vaccines which have governmental
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:41.760]  protection which they say when you try to study them i know they threaten to sue you saying don't
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:47.040]  look at what's in them but sorry you found the mutagens show top one of the top labs in the
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:52.080]  country that all these scientists are working there highly respected four years in you know
[02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:56.880]  in the making but up in running a few years we're gonna do that next segment but but right now
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:01.680]  let's continue just into whatever you want to get into first uh your biosludge documentary this is
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:07.760]  huge well yeah okay so biosludge it's it's the greatest cover-up this is the mass poisoning
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:12.640]  of our country now biosludge what is it it's human sewage it's the collection of all the
[02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:17.760]  pollutants from a city it's all the industrial race waste that gets flushed down the toilet
[02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:23.360]  everything goes into this raw sewage situation they take that raw sewage every city does this
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:28.720]  including austin where we are and they dump it in the countryside this is cities polluting the
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:34.640]  countryside with toxins that are outrageous and i've got the cities are literally crapping on
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:39.760]  the country folks absolutely literally doing that and it's i i've completed all the primary
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:44.800]  photography and interviews with all the experts former epa scientists who blew the whistle
[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:50.320]  and who were fired we've got a film coming out there's no revenue in it it's at biosludge.com
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:53.920]  it's going to be released for free we've got all the scientists blowing the whistle on this you
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:57.440]  know what's crazy though people put stuff up for free and we do it too and then they don't appreciate
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:02.720]  it maybe you say you're putting it out free for a week or something or because you know this needs
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:07.360]  to be celebrated when we need funding you know well you know we've got funding sources like you do
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:12.400]  product lines and so on but this is something that we feel this is urgent for america no no i
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:16.240]  totally agree i mean i mean you should put it out for free it just it sometimes though it doesn't
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:20.800]  all like it doesn't have the same pizzazz if it's if it's free i don't understand it no i know but
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:26.960]  but look there's a bioterrorism aspect to this too it's not just the chemicals it's not just the
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:32.960]  heavy metals the ron also it's the virus and the frogs you look you combine all of the feces and
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:39.280]  all the viral strains and all the bacteria of an entire city you put it into a a pile and you dump
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:43.440]  it out in the countryside the birds get into it and they spread the viruses you know why we're
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:48.480]  having so many weird diseases yeah eye-bleeding disease now happening spreading it's an epidemic
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:53.600]  across america it's because there is this mass poisoning it was approved by the clinton administration
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:58.960]  epa back in the 1990s i remember they're like hawaii bio sludge when i first heard about it
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:03.680]  they make it in hawaii it's sewage putting the sewage next to hawaii all the chemicals all the
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:09.040]  toxins all the stuff you dump down the drain yep all the gasoline all the runoff all of the
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:14.080]  particulate and then as you said they admit over a hundred million people got sv 40 and ended up
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:19.440]  dying from that cancer virus they admit they're not even cooking this sludge these viruses and
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:24.880]  that's right and suspended animation and they say that they estimate hundreds of millions of indians
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:30.640]  in india have died from it and almost the entire population is infected with one cancer virus alone
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:37.200]  sv the the the environmental movement is a political joke because they talk about global warming
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:41.520]  and climate change things that are scientific hoax they won't talk about the actual environmental
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:45.360]  crime the greatest environmental crime of our time which is bio sludge being spread
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:51.440]  on our countryside on our farms is being used in areas where we grow corn we grow fruits uh
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:56.640]  in washington state in oregon and their argument is to be clear you're the expert the argument is
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:01.760]  a grip jump anytime or this is important they go hey we everybody's always used dung but that's
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:07.440]  from cows that ate the grass that's natural you don't take the everything out of the city
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:13.040]  and then go spray it on people's crops that it's the bio accumulation mutating the fish well they're
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:18.000]  actually selling it back to you too right yes we're making the soil out of it it goes it's it's
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.960]  called recycling but you're what you're doing is you're concentrating toxins back into the food
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:28.640]  supply and we talked about the multiple vectors oh so just like whales it bio accumulates from the
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:34.000]  from the krill up to the larger fish and then it bio accumulates the whales oh my gosh either
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.960]  over and over again putting the toxins on the food feeding it again to super bio accumulating
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:44.320]  there's even more alex one of the main chemicals that's used in agriculture today is called atrazine
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.600]  it is called in the scientific literature a chemical castrator this is the gender bender
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:53.360]  you've talked about it and you were attacked i believe for talking about atrazine but you
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:58.000]  were right on atrazine and these other chemicals they go back into the food supply back into the
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:04.640]  water supply and they feminize men across america this is a scientific fact it's not debatable by
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:09.920]  anyone who is actually informed about science oh even pbs did a study and said the gay frogs are real
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:15.840]  why does it it makes a lot of them hemaphrodites others to form but generally it makes them act
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:21.200]  female and then the males try to have sex with each other and then leave the females alone so it
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:27.280]  why does it particularly do that well there's the hormone sensitivity it is it kicks in at parts
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:32.480]  per trillion concentrations of a contaminant so where a lot of health effects require maybe
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:36.320]  much higher concentrations of exposure such as heavy metals at parts per million
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:40.720]  which is a million times higher than parts per trillion by the way but hormone systems
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.800]  are sensitive at parts per trillion so it takes a very tiny amount alex of atrazine or glyphosate
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:51.120]  or another chemical right right yeah endocrine disrupting chemicals disrupts you know why you
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:55.840]  guys are so important on this the trailblaze talking about this for decades and help me
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:00.160]  understand it that is what you look at cobear or the other shows or mainstream news that attacks me
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.160]  every attack is about oh he claims are put up in the food and water to make you feminine and then
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:10.000]  you read their own documents the white house science are under obama they admitted the plan
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.280]  when he wrote the book of the 70s eco science so we're attacking their main plan it's all in the
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:21.680]  scientific literature alex we we are now publishing science.news by the way which is just all the
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:25.600]  scientific literature that supports exactly what we're talking about they try to say that
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:31.680]  this is not science it's all over the literature we have a whole team that harvests 20 science
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:37.520]  stories a day and we cover this the gender bender chemicals are real the mass feminization across
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:44.400]  america is real you know this is happening right now and it's it's irrefutable i run a mass spec lab
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:49.120]  we are experts in pesticide analysis and detection with a major global food company come to us and
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:53.760]  want us to validate a new food contamination method development that's we are well known
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.800]  now in in the food contamination industry i wrote that book food forensics you know we
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:04.000]  it was the number one best seller on on amazon we are experts in food contamination i can tell you
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:11.600]  that what you said is true the food is a a vector a weapon that's being used against masculinity
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.600]  against fertility you mentioned that in last segment the infertility the depopulation
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:20.800]  what's the headline here for this to get to people like emergency warning uh you know uh
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:26.880]  scientific journals confirm plan to uh sterilize you i mean how do you how do you get through to
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:31.440]  people this is happening but the problem is that so so much of the population has been
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:36.240]  chemically softened up the brains have been carpet bombed by think about it things that we're
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:40.560]  talking about all even if you don't take prozac and ridland and the thousands of drugs it all goes
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:46.400]  into the sludge is put on the crops yes eat it again yes heavy metals good god the the water
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:50.560]  treatment centers in the cities don't remove these chemicals and you know that california
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:55.120]  regulations they get waivers on everything of course of course and this bio sludge is dumped
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:59.040]  in forests where it runs off into the rivers which is used in the water supply for the city
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:03.360]  downstream and then they wonder why just the last decade i guess it's the sludge since the clinton's
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:07.360]  they say we don't know we've made the industry a lot cleaner in the big factories but suddenly
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:12.400]  the contamination the fish and frogs and stuff's worse than ever yeah yep and there are thousands
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:17.200]  of contaminants and the epa only requires testing for four possible contaminants i think only two
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.040]  viral strains there are thousands of viral strings well wait a second isn't the epa supposed to
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:26.480]  protect us the environmental pollution agency let's explain they've proven just a search engine
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:34.960]  in major studies sp 40 is in every major sewage system of the world it's one virus guaranteed
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:39.120]  that's killed hundreds of millions of people globally and then no one even knows that most
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:45.600]  cancers viral the bio sludge industry is doing to america what a bioterrorist could never hope
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:49.760]  to accomplish they're doing what hitler could never have dreamed of by stealth we'll be back

[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:14.880]  all right alex jones here with the health ranger mike adams and of course dr griffin you're
[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:19.360]  saying such bombshell stuff and i'm jumping in interrupting which is okay but i'm gonna
[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:24.000]  actually put the camera on you guys for this segment and let you guys host to just get more
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:29.520]  into this more into what you discovered in the vaccines again how they give it protection they
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:36.000]  allow them to put whatever they want into it what was your big lab cwclabs.com you've discovered
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.040]  and then also a plug for iodine we have great x2 it's the missing link we believe it's the best
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:46.560]  iodine out there and it's very absorbable and has done amazing things it's just one of the
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:51.920]  missing links we've got footage here again at one of your labs when we just put it into a
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:57.840]  peaker dish heated up to 100 degrees and it turns into a purple gas it's it's it's amazing and that's
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:06.080]  what's in the x2 40 off at infowarslife.com when you get it with secret 12 that's the new special
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:12.480]  and listen we sold out of a lot of our products and now it could be weeks or months till they all
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:16.800]  come back in it's going to be months till they all come back in but even though x2 and secret 12
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:23.520]  are very close to selling out we're doing 40 until it sells out because i want to incentivize you to
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:29.760]  try x2 and to try secret 12 and just to see what pure good things for mother nature can do for you
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:35.680]  they're 40 off together as a combo infowarslife.com and you're funding an operation that's having
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:41.200]  great effects and is under attack you know if an organization is good by their deeds and their
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:45.520]  track record and if they're under attack by the bad guys and we are under unbelievable assault
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:49.520]  we're not whining we thank you for your hopes your prayers spreading the links the articles
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:53.280]  and if i could say alex uh this nutrition is not just about protecting your body
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:57.520]  or your reproductive organs in the case of iodine it's about protecting your mind
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:03.920]  literally the gang with the spirit you know they they have people intoxicated in in the classic
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:09.120]  definition they the the status quo the poisoning of the food supply the poisoning through vaccines
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:14.560]  they have people intoxicated you need to be detoxicated in in essence if i can twist those
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:20.480]  words like that what it means is you have to have nutrition that occupies all the receptor sites
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:26.400]  in your endocrine system in your neurology so that these toxins don't have as much opportunity
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:31.920]  to interact with your brain cells and your immune system cells and your gut cells and so on right
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:35.840]  yeah yeah and i wanted to bring up another thing mike and i know you've been studying this very
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:41.520]  closely but if you look at the news it's not being widespread reported but we have a massive
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:47.600]  flu epidemic going on right now in the united states hospitals are becoming packed full and it
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:53.280]  just everybody in the office that took it got it it just so happens that if you look at the swine
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:59.120]  flu you know you always have to ask yourself why all of a sudden is this year this big huge epidemic
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:05.760]  with the flu not only are they doing hexavalent flu vaccines where they're putting six who knows
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:10.720]  what virus is in there and if anyone goes online they'll realize real fast that it's impossible to
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:15.200]  do an influence influenza vaccine because it replicates differently every time but but let's
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:19.360]  hit your body with six different ones at once yeah that's the equivalent of six vaccines right but it
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:26.960]  just so happens we have billions billions of boxes of tamaflu stored from the swine flu that
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:31.600]  they have to get rid of right that they've paid for so what's your take on on all the stuff that's
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:36.320]  happening that's what you found the vaccines the vaccine narrative that's pushed out there is quack
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:41.840]  pseudoscience they know that their viral strains are wrong they're not hit the target they say then
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:47.440]  that even if it's the wrong strain it will help reduce the severity of your flu symptoms total
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:54.560]  nonsense no scientific citations whatsoever the cdc fabricates its flu deaths by the way to promote
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:00.880]  vaccines it's all nonsense the truth is that you could take some simple nutrients vitamin c
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:05.840]  vitamin d think that boost your immune by the way i don't want so much i don't want to knock on
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:12.080]  wood but since i've been taking x2 and the other products from forest life dot com literally i can't
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:17.920]  remember the last time i i've had a fever in like four or five six years this is insane yeah it just
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:23.760]  so happens that all the doctors are prescribing tamaflu yeah i look i haven't had the flu in 15
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:28.960]  20 years never get a vaccine shot never get the flu you're probably in the same boat right same
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:34.560]  how do we do that well you activate your body's natural immune response the canadian study admitted
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.720]  you take the flu shot it doubles your chances of getting the flu next season because it lowers
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:44.400]  immunity yes even worse than that a cdc funded study recently admitted that flu shots caused
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:50.560]  spontaneous abortions in women and now what are they pushing flu shots on to pregnant women 20
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:54.640]  years ago in medical school they said never give flu shots to pregnant women now it's part of the
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:38:00.400]  narrative alice is part of the infertility push it's the depopulation push think about it they can
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:05.360]  they can inject you with toxic mercury and abort your baby at the same time and you don't even need
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:11.040]  a trip down to planned parenthood and then here's the thing we're not just saying this is true we're
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:15.840]  not just saying it until seven years ago it was on the insert don't give a pregnant woman the shot
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:23.360]  they removed it off the insert uh skyrockets the uh amount of miscarriages they admitted it's admitted
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.680]  it's a cdc funded study and it's they're killing the babies in front of you they are they are
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:32.880]  murdering your baby forced abortion just like china but here they do it by stealth in fact in fact
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:39.840]  here's the headline hospitals involved in caught hospitals caught carrying out stealth abortion
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:46.880]  of women or medical clinics caught carrying out stealth abortions using flu vaccines cdc study
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.920]  and you know the vaccine industry laments the fact that they cannot get african americans to take
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.480]  more vaccines this is a big obstacle to them they want more black folks taking vaccines they love
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:02.720]  the black folks remember tuskegee they remember the nih funded medical experiments on black folks
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:06.320]  they remember what happens if you trust the government to inject your body with something
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:11.520]  that's a mystery cocktail but everybody knows you get sick when you take them that's already been
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:16.160]  i mean our own military has been used as test subjects for years and years you were in the
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:20.560]  military everyone i know it was in the military said we remember people died in the unit taking
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:24.640]  women were people's kids in the unit died you know the government nurseries taking it people in
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:29.600]  this building have lost children i mean this is incredible so we we now have this is bombshell
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:33.920]  stuff alex we've got a mass spec instrument called the time of flight mass spec instrument we are
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:39.360]  accredited in our laboratory we are now running vaccines and we can determine the molecular formulas
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.560]  of all unknown molecules in those vaccines using state-of-the-art mainstream science that instrument
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:50.080]  alone is like 400 000 just for that instrument we are going to open source publish the molecular
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:56.240]  formulas of everything that we find in common vaccines and it is going to break the wall
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:40:01.360]  of pseudoscience of the vaccine industry that's coming out soon so is this basically a real time
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:07.280]  laser scan of molecular structures a revolution in being able to identify things quicker well
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.560]  similar to the cresp system and gene sequencing no this is not a laser based system this is a
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:17.520]  liquid chromatography mass spec time of flight system so it uses liquid first and then it uses
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.880]  an actual vacuum flight tube to boost molecules through a flight path and the timing of how
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:26.720]  long it takes for them to go through that flight path determines the accurate mass of the molecule
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:30.560]  oh that gives you the reading on it didn't we know there's no lasers involved there's no lasers in
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:35.120]  this case there are other laser instruments but ours is a as a mass spec time of flight instrument
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:41.360]  the bottom line is we can reverse engineer for the first time we're the only lab in america
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:45.600]  willing to do this because other labs are government funded so you're going to go in and find out what
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:51.280]  they're really creating what's in there absolutely that's why we're armed and i'm gonna let you guys
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:54.640]  go to the next time i'm gonna leave hold on i'm gonna leave the room next time because i won't
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:58.080]  be able to shut up i want you to really take the floor and get into this in-depth start over go
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:02.720]  through it all but here's the bottom line they've admitted with the h1n1 what was it six seven years
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:07.760]  ago the next year they said oh we put a simulant in vaccines that was basically that a simulant to
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:12.880]  track viruses so they admit they're experimenting and i know they threatened you and others saying
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:17.520]  don't go in that's our trademark or that's our patent don't look at what we're putting in there
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:21.840]  right and we've got government protection saying we can hurt you that's crazy they're saying don't
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:25.600]  look at what's in this yeah and they don't they don't tell you the real ingredients that are in
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:30.480]  there but what they admit to as you know ed they admit there's msg in vaccines there's squalene
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:35.520]  which is a inflammation causing substance there's mercury there's aluminum we know these and there's
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:41.680]  also aborted human fetal tissue by the way it's listed by the c the cdc in their vaccine information
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:45.520]  aborted human fetal tissue you know why it's critical because they need that from what i've read
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:50.000]  that's what they use as a as a viral carrier with these different classes of viruses that we know
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:56.320]  are harm related where they embed in your tissues and then don't bloom uh until you hit 50 or 60 years
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:42:01.280]  old when they want to get rid of you then the viral cancer activates you know you know the baby
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:06.000]  body parts scandal of plant permanent they take the baby body parts this is real this is sick but
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:11.520]  it's real they grow the the baby body part tissue in vats to create human tissue they use
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:17.120]  baby parts because they grow more quickly they infect them and let them fester with toxic diseases
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:22.480]  very dangerous diseases like smallpox and others and then they take that and they grind it up they
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.080]  filter it out they put it in a bottle and they inject it into you that is so satanic that's
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:31.440]  that's exactly what they do and this is the vaccine industry it is recycling human babies
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:36.240]  and mostly black babies which no wonder the black community doesn't want to be injected with stuff
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:43.440]  they don't want their own babies ground up and then meanwhile though all the black leaders like
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:48.560]  maxine water is only the white guy next year he's the devil meanwhile the true satanism is taking
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:52.960]  place you're coming back mike adams is hosting next segment i'm gonna go watch in the controller

[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:31.840]  man i gotta say the return of the health ranger is amazing and he's show on target mike adams
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:37.760]  natural news dot com cwclabs dot com and so much more and you know he's been attacked with whisper
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:44.160]  campaigns and disinformation and and and ops and and things we've learned about now from the major
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:48.240]  intel we've gotten i've gotten from the trump administration you name it because we're really
[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:52.080]  trying to restore the republic here and we're rolling up the clinton's network and their people
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:56.480]  and it's really really bad but anyways you guys have before this segment the next go ahead and
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:48:00.160]  host uh take over speaking about the trump administration just real quick before we get
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:05.760]  into this ad i offered to take over the epa's nationwide testing of the entire us water supply
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:11.120]  for heavy metals to do it for one dollar a year so that scott pruitt could fire half the epa
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:17.840]  who are quack science traders to america no wonder so many of them finally quit but the epa is a
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:23.200]  junk science organization we can do the testing for all the water samples nationwide here in texas
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:27.680]  and i'll do it for a dollar a dollar alex all they gotta do is get us the samples we'll do the testing
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:32.960]  but that's really where government needs to go i mean look at trump giving his money back when
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:37.760]  you have so many people that would just volunteer that actually care about the the united states and
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:41.840]  care about the world and care about the environment i mean you could literally gut the government i
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:47.040]  would volunteer my own time i mean we're working our butts off for years and years and years trying
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:51.680]  to get this information out there and trying to create change because that's our passion that's
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:56.480]  what we want to do yeah i mean you don't need to pay people in the government a lot of times
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:01.440]  you can just have people that really care about taking care of these things and cleaning up the
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:05.440]  world and cleaning up the environment everything where the government spends money on science they
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:11.120]  cover it up they get results and they hide them why isn't the fda releasing results about contaminated
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:15.120]  foods that they find because they spot check everybody you know you've been tested i've been
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:20.080]  my operation has been tested all clean but they find stuff that's dirty why don't they tell the
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:24.160]  public about it why doesn't the epa tell the truth about the radiation in the water supply
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:27.600]  or the chemicals in the water supply by the way tell them how much that's gone up on average
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:32.400]  well i don't have the latest numbers but they even have like cbs news locally test the water and
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:37.520]  they go it's huge 300 times this and 200 that i mean it's there was a there was a report about
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:43.360]  a year ago that came out in uh you probably know about this mic in somewhere in europe they said
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:48.640]  a gallon of water contained the equivalent of one prozac and that's another thing right now you
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:53.360]  know i'll talk about all this mental disorders and they're doing mandatory mental screening on
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:59.920]  children they're diagnosing two-year-olds with bipolar disorder that most of the antidepressants
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:07.680]  of the anti anxieties and all these uh antisocial anti mental medications are based in florida and
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:14.320]  that goes back to bio sludge when you look at the amount of stuff that's flushed down a toilet i mean
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:19.600]  how toxic is people's poo these days yeah well see this is the whole look at that line the government
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:25.040]  allows 250 chest x-rays a year to be in your water unreal that equivalent but you remember i want you
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.240]  to get into the vaccines to what you're finding on them yeah well the big news on vaccines is that
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:34.720]  we're reverse engineering them will have results you know in a few weeks or a few months depending
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:39.120]  on how many vaccines we test you're telling off air you're finding insane stuff yeah i'm not ready
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:43.280]  to go public with everything that we're finding yet but we have the technology we are an independent
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:47.680]  science laboratory we are accredited we have our own funding we don't get any money not a dime from
[02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:54.240]  government no university nothing and we're doing great science you know we we are a mainstream
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:58.240]  recognized laboratory at this point we're probably one of the few independent science labs that's
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:02.080]  willing to tell the truth about this just like independent media right this is independent
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:06.960]  media willing to tell the truth where cnn is lying well what about independent laboratories
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:12.720]  that's where my focus is you know they say i've heard rumors that they might be putting nanoparticles
[02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:19.280]  in vaccinations that they can use with the 5g with the that are uh activated with electromagnetic
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:25.040]  frequencies would you be able to see we can identify anything like we can identify molecules
[02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:31.840]  between the range of 100 to 1700 dalton's so as long as it is a molecule made of the table of elements
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:36.800]  we can see it you know carbon hydrogen oxygen you name it mercury led we can find it we can
[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:41.200]  reverse engineer it and we're going to list all these results publicly and let let the public
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:45.360]  crowdsource what is this stuff because we don't know the names of those molecules we don't know
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:50.000]  the chemical names we just know the chemical formulas that's what this instrument allows us
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:54.560]  to do but listen to this okay so all of these people that have the flu out there right now
[02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:58.800]  that are suffering from the flu and that have taken the vaccines and that haven't taken the
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:04.400]  vaccines that have just caught it they're all running to the doctor's office and flooding
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:10.240]  the hospitals and they're getting put on tamaflu what is your what what is your reaction to that
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:16.160]  or your response to that considering the fact that usc uh about a few months ago came out with a
[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:24.640]  study saying three days of water only fasting actually regenerates the immune system and
[02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:30.720]  produces immune stale cells which means i mean mike and i have been in the natural market for
[02:52:30.720 --> 02:52:37.120]  years and years and years in the healthcare i don't i've never come across anything that you can take
[02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:42.240]  that within 72 hours you're going to regenerate your entire immune system and produce immune stem
[02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:48.080]  cells no you need to actually challenge your immune system by exposing yourself to the real
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:53.360]  flu at some point but with the nutritional support that's how your body builds antibodies
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:57.840]  that are powerful and strong think about it a vaccine is trying to get your body to make
[02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:01.840]  what you might call artificial antibodies or not quite as strong antibodies because it's
[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:06.560]  a weakened viral strain right the virus in the vaccine is usually weakened sometimes it's live
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:10.960]  that's why sometimes people get the flu from the flu shot but usually it's weakened they do that with
[02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:16.640]  ultraviolet light by the way it's called a denatured viral strain or RNA fragments now
[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:22.240]  your body is going to have a better response to an actual infection in fact you will usually be
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:27.600]  asymptomatic you won't even have symptoms of the flu your body builds antibodies naturally like if
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:32.080]  i test your blood and my blood right now we've all got antibodies to every flu strain for the
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:39.440]  past 10 years but we never got the flu right yeah so what proof what is the root cause of our bodies
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:44.400]  not being able to produce antibodies right the immune system is in the gut so you have the
[02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:49.920]  attack on the gut and then you have the amount of stress people are under with all the negative
[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:57.120]  influence from the immune media so all of these things are just suppressing the ability to produce
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:03.920]  naturally the antibodies needed but how do you produce an antibody to a hexavalent vaccine that's
[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:09.360]  injected into you well your body has to do six times the word right so i've seen doctors say
[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:13.200]  they have a patient come in who's sick right now with the flu and the doctor will say oh you need
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:18.720]  a flu shot right now that is quack medicine it takes time for your body to build antibodies
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:24.400]  even if you think the vaccine works getting a vaccine while you're sick is such quackery those
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:28.880]  doctors should have their medical licenses stripped they have no idea what they're talking about
[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:34.960]  even if you think the vaccine works well actually the proper way that the body develops antibodies
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:40.960]  is not from being injected right from breathing in natural exposure natural exposure through the
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:45.360]  skin the mucus membranes and stuff like that but here's the other thing you know as much as 25%
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:52.160]  of your DNA exists for you to fight off pathogens you have a blueprint for survival against bacteria
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:58.080]  fungi as well as viral strains but you can't activate all that DNA unless you've got the
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:02.880]  right nutrition right so that's where foods and superfoods and the right nutrients and extracts
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:07.600]  and everything comes into place the right minerals if you don't have all of that this perfect blueprint
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:12.880]  that you have for health can't function you can't even you can't fight off the flu if you're
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:18.320]  nutritionally suppressed and then they add the stress of fake news cnn and they add the stress
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:22.560]  of all that hatred hatred by the way if you're walking around seething with hatred you're
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:26.880]  immunosuppressed absolutely and that's what the left is today where's the where's the outbreak
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:30.720]  the worst right now california they're setting up tents and war zones and everything that's
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:35.520]  right in the hospitals people are walking in sick sick as they've ever been they're all stressed
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:40.960]  out and they're sick and they're malnourished the answers are just nutrition we we've been saying
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:46.000]  that for a long time is just cleansing the body and everybody has a self healing mechanism this is

[03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:29.440]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind i like that intro it's so intense but
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:34.480]  we got bigger battles to fight now but we're learning we can change things and a lot of people
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:39.760]  are waking up so very very powerful last hour and mike i'm really glad that you're seeing now
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:43.680]  you're starting more interviews again and that you'll uh you know uh do live in the area some of
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:49.280]  the time so you'll be able to pop by and be part of the whole info wars team uh as you somebody
[03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:54.080]  contributing here and i'm just so glad that dr group got us back in touch you've got so focused
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:59.360]  for years though on those labs so it's good to have you back we're rolling out a lab certification
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:03.040]  program for products you know you might might be interested in that we talk about it later but
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:08.160]  we want to help independent media certify their products are clean as a form of self-defense
[03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:12.160]  because you know you've been falsely accused uh ed's been falsely accused we've all been falsely
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:17.280]  accused there are a lot of fraudulent labs out there that are not accredited we can fight against
[03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:21.520]  them with our accreditation and our certified results so that's a lot of my fault well that's
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:25.760]  the thing buzzfeed bought a bunch of our products tested them said they were what they were and were
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:31.600]  clean and they hated it and and then we have we have labs test all our stuff and then of course
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:36.000]  they say if they like leave the top open in one of the cans for 10 minutes that then we won't pass
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:40.560]  california standards and then oh you didn't pass we're suing you and it's a democrat party group i
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:44.640]  mean and meanwhile they're pushing the psychiatric drugs for your six month old infant you know
[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:48.800]  they're they're poisoning you know your kids and they're they're they're attacking nutrition
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.920]  the kids need nutrition you know so you know our focus is science at this point you know i'm not
[03:01:53.920 --> 03:01:57.360]  i'm probably not going to be like a political guess for you but a but a science guess sorry my
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:02:02.240]  earpiece keeps popping out here but you know science is our focus and we are accredited
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:06.000]  and we tell the truth no and i think that's great and i've been totally focused on the
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:12.080]  nationalism the return of sovereignty when i used to be maybe that 30% and i was trying to wake
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:16.000]  folks up to their topics i intend i'm just probably trying to defend trump because i know he's not
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:20.880]  perfect but he's real the global is hating and now it's not we're over the hump yet but i now
[03:02:20.880 --> 03:02:26.720]  think that we can start shifting it you know back into education just about all the other systems
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:33.840]  well i've i've never seen this country with such a seething demonic left-wing cult is what it has
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:40.640]  become we've seen it come out it is insane we're talking unhinged deranged it's the cult of him
[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:45.200]  running a violent it's unreal man i've i've never seen this you know i haven't been on your show for
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:49.920]  four years during that time you know we both supported trump for president you know we both
[03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:54.400]  tried to defend the republic this whole time you know we both try to get people good nutrition
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:59.760]  so that they can be awakened aware it's not even just about you know being healthy it's about awakening
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:05.200]  your consciousness so you can even take in the truth if you don't have iodine or vitamin c you
[03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:11.760]  will die and they're lowering it and everything on purpose and bombing you with a bad halogen
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:16.480]  it's slowly and then you'll be on uh well first of all before you die they have to put you on
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:21.600]  pharmaceuticals and then one leads to another one which leads to another one which leads to another
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:26.160]  one so it's a slow death process they want to take as much money they want you to die broke
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:29.920]  they want to take all the money from you because money is power and those of us that aren't like
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:35.360]  that don't get the demonic force and the energy of people that are vampiric because they hate
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:40.560]  themselves so much they want to hurt you and you can't understand why they want to turn you
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:45.920]  against each other why they want us like the race garbage and they literally are demons the most
[03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:52.880]  dangerous thing now is this idea that words that they don't like are weapons against them justifying
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:57.440]  their physical violence against you know conservative speakers you know like milo or
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:04:01.200]  and cult or or you or whoever you know they're calling for death threats against everybody
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:05.520]  they don't like because of their words this is a very dangerous precedent and actually you know
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:09.440]  i said i wasn't going to talk about politics that much but historically this is a run-up this
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:15.200]  narrative is a run-up to a a true actual communist attempt kind of like the cultural revolution
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:19.360]  oh this is the exact formula takeover of an authoritarian takeover it is that first they
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:23.840]  start the narrative they demonize people who defend the country they demonize the family
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:28.720]  they create infertility to get rid of those they tear down the old institutions yes yes
[03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:35.120]  the institutions instead of us not getting them back to constitution i want to come back and do
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:39.120]  a few more minutes here and introduce anthony cumia on the other side who hosts the fourth hour we
[03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:43.440]  appreciate the great work he does is compound media i wanted to ask you guys one more question
[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:48.880]  when we return everybody this is life and death it really is that's why you've got to spread the
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:57.040]  live links and tell folks what the local affiliates introducing cell force by info wars life cell
[03:04:57.040 --> 03:05:02.960]  force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection mitochondria produce over 95 percent
[03:05:02.960 --> 03:05:08.640]  of your energy they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your cellular
[03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:14.080]  energy production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because when
[03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:19.040]  your mitochondria don't run at 100 percent efficiency then they start producing reactive
[03:05:19.040 --> 03:05:25.840]  oxygen species top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting
[03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:32.400]  from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful
[03:05:32.400 --> 03:05:37.840]  available on the market the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these
[03:05:37.840 --> 03:05:45.360]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force from info
[03:05:45.360 --> 03:06:07.280]  wars life head to info wars life dot com or call 1-888-253-3139 live from the info wars
[03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:27.200]  dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow
[03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:32.960]  ladies and gentlemen ansity kumia of compound media dot com is going to take over right now i
[03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:38.240]  wanted to uh you have a final question into doctor group and of course the health ranger mike adams
[03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:45.040]  we know nationalism's back populism the family we know we're under attack all over the world uh
[03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:50.240]  from african countries latin american countries to europe to you name it to people are understanding
[03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:55.520]  this global system is not free market it's authoritarian soros admits today that's up on
[03:06:55.520 --> 03:07:00.960]  info wars dot com e you on the verge of breakdown because it's unelected but we're just discovering
[03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:06.800]  there's a big global secret group but what's their religion what's their program well it's eugenics
[03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:12.640]  it's technocracy it's total control of what we eat where we sleep what we do and so i was asking you
[03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:18.880]  in closing uh mike adams to just recap where we are and then what the next level is and how we stop
[03:07:18.880 --> 03:07:23.440]  them what they're targeting and you said rural communities i'm in the middle of a big city i'm
[03:07:23.440 --> 03:07:27.760]  not judging you if you're the point is they admit that that's their plan and the doctor group said
[03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:33.680]  agenda 21 well the bio sludge issue is the mass poisoning of the countryside it's taking all the
[03:07:33.680 --> 03:07:38.880]  pollution of cities concentrating at every heavy metal every viral strain every bacterial strain
[03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:43.600]  and dumping it on the countryside that's that's what bio sludge is all about uh we've got this
[03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:47.680]  documentary it's coming up later this year you can look at the preview at bio sludge dot com
[03:07:47.680 --> 03:07:52.960]  it's going to be a free film but this is just one vector of many it's also the medicine vector
[03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:58.880]  it's the food vector it is also the psychic warfare if you will of of the mainstream media
[03:07:58.880 --> 03:08:01.760]  so they're attacking your mind while they're attacking your body and they're attacking your
[03:08:01.760 --> 03:08:07.200]  reproductive organs so that is really genocide and they are even their speech now is targeting
[03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:12.640]  specifically christians targeting specifically white people you know it's it's genocidal or
[03:08:12.640 --> 03:08:17.120]  targeting male it's literally beyond what the soviets said when they were killing 20 million
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:22.720]  christians it in ukraine and poland and russia and the thing is we're sitting here it's all
[03:08:22.720 --> 03:08:27.840]  and they're completely insane but it's being directed by universities by big banks they don't
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:31.280]  like christians even if you're not a christian because they're not being controlled by them
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:37.760]  they don't like families because they're they're they're a unit they're not a cult and it's insane
[03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:43.840]  to see this happening dr group no i agree and what's insane is when you look at the in the grand
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:49.200]  scheme of things and you look at the children and what's going on with the children with the common
[03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:56.880]  core uh with the massive amounts of vaccinations with the mental health screenings i i i all of that
[03:08:56.880 --> 03:09:02.240]  is going on with us it's but take that times a hundred and look at what's happening to the
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:08.080]  children the attack on the children right now that is scary the good news is though parents
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:13.760]  are waking up people are waking up they are self-destructing they are coming out with more
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:19.280]  fake news the globalists are running scared right now there's all kinds of indictments there's
[03:09:19.280 --> 03:09:24.400]  whistleblowers coming out you got q anon out there whoever that is talking about stuff

[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:40.480]  devastated them yet again that the new york times said trump will never get us above three percent
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:47.120]  growth rate that's now blown up in their face i mean everything they do turns to crap so they turn
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:52.800]  the bs up to 11 that doesn't work they turn it up to 22 then to 33 now they're up to 10 000 it's not
[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:58.400]  working i'm just wondering where this is going next time uh what's happening because i know you
[03:10:58.400 --> 03:11:02.560]  didn't used to call yourself probably a conservative either or die i'm a libertarian i'm well there's
[03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:07.280]  right wingers that have got problems but the left as he was saying earlier mike adams is like
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:16.240]  completely psychotic now and like a mix of stalin meets hitler meets pcp how crazy will this get
[03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:22.960]  in your gut level assumption uh just when you think maybe they're as crazy as they're gonna get
[03:11:22.960 --> 03:11:34.000]  they just plow forward and go even more nuts i am uh i i'm relishing it i am basking in watching
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:40.880]  them lose their minds first of all they've tried so hard to play trumps game he you won't find anyone
[03:11:40.880 --> 03:11:47.040]  better at this than uh donald trump and they're trying to use social media they're trying to be
[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:55.200]  funny at times uh they're trying to be provocative no one does that like donald trump can do it and
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:12:03.120]  he is just wiping the floor with uh the media these days and if he wasn't doing what he said he was
[03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:08.240]  going to do for this country it would be so easy for them to turn around and go well your jokes and
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:12.640]  your provocative language and everything but what are you doing for the country and then you look
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:19.280]  around and see these unbelievable uh unemployment levels that haven't been seen in in years the job
[03:12:19.280 --> 03:12:25.440]  levels uh i mean and record low black unemployment record unemployment for everybody right 26 000
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:30.080]  stock market and here's the deal the democrats and the globalists are running against prosperity
[03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:36.080]  running against freedom running against everything decent and just flipping out i mean who knew they
[03:12:36.080 --> 03:12:41.760]  were really this psychotic and this bad and but i guess globalists had to hire american haters to
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:46.960]  run the screw job and so they they really hate this country and have a hard on for it even though
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:51.520]  it's where their kids go to school and and and so they don't know what to do they've gone psychotic
[03:12:52.720 --> 03:13:01.120]  this is absolutely the era where the cover is ripped off of everything and it is because of
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:08.000]  donald trump being elected we've seen hollywood self-destruct that that glittering uh uh coating
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:14.640]  of glamour on hollywood has been torn off and we've seen the disgusting underbelly that's right
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:20.960]  take it down another four percent that's over 50 percent the last decade it's all exactly as america
[03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:27.280]  re-rises as as it all comes begins to come back all the enemies the fake nfl hollywood mainstream
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:32.000]  media they're all imploding why don't we see that paradox taking place because they could go along
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:37.280]  with the big win and be smart and try to sabotage it later no they want to beat it all now so right
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:42.400]  during its re-assurgence they want to try to kill it in the crib not getting they're destroying
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:51.680]  themselves they don't know when to quit they they absolutely don't and on a daily basis we see this
[03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:58.480]  on a day sometimes an hourly basis they trip over their own feet again they they eat each other
[03:13:58.480 --> 03:14:05.040]  they uh they realize that calling people racist sexist homophobes islamic doesn't work anymore
[03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:12.080]  so they're turning around to their own people now and uh because it only works on them their food and
[03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:17.760]  bs only works on them exactly yep so then they're self-destructing their own because they want power
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:22.560]  they gotta dominate and run somebody in the ground and bully somebody so it doesn't work on us so they
[03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:29.360]  turn on themselves we we we become empowered when we get called these things and and uh we don't
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:35.360]  turn around say hey don't say that we start up our own networks we go out and and uh you had

[03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:44.560]  jealous of you and got ready we all know it really happened and so you launch your own network they
[03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:49.200]  force us to innovate with their own bs we don't go crying in fact sometimes when i'm really tired
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:53.360]  on that energy they try to shut me down or screw me over then i suddenly have this incredible

[03:21:46.720 --> 03:21:52.640]  just start sounding like alex jones i don't know what it is i'm like i woke up this morning i got
[03:21:52.640 --> 03:22:00.480]  a cold and a sore throat and i can't speak uh but i'm i will plow through ladies and gentlemen um
[03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:08.240]  i have to get into this uh donald trump physical thing now we have watched presidents
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:14.400]  over the the entire course of presidency i guess the presidents have had doctors i'm sure george
[03:22:14.400 --> 03:22:20.720]  washington said ah my teeth hurt someone said well yank them out and stick some wood chips in there
[03:22:20.720 --> 03:22:26.400]  and uh you know from then on uh i i guess the presidents have had doctors and we've we've heard
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:31.840]  the news on their medical checkups sometimes they find a little thing well the president had
[03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:38.400]  to have something removed or uh i remember ronald reagan had a colon polyps or something it's always
[03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:45.520]  something you know they're human beings apparently and uh but but the news usually handles it it's
[03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:52.000]  very as a matter of fact it's uh it's one of those things that you don't even really pay attention
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:59.120]  to or didn't pay attention to until of course everything changed again with donald trump
[03:22:59.120 --> 03:23:07.120]  uh i have never in all my years of watching the news and watching our presidents over the
[03:23:07.120 --> 03:23:19.360]  course of the years seen a hysteria over a 100 good medical report on a president have you ever
[03:23:20.080 --> 03:23:26.720]  it's insanity so the the white house doctor uh with a bunch of medals
[03:23:26.720 --> 03:23:32.800]  uh i don't i don't know what they're all about hey he gave someone a colonoscopy colonoscoping
[03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:40.240]  give him the gold colon award there's there he is but it looks like a nice respectable guy
[03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:50.400]  uh so he does the examination uh on on our president donald trump and finds 100 healthy
[03:23:50.400 --> 03:23:57.520]  of course look again he's a human being he could lose some weight who can't uh he could exercise
[03:23:58.160 --> 03:24:04.080]  who shouldn't you know that these are such basic things remember when bubba when bubba clinton
[03:24:04.080 --> 03:24:09.680]  was in the white house and and uh he would he would walk down to the mcdonalds and and eat
[03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:16.000]  big macs and stuff it was it was cute and quaint then they're like oh look he's a regular guy
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:24.320]  he's a little dumpy uh he likes mcdonalds he's just bubba a regular guy well nowadays oh my god
[03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:34.480]  that apparently is a death sentence uh again 100 fine uh mentally uh physically and mentally
[03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:45.040]  he took a uh a test for a mental acuity and he scored 30 out of 30 i mean i guess that's the
[03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:50.800]  best you could score on that test which then leads the doctor to believe that no further mental
[03:24:50.800 --> 03:25:00.240]  testing is needed but but oh my god the media i have never seen a group of people so angry
[03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:07.840]  that a president of the united states got a clean bill of help they were hoping and i'm not i'm not
[03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:14.880]  going overboard with this they were literally hoping that something would come up that might uh uh
[03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:22.640]  trim down his term a few years or make it impossible for him to run for a second term if he
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:31.600]  you know gets through this one uh they started just lambasting this this doctor with the most insane
[03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:40.000]  questions that you'd never heard uh any other president get i don't think we saw this type
[03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:46.800]  of questioning when reagan was shot when ron reagan got shot i don't think the media was this
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:54.240]  frothing at the mouth insane to get uh questions out there but there's donald trump
[03:25:54.240 --> 03:26:02.000]  is doctor uh clean bill of health and we we got questions like and i love how this this uh exposed
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:11.680]  agenda driven left-wing media operates they want to link donald trump to certain key words
[03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:18.720]  that's what they do so they sit there it's his doctor giving his assessment of donald trump's
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:24.800]  physical and mental health and the people in the audience after hearing he's fine nothing wrong 100
[03:26:24.800 --> 03:26:33.840]  percent they put out words like dementia alzheimer's a cholesterol heart disease they throw it out
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:43.200]  there just to link it and i believe cnn just despicable we'll talk about how they uh topped
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:52.000]  some of the president's fake news awards you can't beat this guy uh and and they they threw out cnn
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:27:02.800]  said i think it was sanjay gupta asked uh the doctor uh about trump's uh heart health said houses
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:12.080]  a heart does he have heart disease and the the the doctor says no no and and they get on and start
[03:27:12.080 --> 03:27:19.840]  saying uh sanjay asks president about or asked doctor about president's heart disease he asked him
[03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:27.040]  about he asked him if he had any heart disease the doctor said no uh aside from you know his
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:35.920]  cholesterol which he takes drugs for i i can't imagine uh almost half the country uh over the age
[03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:44.080]  of of 45 doesn't have a cholesterol problem and i would say 90 percent i'm not even sure i'm just
[03:27:44.080 --> 03:27:49.120]  guessing but off the top of my head i would have to assume that 90 percent of people that are in
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:58.560]  their 70s might have some type of uh uh artery uh clogged in some way shape or form trump is
[03:27:58.560 --> 03:28:09.120]  71 years old he'll be 72 in june this is a dynamo to see a guy run around like he does
[03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:19.440]  uh it work the hours he works multitask and getting things done at his age is astounding
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:27.840]  this is the age uh a mere few years ago really when you think about it was uh you'd wait you
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:34.480]  were waiting to die this was every relative you went over to visit that was sitting on a chair in

[03:32:59.360 --> 03:33:26.880]  welcome welcome back anthony kumyan at info wars dot com and man i remember a time with the news
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:33.440]  and especially news about the president and again right up until the donald trump presidency and and
[03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:39.920]  probably even the trump candidacy when he uh declared he wanted to be president this whole
[03:33:39.920 --> 03:33:46.880]  thing started but before that remember these days remember there was there would be times
[03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:55.120]  that would actually stretch days sometimes even a week where you never even heard a story about
[03:33:55.120 --> 03:34:04.240]  the president he would go somewhere uh be doing things you wouldn't hear about uh a bill or or
[03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:10.160]  the fact that he's vacationing it was just one of those weeks where he was doing nothing just
[03:34:10.160 --> 03:34:16.480]  nothing and then a week would go by and you'd turn on the news and they'd be like uh the president
[03:34:16.480 --> 03:34:24.080]  returned from camp david today and you'd be like all right that guy the president uh and that was
[03:34:24.080 --> 03:34:31.280]  usually how the news covered the president when important things are going on he was uh rotated
[03:34:31.840 --> 03:34:37.520]  quite often in the news cycle but when nothing was really going on the president would disappear
[03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:43.840]  from the news for at least a few days and then the president was on the hill today talking with
[03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:51.600]  lawmakers about yeah the president that guy have you ever seen i haven't that's why i brought it up
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:35:01.040]  up a a news cycle that is so fixated on this president that it is i i i used to say daily a
[03:35:01.040 --> 03:35:11.120]  daily it is an hourly occurrence every hour uh the story will be um regurgitated or a new story
[03:35:11.120 --> 03:35:19.600]  comes up a new allegation a new trump said something i have never seen and they say that 90 at least
[03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:28.000]  93 percent maybe 98 percent uh as high as that of the coverage is negative negative coverage
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:38.160]  on this president but the sheer coverage alone is insane the the obsession that this media has with
[03:35:38.160 --> 03:35:45.120]  this president and not the the accomplishments we've heard about uh the accomplishments of late
[03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:52.240]  it's this president is doing an amazing job especially here at home america first that's
[03:35:52.240 --> 03:36:00.880]  what he promised and we're seeing an economy that is a robust uh momentum is building uh again the
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:10.880]  market tops another record breaks 26 000 yesterday and unemployment at record lows uh in some of
[03:36:10.880 --> 03:36:17.280]  the demographics a low that has never been seen since they've been keeping records african-american
[03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:27.040]  unemployment which has been a problem for decades in this country is at record lows and they cannot
[03:36:28.240 --> 03:36:34.800]  comment on it mainstream media cannot bring themselves to comment on this and i assure you
[03:36:34.800 --> 03:36:43.040]  if this was a barack obama we would be having this thrown in our face every day as to how amazing
[03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:52.080]  this president uh was doing but it's a guy they just don't like they don't like donald trump
[03:36:52.080 --> 03:37:00.640]  they don't like uh what they believe he stands for so many ists and isms and phobes that they
[03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:06.480]  throw behind uh this president and meanwhile they're they're missing the most important things
[03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:16.640]  more important than name calling or using a dirty word oh grab my pearls oh the important thing
[03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:25.760]  that people are going back to work that uh people are making money the tax cuts again i have never
[03:37:25.760 --> 03:37:33.120]  seen in my life something signed uh and and results coming out of it as quickly as i have
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:41.920]  with trump's tax plan uh we are seeing huge companies returning to the united states that
[03:37:41.920 --> 03:37:52.000]  repatriating money to the likes of 38 i believe it was 38 billion dollars that apple is bringing
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:59.600]  back to this country from foreign banks because the tax rate is lower they could afford to bring
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:09.440]  money back 20 000 new jobs coming back to the united states how is this 350 billion dollars
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:16.560]  apple announced repatriated 350 is that 38 what am i talking about 350 billion in the next uh us
[03:38:16.560 --> 03:38:23.840]  uh the economy over the next five years 38 billion on uh taxes right there there it was but it's
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:30.720]  it's insane that this isn't the news they jump out of their seats to ask trump's doctor if he
[03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:38.000]  wears dentures or if he's got a peanut allergy they can't get out of the seat quick enough excuse
[03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  me doctor i heard him mispronounce a word what's that all about and we have companies all over uh
[03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:56.560]  this country giving bonuses to employees uh incentives matching programs in their 401ks
[03:38:56.560 --> 03:39:06.880]  is all because of uh the the tax plan that uh trump signed and the media where's the media
[03:39:06.880 --> 03:39:17.440]  they're too busy saying that he used the s word the s word a crap hole will say here uh in Haiti
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:25.920]  and in other some countries in africa they're too busy saying that meanwhile uh the hypocrisy
[03:39:25.920 --> 03:39:31.760]  flows out of that one because uh you will you will never see one of these people set foot
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:37.600]  in one of the countries that donald trump has dubbed a a crap hole allegedly by the way dubbed
[03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:47.760]  a crap hole um but they they uh instead of the the real uh the the the real issue here
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:56.720]  that Haiti uh is indeed a festering uh wound on the face of the earth uh that that maybe they
[03:39:56.720 --> 03:40:03.200]  should address it no they'd rather call out the president for giving a pretty accurate description
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:10.320]  of um Haiti and then you have the clinton's who uh with their wonderful clinton foundation
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:18.240]  was supposed to uh contribute money and construction and help after the earthquake years ago
[03:40:18.800 --> 03:40:25.920]  and help rebuild Haiti well that money never made it to where it was supposed to go uh i don't know
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:33.120]  why that isn't uh under the scrutiny of the media it is under the scrutiny of info wars and compound
[03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:41.120]  media and some of the other uh more honest outlets out there but uh they won't address that the fact
[03:40:41.120 --> 03:40:49.040]  that chelsea clinton's wedding was financed through the clinton foundation uh they're a beautiful
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:57.760]  dress i'm sure was a lavish very expensive wedding uh you can literally take a picture of a a starving
[03:40:57.760 --> 03:41:05.360]  impoverished Haitian child and put it next to chelsea clinton in her wedding dress and that person
[03:41:06.160 --> 03:41:14.640]  absolutely took the food out of that child's mouth to give her a wedding to give her a wedding dress
[03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:27.360]  why isn't that why isn't that uh the news i don't know they'd rather talk about
[03:41:27.360 --> 03:41:34.800]  Trump's language and that he's obscene and that perhaps he uh enjoyed the company of women
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:42.880]  uh years ago uh yeah Haiti helped pay for your wedding uh she rebuked of course
[03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:50.560]  they all they've learned to lie they have learned to lie uh at a very young age the clinton's
[03:41:52.080 --> 03:41:57.520]  and uh man i can only imagine if if hillary was elected oh i hate i shudder at the thought
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:06.640]  imagine a reporter from a conservative news agency standing up and questioning her weight
[03:42:06.640 --> 03:42:14.240]  questioning her health asking about her sanity they wouldn't even question it when
[03:42:14.240 --> 03:42:21.120]  she was falling down on the ground and had to be lifted into a van during the campaign
[03:42:21.120 --> 03:42:30.160]  the media was silent never asking her uh about what happened why that happened to her how she
[03:42:30.160 --> 03:42:37.360]  feels her her coughing fits i mean if this happened to donald trump you would say he needed to be
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:46.560]  removed from office uh because uh he's not fit to serve yet they never said a thing uh unbelievable

[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:37.440]  da da da da da da hollywood remember when hollywood was glamorous remember i do i'm no kid i remember
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:47.440]  years ago it was glitter glamour it was called tinsel town uh it was an amazing place we had stars
[03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:54.960]  these were celebrities stars movie stars that were not accessible to mere mortals like us
[03:49:54.960 --> 03:50:04.560]  you didn't have access you you couldn't tell carry grant that his movie sucked you couldn't do that
[03:50:04.560 --> 03:50:14.320]  hey carry grant your movie sucks you couldn't do that he would just all day think everybody loves me
[03:50:14.320 --> 03:50:23.440]  i'm carry grant and i am amazing you'd have to write a letter dear carry grant your movie sucked
[03:50:23.440 --> 03:50:30.000]  get an envelope figure out where to even mail the damn thing to carry grant care of metro goldwood
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:36.320]  maya and he would never see it somebody would open his mail and go oh someone thinks carry
[03:50:36.320 --> 03:50:42.960]  grant sucks yeah we and why would we give that why would you give me this letter i don't suck i'm
[03:50:42.960 --> 03:50:53.520]  amazing but that was old school hollywood no accessibility the cover was on i there was just
[03:50:53.520 --> 03:51:02.560]  as much debaucheryous uh crap going on back then of course there was but it was kept under wraps i
[03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:10.880]  guess we didn't have access to it we uh we went to movies and it was an amazing new world and when
[03:51:10.880 --> 03:51:19.200]  we saw these celebrities on talk shows we we it was so special to see them in an element out of
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:30.320]  the movie actually being themselves now all we see all we see are their detached opinions on
[03:51:30.960 --> 03:51:39.520]  life and how we all should live it that is hollywood now the cover thank god has been ripped off
[03:51:39.520 --> 03:51:49.440]  and we have seen the disgusting putrid underbelly of what goes on in uh that uh that town tinsel
[03:51:49.440 --> 03:52:01.440]  town uh we've seen uh so much uh from the sexual harassment and actual physical abuse uh allegations
[03:52:01.440 --> 03:52:10.960]  that have come out of late and of course again the progressives the liberals the left democrats
[03:52:10.960 --> 03:52:18.240]  celebrity whatever you want to call it has again uh kicked them themselves uh in the ass on on this
[03:52:18.240 --> 03:52:25.360]  one they had some momentum going you had harvey weinstein which uh from the looks of it was an
[03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:35.840]  actual case of a man using his vast power and wielding it to get sex from women in exchange for
[03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:46.160]  careers uh we we had a few a few other people uh what's his face there where is he from uh
[03:52:46.160 --> 03:52:55.280]  uh yeah well we've had a few people that have uh lost their careers uh because of sexual allegations
[03:52:56.560 --> 03:53:06.000]  but then we have this aziz and sorry story come out i guess this woman her name is uh abbey nierman
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:13.920]  is that it she went anonymous for a while but uh screw that uh she doesn't deserve to have anonymity
[03:53:13.920 --> 03:53:20.720]  if she's going to come out and crucify someone i am anything but an aziz and sorry fan believe me
[03:53:21.680 --> 03:53:28.640]  when i have my little tiff with john steward at the uh comedy cellar aziz was sitting at the table
[03:53:29.280 --> 03:53:34.880]  at john's table waiting for him to come back talk about how cool it was that he was uh screaming
[03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:42.880]  and ready to fight with uh me the istin ism and and phobe that i am a bunch of beta men sitting
[03:53:42.880 --> 03:53:51.360]  in a corner shut up uh so so this abbey girl decides she's gonna document a date that she had with
[03:53:51.360 --> 03:53:58.720]  aziz and it sounds like just an awkward crappy date as it sounds like the guy was probably a
[03:53:58.720 --> 03:54:05.440]  little over zealous she was giving off signals that absolutely said that she wanted to have
[03:54:05.440 --> 03:54:11.920]  sexual relations with this gentleman they're nude in his apartment she's performing certain acts on
[03:54:11.920 --> 03:54:18.480]  him she's doing uh he's doing the same to her and uh then when the whole thing ends the next day
[03:54:18.480 --> 03:54:25.600]  she starts talking about uh how she felt odd didn't feel good about it it was awkward and
[03:54:25.600 --> 03:54:32.720]  troubling and she had to and this is it ask her friend she had to ask her friend if she was sexually
[03:54:32.720 --> 03:54:41.760]  abused i think you know i gotta be honest i think you know you don't have to ask your friend
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:50.640]  from all accounts her accounts by the way as put on babe.com uh again she was anonymous at the time
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:55:01.920]  it sounded like two people that had uh an agenda hers to get uh uh close to aziz a rich and famous
[03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:11.360]  comic uh and his which was to have sex with a girl he met at a club they both had things they wanted
[03:55:11.360 --> 03:55:18.560]  to come out of that evening uh he worked on what he wanted to work on and she by showing up at his
[03:55:18.560 --> 03:55:23.680]  apartment worked on what she wanted to work on getting to know him now he's another one of these
[03:55:23.680 --> 03:55:29.840]  like i said beta men who probably never was able to get a girl in his life until he got a lot of
[03:55:29.840 --> 03:55:36.720]  money and some fame and uh that awkwardness and lack of what we like to call game ladies
[03:55:36.720 --> 03:55:47.040]  was a glaring that evening i hear tell he put his fingers down her throat in a move that she called
[03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:57.600]  the claw the claw and um and then used her saliva for for things is what i hear look things happen
[03:55:57.600 --> 03:56:02.800]  on dates when you're being intimate and they don't need to be splashed out into the public like this
[03:56:02.800 --> 03:56:11.840]  but and and i believe he was uh he was dealt a disservice here by uh abby nyerman and uh
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:19.280]  babe dot com because uh this amounts to nothing but two people awkwardly pawing at each other
[03:56:20.400 --> 03:56:27.040]  in in an apartment and again i believe this will this will be looked at as the beginning
[03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:38.800]  of the end for me too me too which i have to give a comic oan benjamin a uh a credit for this one
[03:56:38.800 --> 03:56:42.960]  he goes hashtag me too he goes isn't that literally pound me too
[03:56:45.840 --> 03:56:54.480]  which is pretty damn funny um and times up i got my times up button on but again something
[03:56:54.480 --> 03:57:01.040]  that may have started out as a noble cause i don't think anybody can disagree that men
[03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:07.360]  wielding their power in exchange for sexual favors uh by women who would never consent to it
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:14.000]  and in exchange for money jobs roles in hollywood uh we all know that's bad but again they take it to
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:22.080]  the umpteenth level of ridiculousness and allow a woman to anonymously uh detail a horrible date
[03:57:22.080 --> 03:57:28.000]  with somebody who's obviously a little sexually awkward but that's hollywood
[03:57:30.160 --> 03:57:36.560]  um thank you alex jones for allowing me to spend some time here on info wars dot com
