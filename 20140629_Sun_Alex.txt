[00:00:10.327 --> 00:00:18.744]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:27.379]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, June 29th, 2014.
[00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:27.959]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:29.320]  I'll be your host today.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:51.258]  Alex is going to be joining us with two brand new special reports because what we see happening at the border is just not only amazing hypocrisy when you look at what's happening at the border versus what's happening at the airports, for example, or what's happening within that 100-mile border that they've said is Constitution-free around the perimeter of the United States.
[00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:57.369]  Alex has a report on that as well as the planned collapse of our economy.
[00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.310]  Now, of course, Petraeus has talked about this.
[00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.112]  Nancy Pelosi went to the border this last weekend, just yesterday.
[00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:13.036]  She was at the border talking about how they're going to essentially incorporate people in and how this is not a crisis, this is an opportunity.
[00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:14.437]  Well, yes, of course.
[00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:18.159]  Rahm Emanuel has always said, every crisis is an opportunity.
[00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.122]  If you're some kind of a Machiavellian control freak, like they are, they always use every crisis.
[00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:26.403]  They manufacture these crises.
[00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:29.005]  And we know that they are manufacturing this crisis.
[00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:34.308]  This is something that the Border Patrol Union officials that have talked to us, as well as
[00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:37.849]  And mainly it's Border Patrol Union officials who talk to us.
[00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:44.771]  The typical employees are being intimidated and gagged by threats from the government to not talk about this.
[00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:49.893]  But let's look at just one example of the hypocrisy that we see coming out of these people.
[00:01:50.473 --> 00:01:55.776]  New York is going to provide free legal aid IDs to undocumented immigrants.
[00:01:55.776 --> 00:02:00.339]  Now, of course, undocumented immigrants is what they call illegal aliens.
[00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:03.561]  They're not just undocumented, and they're not just immigrants.
[00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:04.902]  They're here from another country.
[00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:05.503]  They're aliens.
[00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:08.484]  That's always the legal term that has applied.
[00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:09.385]  They're not immigrants.
[00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:12.567]  Immigrants implies that they're coming here to live permanently.
[00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.648]  An alien says they haven't been given permission.
[00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:17.050]  And, of course, that's what illegal says about it as well.
[00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.451]  But this is what New York is going to do.
[00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:23.413]  And this is really about gerrymandering and buying votes.
[00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:25.574]  I mean, this is gerrymandering on steroids.
[00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:28.095]  You can't get the voters that you want in sufficient quantity.
[00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:32.857]  Just import them into New York or into Texas or into California.
[00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:35.178]  And that's what the New York City Council is going to do.
[00:02:35.178 --> 00:02:45.163]  They've earmarked $4.9 million of the city budget to give legal assistance to foreign-born New York residents facing deportation.
[00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:51.610]  The city will provide that aid for, again, their favorite term, undocumented immigrants.
[00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.212]  Now, this is what they're going to give them.
[00:02:53.212 --> 00:03:02.403]  They're going to give any quote-unquote resident the documentation needed to open a bank account, to sign a lease, or to get a library card.
[00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.456]  They're also, I'm sure, going to give them driver's licenses, voting IDs, because that's the entire point of it.
[00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:15.280]  This is just the city of New York, setting aside $5 million.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.484]  And of course, whereas this is reported, Christian Science Monitor and elsewhere, they're saying,
[00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:20.985]  This is just wonderful.
[00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:25.089]  This is going to give legal assistance to these people who desperately need it.
[00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.611]  Because why do they need legal assistance?
[00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:27.972]  Because they're here illegally.
[00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:29.774]  They're breaking the laws when they come in.
[00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:37.562]  But then, of course, when Boehner talks about suing Obama over executive action, Nancy Pelosi calls that subterfuge.
[00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:40.164]  It's not subterfuge to help people violate the law.
[00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:46.995]  To help create a voting bloc that they couldn't otherwise get by just convincing people.
[00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:52.838]  So they want to create a permanent underclass, a welfare state, collapse the economy as well as collapsing the border.
[00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:55.859]  This is about making NAFTA a fact.
[00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:58.967]  NAFTA has been the law for 20 years.
[00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:03.132]  That's what David Petraeus said in London last week.
[00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:04.073]  We played that for you.
[00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:09.139]  He said, of course, NAFTA's been around for 20 years and now we see this unification.
[00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.842]  Because what comes, and what he said was, what comes after America?
[00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:14.016]  North America.
[00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:15.858]  And he was talking about NAFTA.
[00:04:15.858 --> 00:04:25.028]  So they look at this, and for 20 years they've had, in their opinion, a legal unification of Mexico, America, and Canada.
[00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:27.811]  Now they want to make that actually a fact.
[00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:30.053]  So they're just bringing these people in.
[00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:35.657]  As Nancy Pelosi said yesterday, what we have is a community with a border in the middle of it.
[00:04:35.657 --> 00:04:38.660]  Okay, well actually I would say that's a former border.
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.561]  It's not really a border.
[00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:41.963]  So there's a couple of different things going on here.
[00:04:41.963 --> 00:04:47.407]  We need to look at how they're going to roll out their secretive plans.
[00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:50.830]  And I think this gives us a lot of insight into both that and their hypocrisy.
[00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.213]  We're going to have reports from Alex Jones and from our reporters at the border.
[00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:54.674]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.832]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:05:02.832 --> 00:05:07.195]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:05:07.195 --> 00:05:10.858]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:13.900]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.165]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:25.369]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:29.794]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:35.780]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.704]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:42.467]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.808]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:05:43.948 --> 00:05:45.309]  It's time to take action.
[00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:47.130]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:24.719]  There is a war.
[00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.600]  It's happening now.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.962]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:06:28.962 --> 00:06:31.523]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:33.444]  We are the resistance.
[00:06:33.444 --> 00:06:35.145]  We are the Infowar.
[00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:42.461]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, June 29th, 2014.
[00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:55.411]  As we were just saying in the last segment, the hypocrisy of Nancy Pelosi going to the border in Texas and saying that what we have here is a community that just happens to have a border running through it.
[00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:58.033]  No, it's a former border that's running through it.
[00:06:58.664 --> 00:06:58.784]  We're
[00:07:28.644 --> 00:07:33.505]  Bringing anything into the country that they wish, they have a very different standard.
[00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:36.045]  We're supposed to respect them with all authority.
[00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:38.466]  But of course, this is about setting up NAFTA.
[00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:40.546]  And we're going to look at the hypocrisy of what's going on.
[00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:53.769]  Just consider that just last week, Obama announced that he's going to send half a billion dollars in aid to Syria to foment revolution there, to foment disruption in that country.
[00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:55.749]  At the same time, is he doing anything
[00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:59.032]  At all for these border towns and Texas.
[00:07:59.032 --> 00:08:02.816]  Now, John Bowne was down there and he has this report.
[00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:17.470]  We are here at the county seat of Falfurrias, Texas, a small town whose success is largely due to the developer and pioneer Edward Cunningham Lassiter, who in 1893 owned one of the largest ranches in Texas at 350,000 acres.
[00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:36.238]  As the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway expanded south to his ranch in 1904, Lasseter founded Falfurias, an Apache word meaning the land of heart's delight, possibly due to the sweet butter creamery Lasseter developed in 1909.
[00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:42.281]  Or perhaps it refers to filfarias, Mexican slang for dirty and untidy.
[00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:46.102]  One thing is for certain, both meanings apply here.
[00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:57.387]  As the county and local ranchers struggle to bankroll, defend their lives, and bury the bodies of the rising tide of illegals crossing their land every day.
[00:08:57.387 --> 00:09:00.008]  It was the loss of oil and gas revenue.
[00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:17.927]  Compounded by the amount that we spend, and that figure is dealing with autopsies, it's dealing with wearing care of the vehicles, the sheriff's department, the JP's, the magistrates, the death certificates, all the paperwork that's entailed, getting out to these areas that are very, very remote.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:25.982]  I personally have been taken to pronounce a body when the sheriff officer with me says, oh, there went the transmission.
[00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.423]  And we had to call a wrecker to come get us.
[00:09:27.423 --> 00:09:28.443]  Thank God for Border Patrol.
[00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:31.684]  They were able to take us to where the immigrant was.
[00:09:31.684 --> 00:09:34.625]  And a lot of these immigrants are dying of dehydration.
[00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:35.825]  Is that the main cause?
[00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.246]  We refer to them as the elements.
[00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:42.167]  You know, it's compounded by the 100 plus weather.
[00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:46.669]  As far as the immigrants from other parts of the world, can you speak on that at all?
[00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:50.232]  What your experience, what you've seen from say China, India, Russia possibly?
[00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.173]  We have reports from the Sheriff's Department.
[00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:15.301]  They can confirm that they've apprehended people from over there and they've also found people.
[00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:19.887]  But the Sheriff's Department is very aware that they are here and they're coming in.
[00:10:20.618 --> 00:10:26.800]  Has violence increased in the past few years as a result of the aggressive increase in immigrants?
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.600]  Yes, definitely.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:35.343]  Matter of fact, I just got a report a couple of days ago of a local rancher that they broke into his ranch.
[00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:47.246]  And we are getting more and more reports of either agents that are being accosted or deputies that are finding resistance from these individuals.
[00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.046]  They're young.
[00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:49.287]  They're 30 and under.
[00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:51.228]  A lot of them.
[00:10:51.228 --> 00:10:54.010]  Year to date right now, I believe we have 33.
[00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.692]  And we're about to go into July and August.
[00:10:56.692 --> 00:11:00.114]  If you're familiar with Brooks County, we've got 944 square miles.
[00:11:00.114 --> 00:11:02.396]  And it's very, very rough terrain.
[00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:07.500]  And of course, being from South Texas, anybody that knows about rattlesnakes, we've got some big ones.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.904]  And it's very, very difficult because the antivenom is out of Corpus Christi.
[00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:18.648]  And that means that we'd have to get a helicopter down here and try to get them within that golden hour so we could save their body.
[00:11:19.088 --> 00:11:21.573]  Wow, the cost of that must be staggering.
[00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:22.395]  Of course.
[00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:24.639]  Well, that incurs on the county.
[00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:28.848]  And that's why all these expenses, you know, we don't budget for.
[00:11:28.848 --> 00:11:30.872]  And we've had to, and the law says we have to pay for them.
[00:11:31.343 --> 00:11:33.945]  And have you asked for grants from the federal government?
[00:11:33.945 --> 00:11:36.106]  We've gotten nothing from the federal government.
[00:11:36.106 --> 00:11:42.689]  Governor Perry's office last year stepped up to the plate and they helped us with $150,000 this year.
[00:11:42.689 --> 00:11:45.991]  We were in Austin, Texas this week and they're going to help us with another $150,000.
[00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:50.013]  That's to defray a lot of the costs that the Sheriff's Department has.
[00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:53.155]  There was a boom time with the gas and oil and the creamery.
[00:11:53.155 --> 00:11:56.417]  In 2007 when I took office, our taxable value was $1,000,000. $1,000,093,000.
[00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:03.061]  Last year was 541 million.
[00:12:03.061 --> 00:12:06.403]  We've lost more than 60% of our oil and gas.
[00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:10.425]  So that makes, you know, and we live by oil and gas.
[00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:14.888]  In 1959, we were the only one in South Texas that had an all-concrete stadium.
[00:12:14.888 --> 00:12:16.809]  We had four dealerships and we had a hospital.
[00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:28.516]  Are you aware of the administration of Obama, how they're professing to the Central American countries that if you come across the border and proclaim that you're a dreamer,
[00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:36.040]  Especially these younger kids that are coming across, that you will receive amnesty.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.483]  I think that you can't make the rules just to apply them.
[00:12:39.483 --> 00:12:41.845]  If you're going to be fair, let's be fair to everybody.
[00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:50.092]  If you're going to allow people to come in, you should have standards, you should have a program in play that would allow them to enter the country legally.
[00:12:50.982 --> 00:12:52.083]  Not illegally.
[00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:56.446]  Are you aware of the exploding swine flu now in San Antonio and this area?
[00:12:56.446 --> 00:13:00.209]  What's your Health and Human Services doing to take care of that?
[00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:01.150]  Well, we've been there before.
[00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.754]  A couple of years ago the H1N1 was here and we were prepared.
[00:13:05.754 --> 00:13:11.598]  We've got a wonderful medical center in the valley that keeps us abreast and we always take a proactive approach.
[00:13:11.598 --> 00:13:17.223]  We've got a lot of illegal activity by human smuggling and we've got, it is a problem.
[00:13:17.843 --> 00:13:22.125]  The problem that we've got to contain is that we just don't want people dying in our county.
[00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:25.387]  And so we're trying to do everything humanly possible to stop it.
[00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:31.730]  We've got a good friend of mine that goes out and puts water stations at the ranches so at least they can have water.
[00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.752]  How effective has the Border Patrol and Homeland Security been in your county?
[00:13:36.412 --> 00:13:38.993]  We have a wonderful presence of Border Patrol.
[00:13:38.993 --> 00:13:41.433]  They do a great job of drug apprehension.
[00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:44.494]  You know, that's what they're Brook County's number one in the nation for.
[00:13:44.494 --> 00:13:49.115]  The only bad part about it, we're not a border county, so we don't qualify for any federal assistance.
[00:13:49.115 --> 00:14:04.119]  And so I've made the scenario many times, including to the governor's office on Tuesday, that if you've got a scenario where Border Patrol agents are following somebody and they get bit by a rattlesnake, they'll take him to the hospital, they'll put agents there to monitor him, they'll foot the bill.
[00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:07.383]  But an immigrant dies, Carl Brooks County.
[00:14:07.383 --> 00:14:08.423]  Right.
[00:14:08.423 --> 00:14:23.033]  We were just in Brownsville and McAllen last week, and we discovered that the Border Patrol was paying via credit card for illegals that had come in, mainly women with children, babies.
[00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:25.975]  McAllen, Texas is tapping their resources.
[00:14:25.975 --> 00:14:30.718]  But it's taking effect on their money, on their budget, because you don't budget for stuff like that.
[00:14:30.718 --> 00:14:33.580]  I mean, you can budget some, but at some point,
[00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:39.282]  You didn't foresee the amount of immigrants coming over.
[00:14:39.282 --> 00:14:45.003]  Yeah, and they're paying for bus tickets, they're generating power for them, they're putting up tents, they're feeding them.
[00:14:45.003 --> 00:14:48.704]  Wouldn't you say that's exploitation at a high level?
[00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:49.605]  I mean, that's crazy.
[00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:52.305]  If I did something like that, they'd want to put me in jail.
[00:14:52.305 --> 00:14:53.405]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:53.405 --> 00:14:55.966]  It's amazing what the federal government's getting away with.
[00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:57.608]  My God.
[00:14:57.608 --> 00:15:04.453]  Well, you've enlightened me to a lot of things that, you know, for the last week, I've been inundated with the mass graves.
[00:15:04.453 --> 00:15:09.697]  And so I kind of now got to get back to and focus on everything else.
[00:15:09.697 --> 00:15:12.339]  But it's going to get crazy before it gets better.
[00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:13.420]  It's going to be crazy.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:25.129]  I'm sure glad you landed here and let everybody know what's going on in Brooks County, because, you know, my heart goes out to this to McAllen and the County of Hidalgo, because, you know, they've got a lot on their plate.
[00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:32.360]  We've had it, like I said, for 65 months, and we wouldn't want to be stealing anybody else's.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:43.563]  And now from that amazing interview with Judge Ramirez here in Brooks County, Texas, we take you to the mass dumping ground here at the Sacred Heart Burial Park.
[00:15:43.563 --> 00:15:44.223]  Who's next?
[00:15:44.223 --> 00:15:51.665]  What town is next to take the brunt of the illegal activity being spread by the federal government in the United States?
[00:15:51.665 --> 00:15:52.305]  Is it your town?
[00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:58.805]  From Fowl Furious, Texas, I'm John Bowne for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:04.911]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:08.253]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:10.354]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:16:10.354 --> 00:16:12.515]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:16:12.515 --> 00:16:14.156]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:17.498]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:16:17.498 --> 00:16:19.078]  If so, consider this.
[00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:27.983]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:34.753]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:16:34.753 --> 00:16:36.796]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:44.447]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:54.153]  Live Life Healthy!
[00:17:00.023 --> 00:17:06.185]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:10.747]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:17:10.747 --> 00:17:15.309]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:17:15.729 --> 00:17:18.650]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:24.093]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:17:24.093 --> 00:17:31.476]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:35.617]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:40.720]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.580]  This is innovating.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:49.190]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.615]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:18:00.285 --> 00:18:02.567]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:18:02.567 --> 00:18:09.991]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:20.819]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:30.065]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:18:30.785 --> 00:18:34.847]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:38.629]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:18:38.629 --> 00:18:40.670]  Experience the new formula.
[00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.231]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.572]  Shield your family.
[00:18:44.572 --> 00:18:46.413]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:18:58.587 --> 00:19:05.751]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:08.093]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:19:08.093 --> 00:19:13.376]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:19:13.376 --> 00:19:18.339]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:21.861]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:25.924]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:19:25.924 --> 00:19:30.266]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:19:30.266 --> 00:19:40.492]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:43.014]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:19:43.154 --> 00:19:43.855]  Coast to coast.
[00:19:43.855 --> 00:19:44.895]  Direct from Austin.
[00:19:44.895 --> 00:19:47.297]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:17.940]  Big Brother.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.721]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:20.721 --> 00:20:23.262]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:23.262 --> 00:20:25.243]  You want answers?
[00:20:25.243 --> 00:20:27.144]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:27.144 --> 00:20:33.466]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:37.335 --> 00:20:38.916]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:38.916 --> 00:20:41.196]  I'm David Knight on this Sunday, June 29, 2014.
[00:20:41.196 --> 00:20:44.398]  Now, that's the last segment.
[00:20:44.398 --> 00:20:54.762]  You heard that report from our reporters at the border, John Bowne, reporting on what's happening to the small Texas border towns, how they're being bankrupted, how they're being endangered.
[00:20:54.762 --> 00:21:03.345]  And of course, do they get any assistance from the federal government that has basically stood down on the border, that has allowed the borders to collapse?
[00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:03.465]  No.
[00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:10.846]  At the same time, our federal government is sending a half a billion dollars to create war in Syria.
[00:21:10.846 --> 00:21:16.807]  They're not doing anything to alleviate the suffering of these small Texas towns, many of them largely Hispanic.
[00:21:16.807 --> 00:21:19.668]  This isn't about Hispanics versus Anglos or anything like that.
[00:21:19.668 --> 00:21:29.829]  This is about helping Americans who are here legally, who have paid taxes, who have a tradition, a political and legal tradition that they want to maintain.
[00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:31.210]  It's about taking that down.
[00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.370]  It's about collapsing that.
[00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:38.312]  Whenever they want to take our rights and our freedoms, they always use the children.
[00:21:38.312 --> 00:21:44.634]  They always say that it's for the children, and of course they're holding the children up now as if that's what this were about.
[00:21:44.634 --> 00:21:52.977]  We know from the border agents that they said they're using the children as a front, as a decoy, so the drug cartels can do whatever they wish.
[00:21:52.977 --> 00:21:58.699]  And we should understand, even if we're not at the border, to have that kind of insight that the border patrol agents do.
[00:21:59.379 --> 00:22:09.985]  We should be able to understand and look at this cognitive dissonance at the way they treat people in the airports and the way they're treating people at the borders.
[00:22:09.985 --> 00:22:17.229]  Look at the police state inside of America and look at the total stand down at the borders and ask yourself, why is that happening?
[00:22:17.629 --> 00:22:21.852]  Alex Jones has a special report on that, a new report on that, coming up in the next segment.
[00:22:21.852 --> 00:22:26.575]  But we sent some other reporters down yesterday to see what Nancy Pelosi is doing.
[00:22:26.575 --> 00:22:40.243]  And of course, to put this in perspective, now this is the National Review, and for the longest time, many who are conservatives have bought into the war on drugs as something that was necessary to do.
[00:22:40.243 --> 00:22:42.244]  But here's a quote from this National Review article.
[00:22:42.244 --> 00:22:45.186]  They said, historians looking back at this period in America's development
[00:22:45.586 --> 00:22:57.416]  Well, consider it to be profoundly odd that at the exact moment when violent crime hit a 50-year low, the nation's police departments begin to gear up as if the country were expecting an invasion.
[00:22:57.416 --> 00:22:59.498]  Yeah, somebody's expecting an invasion.
[00:22:59.498 --> 00:23:05.863]  It's Homeland Security that's gearing everybody up, and it's Homeland Security that is standing down the borders.
[00:23:05.863 --> 00:23:09.867]  And as they've said back in Rex 84 and Operation Garden Plot,
[00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:13.172]  When are we going to have martial law?
[00:23:13.172 --> 00:23:14.372]  When is that going to be necessary?
[00:23:14.372 --> 00:23:17.394]  Oh, well, it might happen if the borders were to collapse.
[00:23:17.394 --> 00:23:19.034]  Why are the borders collapsing?
[00:23:19.034 --> 00:23:21.155]  This is not a crisis.
[00:23:21.155 --> 00:23:23.956]  This is an implementation of NAFTA.
[00:23:23.956 --> 00:23:29.258]  And they say we have to wonder why this is happening in 124 homes every day or more.
[00:23:32.219 --> 00:23:33.500]  Likely, every night.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:43.126]  And this is talking about SWAT teams and the raids that are going on as we see our country being totally militarized by the federal government.
[00:23:43.126 --> 00:23:50.111]  Now, to look at the hypocrisy, to look at what happens, you know, they might also ask, you know, why aren't the Border Patrol agents at the border?
[00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:53.073]  Why are they harassing people well inside of the border?
[00:23:53.073 --> 00:24:00.818]  Take a look at what happened to our reporters Sha'Carri Jackson and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs when they went down to report on Nancy Pelosi's photo-op opportunity.
[00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:09.479]  They're pulling over.
[00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:10.960]  This is a border patrol.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.021]  They're stopping everybody.
[00:24:13.021 --> 00:24:14.701]  This is Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs driving.
[00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:17.022]  Can you tell me what your citizenship is, please, sir?
[00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:18.663]  I work at Info Warnings.
[00:24:18.663 --> 00:24:19.903]  You know, Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:19.903 --> 00:24:22.164]  I've heard of it.
[00:24:22.164 --> 00:24:24.725]  I haven't watched it.
[00:24:24.725 --> 00:24:25.125]  That's great.
[00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:26.905]  You gotta check it out.
[00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:27.826]  You can sign up.
[00:24:27.826 --> 00:24:30.567]  You can use your password.
[00:24:30.567 --> 00:24:32.047]  Joe Biggs is giving him a commercial here.
[00:24:32.047 --> 00:24:34.228]  Can you tell me what your citizenship is, please, sir?
[00:24:34.228 --> 00:24:36.029]  Yeah, I live here.
[00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.849]  What's your citizenship?
[00:24:38.288 --> 00:24:39.309]  A lot of people live here.
[00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:41.452]  That's a Border Patrol agent.
[00:24:41.452 --> 00:24:43.355]  What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:44.216]  I'm sorry, sir.
[00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:45.477]  Can you... Oh, sure.
[00:24:45.477 --> 00:24:46.519]  I'll move over here.
[00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:47.820]  I'm sorry.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.061]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:48.061 --> 00:24:48.421]  I'm sorry.
[00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:50.484]  I'm just wondering, what are you trying to accomplish?
[00:24:50.484 --> 00:24:53.007]  Well, this is a checkpoint.
[00:24:53.007 --> 00:24:55.370]  It's a secondary enforcement of...
[00:24:57.232 --> 00:25:03.816]  The border security as we know that we can't catch everybody at the border so this is secondary to catch.
[00:25:03.816 --> 00:25:08.679]  Well sir, I'll tell you if you want to catch the people I can tell you they're at Lackman Air Force Base.
[00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:10.580]  They're in McAllen, Texas.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.741]  El Paso as well.
[00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:17.523]  Unfortunately, we don't control what happens after they've been caught.
[00:25:17.523 --> 00:25:18.444]  I understand that sir.
[00:25:18.444 --> 00:25:21.125]  I'm telling you if you want to find something we can tell you.
[00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:22.746]  I can draw you a map.
[00:25:22.746 --> 00:25:25.588]  We know exactly where those people are too but this is for those people that
[00:25:26.028 --> 00:25:26.568]  Haven't yet.
[00:25:26.568 --> 00:25:27.569]  They know exactly where they are.
[00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:28.769]  They're not doing anything with them.
[00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:30.570]  What your citizenship is, please, sir?
[00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.171]  Well, I live in the state of Texas.
[00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:34.611]  Okay, so is that where you're born?
[00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:36.612]  Were you born here in the U.S., sir?
[00:25:36.612 --> 00:25:39.933]  I was not born in the state of Texas, if that's what you're asking.
[00:25:39.933 --> 00:25:45.095]  No, I was just asking if you were born in the United States, just so I can ensure your citizenship.
[00:25:45.095 --> 00:25:47.275]  I assure you, sir, I'm no criminal.
[00:25:47.275 --> 00:25:48.376]  I'm not doing anything wrong.
[00:25:48.376 --> 00:25:54.558]  And if you'd like to know where the legal immigrants are, sir, I can show you videos and pictures and all that stuff.
[00:25:56.359 --> 00:26:03.745]  I live in Texas.
[00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:05.907]  I'm a resident.
[00:26:05.907 --> 00:26:11.712]  Listen, that's very important because this is all about residents, right?
[00:26:11.712 --> 00:26:20.479]  New York City is going to spend $5 million to defend quote-unquote undocumented immigrants, people that they say are residents of New York.
[00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:23.962]  See, they just moved into New York and now they're residents under NAFTA.
[00:26:24.807 --> 00:26:26.128]  Presumably, right?
[00:26:26.128 --> 00:26:32.874]  So why should Jokari and Joe Biggs give any more information than just to say, I'm a resident of Texas?
[00:26:32.874 --> 00:26:34.315]  But he kept pushing them.
[00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:35.055]  Where were you born?
[00:26:35.055 --> 00:26:36.436]  Where were you born?
[00:26:36.436 --> 00:26:43.802]  They don't care in New York, they don't care in California, they don't care at the border, but they're going to harass people who are inside the country.
[00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:48.146]  This is nothing but pro-forma harassment.
[00:26:48.146 --> 00:26:52.129]  Taking away our freedom, our liberty, in a B.F.
[00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:53.630]  Skinner approach.
[00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:58.274]  Treating us like controlled animals.
[00:26:58.274 --> 00:26:58.715]  Okay?
[00:26:58.715 --> 00:27:00.737]  That's what's happening at the airports.
[00:27:00.737 --> 00:27:02.959]  That's what's happening with the TSA.
[00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:06.562]  And that's what Alex Jones is going to be talking about in the next segment.
[00:27:06.562 --> 00:27:08.604]  This kind of hypocrisy that you can see.
[00:27:08.604 --> 00:27:10.325]  You don't know what it looked like at the border.
[00:27:10.325 --> 00:27:12.787]  You've always heard there's people coming across.
[00:27:12.787 --> 00:27:16.411]  You need to understand and listen to what the Border Patrol agents are telling you.
[00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:16.931]  They're quitting
[00:27:17.091 --> 00:27:22.274]  In mass, because they said they're no longer doing law enforcement, they're just catering to the people who are coming across the border.
[00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:30.639]  They said that they're using children to get people distracted so they can bring drugs, whatever, perhaps terrorist devices through.
[00:27:30.639 --> 00:27:43.466]  But we're being harassed at the airports, we're being harassed in the country and the same agency, Homeland Security, that is driving the police into a militarized approach to the way they deal with the public.
[00:27:43.966 --> 00:27:54.654]  The same agency that is controlling TSA at the airports is the same agency that is stepping everything down at the borders and opening them up completely open.
[00:27:54.654 --> 00:27:57.916]  Now this is being done, as I pointed out, you're seeing them being shipped to New York.
[00:27:57.916 --> 00:28:08.744]  We had an article last week where a lot of these people are going to be shipped to New York and to a Walmart, a dilapidated Walmart that's essentially falling down.
[00:28:08.744 --> 00:28:11.306]  A great picture for what's happening to our country.
[00:28:11.966 --> 00:28:20.313]  As even the Walmarts are collapsing in certain areas, we're going to bring more people in to accelerate the collapse because that's what this is about.
[00:28:20.313 --> 00:28:34.064]  For the longest time, it was back in the 1960s, two social scientists, Cloward and Piven, said we can accelerate the socialist welfare state if we bring enough people onto the welfare rolls to collapse the economy.
[00:28:34.064 --> 00:28:36.706]  And we need to do it through the Democrat Party.
[00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:38.188]  That's being rolled out.
[00:28:38.188 --> 00:28:39.749]  NAFTA is being rolled out.
[00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:44.694]  We're going to talk about the hypocrisy of what's going on at the airports right after the break.
[00:28:44.694 --> 00:28:46.476]  Alex Jones is going to break that down for you.
[00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:46.896]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:06.149]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:09.471]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:11.232]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:29:11.232 --> 00:29:17.575]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:29:17.575 --> 00:29:23.498]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:29:23.638 --> 00:29:27.579]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:29:27.579 --> 00:29:30.540]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:38.942]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:29:38.942 --> 00:29:41.043]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:29:41.043 --> 00:29:42.083]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:29:42.443 --> 00:29:51.390]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:29:59.713 --> 00:30:01.935]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:30:01.935 --> 00:30:10.004]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:10.004 --> 00:30:16.972]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:17.532 --> 00:30:22.133]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that is good stuff.
[00:30:22.133 --> 00:30:32.756]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:30:32.756 --> 00:30:38.878]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:30:39.218 --> 00:30:41.800]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.644]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[00:30:45.644 --> 00:30:47.586]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[00:30:47.586 --> 00:30:51.749]  All the products in Infowarslife.com are simply amazing.

[00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:03.534]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:31:03.534 --> 00:31:07.917]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:31:07.917 --> 00:31:11.560]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.602]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:31:14.602 --> 00:31:21.908]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:31:22.168 --> 00:31:26.071]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:31:26.071 --> 00:31:30.494]  New filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:31:30.494 --> 00:31:36.479]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:40.422]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:31:40.422 --> 00:31:43.164]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:31:43.164 --> 00:31:44.505]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:31:44.645 --> 00:31:46.006]  It's time to take action.
[00:31:46.006 --> 00:31:47.826]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:31:59.804 --> 00:32:05.946]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:32:05.946 --> 00:32:10.508]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:32:10.508 --> 00:32:15.090]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.412]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:32:18.412 --> 00:32:23.875]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:31.259]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:35.381]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:32:35.381 --> 00:32:40.503]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:40.503 --> 00:32:41.344]  This is innovating.
[00:32:41.624 --> 00:32:48.950]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:53.374]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.342]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.342 --> 00:33:07.565]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:15.214]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:16.667 --> 00:33:18.207]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.207 --> 00:33:20.088]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:33:20.088 --> 00:33:22.668]  We've got a special report coming up from Alex.
[00:33:22.668 --> 00:33:30.710]  The hypocrisy of what is happening at the collapsed borders versus what's going on in our airports is something that should really end the TSA.
[00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:46.313]  Now I thought it should have ended the TSA when the unredacted lawsuit went up on Pacer.gov showing that in 2011 the TSA said in its own internal memos there was no threat at either airports or to airplanes.
[00:33:46.693 --> 00:34:10.186]  And yet, at the same time, there was a bill that had passed unanimously in the Texas House to stop this kind of pedophile pet-downs that we have at the airports and they used that to essentially threaten the Texas legislature and said that we're going to essentially turn Texas into a no-fly zone if the Senate passes this after the House already passed it.
[00:34:10.186 --> 00:34:14.229]  They were threatening to shut down all air traffic control in Texas
[00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:20.756]  Even though they said in their own internal documents and knew that they weren't protecting anybody.
[00:34:20.756 --> 00:34:24.141]  Now we should all understand what's really going on.
[00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:24.922]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:34:25.839 --> 00:34:28.800]  Again, thank you for joining us on this Sunday edition.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.582]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the TV studios of InfoWars.com.
[00:34:32.582 --> 00:34:34.382]  David Knight is in the radio studios.
[00:34:34.382 --> 00:34:48.108]  Anybody listening to the radio right now can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the free audio and video feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show or subscribe to the Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:48.108 --> 00:34:51.349]  Well, I want to talk about the fact that the TSA can be abolished.
[00:34:52.444 --> 00:34:56.765]  And can be removed by Congress anytime they want.
[00:34:56.765 --> 00:34:59.446]  And that we have the precedent to do that right now.
[00:34:59.446 --> 00:35:04.447]  In the 13 years of the agency, they have just plowed over the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:35:04.447 --> 00:35:11.829]  They have expanded to the highways of the United States and to checkpoints.
[00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:17.070]  They are engaged in just all sorts of different unconstitutional behavior.
[00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.711]  And they've never caught one supposed terrorist in their own admissions.
[00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:22.973]  And then let's expand on that.
[00:35:22.973 --> 00:35:31.221]  Our own government's funding Al-Qaeda in Syria, and Iraq, and Libya, and everywhere else under ISIS, giving them weapons, stinger missiles.
[00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:32.902]  Our southern border's wide open.
[00:35:32.902 --> 00:35:35.104]  Saudi Arabians, you name it, are pouring across.
[00:35:35.104 --> 00:35:36.506]  We're going to get into some of those articles.
[00:35:37.006 --> 00:35:54.478]  But they want to go to bus terminals, the system wants to go to your school and set up checkpoints and train you that you're a prisoner, that you're a slave, but then all these illegals and the rest of them pouring in with the open border are A-OK.
[00:35:54.478 --> 00:35:57.200]  And that's the point I'm getting at here today.
[00:35:58.428 --> 00:36:15.046]  If we point out that our border is wide open and that Obama has openly brought the illegals in on purpose, on record, and show it's all a hoax, and show that homeland security's been set up for the American people, not for terror threats, and that it's a domestic police state, that's even Mainline News admits that now, a domestic army,
[00:36:16.061 --> 00:36:19.783]  Then the hoax, the fraud can dissipate and fall apart.
[00:36:19.783 --> 00:36:28.868]  But if people just keep going, gee, I wonder why the border's wide open, but don't connect it to the internal security forces that are really homeland insecurity.
[00:36:29.713 --> 00:36:32.335]  Then we have no hope of ever reversing this fraud.
[00:36:32.335 --> 00:36:42.241]  The Border Patrol is now the Immigrant Importation Agency, or the felony, or aggravated felony, Immigrant Importation Agency.
[00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:47.245]  But I wanted to go over some of what's happening with the border and then look at just some of the latest excesses.
[00:36:47.805 --> 00:37:00.569]  and criminal activities of the mission-creeping federal unsworn Gestapo that is the TSA or slave training system to train Americans that we have no rights.
[00:37:00.569 --> 00:37:02.549]  Prisoner induction training.
[00:37:02.549 --> 00:37:03.330]  Look at this headline.
[00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.130]  This is so big out of AP.
[00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.811]  This was last week.
[00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:07.851]  I think?
[00:37:29.201 --> 00:37:43.322]  We broke this back on the 18th of June and the 17th of June with Jakari Jackson and our reporters down on the border showing Greyhound buses pulling in with Border Patrol giving them vouchers to then go deeper into the U.S.
[00:37:43.322 --> 00:37:44.684]  showing emergency managers
[00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:50.208]  Like the head of emergency management in McAllen admitting the feds were doing this.
[00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:56.472]  We forced this into the national discourse after DrugsReport.com picked up the story.
[00:37:56.472 --> 00:38:01.135]  And I'm just pointing out mainstream media won't do their job so Congress could keep denying this.
[00:38:01.135 --> 00:38:06.559]  Here are articles from the week before AP finally admitted this was all true.
[00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:10.461]  Caught red-handed, Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep into US.
[00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:15.286]  Yeah, they're not just releasing them, they're paying to release them.
[00:38:15.286 --> 00:38:15.987]  Okay?
[00:38:15.987 --> 00:38:16.948]  Let's continue.
[00:38:16.948 --> 00:38:23.314]  City official admits Border Patrol fronting cash to bus illegals anywhere, to go anywhere in the U.S.
[00:38:23.314 --> 00:38:23.774]  Boom!
[00:38:23.774 --> 00:38:24.815]  June 18th.
[00:38:24.815 --> 00:38:28.119]  DHS to pay for illegal immigrants to be escorted into U.S.
[00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:30.921]  We even found at the Fed biz op Homeland Security site
[00:38:31.522 --> 00:38:39.007]  Where they were hiring them back in January and pre-deploying food supplies as well to bring them into the country.
[00:38:39.007 --> 00:38:41.109]  This is organized treason.
[00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:43.971]  That's why Biden gives them awards, says we'll get you lawyers.
[00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:48.274]  Obama has the illegal kids to say, you're the DREAM Act, we're going to legalize you.
[00:38:48.274 --> 00:38:58.441]  They have a deal with Mexico as draconian border control to let the South Americans and Central Americans come in on these trains as long as they don't get off.
[00:38:58.441 --> 00:39:01.003]  It's six months forced labor in Mexico and they catch you there illegally.
[00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.413]  So they never let immigrants from Central and South America pour in.
[00:39:05.413 --> 00:39:07.755]  They had to get in through the Caribbean before.
[00:39:07.755 --> 00:39:10.937]  Through the Virgin Islands, which has the highest crime rate in the Caribbean.
[00:39:10.937 --> 00:39:16.161]  Now, they're pouring in right through Mexico, unfettered, organized.
[00:39:16.161 --> 00:39:17.803]  Another headline.
[00:39:17.803 --> 00:39:19.024]  Feds stand down as U.S.
[00:39:19.024 --> 00:39:19.925]  border collapses.
[00:39:19.925 --> 00:39:22.306]  Video of the border gates open, wide open.
[00:39:22.306 --> 00:39:24.468]  People driving in aren't even checking them.
[00:39:24.468 --> 00:39:26.330]  The internal checkpoint's wide open now.
[00:39:27.748 --> 00:39:29.831]  We have other footage of this.
[00:39:29.831 --> 00:39:33.195]  Border gates left wide open by Border Patrol.
[00:39:33.195 --> 00:39:35.417]  Again, that's all up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:39.963]  Breaking as national news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:39.963 --> 00:39:42.666]  Let's look at what else has been happening in the last week.
[00:39:42.666 --> 00:39:43.447]  Illegal immigrants...
[00:39:44.088 --> 00:39:46.751]  Hopping death trains again to U.S.
[00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:47.791]  hoping for amnesty.
[00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:49.133]  Will they get amnesty?
[00:39:49.133 --> 00:39:50.554]  Incredible pictures of that.
[00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:57.060]  DHS questions over decision to let Saudi passengers skip normal passport controls.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.401]  Fox News.
[00:39:58.401 --> 00:40:01.104]  They don't have to go through passport controls to get into the country.
[00:40:01.604 --> 00:40:03.826]  They don't have to get into them when they come through Mexico.
[00:40:03.826 --> 00:40:05.828]  This is the reality of what's going on.
[00:40:05.828 --> 00:40:08.450]  Infectious tuberculosis moving across U.S.
[00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:09.030]  border.
[00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.652]  Ice whistleblower confirms.
[00:40:10.652 --> 00:40:11.352]  Boom!
[00:40:11.352 --> 00:40:14.595]  Airport security worried about reporters, not Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:40:14.595 --> 00:40:15.916]  Our report on that.
[00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.818]  Muslim terrorists caught crossing U.S.
[00:40:17.818 --> 00:40:18.519]  border.

[00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:23.443]  Orders it removed.
[00:40:23.823 --> 00:40:27.487]  Border Highway heavily patrolled by state and local police, but not Border Patrol.
[00:40:27.487 --> 00:40:29.269]  They're literally standing down.
[00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:32.212]  Crime waves hitting South Texas and robberies.
[00:40:32.212 --> 00:40:34.354]  National Review reporting on that.
[00:40:34.354 --> 00:40:37.998]  Democratic lawmakers propose lawyers for immigrant children.

[00:40:42.443 --> 00:40:44.064]  Now, what's the rest of the story here?
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:59.320]  The rest of the story is, while all this is happening, while all this is going on, the TSA is now at highway checkpoints, bus checkpoints, kite festivals, they have the army at it searching people in Austin, training us how to be slaves.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.923]  What a joke, while the border is wide open.
[00:41:02.014 --> 00:41:04.056]  This is being done again to break our will.
[00:41:04.056 --> 00:41:05.057]  Look at RT.
[00:41:05.057 --> 00:41:06.137]  Ex-TSA agent.
[00:41:06.137 --> 00:41:08.419]  We steal from travelers all the time.
[00:41:08.419 --> 00:41:09.160]  Report.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.381]  CNN.
[00:41:10.381 --> 00:41:12.242]  TSA employee misconduct.
[00:41:12.242 --> 00:41:14.604]  Up 26% in three years.
[00:41:14.604 --> 00:41:16.666]  TSA agent accused of stealing $8,000.

[00:41:27.515 --> 00:41:29.637]  Literally bent over with a hand down his pants.
[00:41:30.177 --> 00:41:31.659]  With them grabbing on him.
[00:41:31.659 --> 00:41:35.704]  I've seen them do this to Jesse Ventura when we've been flying.
[00:41:35.704 --> 00:41:44.113]  Now they're going to raise the security cost and the security fee on airline tickets, AP reports, while you pay for all of this.
[00:41:44.113 --> 00:41:45.235]  It's all a hoax.
[00:41:45.655 --> 00:41:48.297]  It's all a stinking giant fraud.
[00:41:48.297 --> 00:41:49.779]  Wake up out of your coma.
[00:41:49.779 --> 00:41:52.201]  Get angry and say no.
[00:41:52.201 --> 00:41:54.283]  It's a police state takeover.
[00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:59.908]  All over the nation, Homeland Security's putting microphones up to listen to us and NSA systems to grab our data.
[00:41:59.908 --> 00:42:01.369]  It doesn't keep us safe.
[00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:04.092]  It's all meant to control us, period.
[00:42:04.092 --> 00:42:06.414]  It's time for you to break your conditioning and wake up.
[00:42:06.994 --> 00:42:07.874]  It's a hoax.
[00:42:07.874 --> 00:42:08.994]  It's a takeover.
[00:42:08.994 --> 00:42:09.715]  It's a fraud.
[00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:11.235]  They aren't even sworn officers.
[00:42:11.235 --> 00:42:12.675]  They're violating the Bill of Rights.
[00:42:12.675 --> 00:42:16.536]  They're treating you as if you're guilty until proven a New World Order slave.
[00:42:16.536 --> 00:42:18.617]  We're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:42:18.617 --> 00:42:20.997]  I want the Bill of Rights and due process back.
[00:42:20.997 --> 00:42:22.338]  I want my freedom back.
[00:42:22.338 --> 00:42:24.758]  I don't want to have the biggest prison population in the world.
[00:42:24.758 --> 00:42:26.919]  I don't want to have big banks laundering the drug money.
[00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:32.500]  I don't want to have the police getting armored vehicles for war with the Tea Party and saying that's their main enemy, not Al Qaeda.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.242]  This is a criminal takeover and you have been warned.
[00:42:36.242 --> 00:42:37.543]  Admit I've been right.
[00:42:37.543 --> 00:42:39.264]  Admit InfoWars has been right.
[00:42:39.264 --> 00:42:42.245]  Admit we're all in deep trouble and it's time to wake up.
[00:42:42.245 --> 00:42:46.008]  Back to the live transmission and David Knight hosting the radio show.
[00:42:46.008 --> 00:42:49.170]  I'm Alex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:54.393]  Don't say you weren't warned and understand if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:43:00.677 --> 00:43:02.979]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:10.403]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:43:10.403 --> 00:43:21.231]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:30.477]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:43:31.197 --> 00:43:35.260]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.022]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:43:39.022 --> 00:43:41.084]  Experience the new formula.
[00:43:41.084 --> 00:43:43.665]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:44.986]  Shield your family.
[00:43:44.986 --> 00:43:46.807]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:43:59.113 --> 00:44:04.075]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:07.416]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:44:07.416 --> 00:44:09.537]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:44:09.537 --> 00:44:11.677]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:44:11.677 --> 00:44:13.338]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:44:13.338 --> 00:44:16.659]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:18.240]  If so, consider this.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:27.163]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:44:27.523 --> 00:44:33.925]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:44:33.925 --> 00:44:35.966]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:44:35.966 --> 00:44:43.588]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:44:57.198 --> 00:44:58.679]  Live life healthy.
[00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:05.705]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:45:05.865 --> 00:45:08.207]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:45:08.207 --> 00:45:13.492]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:45:13.492 --> 00:45:18.657]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:45:18.657 --> 00:45:21.700]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.043]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:45:26.043 --> 00:45:30.366]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:45:30.366 --> 00:45:40.612]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:45:40.612 --> 00:45:43.114]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,

[00:45:59.622 --> 00:46:00.962]  In the near future.
[00:46:00.962 --> 00:46:05.444]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:46:05.444 --> 00:46:06.664]  Security alert.
[00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.685]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:46:08.685 --> 00:46:09.545]  Analysis.

[00:46:12.266 --> 00:46:17.268]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:46:17.268 --> 00:46:18.288]  Crime directive.
[00:46:18.288 --> 00:46:19.848]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:46:19.848 --> 00:46:22.709]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:46:22.709 --> 00:46:25.930]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.111]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:46:28.251 --> 00:46:29.752]  These people are assaulting us!
[00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:31.932]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:46:31.932 --> 00:46:34.553]  They are never going to stop.
[00:46:34.553 --> 00:46:38.575]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:46:45.537 --> 00:46:46.518]  Imperative.
[00:46:46.518 --> 00:46:47.338]  Destroy.
[00:46:47.338 --> 00:46:53.040]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.361]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:47:00.854 --> 00:47:04.455]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.455 --> 00:47:20.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:20.879 --> 00:47:28.621]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.822]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:31.822 --> 00:47:32.663]  I'm David Knight.
[00:47:32.663 --> 00:47:33.644]  I'll be your host today.
[00:47:33.644 --> 00:47:40.811]  And we've got some more reports coming up from our Infowars reporters who've been down at the border, as well as from Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:53.463]  In that last segment, he was talking about how the hypocrisy of what's going on at the borders, where Homeland Security has completely opened the borders to anyone bringing in anything that they wish to bring in.
[00:47:53.463 --> 00:47:53.804]  And yet,
[00:47:54.244 --> 00:48:05.188]  We see how they are using the TSA internally at the airports, and not even at the airports, also at bus stations, at train stations, on the highways with their Viper teams.
[00:48:05.188 --> 00:48:08.129]  We see how they're using this police state, this B.F.
[00:48:08.129 --> 00:48:15.831]  Skinner type of psychological conditioning where they say, you know, let me put my hands on you and I'll let you fly.
[00:48:15.831 --> 00:48:18.913]  I'll instantly reward you with some positive thing that you want.
[00:48:18.913 --> 00:48:22.474]  That's called positive operant conditioning when you do it to a dog.
[00:48:23.214 --> 00:48:25.578]  That's what they're doing to us.
[00:48:25.578 --> 00:48:28.041]  This should stop it.
[00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:37.155]  This hypocrisy of what's happening simultaneously, as we just saw earlier in the program, is Jakari and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs coming back from the Pelosi photo-op.
[00:48:38.544 --> 00:48:47.748]  They were stopped by a Border Patrol agent who is pressuring them to say that they're Americans by birth, and they refused to do that.
[00:48:47.748 --> 00:48:50.069]  They said, we're residents of Texas, and that's all they would tell them.
[00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:53.131]  And they said, oh, by the way, do you want to know where the illegal aliens are?
[00:48:53.131 --> 00:48:55.352]  Because we just filmed a whole bunch of them down here.
[00:48:55.352 --> 00:48:56.712]  Oh, yeah, we know all about those people.
[00:48:56.712 --> 00:48:57.993]  We're not going to really bother with them.
[00:48:58.809 --> 00:49:02.010]  Well, you know, that's the way it's going to roll out.
[00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:08.112]  And I want to talk about what's happening in Detroit and compare that to what's happening in Central America.
[00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:14.053]  But before we do, I want to remind you that this hour, the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.
[00:49:14.053 --> 00:49:19.435]  You know, with the collapse of the border, with the soaring meat prices, it's clear there's no longer time to wait.

[00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:40.450]  They're counting on you to be ever-dependent slaves to their system of control, but you can fight back.
[00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:47.954]  You can establish independence for yourself, for your family, by securing your own private supply of storable food.

[00:50:10.612 --> 00:50:10.752]  I'm
[00:50:32.261 --> 00:50:32.741]  We're good to go.
[00:50:52.418 --> 00:50:54.079]  What's going on in Detroit?
[00:50:54.079 --> 00:50:58.140]  Well, they have thousands of people now who are getting their water turned off.
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.521]  Detroit is cutting their services for non-payment.
[00:51:00.521 --> 00:51:04.862]  You know, Detroit is a good example of what's going to happen to America.
[00:51:04.862 --> 00:51:09.064]  We all look at the massive amounts of people coming in, the collapse of the border.
[00:51:09.064 --> 00:51:14.886]  Many people just can't believe that America could collapse to the level of a third world country.
[00:51:15.606 --> 00:51:19.527]  Well, you obviously haven't looked at what happened in Detroit.
[00:51:19.527 --> 00:51:23.387]  One of the wealthiest areas of the country formally.
[00:51:23.387 --> 00:51:24.268]  But what happened?
[00:51:24.268 --> 00:51:28.828]  They moved pretty much most of the automobile industry out of the area.
[00:51:28.828 --> 00:51:32.929]  Foreign countries to other areas of the country, but mostly to foreign countries.
[00:51:32.929 --> 00:51:35.910]  As industry collapsed, the economy collapsed.
[00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:39.090]  The same thing is happening now in America.
[00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:42.211]  And of course, David Petraeus says, well, what comes after America?
[00:51:42.211 --> 00:51:43.511]  You know, what comes after Detroit?
[00:51:44.403 --> 00:51:46.505]  Well, North America.
[00:51:46.505 --> 00:51:51.389]  NAFTA comes after Detroit, because NAFTA was set up to take down America.
[00:51:51.389 --> 00:51:57.634]  And if you don't think this can happen, if you don't think they're going to collapse us economically, you're not paying attention.
[00:51:57.634 --> 00:52:02.058]  Here in Detroit, they're cutting off people's water because they can't pay for it.
[00:52:02.058 --> 00:52:03.960]  But of course, they're still putting fluoride in the water.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.662]  Still putting more fluoride in the water in Detroit than they do even in Austin.
[00:52:08.662 --> 00:52:11.724]  It's absolutely amazing to see that they're doing this.
[00:52:11.724 --> 00:52:15.906]  But look at what's happening in the socialist paradise of Venezuela.
[00:52:15.906 --> 00:52:19.627]  See, in Venezuela, they have people who can't get water.
[00:52:19.627 --> 00:52:22.969]  That's one of the reasons why they're leaving the country and going elsewhere.
[00:52:22.969 --> 00:52:28.732]  They're packing up, they're leaving, they're traveling up because they can't get drinking water, they can't get medicine.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:41.587]  And there's this article that we've shown a couple times, about a month ago, at the beginning of June, Bloomberg reported, here's the headline, Venezuela sacrifices drinking water to pay bond holders.
[00:52:41.587 --> 00:52:43.688]  Now, let's make that a little bit more accurate.
[00:52:43.688 --> 00:52:48.071]  Venezuela sacrifices drinking water to pay the banksters.
[00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:50.152]  Okay, that's really what they're talking about.
[00:52:50.152 --> 00:52:55.836]  And they have a quote from a guy who's an analyst at Barclays, and he said, the government's priority
[00:52:56.616 --> 00:52:58.277]  Is to pay the sovereign debt.
[00:52:58.277 --> 00:52:59.898]  Not to provide water.
[00:52:59.898 --> 00:53:01.459]  Not to provide medicine.
[00:53:01.459 --> 00:53:04.801]  Not to make sure that you've got an economy that can provide those things.
[00:53:04.801 --> 00:53:08.344]  No, why don't they have an economy that provides those things?
[00:53:08.344 --> 00:53:12.346]  Socialism was supposed to help the little guy, right?
[00:53:12.346 --> 00:53:13.027]  Wrong.
[00:53:13.027 --> 00:53:23.534]  What it did under Hugo Chavez, if you look at this, you find that they're bragging about the fact that under Hugo Chavez they got nearly 700% return on their investments, the bankers did.
[00:53:24.619 --> 00:53:29.954]  Now we know that bankers funded Lenin to start the communist revolution in Russia.
[00:53:30.865 --> 00:53:31.965]  That's the way it goes.
[00:53:31.965 --> 00:53:45.130]  It's always easiest to take somebody like Lenin, or like Hugo Chavez, or like Hillary Clinton, who says they're for the little guy, they're for the 99%, and yet they're being run and controlled by the biggest banks.
[00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:48.972]  Goldman Sachs giving the Clinton Foundation half a billion dollars.
[00:53:48.972 --> 00:53:51.032]  They hold their fundraisers there.
[00:53:51.032 --> 00:53:52.673]  That's where this is coming.
[00:53:52.673 --> 00:53:57.875]  It's the phony kind of hypocrisy that we see from Hillary Clinton, from Nancy Pelosi,
[00:53:58.675 --> 00:54:01.516]  That's why people in Venezuela don't have drinking water.
[00:54:01.516 --> 00:54:03.137]  That's why they're fleeing the country.
[00:54:03.137 --> 00:54:13.861]  That, along with the war on drugs that we've inflicted on them, that we run simultaneously, that creates a violent war within their country so that they flee for their lives, they flee for drinking water.
[00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:14.481]  Where do they come?
[00:54:14.481 --> 00:54:14.962]  America.
[00:54:14.962 --> 00:54:16.522]  The same thing is going to happen here.
[00:54:16.522 --> 00:54:18.463]  The same thing is happening here.
[00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:20.264]  And just today we see that Venezuela
[00:54:21.164 --> 00:54:30.406]  ...is suffering massive electricity blackouts, that they're leaving commuters scrambling, and even the president can't get out his propaganda message.
[00:54:30.406 --> 00:54:37.487]  That's right, twice the president of Venezuela had his broadcast interrupted because they lost power.
[00:54:37.487 --> 00:54:43.529]  You know, and Margaret Thatcher said the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.
[00:54:43.529 --> 00:54:49.590]  I guess the problem in Venezuela is essentially you eventually run out of everything, electricity as well as water.
[00:54:51.425 --> 00:55:03.214]  But there's another aspect of all this hypocrisy that I find very troubling and that is the fact that they're using children as beards when we know how they feel about children.
[00:55:03.214 --> 00:55:06.096]  Remember what Melissa Perry Harris said?
[00:55:06.096 --> 00:55:14.403]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:55:14.403 --> 00:55:19.387]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:55:20.302 --> 00:55:20.923]  There you go.
[00:55:20.923 --> 00:55:23.506]  That's the public service announcement from MSNBC.
[00:55:23.506 --> 00:55:31.135]  Melissa Harris Perry and Nancy Pelosi was at the border yesterday and she had this to say about children.
[00:55:31.135 --> 00:55:32.177]  I'm a mother of five.
[00:55:32.177 --> 00:55:33.558]  I have nine grandchildren.
[00:55:33.558 --> 00:55:37.042]  I wish that I could take all those children home with me.
[00:55:38.294 --> 00:55:40.895]  Yeah, see, she wants to take all those children home with her.
[00:55:40.895 --> 00:55:47.279]  Now, one of the things that concerns me about this is that I believe that they are bringing in a lot of young children.
[00:55:47.279 --> 00:55:58.424]  Of course, this act that Obama put in says that they're going to allow children to stay, and they define children as people up to 31 years of age.
[00:55:58.424 --> 00:56:07.529]  31 years of age, you still qualify as a child as for protection, so I guess they can legitimately say that these gangs, these drug gangs are children, right?
[00:56:08.271 --> 00:56:22.952]  But what they're really doing, I believe, is I believe they're bringing in a massive army of people who they can raise apart and separate from families, apart and separate from any understanding of the foundations, legal and cultural, of this country.
[00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:28.659]  That has always been the dream of Machiavellian dictators, going back to Plato's Republic.
[00:56:28.659 --> 00:56:31.363]  They didn't want anybody to know who their parents were.
[00:56:31.363 --> 00:56:34.126]  They wanted all the children to be raised by the state.
[00:56:34.126 --> 00:56:39.353]  Look at this report that went up on Friday on InfoWars.
[00:56:41.255 --> 00:56:44.537]  is arrested because his eight-year-old son skips church.
[00:56:44.537 --> 00:56:48.839]  Now what happens is a church man pulls up to the house, the kids run out, say, the church man's here, they run out.
[00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:54.002]  One of the kids, the eight-year-old, runs down to a convenience store a half mile away.
[00:56:54.002 --> 00:56:59.506]  When the police come in, they ask him where he lives, he's very scared, he says, I don't know, I don't know.
[00:56:59.506 --> 00:57:03.328]  Somebody there's recognized him, said he lives down here, so they went down and they arrested the father.
[00:57:03.968 --> 00:57:09.511]  Now, remember back in September 2012, we had this headline at InfoWars.
[00:57:09.511 --> 00:57:13.113]  Society now criminalizing parents that allow children to play in the yard.
[00:57:13.113 --> 00:57:18.916]  Our children can't be in the neighborhood playing in the yard as we all did when we grow up.
[00:57:18.916 --> 00:57:20.937]  If we do that, we are arrested.
[00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:22.398]  We have our children taken away from us.
[00:57:23.038 --> 00:57:39.292]  But Obama and Pelosi encourage the parents of Central and South America to have their children run the gauntlet of drug cartels and pedophile prostitution rings so they can do it for economic gain, so they can do it for political control.
[00:57:39.292 --> 00:57:40.132]  We're going to be right back.
[00:57:40.132 --> 00:57:40.593]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.241]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:57:52.241 --> 00:58:00.303]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:58:00.303 --> 00:58:07.465]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:58:07.825 --> 00:58:12.428]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:58:12.428 --> 00:58:23.056]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:58:23.056 --> 00:58:29.561]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:32.122]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:58:32.122 --> 00:58:35.745]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[00:58:35.925 --> 00:58:37.867]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[00:58:49.833 --> 00:58:53.875]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:58.258]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:58:58.258 --> 00:59:01.900]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.942]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:59:04.942 --> 00:59:12.226]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:59:12.506 --> 00:59:16.430]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:20.854]  New filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:59:20.854 --> 00:59:26.819]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:59:26.819 --> 00:59:30.882]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:59:30.882 --> 00:59:33.505]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:59:33.505 --> 00:59:34.846]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:59:34.986 --> 00:59:36.347]  It's time to take action.
[00:59:36.347 --> 00:59:38.189]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:59:54.562 --> 00:59:57.764]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:01.676 --> 01:00:08.320]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.302]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.459 --> 01:00:14.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.441]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:00:16.441 --> 01:00:19.863]  We're going to be joined with Alex Jones at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:19.863 --> 01:00:23.345]  He's going to talk about the global meltdown that has already begun.
[01:00:23.345 --> 01:00:28.888]  And of course, part of that is the restructuring and the collapse of our economy.
[01:00:28.888 --> 01:00:33.231]  And one of the ways they do that is to massively increase the welfare rolls.
[01:00:34.071 --> 01:00:38.516]  Our country cannot absorb the massive amount of immigrants that are coming in.
[01:00:38.516 --> 01:00:40.238]  They very well know that.
[01:00:40.238 --> 01:00:42.961]  They've done social study experiments about this.
[01:00:42.961 --> 01:00:49.789]  Cloward and Piven were two of the social scientists who put forth a theory that this is exactly what needed to be done.
[01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:54.174]  But of course there's another aspect of this and that is the NAFTA aspect.
[01:00:55.015 --> 01:01:01.981]  After enacting this into law 20 years ago, they now want to make it an accomplished fact.
[01:01:01.981 --> 01:01:05.965]  And we have some information about that that we're going to play in a few minutes.
[01:01:05.965 --> 01:01:15.413]  But I want to get back to what I was talking about just before the break, because we played that quote from Nancy Pelosi saying, I wish I could take all these children home.
[01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:19.237]  Well, of course, she can't take all these children home.
[01:01:19.237 --> 01:01:20.037]  Why?
[01:01:20.037 --> 01:01:21.599]  Because she can't support them.
[01:01:22.714 --> 01:01:32.228]  And the same thing that keeps her from taking all these children home is what makes it impossible for America to take all the poor children of the world.
[01:01:32.228 --> 01:01:35.432]  If I wanted to adopt a hundred children, I would be stopped.
[01:01:36.107 --> 01:01:37.589]  by our government.
[01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:45.157]  I would not be able to pass the income means test that would allow me to adopt that number of children.
[01:01:45.157 --> 01:01:48.501]  I wouldn't have the size house that I need for a hundred kids.
[01:01:48.501 --> 01:01:52.846]  And we cannot bring all the poor children of the world into America.
[01:01:53.615 --> 01:02:00.716]  What they're trying to do with this is to create a cycle of dependency and to have an economic collapse.
[01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:09.018]  If they truly wanted to help these children, they could help them by removing many of the impediments that are bringing their countries down.
[01:02:09.018 --> 01:02:22.241]  Of course, it's been the World Bank and the bankers who have, in places like Venezuela, getting 700% on the return on their investment, and the World Bank under Robert McNamara, who was essentially accused and truly was rent-seeking.
[01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:28.044]  Putting them on welfare status so that he could indebt and collapse those countries through debt.
[01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:31.325]  And then we added to that a war on drugs.
[01:02:31.325 --> 01:02:37.708]  A war where for our cocaine we run the Iran-Contra scandal for cocaine.
[01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:43.751]  Bring that stuff in with a crack cocaine in L.A.
[01:02:43.751 --> 01:02:46.973]  as well as the war on drugs in Afghanistan.
[01:02:47.253 --> 01:02:52.457]  When it was under the Taliban, they were only supplying 10% of the world's supply of heroin.
[01:02:52.457 --> 01:02:56.000]  After the American army occupied them, that has soared.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.081]  Record production each year.
[01:02:57.081 --> 01:03:01.265]  It's now over 90% of the world's supply comes from Afghanistan.
[01:03:01.265 --> 01:03:03.787]  We're helping the farmers there to grow it.
[01:03:03.787 --> 01:03:04.908]  We're importing it.
[01:03:04.908 --> 01:03:13.655]  And yet we are exporting violence and weapons and arms into all these countries all over the world, especially in Central and South America.
[01:03:13.655 --> 01:03:15.157]  So if we really wanted to help them,
[01:03:15.737 --> 01:03:18.800]  There are ways to do it, other than bringing them here.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.323]  It is impractical for us, no matter how much we want to do it.
[01:03:22.323 --> 01:03:25.366]  And this is what many of my Christian friends need to understand.
[01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:32.252]  It is misplaced compassion to say that you're going to bring all of these children into America and take care of them.
[01:03:32.252 --> 01:03:38.958]  You can't do that, any more than you could bring all these children into your home, or that Nancy Pelosi could bring them into her home.
[01:03:39.478 --> 01:03:42.000]  But I'm afraid she doesn't really want to do that.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.181]  She wants to bring them into the community.
[01:03:44.181 --> 01:03:46.362]  She wants the community to be their parents.
[01:03:46.362 --> 01:03:53.526]  Just as Plato said in the Republic, they want these kids to see the government as their family.
[01:03:53.526 --> 01:03:56.488]  They're going to treat them better than they treat our veterans.
[01:03:56.488 --> 01:03:58.289]  They're already doing that.
[01:03:58.289 --> 01:04:02.312]  We're going to provide them with free rides for college education.
[01:04:03.166 --> 01:04:04.247]  They're already doing that.
[01:04:04.247 --> 01:04:07.289]  They give them in-state tuition, whatever state they wish to go to.
[01:04:07.289 --> 01:04:10.951]  You and I, as American citizens, can't do that, but they can do that.
[01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:14.514]  They will give them free-ride tuition at the universities.
[01:04:14.514 --> 01:04:26.502]  And if a middle-class American student wants to do that, they're going to become debt slaves to these very banks, who will not release them from that education debt, even if they declare bankruptcy.
[01:04:27.179 --> 01:04:40.042]  But of course, if you want to get rid of that indebtedness to the bankers, you can always sign up as an indentured servant to Obama's Youth Corps, or to become a teacher, or to do something else for the government.
[01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:52.104]  See, if you turn your life over to the government for a few years as an indentured servant, maybe they'll give you a break on that, because it's all about exerting control and collapsing the economy.
[01:04:52.104 --> 01:04:52.444]  Stay tuned.
[01:04:52.444 --> 01:04:55.485]  We're going to be right back with more reports from Infowars reporters at the border.
[01:04:55.965 --> 01:04:59.389]  And with Alex Jones telling us about global collapse.
[01:04:59.389 --> 01:05:05.515]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:05:05.515 --> 01:05:10.079]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:14.644]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:17.966]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:05:17.966 --> 01:05:23.429]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:05:23.429 --> 01:05:30.813]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:05:30.813 --> 01:05:34.935]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:05:34.935 --> 01:05:40.057]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:40.057 --> 01:05:40.898]  This is innovating.
[01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:48.660]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:52.921]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:58.143]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:04.966 --> 01:06:06.187]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:06.187 --> 01:06:07.167]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:10.789]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:14.571]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:18.112]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:35.973 --> 01:06:41.435]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:46.556]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:46.556 --> 01:06:53.898]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny of the mind.
[01:06:58.055 --> 01:06:59.955]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:59.955 --> 01:07:09.097]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:09.097 --> 01:07:10.397]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:10.397 --> 01:07:11.678]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:07:11.678 --> 01:07:17.999]  We're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour with a new report from Alex Jones about the global meltdown.
[01:07:17.999 --> 01:07:19.059]  It has begun.
[01:07:19.059 --> 01:07:23.740]  And that's what we see at the borders, is a meltdown, a collapse at the border.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:36.267]  Before I go to the clip from Petraeus and Pelosi talking about how they view our new country that we're starting to see now, I want to cover what she had to say about these children.
[01:07:36.267 --> 01:07:39.009]  She mentioned several times about their dignity.
[01:07:39.009 --> 01:07:41.891]  She used that phrase at least twice in her short speech.
[01:07:42.771 --> 01:07:45.275]  But of course they don't give us any dignity.
[01:07:45.275 --> 01:07:50.463]  They don't even give our children any dignity when the TSA comes calling.
[01:07:50.463 --> 01:07:56.632]  Either at the airport, or at the bus station, or the railroad station, or at the roadblocks.
[01:07:56.632 --> 01:07:57.853]  They're not giving us dignity.
[01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:00.915]  But they're saying that they need to treat these children with dignity.
[01:08:00.915 --> 01:08:04.037]  They need to treat them differently than they treat the rest of us.
[01:08:04.037 --> 01:08:10.719]  And that report from Alex that this will end the TSA, that is now live on our website as well as on YouTube.
[01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:11.720]  You need to see that.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:20.124]  We need to point out the hypocrisy of what is going on within the country versus what's going on at the borders.
[01:08:20.124 --> 01:08:25.046]  And of course this is all being done by the same bureaucracy, Homeland Security.
[01:08:25.686 --> 01:08:30.491]  Created in the wake of the 9-11 false flags.
[01:08:30.491 --> 01:08:33.794]  Everything about this agency is a lie.
[01:08:33.794 --> 01:08:35.115]  And that's what we see happening now.
[01:08:35.115 --> 01:08:36.737]  They've taken over law enforcement.
[01:08:36.737 --> 01:08:38.078]  They've taken over the border.
[01:08:38.078 --> 01:08:39.039]  And look at what they're doing.
[01:08:39.039 --> 01:08:47.828]  They're turning the police into a militarized occupational force that thinks that they're fighting a counter-insurgency war here in America.
[01:08:48.328 --> 01:08:50.330]  That's everything that they're training for.
[01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:58.159]  And just so that they're not disappointed, they're going to bring in drug cartels into America so we can have a real war, just like they do in Mexico.
[01:08:58.159 --> 01:09:03.586]  And of course, we've been driving that war for them in Mexico, but there's a lot of corruption in Mexico as well.
[01:09:03.586 --> 01:09:04.126]  Look at this.
[01:09:05.089 --> 01:09:11.532]  Article, Mexican military incursion assisting drug smugglers in the USA have a shootout with Texas police.
[01:09:11.532 --> 01:09:13.574]  This is by Sarah Carter.
[01:09:13.574 --> 01:09:15.114]  It was at the end of the week last week.
[01:09:15.114 --> 01:09:26.861]  It said Mexican soldiers and civilian smugglers had an armed standoff with nearly 30 US law enforcement officials on the Rio Grande in Texas last Monday, according to Texas police and the FBI.
[01:09:26.861 --> 01:09:28.862]  Now, I find it interesting that the
[01:09:29.722 --> 01:09:38.329]  Local Texas police, the Texas police and the local police there, have a very different take on it than the FBI.
[01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:43.333]  First we were told that, well, you know, they came across, I think it was accidental or whatever.
[01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:51.319]  Then as the week went on, the FBI comes out with a statement and says, well, bad guys and three vehicles ended up on the border.
[01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:57.564]  People with Humvees, who appeared to be with the Mexican Army, were involved with the three vehicles and getting them back across.
[01:09:58.806 --> 01:10:09.041]  Now we're told by the local law enforcement and Texas police that what was happening was the Mexican military was escorting these drug smugglers across the border.
[01:10:09.767 --> 01:10:13.548]  As we have Homeland Security standing down the Border Patrol.
[01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:19.869]  It's a very different take on it versus the federal government versus the local and state law enforcement.
[01:10:19.869 --> 01:10:21.609]  And that's the problem.
[01:10:21.609 --> 01:10:24.150]  These problems are being driven by Homeland Security.
[01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:26.410]  They're being driven by the federal government.
[01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:30.891]  They're the ones who are pushing the police to shoot first and not even ask questions.
[01:10:30.891 --> 01:10:33.131]  They're changing the rules of engagement.
[01:10:33.131 --> 01:10:35.452]  They're changing the way the police treat the public.
[01:10:36.112 --> 01:10:40.938]  They're making the police paranoid about their safety more so than they are about the safety of the public.
[01:10:40.938 --> 01:10:48.288]  That's never a concern for them anymore if they follow the kinds of training that they're getting in New Mexico and all over the country.
[01:10:48.288 --> 01:10:53.835]  Mexico has been leading this with their shootings in Albuquerque with their
[01:10:54.535 --> 01:11:00.317]  No hesitation, targets, but also with their shoot-first policy at the New Mexico State Police Academy.
[01:11:00.317 --> 01:11:03.419]  They've had instructors there resign in protest.
[01:11:03.419 --> 01:11:05.460]  This is being driven by the federal government.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:11.702]  And notice that it's the FBI that is downplaying the fact that it's the Mexican federales that are coming across.
[01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:13.723]  You know, we've got our own federales.
[01:11:13.723 --> 01:11:16.484]  We've got our own corruption in the American government.
[01:11:16.484 --> 01:11:18.385]  There's always this compartmentalization.
[01:11:18.985 --> 01:11:26.130]  Many people who are honest law enforcement people at the local and the state level don't realize that it's the federal government.
[01:11:26.786 --> 01:11:50.988]  that is running the drug war that is running the drug trade just as it was the federal government shipping arms across the border and you had a local uh... you had other law enforcement that was compartmentalized at the bottom trying to stop it and got killed that's why fast and furious blew up in their face because you had some law enforcement officers who are trying to do the real job while other law enforcement officers quote-unquote
[01:11:51.468 --> 01:11:54.457]  from the federal government were actually violating the law.
[01:11:54.457 --> 01:11:55.179]  Why?
[01:11:55.179 --> 01:11:57.105]  So they could take down the second amendment.
[01:11:58.305 --> 01:12:04.188]  We also see that a study has said that all employment growth since 2000 went to immigrants.
[01:12:04.188 --> 01:12:06.549]  Now this is also from the National Review.
[01:12:06.549 --> 01:12:08.891]  This came out on Friday.
[01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:15.574]  I would say it went to illegal aliens, or as they would say in New York, residents and undocumented immigrants.
[01:12:15.574 --> 01:12:24.439]  This is the Center for Immigration Studies, said that a net employment growth in the United States since 2000 has gone entirely to immigrants, legal and illegal.
[01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:37.185]  They found that there were 127,000 fewer working-age natives holding a job in the first quarter of 2014 than in 2000, while the number of immigrants with a job was 5.7 million above the 2000 level.
[01:12:40.407 --> 01:12:41.348]  Do you understand?
[01:12:41.348 --> 01:12:46.472]  Right now, that is being driven by organizations like the U.S.
[01:12:46.472 --> 01:12:51.696]  Chamber of Commerce and big business are pushing for cheap labor to come in.
[01:12:51.696 --> 01:12:58.081]  But it isn't going to be people from Central and South America that are going to be taking our jobs in just a few years.
[01:12:58.081 --> 01:13:01.163]  Our jobs are going to be disappearing to robots.
[01:13:01.163 --> 01:13:06.047]  It's not going to be the Mexicans, it's going to be the metal cans who are going to be taking people's jobs.
[01:13:06.047 --> 01:13:09.490]  It's going to be service sector jobs, not just manufacturing jobs.
[01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:14.031]  One of the first service sectors to go is going to be transportation.
[01:13:14.031 --> 01:13:19.573]  And that's going to happen, according to many estimates, in as little as three to five years.
[01:13:19.573 --> 01:13:35.877]  They're rolling back the legal restrictions, the technological advances are there for computer-driven cars, and we should be very concerned about not only the economic effect that it's going to have on the country, but also the control that it's going to allow the government to exercise.
[01:13:37.128 --> 01:13:44.717]  Now I want to go to the comment that Nancy Pelosi had about abortion.
[01:13:44.717 --> 01:13:52.185]  Listen to, and she wasn't talking about abortion, but I want to have you think about this in terms of abortion.
[01:13:52.185 --> 01:13:55.289]  Listen to what she was saying about the children coming across.
[01:13:55.871 --> 01:14:15.590]  If you believe, as we do, that every child, every person has a spark of divinity in them and is therefore worthy of respect, what we saw in those rooms was a dazzling, sparkling array of God's children worthy of respect.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.081]  There we go.
[01:14:18.081 --> 01:14:36.994]  Now, this is the same woman, the same political party, that is trying to force mandatory government-funded, well, the government funds abortions in many cases, but now they want to force abortion coverage on individuals and on companies.
[01:14:36.994 --> 01:14:40.156]  And that's a case that's coming up before the Supreme Court this week.
[01:14:40.156 --> 01:14:44.459]  She's talking about this divine light and that these are children of God.
[01:14:44.459 --> 01:14:46.381]  What about the children who are aborted?
[01:14:47.773 --> 01:14:52.716]  Do we not have that kind of respect for the children that have been aborted?
[01:14:52.716 --> 01:14:57.218]  The millions of children that have been aborted over the last several decades?
[01:14:57.218 --> 01:15:02.461]  That's the kind of hypocrisy that we see throughout this border collapse.
[01:15:02.461 --> 01:15:03.722]  Remember Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:03.722 --> 01:15:06.924]  She's going to be the candidate for women's issues.
[01:15:06.924 --> 01:15:10.446]  She's going to stand strong and show that women have arrived and yet
[01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:12.927]  I hope you've seen the tape.
[01:15:12.927 --> 01:15:16.390]  You need to listen to this tape of Hillary Clinton a few decades ago.
[01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:20.174]  It's kind of funny her southern accent that is still there.
[01:15:20.174 --> 01:15:25.198]  She was 27 at the time that she defended a pedophile rapist.
[01:15:25.198 --> 01:15:28.521]  She's just a couple years older at the time this tape is made.
[01:15:28.521 --> 01:15:31.704]  And she's laughing about how she got this guy off.
[01:15:32.364 --> 01:15:35.226]  She's laughing about how he passed a polygraph.
[01:15:35.226 --> 01:15:37.867]  Destroyed her confidence in polygraphs forever.
[01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:41.930]  This is the woman who is going to stand for women's rights.
[01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:49.414]  And Pelosi talks about children having the light of God in them as she pushes to require abortions.
[01:15:49.414 --> 01:15:50.995]  Very, very telling.
[01:15:50.995 --> 01:15:53.457]  The hypocrisy that's going on at the border.
[01:15:53.457 --> 01:15:55.077]  This should roll all this back.
[01:15:55.077 --> 01:15:55.718]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:07.167]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:16:07.167 --> 01:16:09.529]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:16:09.529 --> 01:16:14.793]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:16:14.793 --> 01:16:19.738]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:23.279]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:27.361]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:16:27.361 --> 01:16:31.683]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:16:31.683 --> 01:16:41.907]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:16:41.907 --> 01:16:44.428]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:16:44.628 --> 01:16:52.831]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:16:52.831 --> 01:16:56.813]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:02.023]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:17:02.023 --> 01:17:10.092]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:17.280]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:22.223]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:17:22.223 --> 01:17:32.851]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:17:32.851 --> 01:17:39.336]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:17:39.336 --> 01:17:41.577]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:17:41.577 --> 01:17:45.560]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.662]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[01:17:59.611 --> 01:18:03.653]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:18:03.653 --> 01:18:08.015]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:18:08.015 --> 01:18:11.677]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:18:11.677 --> 01:18:14.718]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:18:14.718 --> 01:18:22.282]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:25.924]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:18:26.124 --> 01:18:30.630]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:36.597]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:18:36.597 --> 01:18:40.542]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:43.285]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:44.627]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:18:44.747 --> 01:18:46.109]  It's time to take action.
[01:18:46.109 --> 01:18:47.951]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:19:00.404 --> 01:19:02.706]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[01:19:02.706 --> 01:19:10.130]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:20.958]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:19:20.958 --> 01:19:30.204]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:19:30.924 --> 01:19:34.987]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:38.749]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:19:38.749 --> 01:19:40.811]  Experience the new formula.
[01:19:40.811 --> 01:19:43.372]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:19:43.372 --> 01:19:44.713]  Shield your family.
[01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.534]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:20:01.095 --> 01:20:04.678]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.678 --> 01:20:08.001]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:11.164]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:11.164 --> 01:20:13.526]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.178 --> 01:20:28.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.523]  I'm David Knight, your host, and I'm going to be taking some of your phone calls.
[01:20:31.523 --> 01:20:32.884]  Let me give you the Sunday number.
[01:20:32.884 --> 01:20:34.485]  It's a little bit different from the weekday number.
[01:20:34.485 --> 01:20:34.746]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:35.166]  That's 877-789-ALEX or 789-2539.
[01:20:44.898 --> 01:20:51.461]  Now, we've been talking about the hypocrisy of what's going on with the border collapse in so many different ways.
[01:20:51.461 --> 01:21:07.147]  And I want to get your take on that, on the hypocrisy, on the planned economic collapse that we see as NAFTA is going from a law, a trade agreement that they enacted 20 years ago to an accomplished fact as they destroy the borders.
[01:21:07.887 --> 01:21:11.988]  But I want to point out one more article here that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:21:11.988 --> 01:21:18.069]  Obama sends a CIA to the UK to probe terrorist, quote, breeding ground.
[01:21:18.069 --> 01:21:25.011]  In a pointed snub to MI5, he sends a lone wolf mission to interrogate British security experts.
[01:21:25.011 --> 01:21:36.113]  In other words, you guys can't really handle the terrorists in your midst, so we're going to send some CIA guys on a junket to the UK, and they're kind of taking a bit of offense to that.
[01:21:37.202 --> 01:21:45.744]  And it really points out the hypocrisy that we've got again of this story that I read just a few minutes ago about the Mexican military helping drug dealers.
[01:21:45.744 --> 01:21:53.527]  They're assisting these drug cartels coming across the border and get into a shootout with 30 US law enforcement agents.
[01:21:53.527 --> 01:22:04.630]  And of course those are going to be state and local agents because the federal agents have been told to stand down and the FBI again tries to downplay that as being any issue.
[01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:05.390]  And it's not just
[01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:10.892]  drug deals that are coming into our country uncontrolled at the border.
[01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:21.196]  Terrorists from any country can bring anything they wish and yet Obama sends a CIA to the UK to help them to make sure that they aren't a terrorist breeding ground.
[01:22:22.281 --> 01:22:29.566]  We're not going to protect our borders, but we're going to micromanage how they handle things in their country.
[01:22:29.566 --> 01:22:30.847]  Just great.
[01:22:30.847 --> 01:22:32.228]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:22:32.228 --> 01:22:41.134]  Now, we had Jakari Jackson and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs go down to the Nancy Pelosi photo-op yesterday, down at the border.
[01:22:41.134 --> 01:22:41.815]  She was there.
[01:22:41.815 --> 01:22:49.100]  The President of Honduras was down on our borders as well, because, you know, we're all one big happy family now.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:56.546]  And they were not allowed to go and talk to her, even though they had sent their credentials in advance.
[01:22:56.546 --> 01:22:58.628]  They had gone through all the paperwork.
[01:22:58.628 --> 01:23:00.230]  They were held back at a distance.
[01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:04.373]  They were not allowed to get there because this was essentially a photo op.
[01:23:04.373 --> 01:23:06.515]  I don't think anybody asked any questions.
[01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:11.880]  I didn't see her answering any questions, but they had some questions for her and they still asked them.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.602]  Here's a clip that we've got from that.
[01:23:15.353 --> 01:23:18.897]  Miss Pelosi, your daughter said there's no way to secure the border.
[01:23:18.897 --> 01:23:20.680]  Did you fill her head with that nonsense?
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:24.485]  Or is that because you guys just don't want to do your job?
[01:23:24.485 --> 01:23:25.286]  She's rushing away.
[01:23:25.286 --> 01:23:26.227]  This is at a distance.
[01:23:26.227 --> 01:23:27.729]  They're keeping them back quite a ways.
[01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:29.130]  That's why he's having to shout that out.
[01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:31.153]  Of course, no response.
[01:23:31.153 --> 01:23:32.735]  Hello?
[01:23:32.735 --> 01:23:32.935]  Hello?
[01:23:32.935 --> 01:23:33.396]  Hello?
[01:23:33.396 --> 01:23:33.976]  No response.
[01:23:34.915 --> 01:23:35.776]  That's what happens.
[01:23:35.776 --> 01:23:41.160]  That's why they don't want us at these events, because we're going to ask them some questions.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.942]  You know, we might also ask them about NAFTA.
[01:23:43.942 --> 01:23:48.265]  But this is what she had to say in her prepared remarks about NAFTA.
[01:23:48.265 --> 01:23:59.774]  And I've included this now with... I've spliced this in with the remarks from General Petraeus that he made in London about America being over and being replaced with NAFTA.
[01:23:59.774 --> 01:24:00.835]  Here are those comments.
[01:24:01.445 --> 01:24:07.308]  Who comes here sees that this is a community with a border going through it.
[01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:08.349]  Boldly proclaimed.
[01:24:08.349 --> 01:24:12.551]  This is becoming North American decades as the title now.
[01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:28.819]  It's founded on recognition that if you put these three economies together, as has been the case 20 years into the North American Free Trade Act implementation, you find unique countries in terms of demographics.
[01:24:29.099 --> 01:24:38.568]  We're all Americans in this hemisphere, North and South America, and this crisis, that some call a crisis, we have to view as an opportunity.
[01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:40.167]  That's right.
[01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:45.289]  Every crisis is an opportunity if you want to extend your control.
[01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:50.052]  And of course, every crisis needs to have children as a part of it as well.
[01:24:50.052 --> 01:24:53.313]  They always have to be the cause that we're protecting.
[01:24:53.313 --> 01:24:58.455]  You know, the children, if they want to take away the borders, it's so that they can help children.
[01:24:58.455 --> 01:25:05.938]  If they want to take away our right to keep and bear arms, to protect ourselves, to keep a check and a balance against tyranny in this country,
[01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:10.601]  That of course has to be taken away to protect children.
[01:25:10.601 --> 01:25:12.543]  It always comes along that way.
[01:25:12.543 --> 01:25:18.987]  Now, Alex Jones is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour, talking about how the global meltdown has begun.
[01:25:18.987 --> 01:25:26.171]  And I want people to think about how these people who are trying to exercise global control, how they operate.
[01:25:26.171 --> 01:25:28.033]  Look at what they've done with NAFTA.
[01:25:28.737 --> 01:25:33.721]  Now, of course, as Petraeus was talking about, he says, we're 20 years into NAFTA now.
[01:25:33.721 --> 01:25:35.983]  And so now we're ready for North America.
[01:25:35.983 --> 01:25:39.566]  And he made these remarks just before the border began collapsing.
[01:25:41.089 --> 01:25:45.473]  Now, Nancy Pelosi is saying we have a community that just happens to have a border running through it.
[01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:47.535]  Well, it's not a border anymore.
[01:25:47.535 --> 01:25:53.420]  Not anymore than the sense of the border between Texas and Oklahoma, and that's what they're looking at.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:56.482]  They're looking at it being that kind of border.
[01:25:56.482 --> 01:26:03.529]  What they have done is they've operated for 20 years, in their minds, as a North American Union.
[01:26:03.529 --> 01:26:05.771]  Now they're making it an accomplished fact.
[01:26:06.502 --> 01:26:15.285]  In other words, they've had it as NAFTA du jour, as the law, now they're making it NAFTA de facto, an accomplished fact.
[01:26:15.285 --> 01:26:32.012]  And this should really concern us in many other areas, because if you look at things like the NDAA, where they wrote a law that says that they can arrest anyone and hold them indefinitely with the military, without trial, and many other things that they have done, this is the way they operate.
[01:26:32.012 --> 01:26:34.813]  They enact the law to cover their illegal actions.
[01:26:35.453 --> 01:26:41.478]  And then down the road they say we've had this law for 10 years now, 20 years now.
[01:26:41.478 --> 01:26:43.359]  Now we're going to enforce it.
[01:26:43.359 --> 01:26:46.101]  That's the way this is going to happen.
[01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:51.366]  They're going to do the same thing there that they're doing now with NAFTA.
[01:26:51.366 --> 01:26:52.647]  Let's go to some of your calls.
[01:26:52.647 --> 01:26:54.508]  Let's go to Bruce in Ontario.
[01:26:54.508 --> 01:26:56.670]  Bruce?
[01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:57.811]  Oh, hello David.
[01:26:57.811 --> 01:27:04.356]  I was calling because there was a report issued to Barack Obama in 2009 titled North America Next.
[01:27:05.343 --> 01:27:14.607]  And this was issued by Robert Pasteur, who, you know, authored Rebuilding the North American Community in 2001.
[01:27:14.607 --> 01:27:19.829]  So he kind of postulated the North American community into existence.
[01:27:19.829 --> 01:27:27.652]  And now this report, I don't know if the guys in the booth, people at home want to look it up, it's called North American Next, put out by a university in Arizona.
[01:27:27.652 --> 01:27:29.173]  That's North American what?
[01:27:29.173 --> 01:27:30.814]  North American Next.
[01:27:30.814 --> 01:27:30.994]  Net?
[01:27:32.074 --> 01:27:32.794]  Next.
[01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:33.334]  Next.
[01:27:33.334 --> 01:27:33.695]  Next.
[01:27:33.695 --> 01:27:34.135]  Yes.
[01:27:34.135 --> 01:27:34.315]  Yes.
[01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:40.937]  Photo by NACPS, North American Center for Transborder Studies.
[01:27:40.937 --> 01:27:42.878]  And there's a lot of information in that report.
[01:27:42.878 --> 01:27:45.539]  It's maybe a 25-page report.
[01:27:45.539 --> 01:27:58.463]  And if you guys can find it, turn to page 15, because it says right on page 15 that what they want to do is move the internal borders away from the borders and to the factory and the farm.
[01:28:00.584 --> 01:28:10.188]  Well, I think it's interesting that you would have North America next, because that was the question that David Petraeus was answering at that London conference.
[01:28:10.188 --> 01:28:11.769]  After America, what's next?
[01:28:11.769 --> 01:28:13.130]  And he said, well, that's simple.
[01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:14.190]  It's North America.
[01:28:14.190 --> 01:28:20.333]  And he said he had been talking about that with a question mark, and he says, now I've removed the question mark.
[01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:24.755]  So he's removed the question mark, and Homeland Security has removed the borders.
[01:28:24.755 --> 01:28:25.916]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:25.916 --> 01:28:26.596]  People look that up.
[01:28:26.596 --> 01:28:27.556]  It's North America next.
[01:28:27.556 --> 01:28:28.437]  Is that correct, Bruce?
[01:28:28.757 --> 01:28:32.708]  Yeah, North American X put out by N-A-C-T-S.
[01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:33.691]  You just search that.
[01:28:34.373 --> 01:28:38.514]  Turn to page 15 because that's quite significant for what you guys are covering.
[01:28:38.514 --> 01:28:45.196]  We'll let people look that up and we always like to give our sources on things and we have listeners who will actually look this stuff up.
[01:28:45.196 --> 01:28:49.657]  That's the difference between our listeners and those who are listening to mainstream media.
[01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:50.738]  They don't check the sources.
[01:28:50.738 --> 01:28:51.538]  Check that.
[01:28:51.538 --> 01:28:53.718]  Find out what's going on for yourself.
[01:28:53.718 --> 01:28:54.659]  Convince yourself.
[01:28:54.659 --> 01:28:55.219]  You'll see it there.
[01:28:55.219 --> 01:28:59.280]  We'll be right back with your calls and with Alex Jones' special report at the bottom of the hour.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:28:59.620]  Stay with us.
[01:29:00.359 --> 01:29:06.503]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:29:06.503 --> 01:29:09.906]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:29:09.906 --> 01:29:11.527]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:29:11.527 --> 01:29:17.952]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:23.816]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:29:23.976 --> 01:29:27.940]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:31.023]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:29:31.023 --> 01:29:39.291]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:41.393]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:29:41.393 --> 01:29:42.434]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:51.738]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:30:00.413 --> 01:30:06.577]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:06.577 --> 01:30:11.139]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:15.702]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:16.102 --> 01:30:19.043]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:19.043 --> 01:30:24.486]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:24.486 --> 01:30:31.869]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:31.869 --> 01:30:36.010]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:41.113]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:41.113 --> 01:30:41.973]  This is innovating.
[01:30:42.253 --> 01:30:49.736]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:53.998]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:53.998 --> 01:30:59.161]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:30:59.961 --> 01:31:02.202]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.

[01:31:10.267 --> 01:31:17.431]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:31:17.771 --> 01:31:22.395]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:31:22.395 --> 01:31:33.004]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[01:31:59.724 --> 01:32:03.807]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:32:03.807 --> 01:32:08.411]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:32:08.411 --> 01:32:11.833]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:32:11.833 --> 01:32:14.875]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:32:14.875 --> 01:32:22.121]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:32:22.441 --> 01:32:26.325]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:32:26.325 --> 01:32:30.769]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:32:30.769 --> 01:32:36.734]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:36.734 --> 01:32:40.697]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:32:40.697 --> 01:32:43.420]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.781]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:32:44.901 --> 01:32:46.281]  It's time to take action.
[01:32:46.281 --> 01:32:48.102]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:33:01.065 --> 01:33:02.605]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:02.605 --> 01:33:04.646]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:04.646 --> 01:33:07.867]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:11.969 --> 01:33:16.872]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:16.872 --> 01:33:19.153]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.153 --> 01:33:27.297]  We're going to continue with your calls in the next segment but you know this breakdown, this collapse of the border is about economic collapse and here's Alex Jones to break that down for you.
[01:33:27.745 --> 01:33:34.129]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, the 29th day of June, 2014 transmission.
[01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:36.210]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the TV studios.
[01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:38.371]  David Knight is in the radio studios.
[01:33:38.371 --> 01:33:44.375]  I could not be covering a more important issue than the one we're about to break down.
[01:33:44.375 --> 01:33:55.422]  It's now not denied that we're going into a global financial incremental implosion, but undoubtedly it's clear that the orchestrated economic collapse
[01:33:57.350 --> 01:34:00.271]  is being accelerated.
[01:34:00.271 --> 01:34:16.578]  And it's crystal clear that on the ashes of this global world system a highly autocratic authoritarian technocracy is being established in the words of the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group, the EU, you name it.
[01:34:16.578 --> 01:34:24.281]  Europe is the model where they appoint the leaders of Italy and Greece, where they have banker bailouts, where they grab 44% out of your bank account.
[01:34:26.098 --> 01:34:32.180]  And pay it to billionaires, who the government has signed on to their derivatives, bailing them out?
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.901]  This is neo-feudalism.
[01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:40.144]  This is economic slavery, my friends, on steroids.
[01:34:40.144 --> 01:34:48.587]  Now again, it's not my opinion that a global financial economic implosion, from which we're never supposed to recover, is being engineered.
[01:34:49.167 --> 01:34:50.968]  The latest article was in the London Guardian.
[01:34:50.968 --> 01:34:53.890]  Pentagon preparing for mass civil breakdown.
[01:34:53.890 --> 01:35:02.196]  Social science is being militarized to develop operational tools to target peaceful activists and protest movements.
[01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:06.078]  To stop the people from getting out from under the globalists.
[01:35:06.078 --> 01:35:07.439]  Another article in the Guardian back in 2007.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.861]  Got a Ministry of Defense report.
[01:35:10.861 --> 01:35:15.422]  Revolution flash mobs and brain chips, a grim vision of the future.
[01:35:15.422 --> 01:35:19.884]  Total police state with a brain-chipped population to control us.
[01:35:19.884 --> 01:35:21.705]  That is the British Ministry of Defense.
[01:35:21.705 --> 01:35:25.426]  You cannot make up the magnitude of the sci-fi tyranny.
[01:35:25.706 --> 01:35:38.269]  Let's look at a quote from Henry Kissinger, and he said similar things in a New York Times article, where he said back in 1991, in Evian, France, at a Bilderberg group meeting, Today, America would be outraged if U.N.
[01:35:38.269 --> 01:35:40.950]  troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:52.293]  Tomorrow, they will be grateful, this is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that means manufactured, that threatened our very existence.
[01:35:52.873 --> 01:35:57.856]  And he goes on to say it's at that time they would give in to the world government for their safety.
[01:35:57.856 --> 01:36:01.699]  General Petraeus a few weeks ago on the London Telegraph speaking to the Thatcher Group.
[01:36:02.685 --> 01:36:14.774]  said that we're going to get rid of America and bring in a North American Union and their own Banff Canada UN document show they're going to use global crises to get that job done.
[01:36:14.774 --> 01:36:24.340]  In fact he told the New York Times in 2009, Kissinger did, the chance for a new world order was the article, that again crises are the way they're going to bring this in.
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.363]  He also told MSNBC right when Obama was elected
[01:36:28.383 --> 01:36:36.592]  And CNBC, separately, that all these different global crises, with Obama, would help bring in the New World Order.
[01:36:36.592 --> 01:36:38.534]  And what is the New World Order based on?
[01:36:38.534 --> 01:36:44.401]  Cloward and Piven, a sociology program of the Democrats, published in The Nation magazine back in 66, is just one
[01:36:46.403 --> 01:36:55.690]  Plan under the larger Agenda 21 again to bankrupt you and to force you to be dependent on the state and the chicken feed they hand out.
[01:36:55.690 --> 01:37:06.599]  Very, very similar to the systems they've used in communist countries to control populations and under austerity over and over and over again.
[01:37:07.717 --> 01:37:11.241]  Things just get worse and worse, and you're not paying off your own national debt.
[01:37:11.241 --> 01:37:23.395]  Your country signed on to the derivatives, to the too-big-to-fail, trillions of dollars per nation in many cases, tens of trillions in our case, and then you're a debtor to the very people that you bailed out.
[01:37:24.156 --> 01:37:44.376]  Now, the good news is that in places like Greece, where they've been going and even taking 44% out of some of the people's bank accounts to quote, bail out the bankers with these bail-ins in places like Cyprus, there has been such a revolt that they're having to start to back down as the public becomes aware of this.
[01:37:44.376 --> 01:37:46.138]  The New York Times bemoaned the fact
[01:37:46.898 --> 01:37:56.361]  That places like Spain, after many years of austerity, killing their economy further, they're now engaged in tax cuts to try to get the economy going.
[01:37:56.361 --> 01:37:59.182]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50%.
[01:37:59.182 --> 01:38:00.802]  Tax receipts doubled.
[01:38:00.802 --> 01:38:06.304]  The elite know if you cut taxes, it actually brings in more money on average.
[01:38:06.304 --> 01:38:08.485]  Then why do they want higher and higher taxes?
[01:38:08.485 --> 01:38:16.047]  To bankrupt the economy, then the globalist corporations are exempt from those taxes and from those regulations.
[01:38:16.887 --> 01:38:27.538]  Continuing now into the global economic meltdown that we know is transpiring, that we know is unfolding and being accelerated.
[01:38:27.538 --> 01:38:29.680]  Here's just some of the latest news.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.905]  Rising food prices push up Indian wholesale inflation in May.
[01:38:35.948 --> 01:38:41.515]  Meat, poultry, and fish prices spike to all-time highs in the United States.
[01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:44.058]  You're seeing the inflation out there.
[01:38:44.058 --> 01:38:45.721]  International Business Times.
[01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:50.847]  Meat, produce, dairy prices on the rise, while processed foods, grain prices remain stable.
[01:38:50.847 --> 01:38:52.149]  Yeah, the processed crud food.
[01:38:52.409 --> 01:38:54.050]  You're not crazy, America.
[01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:56.492]  Your grocery bill is going up fast.
[01:38:56.492 --> 01:38:59.154]  Upwards of 2.1% in the last year.
[01:38:59.154 --> 01:39:01.056]  And that's with cooked federal numbers.
[01:39:01.056 --> 01:39:03.597]  Try doubling, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:03.597 --> 01:39:11.323]  But meanwhile, the farmers can't even make a living because it's all rigged by computers, like high-frequency trading, at the meatpacking level.
[01:39:11.323 --> 01:39:14.446]  And Americans can't even get jobs because the illegal aliens do that.
[01:39:15.299 --> 01:39:22.564]  Economic crime rises worldwide, led by theft and procurement fraud, survey shows, out of Reuters.
[01:39:22.564 --> 01:39:27.168]  Again, corruption is accelerating, led by the Fortune 500.
[01:39:27.168 --> 01:39:34.033]  Las Zetas death toll reaches 100,000 plus in Mexico from the phony drug war.
[01:39:34.713 --> 01:39:39.717]  Criminal violence rising in the Caribbean, UN report, more than doubling.
[01:39:39.717 --> 01:39:53.410]  And now what's happening, ladies and gentlemen, they have trains out of Central and South America called trains of death with unlimited tens of thousands a day that Mexico allows in, as long as they don't get off the train, to come up to the U.S.
[01:39:53.410 --> 01:39:55.311]  where the border patrol loads them
[01:39:56.472 --> 01:40:02.681]  On to Greyhound buses with vouchers and ships them anywhere they go to be dropped off wherever they want to go.
[01:40:02.681 --> 01:40:04.643]  We reported that two weeks ago.
[01:40:04.643 --> 01:40:11.512]  Last week, AP confirmed that the White House, ladies and gentlemen, has literally
[01:40:12.521 --> 01:40:14.263]  Ordered this, but will not give details.
[01:40:14.263 --> 01:40:18.447]  So our story has been confirmed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:18.447 --> 01:40:21.270]  But the backlash against this worldwide is accelerating.
[01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:34.763]  They're flooding Europe with unlimited illegals right now, to then be the voting block to vote for further socialism, further control, further banker bailouts, because they're clients of the state, the state itself controlled by the globalists.
[01:40:34.763 --> 01:40:35.443]  In closing,
[01:40:36.184 --> 01:40:37.285]  Look at this headline.
[01:40:37.285 --> 01:40:38.787]  Too big to audit.
[01:40:38.787 --> 01:40:41.930]  Large partnerships escape IRS scrutiny.
[01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:45.134]  GAO report shows.
[01:40:45.134 --> 01:40:48.497]  And this is being covered by McClatchy, AP and others.
[01:40:48.497 --> 01:40:51.040]  CNS News is covering it as well.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:57.868]  The big firms have written the regulations where the offshore globalists are exempt and don't even get audited and don't even pay taxes in most cases.
[01:40:58.408 --> 01:41:09.239]  But the average middle-class person, an average blue-collar worker, has had 21 taxes raised on them under Obamacare, seven of them on people at poverty line or below.
[01:41:09.239 --> 01:41:10.300]  Look it up for yourself.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.183]  How is that a handout to the people?
[01:41:13.183 --> 01:41:16.687]  Again, even the New York Times admits everything's rigged.
[01:41:16.687 --> 01:41:18.889]  Even Rolling Stone admits everything's rigged.
[01:41:18.889 --> 01:41:20.090]  But who is it rigged by?
[01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:22.112]  That's the key here.
[01:41:22.112 --> 01:41:24.194]  The global collapse is here.
[01:41:24.194 --> 01:41:29.919]  If millions of illegals are able to come in in the next year off these trains, tens of millions more will come.
[01:41:29.919 --> 01:41:31.341]  It will collapse the border.
[01:41:31.341 --> 01:41:32.862]  It will be a crisis.
[01:41:32.862 --> 01:41:39.648]  And under Rex 84 declassified, they have a plan to bring in martial law to fix the problem they've created.
[01:41:39.648 --> 01:41:45.934]  This is the signal to implode the borders, bring in the North American Union as General Petraeus treasonously said a few weeks ago.
[01:41:46.354 --> 01:41:51.076]  You either wake up, speak out, and get involved, or you will lose everything in the meltdown.
[01:41:51.076 --> 01:41:55.917]  They will take your bank accounts, they will take your pension funds, in the name of stabilizing the system.
[01:41:55.917 --> 01:41:57.398]  It's all being prepared.
[01:41:57.398 --> 01:42:00.839]  How many times have I warned you and told you what's going to happen next?
[01:42:00.839 --> 01:42:04.240]  Because I'm going off the globalist-owned white papers.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.461]  I read the Ministry of Defense reports, the Pentagon reports.
[01:42:07.461 --> 01:42:09.242]  I read what George Soros talks about.
[01:42:09.502 --> 01:42:11.323]  They're laughing at you and your family.
[01:42:11.323 --> 01:42:12.724]  This is all staged.
[01:42:12.724 --> 01:42:16.507]  Back to this live Sunday edition with David Knight.
[01:42:16.507 --> 01:42:19.830]  Don't say you weren't warned by InfoWars.com.
[01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:24.854]  Don't say there weren't people there that told you what was happening and that you could politically speak out and stop this.
[01:42:24.854 --> 01:42:31.278]  This is so treasonous that they've miscalculated and this could literally turn the tide against the New World Order.
[01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:34.181]  They're accelerating their plan because they're already in so much trouble.
[01:42:35.495 --> 01:42:36.716]  So many good things are happening.
[01:42:36.716 --> 01:42:39.378]  They're voting down carbon taxes in Australia.
[01:42:39.378 --> 01:42:42.820]  The Supreme Court ruled Obama can't shut down all the coal power plants.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.761]  Good things are happening because you're waking up.
[01:42:45.761 --> 01:42:47.282]  Now wake up all the way.
[01:42:47.282 --> 01:42:48.323]  Wake up others.
[01:42:48.323 --> 01:42:50.544]  Back to the live transmission.
[01:42:50.544 --> 01:42:53.406]  And we're going to be right back with more of your calls, so stay with us.
[01:43:00.137 --> 01:43:07.302]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:43:07.302 --> 01:43:09.664]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:43:09.664 --> 01:43:14.948]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:43:14.948 --> 01:43:20.112]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:43:20.112 --> 01:43:23.134]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:43:23.434 --> 01:43:27.496]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:43:27.496 --> 01:43:31.818]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:43:31.818 --> 01:43:42.043]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:43:42.043 --> 01:43:44.564]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs.
[01:43:44.764 --> 01:43:52.973]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:43:52.973 --> 01:43:56.937]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:02.962]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:44:02.962 --> 01:44:10.386]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:44:10.386 --> 01:44:21.214]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:44:21.214 --> 01:44:30.460]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:35.242]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:44:35.242 --> 01:44:39.003]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:44:39.003 --> 01:44:41.064]  Experience the new formula.
[01:44:41.064 --> 01:44:43.645]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:44:43.645 --> 01:44:44.966]  Shield your family.
[01:44:44.966 --> 01:44:46.787]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:45:12.852 --> 01:45:17.875]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:45:17.875 --> 01:45:18.916]  Crime directive.
[01:45:18.916 --> 01:45:20.457]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:45:20.457 --> 01:45:23.319]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:45:23.319 --> 01:45:26.541]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:45:26.541 --> 01:45:28.722]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:45:29.162 --> 01:45:30.363]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:45:30.363 --> 01:45:32.544]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:45:32.544 --> 01:45:35.145]  They are never going to stop.
[01:45:35.145 --> 01:45:39.187]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:45:49.192 --> 01:45:53.635]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:45:53.635 --> 01:45:55.976]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:45:58.823 --> 01:46:03.785]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:46:03.785 --> 01:46:07.127]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:09.248]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:46:09.248 --> 01:46:11.409]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:46:11.409 --> 01:46:13.050]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:46:13.050 --> 01:46:16.371]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:46:16.371 --> 01:46:17.952]  If so, consider this.
[01:46:17.952 --> 01:46:26.876]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:46:27.236 --> 01:46:33.620]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.

[01:47:30.078 --> 01:47:31.740]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:37.668]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:37.668 --> 01:47:38.989]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:38.989 --> 01:47:45.217]  I'm David Knight and that special report that we just played from Alex Jones is now live at YouTube as well as at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:46.345 --> 01:47:49.549]  About the global collapse has begun.
[01:47:49.549 --> 01:47:50.711]  And how is it coming to us?
[01:47:50.711 --> 01:47:53.294]  It's coming to us through these open borders.
[01:47:53.294 --> 01:47:56.879]  Through NAFTA being made an accomplished fact.
[01:47:56.879 --> 01:47:58.982]  20 years after they passed the law.
[01:47:58.982 --> 01:48:03.668]  After we've had a couple of decades of industry being moved out of this country.
[01:48:04.409 --> 01:48:05.889]  Now I'm going to go back to your calls.
[01:48:05.889 --> 01:48:08.910]  We're going to go to Kenny in Texas.
[01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:09.970]  I'm sorry, Kenny in Florida.
[01:48:09.970 --> 01:48:15.092]  But before we do, I wanted to tell you about our new Molon Lave belt buckles.
[01:48:15.092 --> 01:48:20.113]  This is a limited run of only 400 of these buckles, 500 per color.
[01:48:20.113 --> 01:48:24.334]  They are numbered on the back and say made in 1776 on the back.
[01:48:24.334 --> 01:48:28.575]  This is the same design, this attractive design you've seen on the t-shirts that we've got.
[01:48:29.175 --> 01:48:34.119]  It's a beautiful buckle, it's a great conversation starter, and it's a way to support our operation.
[01:48:34.119 --> 01:48:38.823]  We're not funded by the government like MSNBC and others.
[01:48:38.823 --> 01:48:43.828]  We're funded by selling you products that we hope you enjoy and that you can use.
[01:48:43.828 --> 01:48:49.973]  Things like Fluoride Shield, which we have a 25% off special on at the InfoWars store as well.
[01:48:49.973 --> 01:48:56.779]  Now before I go to your comments, I just want to kind of summarize some of this hypocrisy that we've seen.
[01:48:57.639 --> 01:49:02.182]  Think about these things that are happening with the collapse of the border.
[01:49:02.182 --> 01:49:16.291]  Think about the fact, as we've got the story up on Infowars.com, we've got Texas small towns that are being bankrupted because they're providing humanitarian aid to people coming across the open borders, and yet the federal government gives them no money.
[01:49:16.291 --> 01:49:20.234]  Meanwhile, the federal government is giving half a billion dollars
[01:49:20.874 --> 01:49:24.176]  to Syrian rebels to start a war there.
[01:49:24.176 --> 01:49:33.002]  Then think about those same Texas small towns that are panicking because they're suffering from violence, gang violence of these same people that are coming across.
[01:49:33.002 --> 01:49:35.284]  Are they getting any help with protection?
[01:49:35.284 --> 01:49:36.305]  No.
[01:49:36.305 --> 01:49:47.673]  Still, Obama is talking about sending not 300 troops but now 500 troops and we've also had a lot of people in the military tell us that their entire units are being deployed back to Iraq to another war.
[01:49:48.735 --> 01:49:50.917]  Look at the fact that we have U.S.
[01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:57.323]  kids, especially middle-class kids, who are not going to get in-state tuition in any state they choose to go to.
[01:49:57.323 --> 01:50:04.210]  They're not going to get full-ride tuition, as illegal aliens do, as their children do.
[01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:06.512]  No, if they want to go get a college education,
[01:50:06.952 --> 01:50:10.074]  They're going to become indebted slaves to the government.
[01:50:10.074 --> 01:50:18.019]  Meanwhile, someone who doesn't live here, who hasn't been paying taxes for these universities, comes in and gets a full ride or in-state tuition.
[01:50:18.019 --> 01:50:20.760]  Look at the criminalization of U.S.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:23.062]  kids even playing in their yard.
[01:50:23.062 --> 01:50:25.263]  As I pointed out back in September 2012,
[01:50:26.824 --> 01:50:29.746]  We have a family where the kid was playing in their own yard.
[01:50:29.746 --> 01:50:33.488]  They got visited four times by the police, twice by social services.
[01:50:33.488 --> 01:50:41.213]  Just this last Friday we had a father who was arrested because his kid was skipping church and a half mile away.
[01:50:41.213 --> 01:50:43.095]  So they arrested the father.
[01:50:43.095 --> 01:50:54.422]  And yet they're telling us that they need to encourage these kids to come across the border to run the gauntlet of drug cartels and pedophile prostitution rings, that that's not child endangerment.
[01:50:54.682 --> 01:50:59.188]  No, when you let the child play in your own yard, if you're an American, that's child endangerment.
[01:50:59.188 --> 01:51:09.042]  But when Obama and Pelosi encourage children, encourage parents to send their children across the border through these dangerous times, that's not child endangerment.
[01:51:09.042 --> 01:51:11.065]  Look at dignity and respect.
[01:51:11.966 --> 01:51:16.831]  Pelosi goes to the border and talks about how we need to do this for the dignity and the respect of the children.
[01:51:16.831 --> 01:51:22.197]  What about the dignity and the respect of children at TSA checkpoints at the airport and elsewhere?
[01:51:22.197 --> 01:51:26.702]  What about the dignity and respect that's owed our veterans at the VA?
[01:51:27.483 --> 01:51:28.864]  They don't get dignity and respect.
[01:51:28.864 --> 01:51:32.488]  They get put on a waiting list that doesn't even exist.
[01:51:32.488 --> 01:51:34.450]  And they die on this waiting list.
[01:51:34.450 --> 01:51:37.473]  Told that they're on a waiting list to get treatment, but they don't even get that.
[01:51:37.473 --> 01:51:42.417]  And then finally, look at the hypocrisy of the war on drugs and the war of terror.
[01:51:43.218 --> 01:52:01.047]  Using that to create a militarized martial law, police state, surveillance state in the United States, and yet the borders are wide open, allowing any terrorist, any drug cartel to freely travel back and forth as they wish, bring anything that they want back and forth across the borders.
[01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:10.571]  That is the blatant hypocrisy of this planned takedown of America that is going on right now with this unprecedented collapse of the border.
[01:52:10.571 --> 01:52:11.832]  This is not a crisis.
[01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:14.855]  This is an opportunity, as Pelosi said.
[01:52:14.855 --> 01:52:16.116]  That's the way she sees it.
[01:52:16.116 --> 01:52:18.178]  Alright, let's go to Kenny in Florida.
[01:52:18.178 --> 01:52:19.639]  Kenny.
[01:52:19.639 --> 01:52:20.220]  Hey, David.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.161]  Great show today, man.
[01:52:21.161 --> 01:52:21.481]  Thank you.
[01:52:21.481 --> 01:52:23.904]  If you guys mainstream, we could turn this thing around in a month.
[01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:25.729]  Well, we hope to.
[01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:28.512]  I hope you all support us at Prison Planet TV.
[01:52:28.512 --> 01:52:29.373]  But yes, thank you.
[01:52:29.373 --> 01:52:30.554]  Go ahead.
[01:52:30.554 --> 01:52:32.015]  I had one question.
[01:52:32.015 --> 01:52:37.821]  Why doesn't the governor of these border states call out the National Guard when they have absolute authority to do so?
[01:52:37.821 --> 01:52:38.922]  And I'll listen offline.
[01:52:38.922 --> 01:52:39.682]  Thank you.
[01:52:39.682 --> 01:52:40.503]  Well, that's a good point.
[01:52:40.503 --> 01:52:44.407]  You know, why doesn't the Congress impeach the president?
[01:52:44.407 --> 01:52:45.468]  Why don't they do anything?
[01:52:45.956 --> 01:52:57.185]  Well, the simple fact, I think, Kenny, the answer is, is that the Republicans are as big a part of this NAFTA takedown of the United States and the planned economic collapse as the Democrats are.
[01:52:57.185 --> 01:52:59.907]  I think that's why they're not doing anything about it.
[01:52:59.907 --> 01:53:02.168]  I think they're perfectly fine with what's going on.
[01:53:02.168 --> 01:53:03.670]  I mean, there's some that aren't.
[01:53:03.670 --> 01:53:06.592]  But for the most part, they're doing this for NAFTA.
[01:53:06.772 --> 01:53:07.893]  They have bought into this.
[01:53:07.893 --> 01:53:09.974]  They believe that it's an accomplished thing.
[01:53:09.974 --> 01:53:13.697]  It's been in the law for 20 years, and now they want to see this happen.
[01:53:13.697 --> 01:53:18.981]  They fundamentally don't have a problem with it any more than Pelosi has a problem with it.
[01:53:18.981 --> 01:53:24.064]  She says we've got a community that just happens to have a border that's not really effective anymore running through it.
[01:53:24.064 --> 01:53:29.408]  That's the way Boehner and these other people think of it as well, as the governors who are really not doing anything.
[01:53:29.408 --> 01:53:35.673]  We've had a token effort from the governor here in Texas, but that's all it is, is a token effort, and most of them haven't done anything.
[01:53:36.094 --> 01:53:39.407]  I don't think the Republican governor of Arizona has done anything about it.
[01:53:39.407 --> 01:53:40.832]  Let's go to Jeff in California.
[01:53:40.832 --> 01:53:41.033]  Jeff?
[01:53:44.175 --> 01:53:49.961]  Hi, actually it's Joe, but that's okay, technology, gotta love it.
[01:53:49.961 --> 01:54:08.217]  I've came to the realization, especially in light of the recent happenings down there on the border, is that there are people, they've been here for a very long time, the government, they're not going to do anything about it, my bad, if that ruffles any jimmies, but the point is that those that are here right now, I
[01:54:10.402 --> 01:54:17.821]  If I knew Spanish, I would be down there at those shelters right now, educating them on the fact that this government is just as BS as their government that they've led.
[01:54:19.528 --> 01:54:26.312]  The goal would be to essentially wake them up and turn them against the daddy government.
[01:54:26.312 --> 01:54:29.374]  We can teach these people to become independent, right?
[01:54:29.374 --> 01:54:29.654]  Exactly.
[01:54:29.654 --> 01:54:31.195]  And not depend on government handouts.
[01:54:31.195 --> 01:54:32.315]  And that's the key, Brendan.
[01:54:32.315 --> 01:54:37.258]  When you said, if you spoke Spanish, say, I believe that that's a large part of why they're bringing them in.
[01:54:37.258 --> 01:54:45.203]  I believe that they want to get people as early as possible who are going to be as difficult as possible to assimilate into the country.
[01:54:45.683 --> 01:54:48.126]  Because they want to bring down a collapse.
[01:54:48.126 --> 01:54:50.469]  Because they want to fundamentally transform America.
[01:54:50.469 --> 01:54:53.913]  And they want to give these people a free ride.
[01:54:53.913 --> 01:54:57.578]  They want to give them lavish welfare on them.
[01:54:57.578 --> 01:54:59.480]  So that these people will be loyal to them.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.521]  I think that's what's going on.
[01:55:00.521 --> 01:55:02.303]  I think that's an important part of what's going on.
[01:55:03.144 --> 01:55:21.240]  It is a battle, but I think that's the difficulty, is that we don't speak Spanish, and that they're going to bring them in and educate them away from their family, away from their culture, and certainly not connected to family, and certainly not connected to our legal traditions here in this country.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:23.742]  Let's go... Yes, go ahead.
[01:55:23.742 --> 01:55:24.503]  Anything else you wanted to add?
[01:55:25.387 --> 01:55:35.228]  But my point is that that is the case, but there are individuals who are aware of what's going on that do know Spanish that can at least make a tent in that.
[01:55:35.871 --> 01:55:36.571]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:36.571 --> 01:55:37.932]  It's an information war.
[01:55:37.932 --> 01:55:47.558]  We haven't necessarily lost that information war, but it makes it even more difficult when they bring in people that speak a different language, and when they bring in very young children.
[01:55:47.558 --> 01:55:48.359]  You know, that's the thing.
[01:55:48.359 --> 01:55:55.063]  Always, you've always heard the phrase, you know, give me a child when he's the age of fill-in-the-blank, a very young age, and he's mine for life.
[01:55:55.063 --> 01:55:57.785]  That's the point of government education.
[01:55:57.785 --> 01:56:02.287]  That's been the point of government education since the time of Plato's Republic.
[01:56:02.287 --> 01:56:04.369]  Now that goes on steroids.
[01:56:04.969 --> 01:56:23.500]  And of course, there's also the fact that they're trying to bring in people who, if they're at a young age, that they're not going to be able to support themselves, because that brings about an economic collapse, an economic crisis, and crisis is always an opportunity for people like Nancy Pelosi and David Petraeus and others who want to fundamentally change America.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:24.601]  Thank you, Brendan.
[01:56:24.601 --> 01:56:27.323]  And Idaho, let's go to Ronnie in Texas.
[01:56:27.323 --> 01:56:27.583]  Ronnie.
[01:56:30.484 --> 01:56:31.485]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:31.485 --> 01:56:44.314]  Yes, my comment is that Ross Perot's phrase of the giant sucking sound, thanks to so-called President, so-called Peace Prize, has become now a deafening roar.
[01:56:44.314 --> 01:56:45.776]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:45.776 --> 01:56:46.116]  That's right.
[01:56:46.116 --> 01:56:47.217]  What do you think we should do about it?
[01:56:49.045 --> 01:56:56.012]  Well, we ought to see if we can get Ross Perot in the White House somehow, or we'll wish back that we, or just think about it.
[01:56:56.012 --> 01:57:01.718]  Just imagine if Ross Perot had been allowed to win.
[01:57:01.718 --> 01:57:07.043]  Well, here's the thing that concerns me, Ronnie, and that is that if we look at the way they rolled this thing out,
[01:57:08.035 --> 01:57:21.771]  They enacted it as a law, and people, if they had enacted it as a law, as NAFTA, as a trade agreement, if they had done that and immediately opened the borders like they're doing now, do you think that would have woken people up?
[01:57:21.771 --> 01:57:23.133]  I think it would have.
[01:57:23.133 --> 01:57:26.557]  But instead, what they do is they enact the law and they let it set there.
[01:57:27.581 --> 01:57:31.325]  And they believe that that gives it legitimacy over time.
[01:57:31.325 --> 01:57:49.182]  And what I'm concerned about is the things that we've seen with FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the fact that they have these secret court decisions, the fact that they have the NDAA, they have put the infrastructure of tyranny in, and they're going to exercise that just like they exercise NAFTA.
[01:57:50.362 --> 01:57:54.404]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:57:54.404 --> 01:57:58.767]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:57:58.767 --> 01:58:02.429]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:58:02.429 --> 01:58:05.471]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:58:05.471 --> 01:58:12.795]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:58:13.035 --> 01:58:16.959]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:58:16.959 --> 01:58:21.383]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:58:21.383 --> 01:58:27.348]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:58:27.348 --> 01:58:31.291]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:58:31.291 --> 01:58:34.034]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:58:34.034 --> 01:58:35.375]  The establishment is not going to do it.
[01:58:35.515 --> 01:58:36.876]  It's time to take action.
[01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:38.696]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:58:50.382 --> 01:58:57.405]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:58:57.585 --> 01:58:59.887]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:58:59.887 --> 01:59:05.173]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:59:05.173 --> 01:59:10.358]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:10.358 --> 01:59:13.381]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:13.661 --> 01:59:17.745]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:17.745 --> 01:59:22.070]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:32.300]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:34.823]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:59:34.963 --> 01:59:35.664]  Coast to coast.
[01:59:35.664 --> 01:59:36.704]  Direct from Austin.
