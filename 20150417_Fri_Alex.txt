[00:00.000 --> 00:05.980]  It's called an IMSI catcher or stingray, a fake cell phone tower that sends your cell
[00:05.980 --> 00:11.120]  phone signal to it rather than a real cell phone tower, netting suspected criminals and
[00:11.120 --> 00:13.680]  innocents alike to pinpoint their location.
[00:13.680 --> 00:17.520]  This is not about the content of people's communications or collecting every number
[00:17.520 --> 00:18.520]  that they dial.
[00:18.520 --> 00:25.120]  To me, it's about we are using some equipment, appropriately in my view, to find bad guys.
[00:25.120 --> 00:29.880]  I don't want to say too much about that because I don't want the bad guys to know how we might
[00:29.880 --> 00:30.880]  be able to find them.
[00:30.880 --> 00:35.200]  It's one of the reasons that we ask local authorities who are working with us and using
[00:35.200 --> 00:37.080]  our equipment not to talk about it.
[00:37.080 --> 00:42.480]  It's not like I got something to hide from good people, I got a lot to hide from bad people.
[00:42.480 --> 00:46.200]  The FBI has been over backwards to keep their public awareness secret.
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.080]  The provisions required by local and state police are straight out of a George Orwell
[00:51.080 --> 00:52.080]  novel.
[00:52.080 --> 00:54.360]  Police are not allowed to talk about the technology.
[00:54.360 --> 00:59.240]  Impress releases and court documents during judicial hearings or during other public forms
[00:59.240 --> 01:00.640]  or proceedings.
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.120]  If a district prosecutor intends to use details about how the stingray works during a court
[01:05.120 --> 01:10.720]  case, police must alert the FBI in order to allow sufficient time for the FBI to intervene
[01:10.720 --> 01:16.800]  to protect the equipment, technology and information from disclosure and potential compromise.
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.320]  If the agency receives a court order demanding release of the information, the agency must
[01:21.320 --> 01:25.920]  notify the FBI in order to allow sufficient time for the FBI to intervene.
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.640]  If the agency receives a FOIA request seeking information about the stingrays, it must alert
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.520]  the FBI to allow sufficient time for the FBI to seek to prevent disclosure through appropriate
[01:36.520 --> 01:37.520]  channels.
[01:37.520 --> 01:42.280]  A dystopian tug of war caused the FBI to have cases thrown out to protect the technology.
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.920]  2012, Buffalo, New York, Judge Patrick H. Neymoyer detailed against the FBI's orders
[01:47.920 --> 01:52.360]  how a deal was struck between the FBI and the Erie County Sheriff's Office to drop criminal
[01:52.360 --> 01:57.440]  charges rather than reveal any information concerning the cell site simulator or its
[01:57.440 --> 01:58.440]  use.
[01:58.440 --> 02:02.240]  The records show that of the 47 times the Sheriff's Office used stingrays in the past
[02:02.240 --> 02:06.440]  four years, it apparently only once obtained a court order, contradicting the Sheriff's
[02:06.440 --> 02:07.440]  own remarks.
[02:07.440 --> 02:11.720]  Stingrays are an advanced surveillance technology that can sweep up very private information,
[02:11.720 --> 02:17.560]  including information on innocent people, said NYCLU Western Region Director John Kerr
[02:17.560 --> 02:18.560]  III.
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.480]  If the FBI can command the Sheriff's Office to dismiss criminal cases to protect its secret
[02:23.480 --> 02:29.680]  stingrays, it is not clear how the $350,000 we are spending on stingray equipment is keeping
[02:29.680 --> 02:31.480]  the people of Buffalo safe.
[02:31.480 --> 02:36.720]  They were more dedicated to the lawless, unconstitutional violation of civil liberties
[02:36.720 --> 02:42.160]  by spying on people without getting search warrants than they were to developing legitimate
[02:42.160 --> 02:45.480]  intelligence which would help secure our freedom or our safety.
[02:45.480 --> 02:49.360]  These records confirm some of the very worst fears about local law enforcement's use
[02:49.360 --> 02:55.280]  of this expensive and intrusive surveillance equipment, said NYCLU staff attorney Mariko
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.680]  Horos.
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.240]  Not only did the Sheriff's Office promise the FBI breathtaking secrecy to keep information
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.640]  about stingrays as hidden as possible, it implemented almost no privacy protections for the Erie
[03:06.640 --> 03:10.080]  County residents it is sworn to protect and serve.
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.280]  It was revealed last year that the federal government is using dirt box devices similar
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.080]  to the stingray device to collect data on the unsuspecting population.
[03:18.080 --> 03:23.640]  The ACLU has identified 50 agencies in 21 states and the District of Columbia that own
[03:23.640 --> 03:24.640]  stingrays.
[03:24.640 --> 03:30.160]  Charlotte is one of the few cities that actually has stingrays and we do see some pretty substantial
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.640]  Fourth Amendment concerns with stingrays.
[03:31.640 --> 03:35.000]  We know that they are collecting at least location information but there could be more
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.520]  information that they are collecting and I think that we really need to see again that
[03:41.520 --> 03:42.520]  warrant requirement.
[03:42.520 --> 03:46.800]  A letter to Homeland Security Chief Jay Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder, Senators
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.440]  Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont expressed their
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.960]  concern that no search warrants are obtained when FBI agents use the devices in public.
[03:56.960 --> 04:00.880]  Police scanner audio obtained by the hacktivist group Anonymous appeared to reveal that the
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.120]  Chicago police were using a stingray to intercept phone calls from an Eric Garner protester.
[04:06.120 --> 04:12.440]  Police departments are now lobbying to get the more powerful $460,000 4G cell phone upgrade
[04:12.440 --> 04:17.680]  known as Hailstorm blocking the current 2G stingray technology requires you to find the
[04:17.680 --> 04:23.080]  device information in your phone known as WCDMA preferred.
[04:23.080 --> 04:27.440]  Change that to WCDMA only and the stingray can't track you.
[04:27.440 --> 04:31.560]  It's open season on our Privacy and Fourth Amendment rights and we're all paying for
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.560]  it.
[04:32.560 --> 04:38.120]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a
[04:38.120 --> 04:44.680]  new world order, a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the
[04:44.680 --> 04:47.280]  conduct of nations.
[04:47.280 --> 04:53.520]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order
[04:53.520 --> 04:59.480]  an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the
[04:59.480 --> 05:01.920]  promise and vision of the U.S. founders.
[05:01.920 --> 05:08.760]  We know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see here
[05:08.760 --> 05:11.360]  and read every single day.
[05:11.360 --> 05:13.360]  It's the illusion of choice.
[05:13.360 --> 05:14.360]  Think about it.
[05:14.360 --> 05:20.080]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[05:20.080 --> 05:25.600]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[05:25.600 --> 05:31.760]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources or you can blindly
[05:31.760 --> 05:35.520]  accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media.
[05:35.520 --> 05:38.080]  Never questioning what you are being told.
[05:38.080 --> 05:40.520]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[05:40.520 --> 05:46.000]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know or have you been programmed to accept
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.720]  someone else's version of events?
[05:48.720 --> 05:49.720]  Think about it.
[05:49.720 --> 05:56.440]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at infowords.com and prisonplanet.tv
[05:56.440 --> 06:01.280]  and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on your mind.

[07:24.120 --> 07:29.320]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[07:29.320 --> 07:34.800]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested

[08:00.560 --> 08:16.000]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.480]  the United States government.
[08:17.480 --> 08:23.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[08:23.480 --> 08:27.480]  Do you still think that Jet Fuel brought down a World Trade Center?
[08:27.480 --> 08:31.480]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[08:31.480 --> 08:38.480]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[08:38.480 --> 08:59.880]  Your story does not add up.
[08:59.880 --> 09:06.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday the 17th day of April 2015.
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.520]  I am your host Alex Jones and what we're being fed is a steady massive diet of lies,
[09:12.520 --> 09:18.680]  lies and still more lies.
[09:18.680 --> 09:23.120]  And we're putting together a compilation right now, Rob Dew is, we're going to be playing
[09:23.120 --> 09:29.000]  coming up at the bottom of the hour, of an Indiana, Washington state and other areas
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.920]  when the police are asked why do you have these MRAPs, these armored vehicles from the
[09:32.920 --> 09:38.440]  Pentagon, they say we need to be able to fight sovereign citizens or libertarians or the
[09:38.440 --> 09:41.200]  Tea Party.
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.200]  Now just add that to all the training manuals and all the admissions and then we start getting
[09:46.200 --> 09:52.840]  footage from Florida and California and other states this week that we've been airing and
[09:52.840 --> 09:59.080]  every time we get footage, they're training to attack and beat and arrest and shoot and
[09:59.080 --> 10:03.160]  kill patriots.
[10:03.160 --> 10:09.600]  And then now we have chilling footage of armed army forces, National Guard blocking roads
[10:09.600 --> 10:14.880]  in California and marching around basically commanding the public.
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.880]  This is what a slow motion martial law scenario looks like and I want to explain something.
[10:19.880 --> 10:25.360]  It isn't that martial law is coming, we're under a form of martial law when the feds
[10:25.360 --> 10:29.800]  seize the airports and started searching everyone, we're under martial law when the president
[10:29.800 --> 10:37.200]  dissolves the borders outside of law, we're under tyranny when they sign us on to over
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.560]  half the global derivatives debt that is private and not ours.
[10:42.560 --> 10:49.720]  It's 2.2 quadrillion worldwide, do the math, that's over 100 trillion, excuse me, 1000
[10:49.720 --> 10:54.640]  trillion, these numbers are so huge that they say we owe that we have no connection to.
[10:54.640 --> 11:02.120]  Our real debt is 19 trillion, that's our debt, not 1100 trillion.
[11:02.120 --> 11:05.280]  That's half of the 2.2 quadrillion.
[11:05.280 --> 11:12.480]  Just five years ago USA Today said that we owed 660 something trillion, that was our
[11:12.480 --> 11:16.960]  percentage, but derivatives have only gotten bigger.
[11:16.960 --> 11:22.520]  But our share was 600 plus trillion, we talk about trillions now where we just round off
[11:22.520 --> 11:24.440]  a few hundred.
[11:24.440 --> 11:30.480]  This is the world being maneuvered towards total and absolute enslavement and we have
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.840]  the military in the Rand Corporation and in all their high level documents that are public
[11:35.840 --> 11:40.680]  admitting they're preparing to take over the states, preparing to basically nationalize
[11:40.680 --> 11:45.680]  labor, preparing to bring us into a North American Union security zone as it's called.
[11:45.680 --> 11:49.200]  And they say in the Banff-Canada meetings from 2007 that they would have this global
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.800]  transformation by stealth and by crisis.
[11:54.800 --> 11:59.720]  So used to we'd have a military drill every week that we would have in the news.
[11:59.720 --> 12:03.320]  Now it's 20, 30, 40, 50 a day.
[12:03.320 --> 12:07.920]  It's tanks rolling around, it's checkpoints, it's citizens being drug out of cars, it's
[12:07.920 --> 12:14.880]  National Guard and Army and Marines marching around very aggressively with their hands
[12:14.880 --> 12:24.160]  on their M16s, with the latest footage shot in Ontario, California by Felipe Soto.
[12:24.160 --> 12:26.520]  I'd like to get him on and get his take about that.
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.600]  We've got another California citizen reporter joining us today that shot the footage of
[12:31.600 --> 12:35.960]  the drills that we were told we were barred from where they're screaming, I'm a citizen,
[12:35.960 --> 12:41.120]  I have rights, I'm a sovereign citizen, then they're clubbed the ground.
[12:41.120 --> 12:47.600]  Do you understand every other country in history has ended up falling to criminal elements
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.680]  inside the government that militarize the police and merge the military with the police.
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.040]  The military fights and kills and breaks things.
[12:59.040 --> 13:02.600]  The military fights a foreign enemy.
[13:02.600 --> 13:06.920]  Police keep the peace and are peace officers and report to the local government and bring
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.880]  people in who have been indicted, who there's an arrest warrant out for.
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.840]  But in this new third world system that we're going into, there is a massive program.
[13:18.840 --> 13:23.080]  No exaggeration, it's got to be 50 times bigger than the Manhattan Project, that they've
[13:23.080 --> 13:28.240]  been keeping quasi-secret because they don't want to have a public debate about militarization
[13:28.240 --> 13:29.760]  of police and all that's happening.
[13:29.760 --> 13:32.960]  And the NSA spines, they just deny it, deny it, deny it.
[13:32.960 --> 13:38.480]  That was in the Guardian yesterday, that federal agencies have a policy of lying.
[13:38.480 --> 13:43.120]  There's no stingray, there's no NSA, there's no plan to take your guns, there's no gun
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.280]  confiscations happening, this is not an assault, this is not an attack, so we're always debating
[13:48.280 --> 13:52.840]  with them whether it's happening or not, and they have this moral authority, there's
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.920]  no helicopters, there's no drills, remember that going on 20 years ago, 15 years ago?
[13:57.920 --> 14:05.320]  We'd get the footage, I'd be attacked on hard copy, on extra, on CNN, on Fox News, in the
[14:05.320 --> 14:11.560]  Associated Press, local papers, I would go to these drills and have them break in my
[14:11.560 --> 14:17.760]  hotel room, harass me, try to set me up, just because they didn't want the public to know
[14:17.760 --> 14:21.880]  that they were there federalizing police and training them with the military.
[14:21.880 --> 14:27.320]  But now it's, of course we are, and we come in peace, but in four wars you can't come
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.880]  to our drill, well citizen reporters still go, and you're trying to take on the Tea Party.
[14:31.880 --> 14:40.800]  Well I mean, sure, duh, we have all your manuals, we know two years ago it comes out, the civilian
[14:40.800 --> 14:47.840]  inmate labor camp, the emergency centers establishment act, and the internment resettlement
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.560]  operations for inside the US, you just type in internment resettlement inside the US,
[14:53.560 --> 14:58.920]  reeducation camps for Americans, army document, and it was declassified, they didn't even
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.880]  hide the document, and it said we'll process you by social security number, we'll put
[15:02.880 --> 15:08.240]  you in a reeducation camp, try to give you a job on the outside, this is during collapse,
[15:08.240 --> 15:12.600]  and the troublemakers will be sent to a higher security facility.
[15:12.600 --> 15:20.080]  But everyone will be sent for reeducation, I mean, that is so over the top ultra epic,
[15:20.080 --> 15:29.040]  army regulation 210-35, summary of change, and then it goes through your social security
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.720]  numbers, how to break the families up, and they went on national news, they went Alex
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.720]  Jones is wrong, it's not for America, thinking you're lazy and won't read the long document,
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.200]  unclassified, there it is, on screen for TV viewers, I'm not trying to scare you, I want
[15:43.200 --> 15:48.760]  to explain something, this is already going on, we already have the biggest prison population
[15:48.760 --> 15:54.520]  in the world, the borders have been imploded, I drove through East Austin yesterday and
[15:54.520 --> 16:00.800]  there were just swarms of out of work people, of whites, blacks, Hispanics, all looking
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.520]  like zombies, just wandering around with plastic bags in their hands, old, young, sitting
[16:05.520 --> 16:10.600]  at bus stops with no jobs, guaranteed all on welfare, we have 100 plus million people
[16:10.600 --> 16:17.600]  on welfare, the country is a ticking time bomb, a time bomb, and you'll say yeah good
[16:17.600 --> 16:21.480]  thing the troops are training, absolutely, the globalists create the atmosphere, the
[16:21.480 --> 16:28.440]  economic conditions, the breakdown, just shutting down, now over a thousand coal power plants
[16:28.440 --> 16:33.480]  in the last 10 years, the acceleration under Obama has more than doubled energy prices,
[16:33.480 --> 16:38.480]  that one move kept anybody from moving here to build factories, that one move decimated
[16:38.480 --> 16:47.200]  savings, that one move bankrupted countless businesses, that one move, we're under military
[16:47.200 --> 16:51.960]  attack, we've been conquered, we've been taken over, now you're about to see the mop
[16:51.960 --> 16:57.720]  up operation, and how are they going to have troops in every city and town that have already
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.200]  formed relationships with the police chief, the sheriff and the local government through
[17:02.200 --> 17:11.040]  these jade helm operations, there's a big announcement there, how are they going to
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.400]  do that, they're going to stage false flags to demonize us, put the internet selective
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.720]  kill switch in to shut down the blogs, they're in congress calling anyone in the blog who
[17:20.720 --> 17:26.200]  opposes corruption a terrorist, we played the clips yesterday, you cannot make it up,
[17:26.200 --> 17:31.120]  we've expected it, we knew it was coming, it appears, and I never said this, I never
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.080]  thought Obama would try to stay in office, I never said that it would go this quick because
[17:35.080 --> 17:39.240]  they've already got us, but they know that people are waking up so they want to finish
[17:39.240 --> 17:46.360]  us, and everything I'm seeing shows that they may actually stage imminent false flags and
[17:46.360 --> 17:51.400]  start the civil war, now if we get really freaked out about this and really upset about
[17:51.400 --> 17:55.840]  this and speak out against this, they may be forced to go slower and back off, but they're
[17:55.840 --> 18:02.040]  testing right now, the military has the lowest morale ever recorded, army morale low despite
[18:02.040 --> 18:08.640]  six year optimism program, USA Today, Christians are leaving the military in droves because
[18:08.640 --> 18:14.640]  they've been told they're not welcome, that's in the news today, this is a purge ladies and
[18:14.640 --> 18:20.640]  gentlemen of anyone that is not a criminal, you need to understand this is a takeover,
[18:20.640 --> 18:23.880]  and I've studied them in Russia, I've studied them in Germany, I've studied them in Cuba,
[18:23.880 --> 18:28.320]  I've studied them going back with Julius Caesar, we know, and every other mainline historian
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.400]  says we're in deep trouble, top Nobel laureate just died and said he's afraid of global fascism
[18:33.400 --> 18:45.040]  and World War three, I mean it is, it is red level people, red level, I have never been
[18:45.040 --> 18:52.720]  more concerned, I have never been more freaked out, I mean this is it, they are, they have
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.880]  the safety off their fingers on the trigger for a total takeover, and they are in the
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.600]  final phases of doing it, I can tell you right now, this is not a drill what we see going
[19:01.600 --> 19:09.280]  on, every piece of humet we get in from the citizens out there, you wonderful patriots,
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.040]  black, white, Hispanic, old, young are sending us video, it's so wonderful to see us working
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.960]  as a team that is not commanded from any central zone, it's basically unstoppable without
[19:17.960 --> 19:22.000]  them totally unplugging the internet, every move they make we're tracking it, but the
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.240]  problem is every piece of intel comes in and it's, they're trying to take us on, they're
[19:26.240 --> 19:31.960]  trying to come to our houses and kill us, if we resist, if not we're going to be handed
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.720]  off to socialist reeducators camps, and I'm just not going man, for those people to come
[19:37.720 --> 19:42.040]  in there and try to turn me and make me serve them and make me go out and you know lie to
[19:42.040 --> 19:46.120]  people, I'm just not doing it, in my name, my family, everything's on the line, I hope
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.640]  you know that, but I'm not selling out to these people, but I'm telling you it's real,
[19:50.640 --> 19:56.280]  they're getting ready to go operational, and you notice the economy's imploding, they're
[19:56.280 --> 20:00.520]  starting wars, I mean all of it's going to hit the fan at once, it's going to be spectacular,
[20:00.520 --> 20:01.800]  we could stop it though.

[21:00.360 --> 21:07.400]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones, when I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights
[21:07.400 --> 21:12.920]  5 days a week, I could swim 2-3 miles, then I discovered the New World Order, the globalist,
[21:12.920 --> 21:13.920]  their agenda.
[21:13.920 --> 21:18.040]  I started an access television show, I was so dedicated to my work, and hanging around
[21:18.040 --> 21:24.320]  with radio guys, that I began drinking, I began smoking cigars, and then even cigarettes.
[21:24.320 --> 21:30.560]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee, to looking like a job of the hut, so
[21:30.560 --> 21:36.760]  I began a journey 5 years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds, I started taking super

[24:28.480 --> 24:42.000]  In a moment, I'm going to play the clip from Spokane Washington, another clip from an Indiana
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.080]  Sheriff's Department, where they say two things.
[24:45.080 --> 24:50.360]  They say the enraps in the federal training are for veterans and sovereign citizens.
[24:50.360 --> 24:52.920]  Now, again, I don't need you to tell me that.
[24:52.920 --> 24:57.400]  I know what your ADL, Southern Property Law Center, federal brainwashing is.
[24:57.400 --> 25:02.120]  We've been blowing their operation from the beginning, 20 years on air.
[25:02.120 --> 25:06.560]  First, we're going to play the clip from Morgan County, Indiana, because I'm glad a listener
[25:06.560 --> 25:11.320]  called in yesterday and said, Alex, they're denying all this is for the patriots.
[25:11.320 --> 25:14.760]  The police, when they get asked, say, no, it's for you.
[25:14.760 --> 25:17.200]  We got a lot of people with guns around here.
[25:17.200 --> 25:22.200]  Do you understand, folks, they're preparing to implode the economy, and you think it's
[25:22.200 --> 25:23.200]  bad now.
[25:23.200 --> 25:24.520]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[25:24.520 --> 25:29.440]  But, again, they won't implode it unless they think we'll go along with it.
[25:29.440 --> 25:30.600]  It's not inevitable.
[25:30.600 --> 25:32.320]  We can still pull out of this.
[25:32.320 --> 25:38.120]  But the globalists are all moving to a distance before they blow the country up.
[25:38.120 --> 25:45.600]  Most billionaires have been evacuating to Switzerland, to Iceland of all places, to
[25:45.600 --> 25:48.800]  the Cook Islands, to New Zealand.
[25:48.800 --> 25:51.400]  I've been telling you this for six years every day.
[25:51.400 --> 25:52.560]  Now it's in the London Guardian.
[25:52.560 --> 25:53.560]  Now it's in the New York Times.
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.560]  Now it's in the Jerusalem Post.
[25:56.560 --> 25:59.240]  All the billionaires have left Israel.
[25:59.240 --> 26:00.240]  All of them.
[26:00.240 --> 26:04.760]  Some still have small homes there, but they've officially moved out to Switzerland and England
[26:04.760 --> 26:05.760]  and New Zealand.
[26:05.760 --> 26:09.320]  The top, I told you, the top movie stars.
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.080]  Before it even happened, I told you they were moving by name.
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.080]  The maker of Titanic, you name it, have moved to New Zealand.
[26:18.080 --> 26:24.440]  They're all getting back before they blow the country up.
[26:24.440 --> 26:27.800]  And that's why they're willing to have a civil war here because they're going to sit
[26:27.800 --> 26:36.040]  off shore while we're in the fire and they're going to roast hot dogs like it's a camp out.
[26:36.040 --> 26:37.320]  It's funny to the globalist.
[26:37.320 --> 26:40.400]  They never get their hands dirty.
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.400]  They're going to sit here while the police and military destroy themselves, find the
[26:44.400 --> 26:45.920]  American people.
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.040]  Can you imagine what the patriots, if one percent stand up, are going to do to the military
[26:50.040 --> 26:51.040]  and police?
[26:51.040 --> 26:56.120]  I hear this military line that we've tracked their ISPs, it's a megaphone, it's a sock
[26:56.120 --> 26:57.120]  puppet.
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.440]  Israelis call it megaphone, Pentagon calls it sock puppet, fake computer.
[27:01.440 --> 27:05.760]  It'll be posted 20 times every five seconds on different pages.
[27:05.760 --> 27:08.880]  And the sock puppet, private companies have them, you know, they'll say, I made a lot
[27:08.880 --> 27:11.400]  of money doing this, working for Google.
[27:11.400 --> 27:14.200]  Most of it's corporate spam, but a lot of it's government.
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.160]  We can track it even back to the PR firms that are doing it, we've done reports on it.
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.280]  And there they're going, we got hell, fire missiles and a patch, we'll take you all out.
[27:22.280 --> 27:25.560]  Really, did you take the Iraqis out?
[27:25.560 --> 27:28.080]  How about the Afghanis?
[27:28.080 --> 27:30.600]  That's a tiny fighting force compared to the American people.
[27:30.600 --> 27:35.120]  And I'm not looking for this war, because if we have this war, we've lost the first
[27:35.120 --> 27:36.600]  major phase.
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.400]  Winning is not having the war.
[27:38.400 --> 27:41.840]  Winning is having the states take things back and doing it peacefully and letting the globalist
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.720]  try a few false flags, but exposing those, we can beat them.
[27:46.720 --> 27:53.360]  But I'm telling you, I'm telling you, they want to have the false flag.
[27:53.360 --> 27:59.160]  And then when they try to come get our guns, they know people are going to start resisting.
[27:59.160 --> 28:04.160]  And I can't blame people, you know, they're trying to take it a reeducation camp.
[28:04.160 --> 28:07.480]  And right now they're just coming to talk to you about your guns with knock and talk
[28:07.480 --> 28:14.280]  from Dallas to Boston, from LA to Miami, they come and we want to talk about your guns.
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.200]  We know you, we've seen your Facebook, you're a, you're a libertarian and a veteran.
[28:18.200 --> 28:20.480]  Now it's, we want you to come down to the thing and talk to us.
[28:20.480 --> 28:24.720]  They're just getting used to getting in the car and going and then pretty soon the truck
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.680]  pulls up and a bunch of 20 year olds get off with their guns and stack up to come in your
[28:30.680 --> 28:31.680]  house.
[28:31.680 --> 28:35.640]  Let me tell all those young boys something, only in the first phase are you going to
[28:35.640 --> 28:38.040]  have fun killing the vets and people.
[28:38.040 --> 28:44.600]  Within one day you pull in this stuff, there's going to be major retaliation, major.
[28:44.600 --> 28:47.800]  When they bust a cap in my head, can you imagine what's going to happen?
[28:47.800 --> 28:49.640]  And that's their plan.
[28:49.640 --> 28:54.840]  And these pieces of crap are going to sit offshore and laugh the whole time as America
[28:54.840 --> 28:55.840]  tears itself apart.
[28:55.840 --> 28:58.680]  I'm sick of this crap.
[28:58.680 --> 29:01.880]  This is serious people and we've got to stop it right now.
[29:01.880 --> 29:04.720]  Are we this dumb?
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.040]  I'm trying to be controlled here, but let's go out to break with the county in Indiana
[29:09.040 --> 29:10.440]  talking about how it's for veterans.
[29:10.440 --> 29:11.440]  Here it is.
[29:11.440 --> 29:15.280]  We really didn't have the, the violence that we see today.
[29:15.280 --> 29:21.000]  The weaponry is totally different now than it wasn't in my, the beginning of my career.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.960]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.920]  and the knowledge to, to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[29:28.920 --> 29:33.200]  Morgan County Sheriff's commander, Dan, we're going to go to break folks.
[29:33.200 --> 29:37.760]  What he said is a direct Southern Properties Law Center, globalist Ford Foundation written
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.760]  script.
[29:38.760 --> 29:42.600]  There's been no, no IEDs from veterans, veterans with the lowest crime rates, they've done
[29:42.600 --> 29:47.280]  nothing wrong and there isn't heavier weaponry than there was when he got in law enforcement.
[29:47.280 --> 29:50.840]  It's all lies, lies, you liar.
[29:50.840 --> 29:52.120]  We're on the march.
[29:52.120 --> 29:54.520]  The empire's on the run.
[29:54.520 --> 30:01.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.400 --> 30:05.160]  We all know the countless cases where young black men had drugs or guns planted on them
[30:05.160 --> 30:06.400]  by police.
[30:06.400 --> 30:10.160]  Now the tables have turned by former black police officer, Jeffrey Walker from Daily
[30:10.160 --> 30:11.160]  Mail.
[30:11.160 --> 30:14.840]  A disgraced ex-police officer testifying against his drug squad colleagues acknowledged
[30:14.840 --> 30:19.280]  on Tuesday that he stole drug money, planted evidence and lied on paperwork too many times
[30:19.280 --> 30:20.280]  to count.
[30:20.280 --> 30:25.720]  His victims in his own words were white college boy, khaki pants types who were easy to intimidate.
[30:25.720 --> 30:29.840]  Now that Mr. Walker is out of a job, maybe he should try his hand at the DEA, apparently
[30:29.840 --> 30:33.400]  having wild sex parties and accepting gifts from drug dealers and working with the Sena
[30:33.400 --> 30:35.200]  Loa Cartel is no big deal.
[30:35.200 --> 30:40.480]  DEA head Michelle Leonhardt said, I can't fire, I can't recommend a penalty when asked
[30:40.480 --> 30:45.000]  why she has not fired or revoked the security clearance of agents named in the March 2015
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.680]  OIG report which included an account of an agent hitting a prostitute in the face with
[30:48.680 --> 30:50.600]  a glass over a money dispute.
[30:50.600 --> 30:54.080]  So Mr. Walker, you can probably get a job with the biggest drug dealers on earth and
[30:54.080 --> 30:56.120]  continue your disreputable ways.

[32:59.600 --> 33:28.080]  It's hard to believe we're here watching the takeover and fall of the republic.
[33:28.080 --> 33:34.680]  Borders are gone, dollars being devalued, our tax money is being used to train the military
[33:34.680 --> 33:41.960]  with billions of rounds of ammunition with the police and humet citizens on the ground
[33:41.960 --> 33:44.000]  to take on the American people.
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.120]  We now have the most incredible footage coming up after Joe Biggs leaves us who has his own
[33:48.120 --> 33:53.000]  amazing reports from the Texas border there in the hot zone in El Paso and he's been
[33:53.000 --> 33:59.240]  over the border successfully yesterday finding a large mosque barbed-wired walled compound
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.760]  near where they say there's the ISIS training camp and it is a mosque, it is Middle Eastern,
[34:05.760 --> 34:14.920]  it has domes, it has a little prayer tower, it has a parapet, that's just on one corner,
[34:14.920 --> 34:17.920]  it's very large, mosque found near reported ISIS base.
[34:17.920 --> 34:21.800]  Here's the other headlines, cameras on southern border captured daily streams of illegals
[34:21.800 --> 34:26.600]  singing in the US startling images of immigrants with drugs and guns, Jeb says legal status
[34:26.600 --> 34:35.040]  for aliens rational and thoughtful, yeah it's part of your dad's new world order.
[34:35.040 --> 34:40.600]  Simply amazing and then now we have out of Big Spring City Council the most amazing group
[34:40.600 --> 34:46.080]  of clips where they admit that foreign troops in the future will be involved in Jade Helm,
[34:46.080 --> 34:53.160]  that Jade Helm will now happen every year, that they need civilian cooperation to let
[34:53.160 --> 34:58.880]  them secretly stay in barns and houses and to transport them in secret operations.
[34:58.880 --> 35:03.960]  This is all about creating safe houses and identifying who will work with them during
[35:03.960 --> 35:08.320]  takeovers of different areas that have been identified as resistance zones and it's to
[35:08.320 --> 35:11.240]  see which police chiefs and others are going to work with them, which mayors and others
[35:11.240 --> 35:15.080]  are going to work with them and I know this because I found out about it from the Chief
[35:15.080 --> 35:18.880]  of Police of San Antonio and it's in my police state film the interview is online the whole
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.560]  film is online for free police state 2000 where they tried to bribe the police chief
[35:23.560 --> 35:26.000]  and they were able to buy off the rest of the city.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.560]  The mayor, the fire department everybody else took the money 200,000 a piece and they were
[35:31.560 --> 35:36.480]  corrupted and then the next wave came in and they paid them off too and that was the big
[35:36.480 --> 35:41.400]  cities now they're getting down to the small towns and this is how you take over a third
[35:41.400 --> 35:45.840]  world country as you come in and buy folks off beforehand to not see model how they took
[35:45.840 --> 35:51.720]  over France with the Vichy.
[35:51.720 --> 35:54.840]  They were asked how often they have operations like this they say it's the first and that
[35:54.840 --> 36:00.360]  will be every year, foreign troops, NATO and DHS they go on to say they're going to have
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.520]  people in civilian attire.
[36:05.520 --> 36:09.360]  The local police are going to be involved as if this is for overseas and they'll have
[36:09.360 --> 36:14.240]  some dual use in that but no it's for America and the MRAPS are for America and I want to
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.800]  go to that clip out of Spokane where there's the admission that the MRAPS are for the sovereign
[36:19.800 --> 36:23.560]  citizens you just heard them in Indiana say it's for the veterans because they're so violent
[36:23.560 --> 36:28.160]  now and with IEDs and the feds are telling every department for six years you will be
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.680]  bombed by veterans you will fight them they're the enemy.
[36:31.680 --> 36:38.560]  So when you get bombed do you think it's the veterans or the people that told you it was
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.480]  going to happen I mean how obvious is this a frame up now don't worry once the civil
[36:42.480 --> 36:52.160]  war starts and you've drug veterans brothers often people and killed them in camps oh yeah
[36:52.160 --> 36:58.320]  then you better be in cattle trailers you better be in civilian clothes because the American
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.600]  people are going to come after you and I have no wish for this to happen George Soros and
[37:02.600 --> 37:07.160]  others are going to sit offshore and laugh the whole time but we have huge breaking news
[37:07.160 --> 37:15.080]  documents this is CNN National Guard ordered to consider Americans as enemy forces and adversaries
[37:15.080 --> 37:19.080]  internal briefings read like a strategy for going to war what do you think is going on
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.800]  that's CNN Steve Watson has an article in info wars dot com breaking it down video
[37:23.800 --> 37:29.240]  armed National Guard trips patrol residential streets of California aggressively I mean they're
[37:29.240 --> 37:34.920]  marching around in aggressive battle formation blocking traffic arrogantly with M16s slung
[37:34.920 --> 37:39.960]  across their breasts with their hands near the trigger they're not slung over their backs folks
[37:45.240 --> 37:49.880]  and once the civil war starts a whole phalanx of a hundred National Guard marching on the
[37:49.880 --> 37:58.040]  old street 1776 Lexington and Concord my god it's getting ready to kick off and they're
[37:58.040 --> 38:04.280]  going to kick it off folks just like Lexington and Concord and the National Guard is giving
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.720]  the same memos that we got from the Coast Guard yesterday where they said prepare for veterans
[38:09.720 --> 38:18.120]  on Veterans Day to start attacking federal installations the kickoff will be by them
[38:18.120 --> 38:23.800]  false flagging us then when they attack the Patriots the Patriots left to defend it'll be spun
[38:24.440 --> 38:30.280]  that we've killed kids and police officers and all this then it all kicks off all hell breaks loose
[38:30.280 --> 38:38.280]  you will see the rest of the elite leave the country or hide in DC or hide in the Ozarks
[38:38.280 --> 38:42.200]  on those command bases this is the take down of America look they're willing to go to war
[38:42.200 --> 38:46.440]  to take over Russia of course they're willing to go to war to take us over you're seeing history
[38:46.440 --> 38:52.600]  right now now former staff sergeant the army Joe Biggs who was stationed down there at Fort
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.720]  Bliss and his last duty station had great contacts I'll just leave it at that was able to get into
[38:57.720 --> 39:03.880]  Mexico with local guides into the most dangerous area arguably of Mexico there's one area by the
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.440]  Guatemalan border that may be even more dangerous from the maps I've had top university
[39:08.440 --> 39:13.800]  scientists professors on about the most dangerous areas and written books on it that area across from
[39:15.400 --> 39:20.520]  El Paso has had more than a hundred large mass graves found just the last five years
[39:20.520 --> 39:24.600]  they've been having mass graves going back since I was a kid it is probably one of the
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.000]  most dangerous places in the world and Joe Biggs was able to get in there for a few hours
[39:29.800 --> 39:35.160]  he's able to fly over the day before that he was able to get in and we have the HD footage
[39:35.160 --> 39:41.880]  up on info wars.com also the live stream he did of some very suspicious things just flying over
[39:41.880 --> 39:47.960]  once we caught white trucks with men marching in black uniforms by what looks like combat simulation
[39:47.960 --> 39:56.200]  areas right down the street a big pink and green Arabic style deal which is very rare in in Mexico
[39:57.560 --> 40:02.120]  you could say Mexico is almost Islamophobic obviously because that's from the Spanish culture
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.960]  who dealt with the Moors invading repeatedly and that was what the little reconquista originally
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.920]  was with the Spanish taking Spain back with a big European force that came in to help them
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.560]  but that's why the Spanish used to be blonde haired blue eyes look like Germans they're
[40:15.560 --> 40:20.440]  basically almost a Germanic group basically till they got taken over by North Africans so it's now
[40:20.440 --> 40:25.640]  an interesting hybrid but that's just some history for you we're showing HD footage Joe Biggs shot
[40:26.440 --> 40:34.760]  of the what is that about a 12 14 foot wall barbed wire up on the top spikes looks like
[40:34.760 --> 40:44.040]  men are rats watch towers Constantino wire we need to investigate this further Joe Biggs joins
[40:44.040 --> 40:49.160]  us great job compadre uh breakdown what happened Joe Biggs tell us where you're at right now
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.280]  Joe Biggs here info wars dot com we're actually at the base of the Franklin Mountains uh the far
[40:54.280 --> 40:59.560]  west side of El Paso Texas uh yeah yesterday was uh pretty intense to say the least i've done some
[40:59.560 --> 41:04.680]  crazy things in my life and going into an opera which is probably one of the most dangerous cities
[41:04.680 --> 41:10.760]  in the world without a gun without any kind of protection in a truck with us plates that was
[41:10.760 --> 41:16.040]  a pretty shiny truck that sticks out like a like a sore thumb if i would have sat on a lump of coal
[41:16.040 --> 41:22.680]  it uh would have been a diamond pretty quick well did you know breakdown what happened
[41:23.960 --> 41:28.280]  so we get over the border and when you get over the border it's like you completely just flip and
[41:28.280 --> 41:33.080]  go to the other side of the world i mean as soon as i was 200 yards away from the border i've never
[41:33.080 --> 41:39.720]  felt so far away from america in my entire life i mean war is just this crazy booming little city
[41:39.720 --> 41:44.520]  where everyone's just moving a million miles an hour and it's not what you would expect i mean the
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.560]  the cartel wars have definitely simmered down in Juarez but as we made our way into an opera
[41:49.560 --> 41:55.480]  well that's a whole different uh story that is completely ran by the cartels the mexican military
[41:55.480 --> 41:59.640]  and there's five different types of police in that area from what my buddy anthony was something
[41:59.640 --> 42:04.840]  the guy who drove me in and you don't know who's bought out by the cartels you see spotters standing
[42:04.840 --> 42:08.200]  on the side of the road just hanging out in the middle of nowhere with a cell phone and they're
[42:08.200 --> 42:12.280]  just watching and the biggest thing you have to do when you're out there is not raise any kind of
[42:12.280 --> 42:17.000]  suspicion because as soon as one of those spotters sees you calls it in and suspicious the cartel is
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.200]  going to be so it was very intense and once we got on the ground you're able to see a lot of these
[42:22.200 --> 42:28.280]  compound style buildings that i saw over in iraq i mean the entire place itself looks much like
[42:28.280 --> 42:34.360]  iraq trash everywhere desolate i mean it's just horrible dead animals with rigor mortis just all
[42:34.360 --> 42:39.320]  over the side of the road puddles of blood i mean it was a very intense atmosphere to be in
[42:39.320 --> 42:45.960]  and it's definitely an area that isis would feel comfortable in and feel comfortable in and essentially
[42:45.960 --> 42:51.320]  do these types of missions so it was really interesting being out there and trying to film
[42:51.320 --> 42:59.160]  and then also at the same time stay low key and not be called out let's get into this facility uh
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.960]  i know you found some other interesting areas but you pointed out yesterday that in afghanistan
[43:03.960 --> 43:09.400]  you didn't know that a mile away was a major taliban training base that was launching a tax on you
[43:09.400 --> 43:13.400]  because it had these big walls around exactly until there was reconnaissance flights so it's
[43:13.400 --> 43:18.840]  really hard uh people are like expecting you who went in to instantly find it uh we're just trying
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.000]  to draw attention so that government and others get involved to actually you know force people to
[43:23.000 --> 43:31.080]  look into this because the fbi south com of all said al qaeda isis is in the area yeah exactly i
[43:31.080 --> 43:35.880]  mean it would take multiple trips to get in there and try to find out what's going on i mean we
[43:35.880 --> 43:40.760]  spoke to one gentleman yesterday who worked for uh the city of water and he had a little emblem
[43:40.760 --> 43:44.600]  up on his shirt and we asked him if he knew any muslims and he's like no no no i don't know anything
[43:44.600 --> 43:49.320]  about that and then uh as we started to pull away he laughed he goes as if i did i wouldn't tell you
[43:50.360 --> 43:53.800]  so you know that there's some people who were acting a little strange over there but
[43:53.800 --> 43:59.800]  you know that's expected i didn't expect to see any like large isis flags waving around in the area
[43:59.800 --> 44:05.000]  because that would definitely set off uh you know suspicion for the locals in that area as well and
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.040]  i don't really see them being very uh welcome to that kind of well i've been i've been in war as
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.920]  you know 20 years ago before it really got bad and i've been around that area as well and i've been
[44:14.920 --> 44:21.640]  you know bokeh ish i mean just all over uh the entire border of brownsville uh into mexico across
[44:21.640 --> 44:27.480]  there i've never seen something that looks like a mosque uh did you ask locals anything i mean
[44:27.480 --> 44:32.760]  what did your guides say i mean yeah i mean all the that looked aerobic 100 percent oh yeah i mean
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.760]  that's what my guide said i mean he spotted it and he goes whoa that's weird that's weird and he
[44:36.760 --> 44:42.280]  drove over there i mean when he was a teenager for them to try to prove that they were uh like really
[44:42.280 --> 44:46.760]  tough or hard they would try to drive into an opera and stay there the longest and whoever
[44:46.760 --> 44:50.920]  stayed there the longest was deemed you know like a really hardcore type of kid so that kind of gives
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.960]  you the atmosphere of that place and he said that's something that's very strange to be there and also
[44:55.960 --> 45:00.680]  when we spoke to a number of the people everyone said no no no there's no muslims here this is all
[45:00.680 --> 45:05.000]  christian there's no muslims here so for something like that to be there it definitely sticks out
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.080]  it's definitely strange it's definitely something to keep an eye on but it looks like there's cameras
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.480]  on the building as well yeah i saw that and and then it looks like they're building some more
[45:13.480 --> 45:19.400]  minarets i see constructions going on inside yeah exactly i definitely saw some cameras out there
[45:19.400 --> 45:23.480]  that area is just so desolate i mean if someone wanted to go in there and infiltrate that area
[45:23.480 --> 45:27.800]  and stay low-key in those areas and set up a base camp it would be a hundred percent possible
[45:27.800 --> 45:33.320]  without a doubt how many square foot would you say the building is just estimating and versus it
[45:33.320 --> 45:37.560]  looks like there's a larger compound around it and look like the walls are 12 to 14 feet
[45:38.680 --> 45:44.760]  yeah exactly somewhere around that time um it's about the size of like three
[45:46.120 --> 45:49.000]  nice size homes in austin and there's a pretty big area
[45:49.000 --> 45:57.480]  it is very very bizarre well joe great job going in there um they're continuing to try
[45:57.480 --> 46:02.440]  to whitewash the whole thing i know you're going to the new mexico area you may already be there
[46:02.440 --> 46:06.600]  and you're going to investigate those mountains where the mexican authorities have told the federal
[46:06.600 --> 46:12.200]  government and judicial watch that they have spotted isis with spotters uh who are now doing
[46:12.200 --> 46:16.600]  coyote operations which are very lucrative we know isis is involved in all sorts of criminal
[46:16.600 --> 46:21.960]  operations trafficking in the middle east in africa they're reportedly trafficking arabs
[46:21.960 --> 46:27.320]  just to make money into the country not even so much terrorist well the interesting thing about
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.240]  the part where we're at yesterday josh was on the other side of the border and he was at the
[46:31.240 --> 46:36.680]  crystal ray mountain range where there's a big cross on top on the other side of that is an opera
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.920]  and we spoke to the border patrol yesterday or he did i should say and uh he said that uh in that area
[46:42.920 --> 46:49.480]  there was uh it was probably the largest crossing point for illegals from that area into here
[46:50.280 --> 46:53.800]  and uh he said there's these deep crevices everywhere you can see an officer just gave
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.640]  us a ticket for parking on the side of the road right here this guy just came up and gave us a
[46:57.640 --> 47:04.840]  ticket a second ago a cop just went by and said we were okay wait a minute he also gave you a ticket
[47:04.840 --> 47:08.680]  yeah he just sat there he didn't say anything he just put a ticket in my on the front dashboard
[47:08.680 --> 47:15.000]  so in america they order the border patrol to let the illegals come across and to give them vouchers
[47:15.000 --> 47:21.240]  and to pay for everything to let them drunk drive that's mainstream news cbs news was that uh federal
[47:21.240 --> 47:25.960]  or was that uh park service uh he's like a park police officer i'm just gonna take it and throw
[47:25.960 --> 47:29.640]  it up i mean that's just ridiculous i would follow him and i bet they flip out and say what are you
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.200]  doing give me a ticket for parking on the side of a dirt road i mean what planet are these people on
[47:34.200 --> 47:37.720]  yeah you see you're a citizen though with plates
[47:40.440 --> 47:43.240]  i mean and the border patrol was down here yesterday telling josh and hey
[47:43.960 --> 47:48.040]  there's tons of illegals who come through in this one area where i was out on the other side
[47:48.040 --> 47:52.680]  because there's no border fence whatsoever they come through these deep crevices and walk through
[47:52.680 --> 47:57.320]  hideouts easily easy to not be seen and he said it's not unusual that at night time you'll hear
[47:57.320 --> 48:01.720]  gunfire out there and just tons of people coming through in that area he said that is the most
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.320]  cross by and all of the border that's right and when they don't pay out probably the coyotes kill
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.200]  them and put them in a mass grave and then um robert rodriguez makes a movie where white people
[48:12.200 --> 48:15.880]  are the ones killing them and putting them in mass graves but you know what it wasn't any white people
[48:15.880 --> 48:21.160]  it wasn't don johnson it's the coyotes killing the people and putting them in the graves yeah exactly
[48:21.800 --> 48:26.680]  but robert rodriguez says it's not it says it's huge oh basically yeah that's me i'm the bad guy
[48:26.680 --> 48:34.280]  i'm the veteran you just got given a ticket what do you make now of even cnn sorry go ahead
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.160]  and apparently i'm uh because i used to be in the military i know how to make iad's that's
[48:39.160 --> 48:44.360]  that's pretty uh pretty much preposterous i mean i have just as much uh knowledge in building iad's
[48:44.360 --> 48:49.160]  is you know martha stewart does i mean i that's something i didn't do in the military that's
[48:49.160 --> 48:54.040]  something that eod would do well they're not branding you as al qaeda and cnn's even come out
[48:54.040 --> 48:59.160]  and said national guard ordered to consider americans as enemy forces and i just played clips
[49:00.120 --> 49:05.240]  where they're saying they need to have armored vehicles to fight veterans job because you're
[49:05.240 --> 49:11.320]  going to bomb them yeah i like i said that that's just so mind-blowing to hear something like that
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.720]  i have no intentions of ever doing that i don't know any men who ever served in the military or
[49:15.720 --> 49:19.960]  women who have just kind of intention well they're coming after you i'm a proud american but i am
[49:19.960 --> 49:24.280]  definitely disappointed with my government i'll say that but well it's an illegitimate government 110

[50:29.240 --> 50:35.240]  citizens we have a video i mean this this is just mind-blowing to know that this 1083 program

[54:44.120 --> 54:49.320]  jade helm 15 while the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war
[54:49.320 --> 54:55.400]  critics say the army is preparing for modern-day martial law we really didn't have the the violence
[54:55.400 --> 55:01.640]  that we see today the weaponry is totally different now than it wasn't in my the beginning of my
[55:01.640 --> 55:05.560]  career sending out plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the
[55:05.560 --> 55:10.440]  ability and the knowledge to to build i eb's they've done nothing you blame them on enforcement
[55:10.440 --> 55:16.280]  techniques in video of them two days ago training to attack sovereign citizens
[55:16.280 --> 55:29.000]  they're training exactly for what
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.120]  a nice thing about this piece of footage is that if somebody is
[55:42.120 --> 55:47.640]  directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in they're safely can pick and pull right up to
[55:49.640 --> 55:54.600]  enemy fire it's still trying to address the threat without being afraid of getting shot
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.840]  so i'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in iraq but we're what kind of a situation in the
[55:58.840 --> 56:02.760]  u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of competition listening to a lot of people

[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:24.760]  we are we saw what was happening 20 years ago we took action i listened to the patriots in and
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.040]  out of government that warned us of what was going on we held back the globalist takeover we slowed
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:37.560]  it down but now worldwide they're moving they're moving fast the amount of military training
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:46.280]  i was thinking about this this morning that has been done to take on the gun owners the veterans
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:58.760]  the patriots is conservatively 200 times what it was when i first got on here 200 times it's it's
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:06.760]  going on in every city and in major sub-city on a monthly basis now that we know of in the news
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.520]  i mean there's military crawling all over the place in army times they said that when they
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:19.960]  finally get ready to take over the us or secure it that they would want to brigade homeland 487
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.800]  thousand troops in their transition back into life and those are the troops that are given
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.280]  questionnaires and trained that said they would fire on us citizens in all of those
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.880]  tests they were given a lot of militaries listening army navy marines you go yeah we were given
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:43.160]  digital tests because they kept sneaking out the paper copies back in the 80s and 90s especially
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:47.880]  the 90s under clinton would you fire on citizens would you round people up i mean there's always
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.240]  been civil unrest training you got to have that but this idea with riot control people burning
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.640]  down a city not oh veterans are the number one enemy they're terrorists we need to practice
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.440]  rounding them up and practice clandestine dressing as civilians and snatching grabs
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.920]  and that's why cuban refugees some famous ones have been in the news going no we saw the footage
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.080]  in miami where it showed them practicing putting bags over people's heads in their houses at night

[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:27.320]  direction it's 180 this is flaming 200 proof tyranny
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.360]  if if if if whiskey's 200 proof it's not whiskey it's moonshine it's pure alcohol
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:41.880]  so i say it's 200 proof i mean it is bona fide you know you think a 15 foot alligator you can
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.240]  catch in louisiana's as big as they are this is like a 20 foot one a 25 i mean there's never

[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:03.720]  our treasure our strength our honor and built a giant stinking monstrosity and then use the

[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:15.160]  by drones and robots in the near future and who's their first enemy to take out if you were this

[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.640]  when they start the civil war what are veterans going to do because see they're going to drag
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.960]  a lot of veterans in question them they'll get scared and then they will they'll say okay go out
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:32.920]  and tell us just like they did at ruby rich he was a green beret gotta get him back on the show
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.320]  and they went to him and they said we want you to go around setting up other groups in the air

[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:58.280]  mountain and be left alone as the same thing over and over again i mean i remember they haven't
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:03.640]  tried it like 15 years but you know they'd have some guys try to beat me up and then set me up and
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.840]  then get me thrown off the radio and then they'd approach me and say you know you're gonna work

[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.640]  and woman in the military and the police and the bureaucracy and the is compartmentalized
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.760]  they just want to pay the bills they just want to go and watch a basketball game

[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.120]  us towards the cliff and we're holding it back and the tires are spinning but it's still pushing
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.440]  us and now we're like a foot from the cliff and then we're going to be six inches then we're going
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:38.840]  to be an inch and it's all going to go over and the complainers are up in the front of the bus

[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.920]  or another allegory as you got the big castle walls and there's arrows coming over and holes

[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:44.040]  and prison planet dot com as their news sources and then bellamy's given interviews since then that
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:49.880]  he was basically approached by the establishment and had his views partially changed uh so that
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:54.840]  he could basically continue on with what he does and see that's what they do they come to you and
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:59.880]  say do you want to keep being successful you want us to shut you up and i'm not attacking matt bellamy
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:07.080]  it's just i love the music amuse excellent band uh if i didn't like their music i could care less
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:13.160]  of the guy was uh you know a listener or not i appreciate the courage of people like billy corrigan
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.800]  who's been threatened to not make political statements or they'll try to shut him down
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:23.560]  and then he just keeps going or a day mustane um or even a charlie sheen despite all his baggage
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:30.600]  and problems at least he is a guy that wants to be good and and and has courage now there's like
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:35.080]  nine of these clips but there's exactly nine of them it will take 20 minutes to air them all
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:41.000]  but it's over the top important a mr mead is a spokesman uh for jade helm that's being carried
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:48.520]  out in 18 towns we know of in texas big spring city council basically told the truth on a lot of
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.760]  stuff but not on others you'll hear a lot of contradiction here who's participating why did
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.720]  you choose texas uh we need civilian cooperation and help people who are willing to allow the use
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:04.360]  of personnel and land and business for secret meetings to be conducted see this is about creating
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:11.000]  their little takeover cult humed i mean i i told you under clergy response and under infregard
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.600]  they've recruited basically or tried to recruit everybody i know i mean every business owner
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.800]  that's you know got a major business that i've talked to they've approached them doctors lawyers
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.720]  most of them have been approached this is a huge operation and it's to identify who will go along
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.520]  the globalists have got a problem though a lot of people they've approached have gone ahead and
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:39.720]  played along and they're smart enough not to give me any information because we're decompartmentalized
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.040]  and we are not centralized there's not even a cellular structure we love freedom
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.880]  we've got the enemy so infiltrated it'll make their head spin
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.760]  you guys are in a lot of trouble that's all i can tell you there are a lot of governors know
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:27:03.240]  what's going on and i uh when you nuke a city and blame it on us it's not going to fly pieces of crap
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:08.440]  i can't believe i'm living in the real deal here i just i cannot believe how evil this is and that
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:12.600]  you people the melissa harris parry's of the world the michael moores and all of you think you're
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:18.840]  going to play civil war black op commando with america you're at you have been successful
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.960]  because you were incremental now you want to push to the next level and and this is incremental
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.840]  just the slowly escalating martial law frog in the pot the problem is it's getting so intense
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.520]  and people know now so at a certain point incrementals on incremental anymore you put a
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:41.640]  piece of paper on top of stove and say it's one of those you know hot top heaters and it'll brown
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.840]  it'll yellow it'll brown and suddenly to go in the flame they put it on top of a flame it'll light
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.760]  and burn incrementally but you put it on top of hot plate it'll heat up a lot slower and won't
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:28:01.720]  burst in the flame as fast but when it does this piece of paper is dark brown it's smoking all over
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:08.120]  and it's about to go and i'm just going to keep my head down i mean a bunch of stuff people get
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:12.360]  shot stuff gets blown up i had nothing to do with it because that doesn't help the liberty movement
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.880]  but you better believe every time there's a terrorist attack or a cop gets shot they blame
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.640]  me with no evidence we're going to go to break and come back and play these clips one after the

[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:30.440]  it's alex jones i'll say it again anybody wants to understand what's happening study how
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:41.560]  the nazis basically had 99 of the french military staying down when the germans ran over the
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.880]  marginal line and invaded france and took the country in just two short weeks and that was
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:54.520]  only battling the british expeditionary force and then forcing them out at duncork at the sea
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:34:05.400]  and then if you want to go further you can see how twice not once most of sudam whose
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:15.160]  saints generals were paid off in both gulf wars previously to stand down and that's because before
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:22.920]  that for over a decade sudam's military was trained in the u.s and were allies from the iran iraq war
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:30.360]  the pentagon even wrote after the fact it wasn't widely published but it was in defense quarterly
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:36.120]  and publications like that how they use the german tactic so i'm not telling you something
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:43.560]  that's my theory i know what's going on under clinton still under bush exploding exploding
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:49.400]  under clinton it went on during bush the same program but quieter it just metastasized under
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:57.400]  obama they are out basically probing every community leader they can every person of influence they
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:03.880]  can radio stations tv stations journalists you name it they legalized domestic propaganda last
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:12.120]  year they already been doing it and they're now quote having the pentagon as they reported last
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:16.840]  year in that press conference the headline of the article was pentagon promises to stop lying
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:22.920]  because of drudge and then it goes on to show the hour-long press conference by the under
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:30.040]  secretary of the army knows of the defense department and they're there with hundreds of
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:34.520]  military in the room and psyops people the heads of departments and they say we'll now go out and
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.560]  help the local media report accurately we're going to be embedded with you and the military gets up
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:44.120]  and goes this people are going to stop lying he's like well not exactly we're going to be involved
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.920]  everywhere to make sure we tell the truth and get their trust back i mean and you look at the morale
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:55.240]  the people in the room they look like they have just been seeing their child die i love how the
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.000]  flags even have the don't tread on these snakes behind him but now they're phasing that out in
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:08.200]  the military and saying it's politically incorrect i mean it's just amazing because they all know the
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:14.840]  psyop is they're now going to triple the line but the good news is the military it's in us today
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.760]  has the lowest morale ever not saying it's good they have bad morale it's good that they're good
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.320]  people that's why they say and when they get out they're the end i mean imagine they're they're
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:29.160]  teaching the army and the military your number one enemies veterans are like that's my brother
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.920]  and my dad me well well they're going to blow stuff up or what we're going to rob a motorcycle get
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:39.960]  tried to get a job have some kids or take care of my kids we're going to blow up cops what are you
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:45.240]  talking about it's like joe big is on tv earlier with us he's going what i'm going to blow i mean
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:56.680]  what is this crud he wants to go water surfing wake surfing on the back of the boat with some girls
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.680]  you don't want to kill people in america this is the biggest stinking frame i've ever seen
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:08.840]  me not predicted you start hearing that patriots have committed crimes with al qaeda and isis this
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:13.720]  week they came out twice and said patriot groups are hacking government servers and then claiming
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.680]  isis has done it with no proof kind of like they released the sony stuff the pentagon and the cyber
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.480]  security and then blamed it on that that idiot kim jong-un that can't even tie a shoelaces
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.480]  although they admit he ties he gets shoelaces tied for him
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:35.320]  so it's the most helter skelter program but here's the deal there's a method to it they
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:41.400]  want to anger the military and get the christians and the patriots people that are awake out and
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:49.320]  then rotate in all their bureaucrats and the new commandos and it's not the new commandos will
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:54.040]  pretty much all be gay must think they're bad because they're gay it's the and i'm that's in
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:38:02.760]  the news today it's that politically they just are a bunch of america hating freedom hating
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:10.440]  property hating gun hating control freaks who dream of some glorious civil war with the american
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:17.240]  bitter clingers i mean once you actually attack the bitter clingers it's all over dummy it's like
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:27.480]  going up to a full grown grizzly bear and punching it in the nose you're such idiots you really have
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:34.840]  taken our restraint as a sign of weakness instead of extreme control extreme control
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:42.840]  because every passing day the power of the liberty movement grows and more people wake up
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.200]  and every passing day your tyranny bleeds to death we're killing you by tens of millions of cuts
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:54.280]  writing websites on money on walls telling people calling into radio running for office
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:01.880]  voting with our dollars supporting independent media citizen journalists everywhere documenting
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:08.360]  what you're really doing not what you say to your pr machines ground to a halt you want to have a war
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:14.360]  with the american people and you think you're going to win that when you come out in the open
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:17.000]  i don't care how many false flags you pull it's over
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:24.520]  but they know that they want their failed system to bring the country down and then that will
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.640]  break the country regardless and then they come in after the long winter the long depression
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.080]  and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:40.200]  after we've all wiped each other out that's the plan
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:48.600]  you see you couldn't take america down from outside there'd be a rifle behind every blade of grass
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:54.760]  to quote admiral yamamoto a fear we've awakened a sleeping giant
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:01.480]  he had to try to convince him no we don't want to try to land
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:09.880]  in origan with troopships it's not going to go well nowadays if they landed in troopships
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.520]  wearing peak uniforms going tranny tranny tranny literally everyone would just kneel and go
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:21.160]  and just here are our children if it's politically correct don't be racist shooting everybody i mean
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:25.400]  that's what political correctness is drink your fluoride take your obama care open your borders
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:33.080]  pay for everything or you're a racist it's it's it's it's just a psychological war but once the
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:38.360]  trance is lifted and and and the sleeping giant is starting to wake up once the trance is lifted
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:45.560]  people have a very fast learning curve once they're broken the mind control i want to go to these
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:52.600]  clips but basically all hell is now breaking loose the only way to take over is from within
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:58.840]  a Cicero set about Rome the you know the the outside invader comes with their banner openly
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:06.280]  it's the traitor within that infiltrates we've been taken over like vc france like iraq we've
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:13.080]  been infiltrated with a classic cia ran corporation takeover program and it's a big nut to crack but
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:19.080]  man they're doing it off the spree to core the military getting all these wannabes all these
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:23.320]  guys you know that are like 70 something years old nothing against that but i you know who want to
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.800]  be well you know insurance salesmen that make 300 000 a year and they want to be a cop and they
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.280]  think it's a taser and it's their gun imagine the feds approaching going we're going to give
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:37.240]  you an infregard card or a homeland security card even pay you and go out and recruit other people
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:42.920]  and here's your gun and you're even licensed to kill when you're given the code on your smartphone
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:49.560]  and man these guys are walking on air that they're now infregard
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.960]  i've had them walk up to me and mcbrain and others on the street and then leon macadoo
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.920]  once called you're not allowed to film in america we're gonna get you soon the guys weren't like a
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:04.280]  $2,000 suit he's like that's right i'm part of it i and we're like oh you're part of the infregard
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:09.240]  how do you know that i i i mean you give them an armband you give them a button it's all over
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.600]  but we need our own buttons we need our own symbols so people know hey we're here to help
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:22.360]  we just want basic low taxes sovereignty freedom a border and and our five-year-olds not to be taught
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:32.200]  how to you know give oral sex pretty reasonable they're like no because they have a will to
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.760]  conquer we just have a will to be free they have a will to conquer just like i can't stop fighting
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:43.960]  them i guarantee if i was they could torture me and i couldn't stop i can't stop it burns in my
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:49.800]  bones to quote some patch from the bible i forget where do you find the burning in the bones patches
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:58.680]  the whole testament is it a zeal i mean i burn because i don't want me just like i burned up
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.080]  i caught a burglar in my house i mean we're being gang raped i want to go to these cliffs
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:09.480]  this is big spring city council and remember this is in a backdrop of video in the last week
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:14.840]  and headlines everywhere at these drills to take on the tea party and gun owners i mean i can play
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:20.760]  the clips veterans gun owners tea party they say we're going to start killing everybody imminently
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.400]  with no evidence maybe like if i call the cops 20 times over the years saying my neighbor my
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.800]  neighbor's you know uh gonna kill somebody my neighbor's gonna kill the other neighbor when
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.480]  the when the other neighbor gets killed the first person they're going to come to suspect is me
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.400]  and the globalists the democrats especially republicans go along whether that's why they're
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:45.640]  scared they keep telling them you know the patriots are going to blow up buildings the
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:50.680]  patriots are going to kill cops the patriots i mean this is such an obvious frame up but now
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.760]  they're going operational with this which makes me think they're not going to let obama leave
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:44:01.960]  office before they pull this because america is being conquered right now the treaties are all
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.760]  being signed the borders are being dissolved our military is being put under nato it's all happening
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.960]  because if you run this empire you run it all while the stock market implodes
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.600]  all right let's go to clip number three we need civilian cooperation and help
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:25.720]  this is mr mead in big spring city council meeting just just three days ago here it is special
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:32.920]  operations command being the director of the of the exercise desires to have a very rural area
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:39.880]  for us to be able to operate in uh because the last few years these guys have uh in afghanistan
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:47.720]  and iraq they receive um aerial resupply by helicopter about once a week they live in buildings
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:53.240]  they have connectivity to the internet to be able to to to talk to their command but also
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:59.080]  be able to talk to home um when they come out here to martin and howard county they're not
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.280]  going to have those luxuries in the scenario that we've built they're going to have to operate
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:10.120]  outside of those normal this is when they turn the power off of the us and rely on the folks that
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:15.720]  the the civilians this is all in the area to be able to support them as if training with
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:20.360]  people west taxes is like afghanistan element that actually will replicate that the after the war
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:27.960]  is over too i thought uh we also ask for we can't do the exercise without the public's help uh things
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:33.560]  that we look for uh from that perspective is we look for people that are willing to be a role
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.440]  player to just be someone who goes and gives a little nugget of information for them to build
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:43.640]  an intelligence picture to understand the scenario they're recruiting you for him to operate better
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.680]  we look for people that uh are willing to transport our guys because they want the
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.480]  relationship before the civil war starts for example in the back of a horse trailer they're
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:58.680]  getting a battle night so nobody can see them these are ways that they want that we wanted 30
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.960]  seconds in i should have talked over that yeah we need this is where afghanistan's where we need
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:08.040]  you in a cattle trailer we need to have that relationship with you this is building the
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:13.560]  cadres in every city for the roundups and then they're going to put these people in charge
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:20.120]  over the cities well i guess they had to take you know johnson away he was training with them
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:25.640]  terrorists part of the ones that nuke chicago i tell you i can't believe it we got to do it
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:33.160]  we're allowed to have our guns we got badges we're nobody else can but we can you trash
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.920]  but again these people aren't trash right now they mean well you mean you need training for
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:45.320]  afghanistan in my cattle trailer his secret me absolutely while i was in the military myself
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:50.520]  i'll be like here's five thousand for helping me brown or gonzalez here you go
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.880]  you're a vc now
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.680]  oh so sick that i mean look at the spokesman i didn't know they could stack crap that high i gotta
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:09.400]  tell you that's a lion sack of crud right there and he doesn't like his job either
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:16.440]  he knows lying to everybody you fool let's go ahead and i mean you want to see the enemy folks
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:24.440]  that's the enemy right there not the trips but sacks a crap like that guy tell you what uh
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:30.040]  things that we look for uh from that perspective is we look for people that are willing to be a
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:35.240]  role player to just be someone who goes and gives a little nugget of information for them to build
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:42.440]  an intelligence picture to understand the scenario and be able to rewind it again thank you 10
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:47.800]  seconds yeah we have footage going back under clinton in hebron maryland where they came over
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:54.520]  with guns and told us turn our cameras off uh in alabama in florida all over where they trained
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:59.240]  to take on the militia and they have the boy scouts telling them where the guns are and then i have
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:04.280]  the new york times admitting that the kids are trained to take on the veterans so let me explain
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:12.040]  something they down to the girl scouts us say today look it up girl scouts train to spot terrorist
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:18.200]  and more your daughter when you send her off to that if there's a humet involved and then it now
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:24.360]  most of them do i mean imagine in america the boy and girl scouts down to brownies they asked the
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:29.720]  brownies what's in the medicine cabinet there it is scouts trained to fight terrorist and more
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:35.800]  first line they train to take out veterans and they do okay let's go back to him saying just give us
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:43.240]  little nuggets for afghanistan no you're creating humet and the new mission 400 000 troops is the
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:50.600]  public plan ran corporation army times brigade homeland the cadre was 4 000 now it's up to about
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.800]  100 000 or so and they're and they're now creating a domestic army to then command
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:03.240]  their basic humet national guard teams that are in plain clothes and let me tell you
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:09.240]  these people that are in this listening right now the humet the rest of you guys
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.800]  i know most of you aren't bad but you can't handle the peer pressure that you've been
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.680]  inducted into this now you're on a power trip now you should just now give us all the intel
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:23.160]  you've got i know you will you need to you need to put up youtube videos anonymously you need to
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:29.320]  release it or go public like the marine corps colonel id and others and just expose the whole thing
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.240]  so don't get out if you didn't understand this you're now decompartmentalized give us everything
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.400]  i mean we know it's going to be your training to take on the vets we understand that and then
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.040]  they're going to have some operatives that come out and claim us for afghanistan we'll know who
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:47.480]  they are immediately because they have that look of dishonor in their eye let's go back to the clip
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:54.520]  the public's help uh things that we look for uh from that perspective is we look for people that
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.640]  are willing to be a role player to just be someone who goes and gives a little nugget of information
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.560]  for them to build an intelligence picture to understand the scenario to fight west texas
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:09.960]  and be able to operate better we look for people that uh are willing to transport our guys because
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:15.640]  they trans have to move around in a clandestine manner for example in the back of a horse trailer
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:19.880]  in the middle of the night they're getting in a full war against us these are ways that they have to
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:26.520]  operate in um in foreign countries and when they're not supposed to be in those countries
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.400]  i love when you're not supposed to be in america under positive commentatus and common sense like
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:37.000]  that let's get this network break uh let's go to the next clip number five what to expect
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:46.440]  and the involvement of local pd what can you expect that now understand that this um this
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:53.480]  slideshow is our standard slideshow that we use to brief the counties and and the city southern
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:58.840]  property law center fine within this that was made by them see most of this i would tell you
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:05.160]  um for example increase aircraft in the area that's the good part of this because the enemy
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:08.680]  smart but you got to understand it's a bunch of adl southern property law center types that
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:13.960]  command all this from above the pentagon and they just give the scenarios to them who then put the
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:17.480]  battle planning into it that's kind of the disconnect here though when you're reading and
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:22.120]  seeing this stuff it's it's just an incredibly sickening to have foreign registered groups
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:26.600]  basically operating inside the u.s but this is us we're captured country and we killed 50 something
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:30.920]  million babies i mean we kind of deserve it here let's go back to it you'll see that out in the rural
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:37.640]  area we have a resupply an aerial drop that will occur and then some paratroopers as well will
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:47.560]  will jump into martin county um in early august it won't happen within the city limits um noise
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:53.640]  complaints if my guys are noisy here in the city they're really doing something wrong is what i
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:52:02.200]  would tell you um that third bullet can conducting suspicious activities that's where here in the
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:10.280]  city we we're looking at using the city from an aspect of um conducting clandestine just trying to
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:15.000]  turn the troops into cia's commandos in south america kinetic activity there won't be gunfire
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:21.400]  going on no assassination teams like that our footprints within the cities are probably five
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:27.400]  to six people at the most games in these meetings but one of the most important things and and i know
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:34.440]  i've said it previously is we link in with the law enforcement officers they know when and where
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:41.320]  we're conducting activity the linking and the cops in the police department to be near the activity
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:46.280]  that way they're able to answer constituent calls on that the other thing that we have the
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:53.080]  cover story where they kill the patriots prior to the activity going on that way the the police
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:58.440]  chief can let the dispatch know that this is occurring so that when they field phone calls
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:06.440]  from uh from uh concerned citizens they're able to uh meet that off or cut that off at the past
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:12.120]  oh yeah cut the enemy so to say and the other thing that we do as well as we make sure that it
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:18.040]  tries to get out at the morning and evening roll call so the officers that are on duty know what's
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:22.760]  going on and know where it's occurring and this just goes on i mean i've got a whole bunch of
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:29.880]  other clips but just look at cnn even reporting documents army national guard ordered to consider
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:35.480]  americans as enemy forces and adversaries internal briefings right like a strategy for war and that
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:43.240]  was in missouri with the situation ferguson which was sorrow sponsored as the simulant to then legitimize
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:50.360]  that video our national guard troops patrol residential streets in california with their
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:56.600]  guns at the ready blocking traffic see this is all just coming out all of this unfolding
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:04.120]  let's go to weapons and ammunition civilian attire clip they will be carrying weapons
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.760]  but it won't be live ammunition it'll all be blank ammunition they always say that
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:14.440]  they have trash just to correct one thing that was in the newspaper on sunday um that i that i
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:20.840]  read was they'll have blank ammunition but there will not be any explosions uh we won't we won't be
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:28.440]  setting off live live demolition out here um that's for 911 the guys will be wearing civilian attire

[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:41.720]  but that's not normally anything they got kids or white t-shirts in west texas and what i've seen
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:47.800]  especially during hunting season hunting season um and they may be driving civilian real infiltrator
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:52.120]  right there that you're seeing that is a really small trader city limits if you notice my guys
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:55:01.800]  they're probably really doing something wrong man we're in trouble man we're conquered
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.280]  now let's go to clear marking of the participants first they're not going to be marked now they're
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:15.880]  going to be marked let's go to that club that for us that's one of the the big things we make sure
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:22.040]  that all of our guys have some type of marking that that um that they'll be all be wearing an
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:27.080]  armband with a marking that identifies them as part of the exercise i'm not gonna play more
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:31.320]  of that and tj just pointed something out that i was thinking he moves in action as that
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.920]  knelliness of a baptist preacher to set you at ease i mean this guy makes you want to cry
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:43.960]  actually that we fall this far god almighty i can't believe how much trouble we're in jesus christ
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:49.240]  i'm not kidding i just can't handle this anymore this country is so gone they're playing
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:52.600]  in something really bad folks and these people are just such traders
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.240]  let's go to uh how how often will you do operations like this just go to that clip
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:09.880]  how often do you do a operation like this is this is this done annually or yes sir so um
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:16.200]  um the the jade helm project is a new project that has come along from uh general cleveland
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:24.600]  from his staff uh comes out of the union's operations command um this this exercise is
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:32.680]  planned to can be conducted yearly um we we conduct uh an exercise that's similar to this
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:39.960]  and i similar i say similar because the scope and the breadth of the exercise is nowhere comparable
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:46.040]  to what we do here by the way they conduct that exercise six times a year in north carolina so
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.400]  by the way twice cops have killed military personnel and they've got to rob cars and stuff
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:56.120]  not knowing what's happening uh during the stuff they do outside for brad we started 30 years ago
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:00.200]  supposed to go that's no big deal they did it there now it's all over the country and in the
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.880]  actual drills it's to take patriots on and to create the relationships this year they'll do a
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:09.320]  bunch of stuff for the public saying it's for overseas we already told you that next year it'll
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:13.960]  be for everybody and then the next year it'll be for real i mean we i'm just saying that's how they
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:21.320]  work listen to this one how do the fbi and da work with the military on the operation here's that
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:28.760]  let's ask how does uh fbi and dea work with the military on operation well generally speaking
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:37.240]  sir the fbi and dea provide us um um liaison officers up at our command level depending on
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:43.080]  because they command it just like how scenarios written one of the ways the fbi fbi and dea are
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.560]  working i hadn't even watched all these clips today i told you it comes out of the justice

[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:45.400]  and the gun owners they're saying that we're the bad guys these people who hold themselves out
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:52.440]  to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic terrorists that's what cobra would say
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:58.040]  that's what specter would say that's what goldfinger would say because that's who those people are
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:08.200]  i am supreme cobra commander you call your penny bureaucrats officials and authorities
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:19.480]  you will kneel before cobra or face my wrath resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's

[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:34.280]  call me mr cobra
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:40.360]  expect your cobra call it what you want it's criminal influences infiltrating governments
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:47.720]  showing chaos which they then respond to having 360 control of the initiation and then the response
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:55.640]  and then the final outcome that's full spectrum dominance walter williams the filling host of
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:00.200]  russia limbaugh and of course best-selling author is going to be joining us to look at
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:04.600]  the how they're trying to vulcanize the country look at race relations in america and more
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:17.720]  uh his new book deals with american contempt for liberty set for release just next month
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:21.240]  we'll be talking to him coming up i'm very excited about that i've only had walter williams on one
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:27.160]  other time like 10 years ago very hard to get on that cross our fingers i really i'll be honest
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:31.960]  i like to hear him host a lot better rush limbaugh it's hard to turn off when he's on there i'm not
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:35.640]  in competition with rush limbaugh by the way i never wanted this time slot this is what the radio
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:41.880]  network in 1998 would give me and i said no i'm gonna be on at night i've been on at night for
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:47.000]  years i want to be on at night they said no you're gonna be on 11 a.m to 2 p.m because no one will
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.520]  go up against rush and we have stations right now ready to turn you on and you know what they were
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:58.840]  right right away about a hundred stations put us on so tanner some was right i was wrong but this
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:04.360]  is not some egomania thing to go up against rush limbaugh it was a network decision but
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:11.960]  i know in the radio industry they say if i would just be nicer to the gop that you know that i'm
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:17.080]  the heir apparent for rush limbaugh when he retires yeah right i don't even think about such things i
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:25.480]  just want to stop the global takeover and our biggest success is getting real talking points of
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:29.640]  liberty and what's really happening into the republican party the democrats talk about this on
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:35.080]  cnn smbc they hate it you tune in to glenn becker rush limbaugh now you will hear them talking about
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:41.240]  what we initiate and the stories we break a lot of the time without credit i don't care i want to
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:46.920]  beat the globalist i don't care about the credit it's very liberating to not be in competition
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:51.400]  with these people and i'm all for competition in life but i'm in competition against the globalist
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:58.200]  i want to defeat them that's what it's all about i haven't taken the money because the
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:02.280]  radio show that makes money it's the huge big audience millions and millions every hour
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:12.280]  and bought a private jet for millions a year or a huge mansion i built this i hired all the
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:18.280]  reporters and writers this is this is what i'm into i want to fight these people i would give
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:23.800]  every ounce of blood in my veins right now to defeat the globalist if god appeared and said
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:27.560]  all right say you'll die right now and we'll defeat the new world order i would say do it
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:32.840]  and then that's not even really a big deal of course i would i would lay down my life for
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:38.200]  all these innocence and that's the type of attitude that builds civilization but i will
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:42.600]  not lay down and die just to be a slave says the thing you'll end up dying and being enslaved
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:51.320]  going along with them why not stand up well what's on your family crest is that i'd rather
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:56.440]  die than be a slave because i don't really have a family crest i mean i've got our old english crest
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:03.480]  but if i'd made a new family crest it'd be live free or die like new hampshire and they're slogan
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:10.440]  we have our guest keith johnson another paul revere courage sewers dot com courage sewers dot
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:16.040]  com represents our shift out of typical american philosophy into a courageous world of mindful
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:21.400]  creative living we focus on what's important and developing a way of living that works for our family
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.720]  we are those crazy people with chickens in the urban neighborhood urban farmers free thinkers
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:28.360]  who choose to analytically evaluate everything we read in here
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:36.600]  convinced abundance is not a circumstance it's an attitude courage sewers dot com very exciting all
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:41.800]  i know is this guy continues to turn out citizen journalism in california catching them at a dirty
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:47.160]  bomb drill blaming it on the patriots catching them covering up the fact that we're beating the
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:51.960]  force inoculation bill right now that's not on the news out in california folks it's only on the
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:58.920]  internet because they won't cover it so we've got what all of you should do you don't know how to
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:03.240]  do a youtube it's easy get your son or daughter or neighbor to show you or to partner with them to
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:09.800]  upload it go out just go to city councils go to events go to jade helm pick go to the border
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:15.560]  cover news just all of you have a voice and then we'll all be targeting and tracking everything
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:21.160]  so when the globalists pull something big they'll know we're watching are even better even better
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:29.800]  even better they'll be so afraid of our human everywhere our human intelligence people everywhere
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:36.200]  not under any group or name just there that they can't track that they can't stop they're trying to
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:42.360]  get humid right now with all these drills they're trying to get their forces in place the military
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:48.200]  about 90 percent of them are totally awake i mean we're in a war folks we're not just gonna
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:53.480]  sit here and let the neural water gang rape us ahead of this takeover we're already in the trenches
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:59.000]  we've already infiltrated our own country against you you built these corrupt takeover systems we
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:05.640]  infiltrated them see valkyrie works both ways and you know it don't just come let's go to
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:11.800]  keith johnson keith we salute you great job oh thank you alex may you live an interesting time
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:17.560]  well we do i mean look you are the example you're out there constantly engaged in citizen journalists
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:23.960]  tell us about some of your latest exploits well actually what i want to say and this could actually
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:29.960]  encourage a lot of people that are on the fence thinking about it monday i was on the nightly news
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:38.840]  with david night and that was my first time ever i think ever a week ago today we were excited about
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:45.480]  getting 20 or 30 hits on like a saving rainwater article or something like that and i went out to
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:50.680]  richmond i woke up i was thinking i don't really feel like getting up and doing this and driving
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:54.440]  out there it's an hour and a half you know no one else could make it i was by myself
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.160]  my own little video camera but i thought you know what just in case i'm gonna wouldn't let you in
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:07.080]  but through the fence she got it on tape yeah actually one of the cops there from my l3 so that's
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:13.480]  the town right above richmond which is located by berkeley and oakland on the east bay he actually
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:18.440]  went and asked if i can come inside and shoot some footage there which would have been great
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:24.200]  then i would have been able to talk to some people and get close to be a sense of the ridiculous but
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:29.080]  you're a you're a you're a human you're an american you're the enemy what happened no he was cool he
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:34.920]  just he apologized no no the cop was cool but they said no is what i meant no no no i did not have
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:42.040]  press credentials so therefore no yeah but you know i got so close because i went down there
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:47.000]  thinking it was going to be in the city where they have city streets shut down people land all over
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.560]  helping people you know you think if there was a drill number one you want to secure evidence
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:58.200]  you want to help people dirty bomb was just to cover yes yes it was actually in the national
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:03.800]  guard compound there and there's a little apartment complex next to the retired citizen
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:08.520]  little place there and i walked in there and the only thing separating it was a rod iron fence so
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:15.000]  i stood there the cops said thanks you film whatever you want so i did and now it's getting
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.800]  millions of views and now your other videos are getting views and now you've launched your own

[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:10.120]  lying about me and attacking me because they can sit there and regurgitate whatever the government

[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:42.200]  who numbing wrapped around the block at the state house people testifying against forced
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:48.040]  inoculations and it hardly made the news locally it didn't really make it nationally but now it is
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:53.000]  because of your report people saying we will not be forcibly inoculated by the way that's a good
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.360]  looking crowd of parents and folks there to testify against it so for now they're shelving it when
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:03.080]  there's not opposition but you know they'll be back but i'm just amazing footage tell us about that
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:11.560]  yeah well i was actually at work and all the stuff with the richmond drill had just gone off
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:18.120]  and i saw they were having the senate education committee hearing down there and a bunch of parents
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:23.640]  were going down there to let them know if this passes i'll be pulling my kids out of school public
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:29.400]  school because it affects private schools it affects uh home schooling somehow the curriculum
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.400]  they got that worded in there i haven't pushed that out yet and next they'll leave the whole state
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:36.680]  and then the whole country and they need to understand we're going to withdraw our money from
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:42.200]  their dirty system if they want to brain damage our kids yeah and there's another law in there too
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:48.200]  about uh adult this is a mandatory vaccine law that's right yeah tell folks about that exactly
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.560]  i mean they're i mean this had to be over a thousand people i'm looking at the footage it's
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:57.240]  incredible well i told my wife i said why don't you grab the camera go down there we'll just
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:01.240]  do all this over you know your turn you know hand it down to her your turn to go down there
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:07.320]  and she uh sent me a message back and said this is incredible the place is packed she goes i'm gonna
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:13.960]  get in line and she had the camera and what i did is i found it's called like cal channel or
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:18.840]  something like that and what it is is they have television cameras and all these buildings and
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:24.760]  all these rooms and you can literally sit there and watch it or listen to it you know i was at work
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:30.840]  so i just put on i could just hear the audio and all they let them say is name city and if you're
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:36.520]  forward or opposed and i haven't had time to go through the video we tried uploading the video
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:42.680]  break it down so we can edit it and put in you know just pieces this three hours and 41 minutes
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:46.760]  long yeah just get the highlights but you were saying the vast majority are against it what percentage
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:55.640]  would you say 100 so you're saying you're saying there wasn't one person for it no none that i saw
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:01.000]  if someone that's the headline fell over a thousand testify no one for it and that's why
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:06.280]  they're trying to make it mandatory because they know the sleeping giant is awakening they're panicking
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:11.720]  i can't wait till we route these people i don't i don't i don't care if i even make it through
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:16.040]  all this i just want to defeat this scum go ahead sorry no no no you got to make that
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:21.960]  decision going in that's just the way it is but um if someone actually wants to sit there
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:29.240]  and watch that entire video it's three and a half hours but if you go to the last five minutes
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:35.320]  even one of the co-authors from san diego i believe michael block even he looked nervous
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:40.680]  because the room was packed they just sat there for about two hours and watched person after person
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:46.280]  after person say this is my name this is where i'm from i'm a teacher i'm opposed many people were
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:52.360]  saying i represent my entire school of six thousand people i represent a hundred people i represent
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:58.760]  and these people were shaken they did not like what they heard and they were supposed to have it now
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:05.640]  i know the spin is in committees there's always questions there's always things to get worked
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:10.920]  out there's always bugs you know we always delay for information for our questions and that is true
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:17.960]  however the question is and even what these senators were saying the problem is if they
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:25.320]  refuse vaccination what happens to these kids when they're not in school are we going to have thousands
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:34.360]  of kids that aren't eligible for school we have a right to education so it looks a little hairy in
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:39.720]  there absolutely whatever you've done a great job and and everybody's going to go through that video

[02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:36.760]  he is the longest continual fill-in host for rush limbaugh 20 years i was in college
[02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:44.120]  uh listening to walter williams 20 plus years and i've read some of his books i've uh seen clips
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:49.960]  of his uh documentary shown on pbs suffered no fools uh he's just an amazing individual he
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:54.600]  has a new book coming out next month everybody should pre-order at amazon.com american contempt
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:59.960]  for liberty comes out may first a strike i guess at the socialist i'm not going to go through all
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:05.640]  of his lawyer degrees and phd's and economics and all the rest of it i mean because it would
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:10.600]  take too long to go over all his degrees but i gotta say it i said earlier i like it when he
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:15.880]  hosts the rush limbaugh show better than rush uh it's more hardcore uh but i'm gonna quit kissing
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:20.760]  his butt and just get right to the actual meat and potatoes uh we have martin luther king coming
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:25.800]  out to paraphrase in the 60s and i agree with it we should judge someone on the character of their
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:30.520]  deeds in fact here's the quote i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:35.000]  nation where they will not be judged by color of their skin but by the content of their character
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:40.680]  how did we get from there was something that's so veritas dr williams to the inverse where
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:46.360]  everything is about the color or the sex and with these hate laws other people are more protected
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:52.840]  and the democratic party has just gone race crazy and admits they're trying to divide and conquer
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:58.440]  to the point of just absurd i mean you're the expert on this uh are they winning are they
[02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:04.040]  losing where is this insanity going uh doctor well i i i'm not sure whether they're they're
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:09.080]  winning uh they you know they're fairly strong but i think that that what has happened is that um
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:14.600]  of the you know after the civil rights movement people found that they can they can hustle they
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:19.720]  can be they can become poverty pence they can they can uh uh they can they can make a lot of
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:25.480]  money al sharp and uh you know he gets a lot of money uh or jesse jackson and i think uh you know
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:31.160]  i don't know how wise it is of us to ask uh al sharpton to go out and get a real job
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:37.720]  uh or and make much less money it's it's he'll you know he makes just makes money on the uh you
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:43.960]  know uh you know hustling uh and and exploiting uh whatever problems that might exist among uh
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:49.320]  blacks and whites but i think one of the things that goes unnoticed and is not said enough and
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:57.320]  that is uh black americans as a group have made the greatest gains over some of the highest hurdles
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:02.280]  in the shortest period of time than any other racial group in the history of mankind and that
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:07.320]  okay so what's the evidence of that well if you add up all the income that black americans earn
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:12.600]  each year and thought of us just as a nation independent nation we would be the 17th or
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:17.800]  richest nation on the face of the earth uh there are a few black americans who are among the world's
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:22.840]  richest people uh there are there was one black american who was the head of the world's mightiest
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:30.680]  military colon pal the uh uh and and some black americans are some of the uh world's most famous
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:39.400]  personalities now the significance of this is that in 1865 neither a slave nor a slave owner
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:44.680]  would have believed that these kind of gains would have been possible in just a little bit over a
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:50.440]  century and as such it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people but just as importantly
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:55.080]  it speaks to the greatness of a nation because these kind of gains would not have been able
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:01.080]  would not have been possible anywhere in the world except united states of america now
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:06.840]  just because these gains have been made it doesn't mean that they're major they're not major problems
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:12.600]  but they the problems are not civil rights problems that is many people look at the problems that
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:17.880]  in many black communities uh as civil rights problems and and the civil rights struggles
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:23.080]  over and is one that is at one time black americans did not have the constitutional guarantees or
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:28.920]  everybody else now we do but the fact that civil rights problems are over does not mean that they're
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:34.360]  not not problems but they're not civil rights problems and the point is is that if we view them
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:41.080]  as civil rights problems the the solutions will be elusive forever well that's right and it seems
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:47.640]  like the democratic poverty poverty pimps the democratic party they don't want their old paradigm to end
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:54.840]  and so now they're just hyping up any slight they can to create division to create hate uh
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:38:00.840]  they're promoting all this uh what i call reverse racism it just goes on and on and it's cartoonish
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:06.280]  when you see it but it's not just with black folks it's happening the political entitlement
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.160]  of how they're trying to make women think that men somehow have you know tried to screw them over
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:18.040]  or that uh anybody with any money is bad and that and that capitalism is bad it just seems
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:23.160]  like there's a death wish for the country uh coming out of the whole sorrows funded combine
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:28.920]  what do you think's behind this as an economist and a lawyer mr williams well i always say follow
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:35.400]  the money and so there's a lot of money and a lot of jobs be had for people who are involved in this
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:41.400]  hustle and and i think that when you when you look you were you were mentioning uh you use the term
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:48.680]  cartoonish and it is indeed cartoonish that is when you find uh uh these great big these marches
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:55.800]  around the country as a result of the shooting in ferguson Missouri or the shooting in new
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:03.560]  york a black man shot by police uh and and if you say well look uh if if if policemen became
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:10.040]  angels tomorrow it will not have done very much for the murder of blacks that is there's an average
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:17.000]  of seven thousand blacks murdered each year and and in and places like chicago it's uh sometimes
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.840]  some years is it has been one black of the murder per day and and it's and it's not the clan coming
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:28.520]  and they're doing that and then there's a other cartoonish type things that is those people are
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:34.920]  blaming uh uh discrimination for many problems that black face the but however if you look at the
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:41.640]  illegitimacy rate among blacks that is 75 percent of black babies are born out of wedlock now i'm
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:47.080]  not i'm not approved but you know if you if it's not the best start on life when you if you're
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:52.520]  born you find your mother 16 your grandmother's 30 and you'll know who or where your father is
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:56.600]  that's not a very good start as you know you're four to five times we're likely to be in prison
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:02.200]  are on drugs the democratic party promotes that i i believe to create a system of dependency
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:06.840]  and and i mean is it not the modern plantation these places like chicago and other areas are
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:12.040]  more like a reservation that's right you're absolutely right but the same thing that people don't
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:19.880]  have very little appreciation for is that all of this is new among black people that is in 1940
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:26.680]  the illegitimacy rate around among blacks was 13 or 14 wasn't it lower than even whites
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:33.240]  okay well well in the 19 teens the illegitimacy rate among black teenagers was less than that
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:39.160]  among white teenagers so now it's been totally inverted oh that's right in eight in eight i have
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:49.720]  in my book a race and economics and i give these statistics and in 1870s 1880s 75 percent of black
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:54.520]  kids lived in two parent families and in some cities higher i'm talking about cities like
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:41:00.520]  detroit chicago philadelphia and new york and matter of fact in new york in harlem new york
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:07.320]  harlem's new in new york's harlem 85 percent of black kids lived in two parent families in 1925
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:13.240]  now today it's it's around 30 percent of black kids live in two parent families so the point that
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:20.760]  i'm making is that much of the pathology that we're seeing among black americans is entirely new
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:26.840]  and moreover i believe that it's the result of the welfare estate well i mean it's got to be
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:31.240]  undoubtedly and you go through all the statistics as an economist in your books the democrats have
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:36.520]  to know this then what is the in game strategy where do you think they're wanting to take people
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:41.320]  because the same paradigm that we've seen with them quote helping blacks with the great society
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:46.440]  has now been deployed to every other community and we see the same slide towards illegitimacy
[02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:53.720]  drugs crime the thug culture i mean where did this come from i mean i know mtv well you know
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:42:00.040]  we you mentioned that the the spread of this uh culture um in eight when when patrick moinehan
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:06.520]  was writing about the decline of the black family in the 1960s the illegitimacy rate among black
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:15.000]  americans at that time was close to 30 percent the illegitimacy among whites today is where it was
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:21.560]  for blacks in 18 in 1965 that is the illegitimacy rate among whites is over 30 percent today it's
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:27.080]  all going the same direction yeah we're all going to say and and it's and it's the welfare state
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:32.520]  i mean that is look if you you know i don't i don't care whether an economist is a conservative
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:38.600]  or a liberal but he'll tell you that if you tax something you're going to get less of it and
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:44.360]  if you subsidize something you're going to get more of it and what we've been doing is subsidizing
[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:50.840]  sluffingly behavior that is there's there's no cost there's very little cost of people to engage
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:57.160]  in sluffingly behavior does a girl has has a has a baby out of wedlock you know she doesn't pay
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:02.520]  to really cost it's it's the taxpayer that is the government will give them a subsidized housing
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:11.400]  food stamp welfare etc etc and and so it makes it very cheap to behave in in the self-destructive
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:19.960]  ways what do you think's behind this clear social engineering well i i think that it gets people's
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:27.880]  votes i mean anybody talk any politician talking the way that i am would get run out of town he
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:33.560]  would not get voted he would not well any any politician eat and forget the study that the
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:40.200]  the material this things i'm saying about race but but just any politician who would promise
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:45.960]  who would act to uphold and defend the united states constitution he would get run out of town
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:52.040]  by the americ people because the america you know increasingly and it's sad to say increasingly
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:59.160]  americans are having more and more contempt for the united states constitution wow walter e williams
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:06.040]  is our guest what do you think the legacy of obama is going to be i i mean i really was concerned
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:12.360]  about the centralization of power under clinton and bush and and and and now dr williams we see
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:17.400]  the borders totally wide open paying with vouchers to bring the illegals children in
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:22.440]  above the law power plants getting shut off outside of law our military being put under
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:29.320]  u n nato command outside of law obama ignoring for your request the irs not getting in trouble
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:35.400]  for stuff that makes nixon look like an angel i mean is this not real totalitarianism how would
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:42.120]  you as a political scientist quantify what we've now become because i expect the republicans when
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:48.360]  they get in power to not be as vitriolic against america as much but still they like power i mean
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:53.800]  i fear the direction the trajectory of this country what what do you think obama's legacy is
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:59.800]  going to be well i i predicted in 2008 in one of my columns and i was going to i was predicting
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:05.160]  that that obama administration would be a failed administration where a failed president just like
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:12.360]  jimmy carter's is but but some people are saying that obama's begin to make jimmy carter look good
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:21.800]  but the point but the point is is that obama is following a trend in our country and he's just
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:28.280]  accelerated that trend that is you found during the bush administration you found all kinds of
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:33.880]  ignoring ignoring the constitution use you found the you know the no child left behind you found
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:39.160]  the uh the prescription drugs and and all these other programs that happened during the bush
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:46.760]  administration so so we've been on this path away from the constitution away from personal liberty
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:53.880]  for quite a while and and and so the real challenge is the real question for the future of our country
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:46:00.600]  is can we reverse it and there's some question whether whether it's reversible let me ask you
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:05.720]  this question i want to get into your new book american contempt for liberty if we don't study
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:12.200]  history as you've done if we don't reverse the course we're on how long do you think this country
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:18.280]  has left because it's degenerating fast well i i i don't know but uh but you know people have
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:24.600]  asked me uh you know what what can we do and i asked them well are americans anyway basically
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:31.480]  different as human beings from the roman from the french from the spanish from the portuguese
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:37.400]  from the british now these are great empires of the past powerful empires of the past but they went
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:43.960]  down the tubes and so and and they went down the tubes for precisely the kind of things that we're
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:51.720]  doing uh that is bread and circuses big government spending programs so so there's a real question
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:57.800]  whether americans will will uh find a different fate you find a country just like like argentina
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:04.680]  argentina is a basket case but in 1940 exactly 1930s it was among the ten richest countries in the
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:09.240]  world it was absolutely and then they got into big government they got into deficits and now it's a
[02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:15.400]  hellhole that's right that's right they got into socialism a lot of the kind it was accelerated
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:23.400]  during the perones and and and socialism is uh when socialism takes over a country does not have
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:28.840]  much hope the saying was as rich as in argentine and now people don't even know what that means it is
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:34.760]  so sad to see them wreck this and i saw statistics today that even the middle class is shrinking fast
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:40.200]  and that even the ultra wealthy uh are paying so many taxes that that that they're having
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:46.440]  trouble saving and then france now has a hundred percent tax forms reported uh on their wealthier
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:49.960]  people forcing them to leave the country what are the socialist things going to happen when
[02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:55.640]  they're all gone dr williams well well you know it's a rather remarkable thing for throughout our
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:48:03.000]  entire history yeah we've been the place where people are run to to avoid high taxes to avoid
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:09.160]  oppression now people are leaving united states that is wealth and wealthy money record numbers
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:16.680]  in united states going to the the to the islands uh uh uh banking in in other countries and going
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:22.920]  to lichtenstein in other places to put their money and so so we're going in the direction i don't
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.080]  know what at what speed but we're going in the direction of the other of other countries that
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:32.280]  have adopted socialistic policies walter e williams i know you support law and order i support the
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:38.440]  rule of law as well but the over militarization accelerated under obama now all these training
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.920]  manuals where they say the big enemy of the pentagon is the tea party veterans gun owners
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:47.320]  i'm sure you're aware of that if not i can play some news clips where they say we need the m rap
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:51.880]  tanks for the veterans when the veterans aren't out there doing anything what do you think of
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:58.840]  this attempt by the democrats to to basically turn the military into a domestic tool yeah well uh
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:04.040]  it's uh you know that that's that's what the that's what socialism needs that in order to
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:09.080]  for for government to be able to impose as will and needs force because a lot of people will not
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:15.640]  go along with the voluntarily and then also uh you you you notice that the very people in our
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:24.520]  country who are the most anti you know anti gun or or or anti second amendment they are the very
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:29.400]  people who are trying to take over our lives they're the ones armed into the teeth they're the ones
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:35.080]  with bodyguards like michael more but you and i we can't have a gun oh that's after and the and the
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:41.720]  point is that what a lot of mergers do not know is that the the founders of our nation they did not
[02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:47.720]  give us the second amendment in order for us to go deer and duck hunting they explicitly said
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:53.560]  the anti-init in my column this week they explicitly said that we we're we want the
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:50:00.520]  american people to be armed as a last resort against the betrayal of their of their freedom by
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:05.800]  their representatives and rulers wow we got one final segment after this quick break with

[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:32.840]  on any type of americana's culture certainly america's got a lot of bad in our past but
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:37.640]  our ideals were the greatest and we made the greatest strides that's why the system's attacking it
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:42.120]  what they're replacing it with is dr williams said is a bunch of roman bread and circuses

[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:33.080]  subjects uh we can cover but i'd like to give you the floor to host the show here for a moment and
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:37.480]  get into what you think is the heart of the matter well i well one of the things i think but
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:43.320]  uh i always tell uh people say well what do you try to do walter well i say i'm trying to sell our
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:49.480]  fellow americans on the moral superiority of individual freedom and personal liberty and
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:56.040]  its main ingredient to limited government and it's rather surprising what has happened to our
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:55:00.920]  country and just let me give you an idea when i say that there's a lot of contempt for the
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:08.920]  united states constitution and contempt for the ideas of liberty in 1794 uh congress appropriated
[02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:15.400]  15 000 to help some french refugees james madison the acknowledged father of the united states
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:21.960]  constitution of the father of the constitution and a former president he stood on the floor of
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:27.960]  the house i rate and he said now virtually quoting him he says i cannot undertake to lay my finger
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:35.560]  on that article in the constitution that authorizes congress to spend the money of their constituents
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:42.120]  for the purposes of benevolence now if you look at the federal budget today two thirds the three
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:48.440]  quarters of it is for the purpose of benevolence and you ask the question uh and also madison said
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:55.000]  charity is not a function of government now anybody any person running for the presidency today
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:02.200]  who would make the same statement that james madison as well as other founders made the american
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:10.200]  people would run them out of town on the rail that is the american people have contempt for the great
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:16.760]  ideas and the great ideas of liberty that made us the richest and the freest country uh in the world
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:24.760]  and and and you know to give you another example if i said if i'm running for the the governor if
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:29.080]  i'm running for the senate in texas and i go back and forth across the state and i say look my fellow
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:34.680]  texas i've read the united states constitution i know what the constitution authorizes i know what
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:41.720]  article uh one section eight of the united states constitution says if you let me to the senate don't
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:48.680]  expect for me to bring back aid to higher education highway construction uh uh prescription drugs and
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:54.120]  all these other programs the question is do you think the people of texas would elect me to the
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:57:01.480]  united states senate texas might been probably only two or three other states but but it'd be a
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:07.320]  fight but i think texas understand that we would just keep all of our money here and decided what
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:11.960]  we would want to do instead of giving the feds all the control but most states should be voted out
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:18.760]  though well see i think that that if if i don't bring if i ask senator don't bring back money to
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:25.080]  detect to texas it doesn't mean that texas will pay a lower federal income tax all that it means
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:31.480]  is that the money will go to oklahoma instead that is once legalized theft begins it pays
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:35.560]  for everybody to participate no you're right we can't get out of it because our money will just
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:42.440]  go somewhere else that that is absolutely right and so that's the tragedy of uh in our country that
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:49.960]  it it pays for people to engage in legalized theft that is it pays for people to use the power of
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:55.160]  their office for it pays for people to elect people who will use their power of their office
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:59.720]  to take what belongs to one american and bring it back to them they have wired fraud into the system
[02:57:59.720 --> 02:58:04.520]  and now they're just expanding it what about obama saying he may raise taxes by executive power
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:11.800]  well i he has no constitutional authority to do that and then you know a lot of people say well
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:17.960]  look the bush tax cuts the bush tax increases the bomb bomb increases obama tax increases
[02:58:19.240 --> 02:58:24.280]  according to constitution the president has no taxing and spending authority that's right
[02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:30.840]  only the article one gives congress the taxing and spending authority that is the president
[02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:35.800]  cannot spend one day of congress doesn't that first appropriate walter williams amazing waltry
