[00:00.000 --> 00:22.340]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:22.340 --> 00:23.340]  show.
[00:23.340 --> 00:32.440]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are. It's Friday. We're only seven days out from Donald
[00:32.440 --> 00:37.200]  Trump being inaugurated, the 45th president of the United States, and they're already
[00:37.200 --> 00:42.280]  on the verge of repealing Obamacare. Every week, tens of billions of dollars or more
[00:42.280 --> 00:48.240]  jobs are announced to come back into the United States to latest Chrysler plans. We are seeing
[00:48.240 --> 00:54.600]  him come out against vaccines. Again, ladies and gentlemen, I told you that was coming.
[00:54.600 --> 01:01.960]  This is unbelievable. We are seeing him openly move to get over a trillion dollars of money
[01:01.960 --> 01:06.320]  back in the United States by changing our tax laws to expose the globalist. I have the
[01:06.320 --> 01:12.100]  cover of USA Today here in front of me with their weekend edition, Trump's cabinet of
[01:12.100 --> 01:17.960]  disruptors ready to go. That's right. They're going to disrupt the New World Order, ladies
[01:17.960 --> 01:25.600]  and gentlemen. All the things Trump is delivering on in space, and he has committed to the American
[01:25.600 --> 01:29.800]  people, he's committed to me. I'm going to leave it at that so he doesn't have another
[01:29.800 --> 01:36.640]  heyday with it, that he's going to deliver or basically die trying. He is going all out.
[01:36.640 --> 01:43.400]  That's why we're seeing this unprecedented move, this unprecedented move right now to
[01:43.400 --> 01:49.200]  disrupt the inauguration and to actually try to sell the American people and overthrow
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.960]  Trump. The establishment, the globalists are trying to convince themselves that they can
[01:53.960 --> 02:02.280]  try some coup with Obama with seven days left. Now, remember, in the last month, I've been
[02:02.280 --> 02:07.760]  warning you that they're trying to launch a continuity of government, COG, basically
[02:07.760 --> 02:15.680]  Operation Valkyrie. They use COG in 1944 to try to kill Hitler, their continuity of government
[02:15.680 --> 02:20.080]  system, but it backfired. Well, they've turned that around now, they're acting like Trump
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.800]  is illegitimate. They're trying to sell COG through rogue groups in the government to
[02:24.800 --> 02:30.800]  convince them that what they're doing is okay and normal. And I've said the left is openly
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.280]  behind the scenes calling for martial law and the arrest of Trump or the blocking of
[02:36.280 --> 02:41.280]  Trump and then a, quote, new election. That's why Homeland Security last week announced
[02:41.280 --> 02:47.280]  the federalization and total control of elections. People said, well, he'll be gone in 10 days
[02:47.280 --> 02:52.400]  or so, you know, last week or 12 days, whatever it was. But see, not if they suspend this
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.480]  election and say it was fraudulent. They're seriously thinking about it. Now, Rosie O'Donnell
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.680]  is one of the top people in the New York Hollywood scene. She's a husband, but she's a darling
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.400]  with the elites. And she has put out an article in Yahoo. We'll put it up on infowars.com
[03:09.400 --> 03:15.960]  for everybody right now. She has come out and openly said that she wants the election
[03:15.960 --> 03:19.920]  suspended because she's a, quote, Russian agent until that can be cleared up. Of course,
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.280]  it'll never be cleared up. They're the ones running with this info. And then she wants
[03:23.280 --> 03:34.040]  martial law in place. Now, CNN, CNN just three weeks ago had a talking point that they put
[03:34.040 --> 03:39.880]  out that I put a lot of attention on where they said civil emergency, national emergency.
[03:39.880 --> 03:45.560]  I then talked to my sources yet CNN. We also have sources inside ABC news. I'm going to
[03:45.560 --> 03:50.400]  stop right there. And they said that they are seriously wargaming just like they got
[03:50.400 --> 03:56.920]  caught before the Gulf War both times in 1991 and 2003. Wargaming the attacks with the exact
[03:56.920 --> 04:03.600]  targets drilled beforehand were the seamless integration of federal government Pentagon
[04:03.600 --> 04:07.760]  media through the media. They are actually wargaming. And I'm going to announce this
[04:07.760 --> 04:11.040]  on the other side of the break with David Knight. That's some of the stuff I'm working
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.240]  on behind the scenes. This is not turned into a vacation. It's turned into an on the road
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.880]  emergency transmission. But the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, they are seriously notice
[04:20.880 --> 04:25.960]  you heard this for me first, because we have the sources. Now you see it actually materializing
[04:25.960 --> 04:29.920]  seven days out. David Knight, this is incredible.
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.640]  Alex. And of course, when we look at Rosie O'Donnell, we could say that it's just the
[04:34.640 --> 04:39.960]  rankings of somebody who's a failure. But this is something that has been promoted by George
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.000]  Soros. We're going to talk into Michael Snyder today and he breaks down this group that is
[04:44.000 --> 05:00.760]  going to try to disrupt the inauguration. We'll be right back.
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.840]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today. What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.000]  with respect to the FBI? Based on the information they had, she should never have been allowed
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.440]  to run guilty as hell. They were very nice to her. She lost because she campaigned in
[05:13.440 --> 05:18.120]  the wrong states. No enthusiasm. He left out. She's a line corrupt criminal politician.
[05:18.120 --> 05:24.000]  He also tweeted the unaffordable care act will soon be history. Amen. Now here is Rosie
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.720]  O'Donnell on Twitter. I fully support imposing martial law delaying the inauguration until
[05:30.720 --> 05:36.840]  Trump is cleared of all charges. All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed. The only problem
[05:36.840 --> 05:43.000]  with that is there are no charges to be cleared. Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.080]  On her side of the fence before the election, when they go low, we go high. Trump and Republicans
[05:47.080 --> 05:51.080]  need to accept the results so much for that. Two things were confirmed today. Trump on
[05:51.080 --> 05:55.440]  Twitter is awesome and Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron. Job of the
[05:55.440 --> 06:00.560]  HUD in the flesh. This is Owen Shroyer for infowars.com.

[07:04.000 --> 07:08.360]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known
[07:08.360 --> 07:14.000]  for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.920]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into
[07:18.920 --> 07:23.480]  the water. They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the
[07:23.480 --> 07:28.280]  Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.080]  to prepare yourself and your family. Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[07:34.080 --> 07:39.480]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying
[07:39.480 --> 07:44.200]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for
[07:44.200 --> 07:48.520]  yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in

[08:21.920 --> 08:28.920]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:28.920 --> 08:40.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday the 13th, 2017. That's right. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[08:40.520 --> 08:47.200]  We are now looking at seven days out of number 45, President-elect Donald Trump becoming
[08:47.200 --> 08:51.160]  the 45th President of the United States. I'm going to be here until the bottom of the hour.
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.320]  David Knight is going to be on showing this broadcast. Again, I will be back in the saddle
[08:55.320 --> 09:01.960]  early next week, and I'll be obviously breaking some very important news over the weekend
[09:01.960 --> 09:09.160]  if I'm given the green light. Believe me, I want to be given the green light. I do not
[09:09.160 --> 09:14.720]  like sitting on this, but let's just say this. We're living inside a Tom Clancy novel right
[09:14.720 --> 09:20.560]  now, folks. But it'd be a Tom Clancy novel, so fantastic. No one would believe it because
[09:20.560 --> 09:25.280]  the truth is stranger than fiction. Now, David Knight's going to be augmenting what I'm saying
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.320]  because there's so much evidence that when he popped in during the last segment, if he
[09:29.320 --> 09:34.120]  just joined us, he added key intel to all of it that I hadn't even gotten to, so we're
[09:34.120 --> 09:39.400]  going to be going back and forth here. But first, let me lay this down for you. I first
[09:39.400 --> 09:45.240]  began to tell you over a month ago that CNN, ABC, and others were going to start promoting
[09:45.240 --> 09:53.400]  the idea of a civil emergency, a national emergency, a national security emergency,
[09:53.400 --> 10:01.120]  a continuity of government emergency, or a COG. Now, under a COG, if a president was
[10:01.120 --> 10:05.240]  actually a foreign agent and that was confirmed, you'd have to have congressional emergency
[10:05.240 --> 10:09.640]  hearings and things like that for it to be constitutional. The shadow government, the
[10:09.640 --> 10:15.800]  deep state that is publicly attacking Trump now doesn't intend to go that route because
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.920]  they are the deep state. They are actually the foreigners. They're actually the globalists.
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.840]  They're actually the people that have infiltrated the government and are overthrowing our republic.
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.760]  Trump is returning the republic. Trump is trying to disrupt the globalist operation
[10:29.760 --> 10:35.000]  to impoverish us and make us facile slaves. I'm going to break all that down. But here's
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.880]  the big news. Over and over again, I've told you, and I'm going to go ahead and just release
[10:40.880 --> 10:48.000]  the information today. I was told over a month ago by sources inside CNN and inside ABC and
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.240]  others, they said, Alex, you are dead on. We're up here wargaming, civil unrest, getting
[10:55.240 --> 11:01.600]  around the inauguration, Trump being arrested, Trump being indicted, the news announcing
[11:01.600 --> 11:07.680]  he's a Russian spy, basically overthrowing the president, putting it into a constitutional
[11:07.680 --> 11:16.760]  crisis and a national emergency being declared. So I'm being told this by sources. One mid-level,
[11:16.760 --> 11:24.640]  one, let's just say high level, but on the edge of CNN, let's just say a consultant.
[11:24.640 --> 11:28.640]  That's what's going on. That's what's thematically being prepared because they're having to get
[11:28.640 --> 11:34.760]  their own people prepared and lined up. Just like we saw before the first Gulf War in 1991
[11:34.760 --> 11:41.480]  and then in 2003, it leaked that ABC, CBS, CNN, all of months before were wargaming with
[11:41.480 --> 11:46.360]  the actual graphics, the attacks that happened, the exact order they happened, because media
[11:46.360 --> 11:53.320]  was interfacing with the Pentagon to have seamless propaganda. Well, let me just explain something.
[11:53.320 --> 11:58.880]  They are prepping. They are doing, like when you go have a wedding, well, the day before
[11:58.880 --> 12:03.720]  you'll have a dress rehearsal. They've had rehearsals. They've had dress rehearsals.
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.960]  Now they've started to sell the public on the idea. Then after we first talked about
[12:07.960 --> 12:15.320]  that, they began to say on CNN, we need a civil emergency. We need a national emergency to
[12:15.320 --> 12:21.680]  clear up whether or not Trump is a Russian agent or if these electors don't go for him,
[12:21.680 --> 12:25.680]  we're going to need this crisis as well. We're going to need this system to take care of
[12:25.680 --> 12:32.040]  the crisis. Now, it's been intensifying with these rogue intelligence agencies coming out
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.280]  with reports that Russians turned off the East Coast power or that Russians plan to
[12:36.280 --> 12:42.720]  turn off the East Coast or that they had a laptop and then, okay, the laptop didn't
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.120]  even have the software on it. It's all totally made up. We've seen hoax after hoax after
[12:47.120 --> 12:51.160]  hoax after hoax. We've seen three lawsuits saying he raped young girls, fake names totally
[12:51.160 --> 12:56.080]  made up, but we're all supposed to forget about those. Now, Rosie O'Donnell, who is
[12:56.080 --> 13:04.680]  a husband, but that doesn't matter. In Manhattan, she is an absolute darnling of establishment.
[13:04.680 --> 13:10.200]  She's dialed into everything. At the national level, she's seen as the nemesis of Trump.
[13:10.200 --> 13:16.240]  She comes out uncharacteristically technical with the terms she used that are the exact
[13:16.240 --> 13:20.760]  script they're planning to use if they try to overthrow our president and the return
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.600]  of our republic. This is from Yahoo News. Trump's nemesis, Rosie O'Donnell calls for
[13:25.600 --> 13:31.160]  martial law. That's yesterday. Donald Trump ripped Rosie O'Donnell during this first
[13:31.160 --> 13:34.880]  Republican presidential debate. We'll see he deserves it, saying that she was the only
[13:34.880 --> 13:39.640]  woman about whom he'd ever made disparaging comments. Now, with less than 10 days until
[13:39.640 --> 13:46.600]  Trump takes the other office, O'Donnell says that she support martial law. That's a quote.
[13:46.600 --> 13:52.400]  In order to delay his inauguration, fully support imposing martial law, this is a quote, all
[13:52.400 --> 13:57.120]  caps, fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared
[13:57.120 --> 14:04.640]  of all charges. I am fully support martial law. She goes on from there. Again, they are
[14:04.640 --> 14:10.440]  trying to sell this idea. They are wargaming it. They are preparing it to the point that
[14:10.440 --> 14:18.080]  on ABC, CNN, MSNBC, anybody can search these terms and pull up these transcripts. In the
[14:18.080 --> 14:24.840]  last month, they started floating, national emergency, national emergency, national emergency.
[14:24.840 --> 14:31.280]  We need Obama to declare a national emergency. Then they'll announce they're having an investigation
[14:31.280 --> 14:38.440]  for six months until there's a new election. You see, and then even if there is a new election,
[14:38.440 --> 14:44.920]  Homeland Security, here's the key, federalized the elections last week. Now remember, I told
[14:44.920 --> 14:50.200]  you that a month before they actually came out and announced they were going to start
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.240]  the process. That was a month that I had before the election. Now, people keep asking, how
[14:54.240 --> 14:59.720]  do I keep predicting all this? Do I have a magical crystal ball? No, ladies and gentlemen,
[14:59.720 --> 15:05.240]  I have sources throughout the Pentagon, throughout the CIA, throughout the FBI, throughout the
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.080]  federal marshals, and I've got sources even above that. I've been on the phone the last
[15:10.080 --> 15:17.560]  week with people in this government at the highest levels. Let's just understand, this
[15:17.560 --> 15:23.560]  is not smoke you're getting here. This is hardcore reality. If people think the globalist
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.120]  aren't going to try something, when their whole world government is going down in flames,
[15:27.120 --> 15:34.920]  they'll want, think again, the whole table is set. Meanwhile, another big tell, and this
[15:34.920 --> 15:39.040]  is an intel I got from sources. This is what I saw with my eyeballs. That's usually the
[15:39.040 --> 15:46.440]  best intel for anybody in it. George Soros doubled the week after the huge upset on November
[15:46.440 --> 15:54.240]  8th, 2016. He doubled the amount of money he was giving to the Black Lives Matter, the
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.440]  Communist groups, the Ford Foundation groups, the destabilization groups, the groups calling
[15:58.440 --> 16:03.760]  for civil unrest, burning down cities, killing cops, knockout game, all this garbage. I thought,
[16:03.760 --> 16:09.920]  well, maybe he's just being vindictive. Then I saw the big foundations, and I saw everybody
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.000]  from Kellogg's to the Ford Foundation massively increase what they were giving. In one week,
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.560]  they were giving 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 5 million a piece. Over 30 major corporations
[16:21.560 --> 16:27.120]  were giving over a million a piece. Some 3, 4 million Soros gave 100 million additional
[16:27.120 --> 16:34.800]  that week. Ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about a massive, massive quadrupling down
[16:34.800 --> 16:40.680]  ahead of this inauguration, with them busing in, reportedly, hundreds of thousands of agitators.
[16:40.680 --> 16:45.120]  We have it in the WikiLeaks. They give them drugs. They give them alcohol. They pay the
[16:45.120 --> 16:52.120]  average person $200 a day. Some agitators are paid $1,400 a day to physically attack
[16:52.120 --> 16:57.560]  people that Soros' lawyers get them out of prison. This guy's overthrown Ukraine. This
[16:57.560 --> 17:01.800]  guy's overthrown the Middle East with the Arab Spring. They mean business, and their
[17:01.800 --> 17:08.440]  mouths are wet with the blood of the innocent. They've got a bloodthirsty taste of victory
[17:08.440 --> 17:12.320]  in all these other countries, and they really think they can do this. Trump is aware of
[17:12.320 --> 17:18.440]  what's going on. Trump has plans in place, but everybody better know this. Be ready to
[17:18.440 --> 17:22.160]  call C-SPAM. Be ready to call talk radio. Be ready to really take action, get a buzz
[17:22.160 --> 17:27.280]  going out there, but they better not try martial law, because that's the kind of thing that
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.840]  can spook them off of doing this, if their program is exposed. And another thing Trump
[17:32.840 --> 17:39.520]  needs to do, he needs to get into the hack that happened two years ago that we learned
[17:39.520 --> 17:47.600]  about last year, the OPM hack of $14 million, and then we learned $20 million of these emails.
[17:47.600 --> 17:50.880]  I know he's tweeted about that. When I've talked to him recently, I brought that up.
[17:50.880 --> 17:55.680]  He said, absolutely, it's crazy. Obama let all this stuff get stolen from us, and then
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.520]  they're obsessing on this made-up Russia situation. But the point is, is that that was done on
[18:00.520 --> 18:04.120]  purpose. We were compromised on purpose. They gave our entire database of everybody
[18:04.120 --> 18:08.840]  in the government, the spies, the connections, the informants, to roll us up to the Communist
[18:08.840 --> 18:13.920]  Chinese. That's part of Obama's ongoing sabotage of the country that we see all over the place
[18:13.920 --> 18:20.280]  that he admits he's carrying out with his Scorched Earth operation. So we've got all
[18:20.280 --> 18:27.120]  of this unfolding, and if you add on top of that, and again, this is what Trump needs
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.920]  to do, he needs to come out and say, Hillary, you got money from the Communist Chinese. You
[18:32.920 --> 18:36.560]  got money from the Saudi Arabians. Here are the newspapers where they bragged they gave
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.720]  you money, and where the whole media was on your side. Stop changing the subject onto
[18:40.720 --> 18:44.960]  Russia. You're a liar. You're, you know, a Podesta people took 30-something million
[18:44.960 --> 18:49.440]  from the Russians. You met with Putin in secret, and so stop claiming that I've done
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.960]  what you've done. See, if he hits her with that, it's over. And I know Trump's got a
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.200]  lot of stuff going on in his mind, and he's got Spicer advising him, which is fine, but
[18:58.200 --> 19:02.520]  I've seen a lot of softballs being thrown back by Spicer and others. Every time the
[19:02.520 --> 19:07.600]  president elects those balls, they're hard. And we pointed out the whole hack last week
[19:07.600 --> 19:14.960]  via tweet, but one tweet about the Office of Personnel Management, that is not enough.
[19:14.960 --> 19:20.040]  We need to hammer the daylights out of this, but let's back up for a moment. I'm bringing
[19:20.040 --> 19:23.520]  David Knight in here because he's got Mr. Schneider coming on for a full hour to break
[19:23.520 --> 19:29.440]  all this down and over every facet of this. Ladies and gentlemen, they're nakedly saying
[19:29.440 --> 19:35.360]  they want to overturn the election. They're nakedly trying with the electors and the recounts
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.360]  and all the rest of it. And remember, every time they were trying that, they'd say, well,
[19:39.360 --> 19:44.000]  we're not trying to have the electors overturn the election. That's a conspiracy theory of
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.920]  Alex Jones. Her Nancy Pelosi's daughter leading the effort, as she said, I'm getting death
[19:48.920 --> 19:55.400]  threats. Alex Jones once we did on Kovuto. Totally made up. No, I'm not threatening her.
[19:55.400 --> 20:00.320]  I'm not saying to her, I said, she's leading the charge. They have the electors overturn
[20:00.320 --> 20:05.800]  this election, put things into crisis, federalize the election. This is a soft coup. Well, they're
[20:05.800 --> 20:11.600]  pissed because I called them on what they were doing. Pelosi then went and literally
[20:11.600 --> 20:16.200]  tried to get Loretta Lynch to cook up some federal lawsuit before they left office to
[20:16.200 --> 20:23.200]  try to have me basically indicted. I mean, these people are that crazy that her daughter
[20:23.200 --> 20:29.560]  is running around trying to overturn the election. I call her on it. She goes and cries to mommy.
[20:29.560 --> 20:34.000]  I tell everybody about it in the morning at 11 a.m. And then that afternoon, she's on
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.480]  Kovuto saying the exact thing on national TV. What I'm telling you listeners is I'm
[20:40.480 --> 20:44.560]  not bragging about the show. I'm telling you, this is the broadcast the intelligence
[20:44.560 --> 20:49.320]  agencies listen to. This is what the president elect listens to. This is what anybody who's
[20:49.320 --> 20:53.600]  got half a brain listens to. This is what drugs listens to. It's what Congress listens
[20:53.600 --> 20:59.120]  to because they listen to you. It isn't about Alex Jones. It's about the family of listeners
[20:59.120 --> 21:03.800]  and activists and guest hosts and all of us together are the brain trust and we are the
[21:03.800 --> 21:08.640]  source. We're given the information to respond to the globalist and the info I've been given
[21:08.640 --> 21:15.680]  from our sources has been 100% dead on. There is a real resistance. This country is in total
[21:15.680 --> 21:21.040]  crisis but amazing historical things are happening right now. Now, David Knight, I've laid out
[21:21.040 --> 21:26.520]  a lot of points here. They're prepping the public for a civil emergency. That's a fancy
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.640]  term for martial law. Just like a bunch of made up internet crap, it's not just some
[21:30.640 --> 21:36.280]  sleazy internet message board. You call it a dossier. Well, if you're preparing martial
[21:36.280 --> 21:42.120]  law, you don't call it martial law. You call it national emergency with Obama making it
[21:42.120 --> 21:48.720]  all racial, triggering riots nationwide, claiming the people don't accept Trump. They don't
[21:48.720 --> 21:56.360]  accept a Russian agent. He's got to accept emergency elections while he's under investigation.
[21:56.360 --> 22:01.560]  They'll indict a bunch of his underlings. That's the soft power move. They might blow
[22:01.560 --> 22:06.040]  up Trump Tower. I'm sorry to talk like this, but anything can happen. They might, charging
[22:06.040 --> 22:10.920]  during the inauguration, these people are not giving up until we get on the offense
[22:10.920 --> 22:16.320]  and let them know we know who you are. We know what you're doing. Yes, Nancy Pelosi's
[22:16.320 --> 22:20.000]  daughter. I bet you did get some mean phone calls and things because you're trying to
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.280]  overthrow an election. Don't look at me and tell me I did something when it's you and
[22:25.280 --> 22:30.760]  your mommy squatting on top of this country and your mother under your leaderless garbage
[22:30.760 --> 22:35.320]  with the Democrats is now leading the fight against America with Soros. Almost everybody
[22:35.320 --> 22:39.640]  else is quitting. Almost everybody else is rolling over and giving up. Basically, Obama
[22:39.640 --> 22:46.600]  is now taking orders from Nancy Pelosi and Soros. He's too busy crying and bitching and
[22:46.600 --> 22:51.000]  complaining that his legacy of killing this country is being overthrown. He's too busy
[22:51.000 --> 22:56.240]  giving Biden the Medal of Freedom Award where both of them cry as narcissistic loons. He's
[22:56.240 --> 23:01.480]  too busy saying, we'll take anybody from anywhere in the world with no evidence of who you are,
[23:01.480 --> 23:06.280]  known jihadis, you name it, but if the Cubans are fleeing tyranny, they can't come here.
[23:06.280 --> 23:11.600]  He's just enacted that with eight days out. We're now seven days out. And here on Friday
[23:11.600 --> 23:18.240]  the 13th, I want the listeners to understand the incredible, historic, life changing, once
[23:18.240 --> 23:23.360]  in a lifetime events that we're seeing unfold. David, what do you think of this overall breakdown
[23:23.360 --> 23:24.360]  I put out there?
[23:24.360 --> 23:29.160]  Isn't it interesting, Alex, one of the last things you mentioned is Obama's move now against
[23:29.160 --> 23:33.800]  Cubans. I grew up in Florida. I knew a lot of Cubans and they were real free market
[23:33.800 --> 23:38.760]  people. And so that's the only group that Obama doesn't want to have come in the United
[23:38.760 --> 23:41.960]  States. So that's, I think, that's kind of interesting. But when you're talking about
[23:41.960 --> 23:46.800]  Soros, you know, we look at Rosie O'Donnell and clearly the rhetoric that she's got out
[23:46.800 --> 23:51.800]  here is inflammatory, you know, but the issue is whether wittingly or unwittingly, what
[23:51.800 --> 23:56.840]  she's doing is supporting the efforts of George Soros, Bill Ayers, Black Lives Matter and
[23:56.840 --> 24:01.160]  the rest of these people who the day after the election started with violence. Now, Michael
[24:01.160 --> 24:04.960]  Snyder that's coming up in the next hour, Alex, he pointed out in this article, some
[24:04.960 --> 24:09.440]  of the more moderate groups are talking about things like civil resistance, civil disobedience.
[24:09.440 --> 24:14.200]  But the others openly talking about blockades, they're talking about citywide paralysis and
[24:14.200 --> 24:19.280]  listen, Alex, to who this is. People like Cornell West or educator, put that word in
[24:19.280 --> 24:24.240]  quotes, educator Bill Ayers and Carl Dickson, the Communist Party USA and their group is
[24:24.240 --> 24:29.160]  called Disrupt J20, Disrupt January the 20th. So we're going to talking to him about that
[24:29.160 --> 24:33.640]  in the next hour. But that's precisely what this is. And yesterday, Glenn Greenwall said,
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.920]  look, the left is going hysterical, they're losing, they lost to Trump and they're upset
[24:38.920 --> 24:42.160]  about this. He says, if you don't like their policies and Glenn Greenwall said, I don't
[24:42.160 --> 24:46.800]  like Trump. So, but I'm going to oppose him in the marketplace of ideas. There's other
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.440]  ways to do this other than embracing the kind of tactics that have been used and other
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.320]  countries to overthrow their governments by the CIA and embracing that here at home. And
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.360]  that's the real issue. That's what he said that deep state has come out and declared
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.600]  war against Donald Trump. That's right. The deep state exactly has declared war against
[25:04.600 --> 25:10.120]  Donald Trump. And here's what I'm getting at. Just like when the month before they went
[25:10.120 --> 25:14.160]  after the electors, they were going after him covertly. We were exposing it and they
[25:14.160 --> 25:18.320]  would say, oh, you're conspiracy theorist. No one's going after the electors. They don't
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.040]  want any opposition to mount to their ongoing programs. So what I'm saying is they're currently
[25:23.040 --> 25:29.440]  with seven days left seriously trying not just the more on left, but the deep state
[25:29.440 --> 25:35.480]  to sell the public on the suspension of the election, a national emergency and basically
[25:35.480 --> 25:40.000]  martial law. And that's why you hear Rosie O'Donnell saying this because these talking
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.280]  points are being discussed by the leftist in newspapers. I mean, they're in the New
[25:44.280 --> 25:49.840]  York Times. They're in the Washington Post calling for impeachment to begin right away,
[25:49.840 --> 25:55.400]  even for a suspension of this election. They're already calling for it. It's so unconstitutional.
[25:55.400 --> 25:59.920]  It's so naked. It's so brazen. We are having trouble believing they're even doing this,
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.480]  but I'm trying to assure everyone they are currently moving and are currently trying
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.640]  this because look, even Bernie Sanders has had to come out and say, okay, Trump's right
[26:09.640 --> 26:13.640]  on trade. Okay, Trump's right on bringing the tax money back. Okay, Trump really is
[26:13.640 --> 26:18.240]  bringing jobs back because his own constituents are turning against Sanders. Sanders is a
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.380]  slime ball, but he understands which way the wind is blowing. He understands real
[26:22.380 --> 26:28.160]  prosperity is here. Trump is turning off all the globalist policies that have made this
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.960]  country a rust bucket. The globalists are in full panic. Trump intends folks to completely
[26:33.960 --> 26:39.040]  deliver. Then it'll just be up to us to be moral and hardworking and save money and be
[26:39.040 --> 26:43.720]  good people. But this country and the world, America doing well will make the rest of the
[26:43.720 --> 26:48.680]  world do well. It's not a zero-sum game. It's a non-zero-sum game or a 361 as we talk
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.840]  about, and Trump understands that the engine of liberty, the engine of renaissance will
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.320]  empower the entire world for anybody that wants to work hard and be moral. So they are
[26:58.320 --> 27:05.480]  incomplete in total panic mode. And as you said, David, they are activating the sorrow
[27:05.480 --> 27:13.320]  cells to disrupt and block. It's being literally led. A former head of the weatherman underground
[27:13.320 --> 27:18.600]  was connected to bombing and blowing the eyeballs out of police officers, you name it, and who
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.400]  openly, openly in those meetings that came out in the FBI files and court hearings, was
[27:23.400 --> 27:27.800]  planning to put 15 million Americans in reeducation camps and kill 25 million. It was, we ought
[27:27.800 --> 27:34.040]  to pull up Larry Graftwold. Pull up that after the break. Pull up Graftwold and fight that
[27:34.040 --> 27:39.560]  in 1998 because these people mean business. They cannot compete with the free market.
[27:39.560 --> 27:44.600]  They cannot compete with America. The world of globalism and authoritarianism, no matter
[27:44.600 --> 27:51.480]  what spot or what type or what the vector, what degree, can not compete with free market
[27:51.480 --> 27:56.160]  and the open market of ideas. Look at how you get 1,000 flavors of everything. You get
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.240]  every choice you could ever imagine. You get being able to fly anywhere in the world inexpensively
[28:01.240 --> 28:06.480]  and get rent cars instantly and have medicine instantly. And people sit around lazily and
[28:06.480 --> 28:09.880]  bitch about this. Well, the globalists have an answer to that. They're going to take you
[28:09.880 --> 28:15.240]  all away from you like North Korea or Venezuela or Cuba and look at Obama. As long as you
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.480]  come here from an authoritarian country, you can come here. You got diseases, you can come
[28:19.480 --> 28:22.360]  here. You got no documentation, you can come here. You want to come here and have a baby
[28:22.360 --> 28:27.680]  for free? You can come here. But you're a bunch of Cubans fleeing 50-something years
[28:27.680 --> 28:32.240]  of absolute total tyranny and hundreds of thousands murdered and millions in prison.
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.760]  When you come here and you're active, you're pro-gun, you're pro-American, you're pro-freedom,
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.840]  I can't tell you how many times it's Cuban-Americans fighting tyranny, 10 to 1 what other Americans
[28:41.840 --> 28:46.200]  are doing. And the globalists are in panic mode. They're like, no more of these Cubans.
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.360]  You keep them out. It shows the complete evil agenda of these people, David.
[28:50.360 --> 28:53.680]  Yeah, you know, Alex, we were talking about the electoral college and of course we saw
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.600]  that happen with the nomination. We saw it with the election. They say, hey, we're going
[28:56.600 --> 29:01.720]  to get people to overthrow the votes of the voters in the various states. But also remember
[29:01.720 --> 29:08.440]  that it was Evan McMullen, former CIA guy that Glenn Beck and others pushed in Utah to try
[29:08.440 --> 29:11.120]  to block Trump from getting an electoral majority.
[29:11.120 --> 29:14.880]  They thought that would be a very effective strategy that didn't realize just how far
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.880]  out he was. But of course, this is a guy who went to meet with ISIS, went with John McCain
[29:19.880 --> 29:24.080]  to meet with ISIS. Evan McMullen, this is the guy they picked, the CIA operative.
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.000]  Exactly, David. That's why you're so great. You'll bring up all the backstory, all the
[29:28.000 --> 29:34.160]  background. This whole thing are rogue criminal multinational corporate agents that have infiltrated
[29:34.160 --> 29:40.040]  the CIA, the NSA. These bodies were set up, especially the CIA, to bring America into
[29:40.040 --> 29:45.600]  globalism. It was set up from the beginning out of the whole Rhodes scholarship. It was
[29:45.600 --> 29:50.440]  all the Cecil Rhodes plan. He wrote multiple books on it. They set up the Pratt House in
[29:50.440 --> 29:57.440]  New York in 1921 to do it. The CFR, that's the World Commission on International Affairs.
[30:20.440 --> 30:25.440]  Their act will soon be history. Amen. Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[30:25.440 --> 30:32.200]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared of
[30:32.200 --> 30:37.360]  all charges. All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed. The only problem with that
[30:37.360 --> 30:43.120]  is, there are no charges to be cleared. Just fake news allegations that you fall for. Remember
[30:43.120 --> 30:47.160]  her side of the fence before the election? When they go low, we go high. Trump and Republicans
[30:47.160 --> 30:51.160]  need to accept the results, so much for that. Two things were confirmed today. Trump on
[30:51.160 --> 30:55.520]  Twitter is awesome, and Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron. Jabba the
[30:55.520 --> 31:21.520]  Hutt in the flesh. This is Owen Troyer for Infowars.com.

[33:28.080 --> 33:32.480]  have a couple hours to break all this kind of latest out for you and hopefully later
[33:32.480 --> 33:37.440]  I'll open the phones up and take your calls. But as he was just getting into, we have the
[33:37.440 --> 33:44.360]  CIA former field commander up in Utah starting this whole electorate deal and trying to get
[33:44.360 --> 33:53.680]  electors to turn against Trump. This started basically the day after the election on November
[33:53.680 --> 33:58.960]  9th. Before that, he was trying to get Utahns to vote for him so that they could broker
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.960]  a deal and basically still defeat Trump. This guy admittedly works for McCain as David
[34:04.960 --> 34:10.280]  Nye just said, went over and met with ISIS, met with Al-Nazra, met with Al-Qaeda. These
[34:10.280 --> 34:16.960]  are truly monstrous, monstrous individuals. But guess what we did? We came out before
[34:16.960 --> 34:21.160]  the election and after it and said, this guy's just come back. Again, I don't want to sit
[34:21.160 --> 34:27.280]  here and just say it's all CIA. I'm not defending the CIA either. It's criminals. It's globalists.
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.120]  It's corrupt individuals. It's operatives of this system that wants to basically enslave
[34:32.120 --> 34:40.080]  everybody that are inside and in control of these institutions that are above the law.
[34:40.080 --> 34:44.360]  The CIA, according to its charter out of the National Security Act of 1947, is basically
[34:44.360 --> 34:50.120]  above the law and invisible. It's worse than the UN with its diplomatic community. I mean,
[34:50.120 --> 34:56.480]  it has license to kill. It's out of control. It's a perfect system for a takeover of the
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.560]  country. The group claiming they're protecting the country are really the ones using the
[35:01.560 --> 35:07.600]  country to dominate and take over the world at our expense. That's about to come to an
[35:07.600 --> 35:12.200]  end. They have mismanaged things. Even from a Machiavellian perspective, they have not
[35:12.200 --> 35:17.280]  delivered. Even on their promise to their own controllers, they have destabilized the
[35:17.280 --> 35:22.160]  world. They have created a more evil world, a more unstable world. And so they're being
[35:22.160 --> 35:29.040]  rejected at Americanism. Not globalism is returning and the new world order is panicking.
[35:29.040 --> 35:34.000]  So I want to play this wrath wall clip, the FBI informant, from his meetings inside the
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.440]  Weather Underground with Bill Ayers. This issue was just given hundreds of millions
[35:39.440 --> 35:45.800]  of dollars by the big foundations and the big Fortune 100, and George Soros gave over
[35:45.800 --> 35:50.320]  100 million right after the election to these groups, but hundreds of millions more. I mean,
[35:50.320 --> 35:54.760]  the numbers, as you see, it's just unknown. It's billions the last few years. But since
[35:54.760 --> 36:02.480]  the election, just a few months ago, massive funding of this individual, I brought up the
[36:02.480 --> 36:08.200]  subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government. You know, we become
[36:08.200 --> 36:16.760]  responsible then for administrating, you know, 250 million people. And there was no answers.
[36:16.760 --> 36:22.320]  No one had given any thought to economics. How are you going to clothe and feed these
[36:22.320 --> 36:27.600]  people? The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the
[36:27.600 --> 36:33.320]  North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions
[36:33.320 --> 36:38.520]  of the United States. They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to
[36:38.520 --> 36:44.840]  protect against what they called the counterrevolution. And they felt that this counterrevolution
[36:44.840 --> 36:51.800]  could best be guarded against by creating and establishing reeducation centers in the
[36:51.800 --> 36:59.160]  Southwest, where we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated into the new way
[36:59.160 --> 37:06.280]  of thinking and teach them how things were going to be. I asked, well, what is going
[37:06.280 --> 37:13.360]  to happen to those people that we can't reeducate, that are diehard capitalists? And the reply
[37:13.360 --> 37:19.080]  was that they'd have to be eliminated. And when I pursued this further, they estimated
[37:19.080 --> 37:25.160]  that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers. And when
[37:25.160 --> 37:33.000]  I say eliminate, I mean kill. 25 million people. I want you to imagine sitting in a room with
[37:33.000 --> 37:43.280]  25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational
[37:43.280 --> 37:51.200]  centers, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[37:51.200 --> 37:53.720]  And they were dead serious.
[37:53.720 --> 37:58.600]  Now, people ask why I get upset on air. And it's because I've got hundreds of points
[37:58.600 --> 38:03.280]  I want to make. I'm teleprompter-free, and I'm just so upset and frustrated because
[38:03.280 --> 38:08.000]  I know we're up against people just like Larry Grathwald just died a few years ago. I was
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.520]  breaking down. By the way, I interviewed him several times over the years. I didn't know
[38:11.520 --> 38:15.720]  how sick he was right before he died. I interviewed him. We should probably dig that interview
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.720]  up. And I think after Trump gets inaugurated and gets in, we should probably take some
[38:20.720 --> 38:26.440]  of the folks that aren't here with us anymore and posthumously give them awards for their
[38:26.440 --> 38:30.840]  fight against the globalists that maybe even give some cash rewards to their family, just
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.840]  because we need to recognize the real patriots and have our own award ceremonies, not to
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.400]  ourselves, but to those that have paid the ultimate price and fought so hard. That's
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.840]  what I'm discussing, to see Biden being awarded the Medal of Freedom and a surprise ceremony,
[38:44.840 --> 38:51.080]  brimming with emotion, of all presents, VP, the nation's top civilian honor. I mean,
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.880]  they admit everything they're doing is to sabotage this country for the globalists,
[38:54.880 --> 39:01.640]  to sell us off to the communist Chinese. They gave the 14 to 20 million identities and entire
[39:01.640 --> 39:07.360]  system to roll up the entire U.S. spy network and all of their assets. They blew us wide
[39:07.360 --> 39:11.880]  up and they brought us down. They sold us out. That's another reason you're seeing
[39:11.880 --> 39:16.280]  this whole struggle right now is because they've just come so far. They've opened the borders
[39:16.280 --> 39:22.520]  for three years and let people in that they know have syphilis, drug-resistant TB, and
[39:22.520 --> 39:29.680]  yes, even things like flesh eating, a bacteria, and of course, leprosy. I would tell people
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.920]  about leprosy three years ago because I have health department sources in Florida, Texas,
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.040]  and California, and they would say, oh, you're crazy. There's no leprosy. Well, now it's
[39:38.040 --> 39:44.880]  in the Associated Press. They put kids with leprosy in schools in Texas and in California
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.880]  in liberal areas and then let it spread and then use it as a test case with the health
[39:50.880 --> 39:56.240]  departments through DHS to see if they can cover it up, just like they used to Ebola
[39:56.240 --> 39:59.560]  cases all over the United States and they were all over the United States and it even
[39:59.560 --> 40:04.800]  came out here and there as a cover-up drill. All of this is testing what they can get away
[40:04.800 --> 40:12.320]  with and a criminal, globalist, multinational cabal is in control of the CIA. The Robert
[40:12.320 --> 40:16.040]  Barron's set up the UN to transfer our power to it and other multinational groups like
[40:16.040 --> 40:23.960]  TPP and the WTO. We're now awakening to that and saying no and so now they are openly,
[40:23.960 --> 40:27.240]  just like they did with the electors and the recount. Nobody believed me until it started
[40:27.240 --> 40:32.040]  happening. They're now priming the pump for civil emergency in the next seven days with
[40:32.040 --> 40:36.960]  huge riots kicking off. I'm not saying this is going to happen. I'm saying they're planning
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.120]  it. They admit it. They are been prepping it. They're saying that the election should
[40:41.120 --> 40:47.040]  be suspended and so I'm going to ask David this as I leave. Okay. I wanted to think
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.440]  and write some notes here. David and I want to ask Snyder coming up. I want to ask you
[40:51.440 --> 40:55.640]  the listeners. I want to create a debate around this. What do we do with seven days down here
[40:55.640 --> 41:02.520]  on Friday the 13th to focus attention on this and to expose it? I think we tweeted Trump.
[41:02.520 --> 41:08.400]  We write articles. We put out videos. We tell Trump, hey, we've done a great job. We think
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.800]  you need to come out and point out that Hillary was bought off of the Chinese and the Saudi
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.160]  Arabians and that's why you changed the subject under Russia and that you're going to be
[41:17.160 --> 41:21.440]  investigated Hillary, which is now being announced. Take the gloves off. They knew Trump was
[41:21.440 --> 41:24.000]  always going after Hillary. He was always going to drain the swamp. He was always going
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.320]  to lock her up, but he had to play possum. They now know it was always possum. So this
[41:29.320 --> 41:33.320]  is a death battle, folks. This is an epic time. Call in the C-SPAN. Call in other talk
[41:33.320 --> 41:39.720]  shows. Get all over the internet. Comment everywhere. Do banner hangs on highways. Whatever
[41:39.720 --> 41:44.880]  is legal and lawful, come to DC to stand up against these communists in a peaceful way
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.480]  and totally outnumber them like we did in Cleveland so they shrunk back in their holes.
[41:49.480 --> 41:54.040]  I'm closing. I'm ahead of the baton of David Knight. I get so focused on fighting the globalist.
[41:54.040 --> 41:58.840]  I don't even plug our products to what we do here, whether it's anti-globalist t-shirts
[41:58.840 --> 42:03.360]  or Molan lobby t-shirts, whether it's non-GMO or heirloom seeds, or whether it's the supplements
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.280]  or just extending sales of whatever's still in stock and whatever's come back in, like
[42:07.280 --> 42:13.200]  Selenium was sold out. Biotry's Selenium, truly amazing. That's back. DNA force is back.
[42:13.200 --> 42:18.960]  That is 10% off. That has been sold out for two months. We have, what, 30% off on a whole
[42:18.960 --> 42:24.560]  bunch of the products. Brain force are amazing. Neutropic. More supermelt vitality came in,
[42:24.560 --> 42:29.840]  but a limited amount will be a month until more comes in. That's about to sell out.
[42:29.840 --> 42:33.680]  We've got a whole bunch of stuff discounted. Later, David can list it all, but it's at
[42:33.680 --> 42:40.360]  m4warstore.com or m4warslive.com. But whatever you do, support the broadcast. Spread the
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.160]  links. Spread the videos. But also, these are great products, whether it's Props2Guard
[42:45.160 --> 42:51.680]  or whether it's our super high-quality Mediterranean organic oil of oregano caplets that are 100%
[42:51.680 --> 42:55.880]  pure and absorb right into your body. The very best out there, whether it's the sleep
[42:55.880 --> 42:59.760]  aid knockout, whether it's the lung cleanse, whether it's the liver shield, whether it's
[42:59.760 --> 43:06.040]  the natural defense parasite cleanse, it's all available at m4warslive.com or call toll
[43:06.040 --> 43:10.840]  free, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. We have almost 30 products now.
[43:10.840 --> 43:16.560]  Yongevity is another great company I work with. They have over 400 products. m4warsteam.com
[43:16.560 --> 43:22.800]  when you get beyond Tangierine 2.0 or Polymerc or the Osio FX products. When you sign up
[43:22.800 --> 43:27.560]  for auto-ship, you get free shipping. When you sign up to be a distributor, you get big
[43:27.560 --> 43:33.000]  discounts and a small part of the money that they make goes to fund our operation, about
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.320]  5%, 6%, 7% depending on what you purchase, and that helps fund the operation. So if you
[43:37.320 --> 43:44.040]  love Yongevity products like I do, m4warsteam.com as well is the key site for that. But this
[43:44.040 --> 43:51.800]  is just, I keep saying historical time, and everybody overuses the word epic. People overuse
[43:51.800 --> 43:58.280]  the word saying it's like Hitler. Trump finally came out and said, the media and the agencies
[43:58.280 --> 44:02.720]  are acting like Hitler. Yeah, Hitler overthrew governments. Hitler did corrupt things. Hitler
[44:02.720 --> 44:08.000]  lied about people. This is very Hitlerian. All the surveillance, all the tyranny, all
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.640]  the corruption, all the spies, all the manipulations. It's very authoritarian. And David, you made
[44:12.640 --> 44:16.200]  a really good central point here today, and I'm going to hand the baton to you and just
[44:16.200 --> 44:21.120]  ask you what else we can do. But you were making the point that you hope Trump is learning
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.000]  about the surveillance state because the one area he's been bad in, his heart, and he means
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.600]  well, he's very smart, he's a good guy, he believes we'll believe the government's good,
[44:28.600 --> 44:33.240]  and the surveillance is okay. No, it's always using us innocent people. It's a Pandora's
[44:33.240 --> 44:37.280]  box. We need to get back to the Constitution and Bill of Rights for a reason. We need to
[44:37.280 --> 44:42.160]  get back to not, as you said, Obama as he leaves is changing laws or regulations for
[44:42.160 --> 44:45.400]  now. They're going to track everywhere you go and what you do. Of course, they were
[44:45.400 --> 44:49.600]  always doing that, but now they're admitting it. And so perhaps now that Trump has been
[44:49.600 --> 44:54.400]  burned by this evil surveillance grid and has experienced it and seen what it's done
[44:54.400 --> 45:00.360]  to Hillary and everybody else, maybe he'll move to afford all of us the protection guaranteed
[45:00.360 --> 45:05.480]  to us under our American system. Because after all, it's Americanism, not globalism. David,
[45:05.480 --> 45:09.800]  I'm going to hand the baton to you, my friend. Thank you, and great crew for the wonderful
[45:09.800 --> 45:10.800]  job you're doing, my friend.
[45:10.800 --> 45:17.520]  Thank you, Alex. And that truly is my hope. And Donald Trump is a smart guy. And unlike
[45:17.520 --> 45:23.120]  these other people, he's not controlled by these cabals. He's his own man. And so I
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.960]  truly believe that if, as he sees these types of things happening to him, and as he hears
[45:28.960 --> 45:33.000]  other people, he can change his mind on issues. I mean, he is open to things like that. That's
[45:33.000 --> 45:40.720]  why we see the situation that we saw with RFK Jr. crossing the lines of party lines
[45:40.720 --> 45:46.400]  and saying, hey, I'll work with Donald Trump against the CDC's abuses. And of course, we
[45:46.400 --> 45:51.120]  just have this article today about Allison Young, USA Today, pointing out how the CDC
[45:51.120 --> 45:55.960]  is keeping secret all of its mishaps with deadly germs. So it's not just vaccines, it's these
[45:55.960 --> 46:01.200]  other things. We have these quasi-governmental organizations like the Federal Reserve, like
[46:01.200 --> 46:05.320]  the CDC. They need to be audited. The CDC needs to be audited as well. But when we see people
[46:05.320 --> 46:09.960]  like RFK Jr. come across, and we got the article up on infowars.com, Bernie Sanders say, hey,
[46:09.960 --> 46:13.680]  I agree with Donald Trump. I'd like to change the infrastructure, as long as we make sure
[46:13.680 --> 46:18.720]  that we don't give it all away to private companies, as long as we don't privatize the
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.520]  infrastructure. I'd like to work with them on the Trans-Pacific Partnership too. So we
[46:22.520 --> 46:29.600]  have people that we have profound disagreements with, like RFK Jr. and Bernie Sanders on many
[46:29.600 --> 46:32.680]  issues. We have profound agreements. But I think the key thing that Donald Trump can
[46:32.680 --> 46:36.560]  do, and we've already seen him do this, and we can see it, I think to some extent in the
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.280]  confirmation hearings, is that he doesn't have unilateral agreement with everybody on
[46:41.280 --> 46:45.200]  everything. He doesn't demand that people come in and agree with him on everything and
[46:45.200 --> 46:50.120]  be yes men. And so I think it's important that we look at these confirmation hearings
[46:50.120 --> 46:53.200]  that we see what people are saying, and we understand also that he's going to remain
[46:53.200 --> 46:56.280]  in charge. At least that's what we hope. We hope that it doesn't turn around the other
[46:56.280 --> 46:59.360]  way. That's why we're concerned when we see certain people that are in the cabinet that
[46:59.360 --> 47:02.600]  say, well, we're going in this way, and Donald Trump has been saying, no, I'm going in the
[47:02.600 --> 47:07.080]  other way. We always hope that we're gonna wait and see which way the influence goes.
[47:07.080 --> 47:10.440]  But I think he's a strong leader. I think he will do the right thing if these people
[47:10.440 --> 47:14.080]  go in a different direction. And before I get to some of this other news, I gotta say
[47:14.080 --> 47:18.720]  one of the things that Alex mentioned about Joe Biden getting the Medal of Freedom and
[47:18.720 --> 47:24.200]  crying about it. That's something that really bothered me to see that. Not the fact that
[47:24.200 --> 47:27.760]  he's crying, not the fact that he's getting sentimental about his son's death. I think
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.280]  that had a lot to do with it because that was mentioned by Obama. But look, my remembrance
[47:33.280 --> 47:38.800]  of Joe Biden is before he got the hair transplants, before he became Vice President. I remember
[47:38.800 --> 47:43.000]  the Clarence Thomas hearings, the same type of stuff that we're seeing now going on with
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.720]  the Cabinet. My wife and I were on vacation at the time. We were listening to them in
[47:47.720 --> 47:54.240]  the radio as they were being broadcast live. And I remember Joe Biden railing against Clarence
[47:54.240 --> 48:01.000]  Thomas because Clarence Thomas had supported the concept of natural rights and by extension
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.280]  natural law. In other words, our rights come from God. They're not granted by government.
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.400]  Government is there to protect the rights that we have inherently as human beings. That's
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.400]  the Declaration of Independence. And I could not believe that Joe Biden was absolutely
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.800]  incensed by the fact that Clarence Thomas would support that. He felt that Clarence
[48:20.800 --> 48:25.920]  Thomas supporting the principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence by Jefferson
[48:25.920 --> 48:30.560]  and the signers, he thought that those fundamental American principles of natural rights and
[48:30.560 --> 48:35.880]  natural law were disqualifying for Clarence Thomas. Can you believe that? I mean, go back
[48:35.880 --> 48:41.200]  and take a look at what he said in those hearings. Absolutely amazing. And here's the guy that
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.280]  Barack Obama gives a presidential medal of freedom. He doesn't support freedom. He doesn't
[48:46.280 --> 48:51.160]  support individual rights. He doesn't support liberty in any way, shape, or form. Now later
[48:51.160 --> 48:53.920]  in the program, we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson. He's the president of
[48:53.920 --> 49:00.960]  Energy and Environment Legal. And we see this explosion of regulations that are coming from
[49:00.960 --> 49:06.880]  Obama, especially in the last days, especially through the EPA. The EPA, it doesn't say,
[49:06.880 --> 49:11.800]  for the last two days, the EPA has gone after yet another major car company. We had three
[49:11.800 --> 49:19.400]  days ago, they arrested a VW executive. And I would say basically they kidnapped him.
[49:19.400 --> 49:24.240]  But then the next day, yesterday, they came after Chrysler, Chrysler's stock tank. They
[49:24.240 --> 49:29.320]  said, you cheated on diesel. So the same thing they came after VW with. Now today they're
[49:29.320 --> 49:33.440]  coming after Renault and saying, Renault, you cheated on your diesels. Do you see a
[49:33.440 --> 49:37.640]  pattern here? They want to shut down diesel engines. They want to shut down internal combustion
[49:37.640 --> 49:42.400]  engines and that's a globalist tactic, just like the way they're coming after coal.
[49:42.400 --> 49:45.880]  So we're going to talk to Craig Richardson about that. And of course, in the next hour,
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.200]  we're going to be joined by Michael Snyder, a frequent contributor to infowars.com, about
[49:51.200 --> 49:55.760]  the anarchists that are hoping to turn Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th and one
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.360]  of the biggest riots in US history. That's his article. Also asking, why is Obama moving
[50:00.360 --> 50:04.200]  troops into Poland and provoking a war with Russia right before the inauguration?
[50:04.200 --> 50:09.040]  So he's doing a lot of things and he's hoping that Donald Trump will not be able to turn
[50:09.040 --> 50:14.840]  these back. He's hoping that they can do these things, put them in terms of provocative cold
[50:14.840 --> 50:21.320]  war actions and that he can tie Donald Trump's hands by saying, you are a Russian agent.
[50:21.320 --> 50:26.040]  So they're doing everything that they can to make that come true. Today we've got the
[50:26.040 --> 50:30.880]  Washington Post saying, some people are calling Donald Trump a Manchurian candidate. Notice
[50:30.880 --> 50:34.320]  how cleverly they do that. They don't say, we think he's a Manchurian candidate. They
[50:34.320 --> 50:38.680]  imply that he's a Manchurian candidate. And we come back from the break. I'm going to
[50:38.680 --> 50:45.280]  tell you who the real Manchurian candidate was and is. Okay? It's not Donald Trump yet.
[50:45.280 --> 51:00.840]  You guessed it. His name starts with a no. We'll be right back.

[54:10.880 --> 54:16.200]  want to go back and talk about the real Manchurian candidate. Washington Post is implying that
[54:16.200 --> 54:21.840]  Trump is very strongly implying and they say, let us tell you what this metaphor is about.
[54:21.840 --> 54:24.520]  And so we're going to talk about that article, you know, because you have all these different
[54:24.520 --> 54:28.280]  movies that have come up that have become metaphors. Movies like Gaslight, we're talking
[54:28.280 --> 54:32.400]  about Gaslighting or Kitch 22. And they say, well, Manchurian candidate, you know, that's
[54:32.400 --> 54:38.320]  a metaphor as well. Let's explain that. Not directly attacking Trump, but in a very passive
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.560]  aggressive way is what the Washington Post is doing. Same way that CNN came after him
[54:42.560 --> 54:46.560]  earlier this week. So we're going to talk about that in just a moment. Real quickly, Alex
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.000]  is talking about the specials that we have. It's very important at the beginning of the
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.960]  year, I think, to establish new habits. It's one of the ways that we can improve our lives.
[54:53.960 --> 54:57.120]  Everybody's looking to try to make themselves healthier as the new year begins. One of the
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.800]  ways you do that is by establishing habits. You know, one of the things I've noticed when
[55:00.800 --> 55:05.800]  I had a little bit of time, a little bit more time than usual, I would kind of see a dip
[55:05.800 --> 55:10.880]  in my energy level over the weekends because over the weekends, I wasn't taking the supplements
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.440]  from him for wars I typically take. Things like Supermail Vitality or Survival Shield
[55:15.440 --> 55:21.640]  X2-NASA 999. I have a routine, a habit that I do that on weekdays. And I would get involved
[55:21.640 --> 55:25.280]  with other things. I didn't have that habit on weekends. And I could notice a difference.
[55:25.280 --> 55:28.560]  I don't notice a difference on most of the things when I take them right away, except
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.040]  for things like brain force. That focuses my thoughts. So I definitely notice it with
[55:33.040 --> 55:37.600]  that. But the other ones, I didn't notice it until a couple of days went by without
[55:37.600 --> 55:42.560]  taking them. And then I could really notice a difference. So you need to set up your habit.
[55:42.560 --> 55:46.440]  You need to get yourself on auto-ship because we do have products that go out of stock occasionally.
[55:46.440 --> 55:52.080]  We just had DNA force go out of stock for over a month. We've gotten that back in an
[55:52.080 --> 55:59.320]  emergency limited supply and we have offered it as 10% off to help you stock back up. But
[55:59.320 --> 56:05.200]  all the time, we offer 10% off if you set up auto-ship. And if your order is total more
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.560]  than $50 or more, then you get free shipping when you set up auto-ship. But right now,
[56:09.560 --> 56:13.840]  we also have some specials, 30% off brain force, I just mentioned, 30% off Survival
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.280]  Shield X2 nascent iodine, I just mentioned. Also, a super male vitality, 30% off. We have
[56:19.280 --> 56:25.440]  20% off secret 12. That's our vitamin B12 liquid formulation. 20% off of that, 20% off
[56:25.440 --> 56:32.040]  liver shield and knockout, which is our natural sleep aid, prostagard, 20% off, and many others
[56:32.040 --> 56:36.760]  at infowarslife.com. We appreciate your support. That is the way we fund our operation. Media
[56:36.760 --> 56:41.200]  Matters and others are funded by the government, by George Soros and so forth. And we're going
[56:41.200 --> 56:46.320]  to be talking to Michael Snyder in the next segment about the people behind this effort
[56:46.320 --> 56:51.880]  to try to create riots, to try to establish martial law. That's been a tactic of terrorist
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.280]  for a long time, to try to provoke an overstep of the government. But of course, she's calling
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.160]  for martial law. I was really kind of surprised that Rosie O'Donnell could even spell it the
[57:00.160 --> 57:04.320]  right way. Maybe she doesn't really realize, let's be charitable and say she doesn't really
[57:04.320 --> 57:09.920]  realize what she's truly calling for. Because that is truly a serious thing to call for
[57:09.920 --> 57:14.520]  that. But let's go back to this Manchurian candidate, this Slander that Washington Post
[57:14.520 --> 57:19.080]  is putting out there. They're saying, well, a lot of people have said this. Max Boot said
[57:19.080 --> 57:25.520]  it in the New York's time. Max Boot, the perennial, never-trumper, another partisan hack. That's
[57:25.520 --> 57:30.760]  where these things are always coming from. They've called Donald Trump Hitler so many
[57:30.760 --> 57:36.400]  times. It's become a meme. Everybody from Glenn Beck to these people, the Washington
[57:36.400 --> 57:41.360]  Post calling him Hitler. And he noticed the other day how indignant they got. They even
[57:41.360 --> 57:47.120]  had the Anne Frank Museum call out Donald Trump saying, you said these people were acting
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.560]  like Nazis, creating fake information and putting it out there to assassinate your character.
[57:51.560 --> 57:57.400]  He said, that's the type of thing that Nazis did and have done. And they said, you can't
[57:57.400 --> 58:01.400]  invoke the Nazis because then that minimizes the Holocaust. That's what the Anne Frank
[58:01.400 --> 58:07.800]  people said. But it was okay when they did it ad nauseum, over and over again, ad infinitum,
[58:07.800 --> 58:11.960]  okay, against Donald Trump. Now they've got a new one because that's getting old, the
[58:11.960 --> 58:17.200]  Manchurian candidate. The real Manchurian candidate is the guy who had multiple names,
[58:17.200 --> 58:21.440]  the guy who did everything he could to seal his record, the guy who traveled to Pakistan
[58:21.440 --> 58:25.360]  for a while and returned with a new Muslim name, the guy who grew up and was schooled
[58:25.360 --> 58:30.320]  in Islamic Indonesia, the guy who tried to cover up Christian symbols as one of the first
[58:30.320 --> 58:35.080]  speeches that he had when he was inaugurated, the guy who when you saw his birth certificate
[58:35.080 --> 58:39.080]  saw as a forgery, that Manchurian candidate, Barack Obama. Stay with us, we'll be right
[58:39.080 --> 58:40.080]  back.

[59:00.800 --> 59:05.680]  that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[59:05.680 --> 59:12.320]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[59:12.320 --> 59:14.720]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[59:14.720 --> 59:19.800]  And when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different

[59:53.040 --> 1:00:00.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[43:36.020 --> 1:00:33.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight. As we were talking about
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:39.440]  the Washington Post efforts to come up with a new pejorative term, a meme that they can
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:45.040]  throw at Donald Trump. Now, I guess the Hitler thing is getting so old, so tired, they're
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:50.800]  now going to call him the Manchurian candidate, implying that he is associated with Russia.
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:55.800]  And as I pointed out, the real guy that you have to be worried about being a foreign agent
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:01:00.360]  is the one with the secret identities, the multiple names, the hidden past, the forged
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:05.160]  birth certificate. We don't know where this guy came from, Barack Obama. We still don't
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:10.800]  know. That birth certificate is an absolute phony. And if you haven't seen the report
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:17.440]  that Darren McBrain put together with the people that worked on this with Sheriff Arpaio,
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:21.240]  you need to see that. That is a definitive collection of that.
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:27.360]  But they're continuing on with this. He's a foreign agent, a tact. We've got Politico,
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:32.920]  of course, always opposing Donald Trump. Now talking about Pravda on the checkout line.
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:37.720]  Say Pravda on the checkout. Not talking about propaganda or fake news. We're going to call
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:43.520]  the National Inquirer Pravda. And they go in and they say, it's kind of interesting.
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:48.000]  They say, back in 1987, the Inquirer helped to scuttle Gary Hart's presidential ambitions
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.760]  when it published a cover photo of Donna Rice sitting on his lap. And in a 2008 series,
[1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:58.160]  it threw a saddle on John Edwards' presidential bid and rode it into the ground. But the tabloid's
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:04.520]  thrust has always been pure scandal. And really, you know, what they did, yeah, it was a character
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:12.200]  issue, wasn't it? But it paled compared to what Hillary Clinton did. And yet, their idea
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:17.920]  is that somehow, what the National Inquirer did, by routinely, as they point out, depicting
[1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:24.600]  Clinton as crazed, diseased, near death, an ISIS-supporting traitor, a liar, a black
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:31.040]  mailer, corrupt, and a member of a crime family, all of the above, guilty. We talked about
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:36.400]  you all. Is that no scandal? That's not a scandal. They say that these guys having extramarital
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:40.800]  affairs. And of course, it was a big issue with John Edwards because his wife was very
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:46.160]  well respected in liberal circles. And she had breast cancer, was dying of breast cancer.
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:51.000]  And here he is, cheating on her. That was a big deal, big character issue. And that
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  really hurt him. And yet, those things are personal character issues. But look at how
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.400]  broad the problems with Hillary Clinton are. And yet, they're saying, well, they're not
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:06.560]  focusing on scandal here. Don't you think that's scandalous? I mean, violating national security,
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:11.920]  that's not a scandal to Politico. See, that's not something that national inquires should
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:17.920]  be reporting about. And they do the same sort of thing with WikiLeaks. They attack them
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:23.040]  instead of attacking the information that they put out. And they never said that anything
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:27.840]  that WikiLeaks gave us about Hillary Clinton, regardless of the source, they never said
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:32.000]  that any of that stuff was false. And now they're not saying, they don't make an argument
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:39.560]  that the National Enquirer reporting on Hillary Clinton was false. That stuff is true, folks.
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:42.280]  That's why she lost the election. You can't get your head around it, but you're going
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:47.880]  to continue on with this. Trump is a foreign agent. That's a key part of all of this to
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:53.000]  try to destroy him. At the same time, we see a communist Chinese dictator about to speak
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:59.360]  at Davos. And they're bragging about the fact that he is going to be selling globalism.
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:04.560]  Do you see an irony in that? Do you see an irony with the fact that the most hyper-nationalistic,
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:12.040]  the most hegemonic country on earth, the other company, they have the most closed market.
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:18.040]  They violate copyright, left and right there, the most notorious copyright pirates. That
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:23.600]  was what these trade agreements are supposed to shut down. They're currency manipulators.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:29.560]  And yet, they are champions of open trade globalism? You realize how we're being had
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:35.800]  here, don't you? You realize the phoniness of the Chinese coming out and saying that
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:40.160]  populism, protectionism, nativism, the world has come to a historic crossroad where one
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:44.520]  road leads to war, poverty, and confrontation and domination. Now, that's coming from the
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:49.040]  Chinese. They're the most aggressive of anybody. Yeah, we're told it's the Russians we have
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:53.920]  to worry about. Not ISIS. Did the Russians cut off anybody's heads? I don't think so.
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:59.680]  Can't we try to work with them on common ground just like we do JFK, RFK Junior?
[1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:03.560]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act,
[1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:08.160]  with a 51 to 48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves
[1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:12.120]  of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster. Liberal
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:15.880]  tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:20.120]  no, with a nice lecture to go with it. Forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner,
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:24.160]  to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating at nauseam, debate is not allowed
[1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:27.960]  during a vote. Now today, the vote moves on to the House where we have had similar results.
[1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:31.280]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large
[1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:35.200]  blown up photos of children to win sympathy points and try to argue that Republicans are
[1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:39.640]  ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right? Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims
[1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:43.560]  that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by big wigs
[1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:47.320]  and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable
[1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:51.640]  Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions. He also said that Republicans
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:55.520]  had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:06:00.120]  the debate floor. This is Owen Troyer, and I've got jugs of Liberal tears here.
[1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:04.600]  We have the new product at enforce.live.com, Biotru Selenium.
[1:06:04.600 --> 1:06:09.400]  We've had so many requests over the years for Selenium, and just recently we were able
[1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:15.840]  to source a certified organic bioavailable Selenium from Mustard Seed Extract. When you
[1:06:15.840 --> 1:06:20.720]  take Selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It
[1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:26.080]  helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify. Selenium is another one of those
[1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:31.160]  absolute must-haves. The highest concentration of Selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's
[1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:35.920]  actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that
[1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:43.560]  are directly dependent upon Selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:49.480]  really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is so key. Biotru Selenium is the product,
[1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.680]  the best Selenium that we could bring you. We believe it's the best out there at a very,

[1:07:56.640 --> 1:08:22.400]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:30.760]  the show.
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:37.480]  Well, Obama has been a very, very busy person. He's sending masses of troops to the Russian
[1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:43.680]  Polish border with seven days left, a major provocation. They've put new sanctions in
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:48.480]  against Russia. There have been clear cyber attacks against independent media here in
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:55.000]  the United States. He's ended his wet foot, dry foot policy. Cuban migrants reaching US
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:59.840]  soil were allowed to stay previously. Now they're the only group that basically can't
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:05.840]  seek political asylum. They just basically get sent back to the tyrant, to the tyrant's
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:14.800]  brother there in the Cuban Liberty Wonderland, similar to North Korea or Venezuela. But
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:21.320]  meanwhile, Biden is awarded the Medal of Freedom in a surprise ceremony brimming with
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:28.360]  emotion. Oh, lots of cheers. Obama presents VP, the nation's top civilian honor for the
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:33.720]  defense of liberty and freedom. Yeah, like his son, Biden's son, taking over the billions
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:39.960]  of dollars a year of natural gas coming out of Russia through Ukraine. That's a good family
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:43.920]  business. Just put your son over the energy company. So he personally reported, he's going
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:49.160]  to make hundreds of millions of dollars off jacking up the gas prices after they hijack
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:56.680]  it basically into Europe. Yes, giving him an award. But the reason I'm popping in here
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:01.200]  during the transmission with David Knight and Mr. Schneider is I was thinking, you know,
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:08.920]  I've seen this, this meme put out by dying MSM that I'm a Russian dupe and I'm a Russian
[1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:14.720]  idiot and I'm a moron. That's why I started my show 20 plus years ago before this controversy
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:20.000]  even existed last year. That's why I promote the Second Amendment and sovereignty and national
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.480]  borders and private property and the right to religion, everything that made our country
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:30.080]  great. Yes, it's all because I'm a dupe of Putin. I don't speak Russian. I've never
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:35.040]  been to Russia. I've been on Russian TV. I've been on Portuguese and Japanese and British
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:40.360]  TV. But it is true that the Russians have pulled out from the oligarchs, the same globalist.
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:47.680]  So we do have a kinship. We do have some solidarity there. But what an insult to say that we're
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:55.760]  all Manchurian candidates and that we're idiot dupes of Putin. Let me explain what's happening
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:00.080]  here. We have foreign globalist powers that have hijacked this nation. We know that. We
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:05.000]  have to keep hammering that. And these multinationals want us to transfer our sovereignty to the
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:10.200]  these unaccountable secret global boards like TPP and the WTO through deals like NAFTA
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:15.320]  and GAT. It's not happening. We are declaring our sovereignty. We're declaring our individual
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:19.920]  liberty and we're not going to be ruled by far off secret cabals. It's over. So we're
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:26.160]  the one standing up against the foreign takeover. We're the one standing up against the traders
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:31.640]  and the people trying to sell us out to globalism. They're the enemy. So all of you that support
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:36.440]  globalism, you're the idiot dupes that want to be slaves and don't want to control your
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:42.720]  own destiny and have sold out to the system. But I do want to say that Donald Trump, Ron
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:49.520]  Paul and many others deserve a medal of freedom. If we were going to hand these things out,
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:54.400]  but they're the type of men that don't want awards. They just want results and freedom.
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:59.120]  Because what's promoting peace and freedom worldwide is not having a needless new Cold
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:05.080]  War that costs trillions of dollars with Russia. That's what we're breaking down here. That's
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:11.720]  what we're pushing. That's what we're promoting. That's what as a country and a world we want
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:19.880]  is peace in our time. But taking a breath and settling down, the reason I get so upset
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:23.800]  is that we need to be upset. We need to get out of our comfort zone. We need to get out
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:29.000]  of our trances, get out of our hazes, get out of our daydreams and realize globalism
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.680]  is a nightmare. And only being awake is going to reverse that and gives us any chance of
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:38.680]  stopping it. And we've got a great chance of stopping it. But it is the people that
[1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:42.560]  have sold out to globalism that are the true traders, and they know that. And that's why,
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:48.040]  again, they twist reality and turn it back on to us. But really, all of us that have
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:53.960]  been promoting peace and freedom, aren't we the people that deserve the awards? And again,
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:13:02.280]  I'm not saying I want an award. I'm saying it's asinine to see Obama being given awards
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:08.120]  and to see Biden being given awards. And it turns these awards into complete jokes.
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:13.680]  I mean, a Nobel Peace Prize is the biggest joke in the world now. Even the committee
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:18.400]  last year admitted they had discredited themselves giving Obama a peace award with all these
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:23.680]  wars before he'd ever done anything before he even got into office. And giving awards
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:30.720]  to Henry Kissinger and Al Gore, it's all nothing but propaganda offensives to prop up their
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:36.240]  failing facade. And they understand they're losing. They failed. They tried to play this
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:41.120]  game that Carl Rove talked about where they're history's actors and they control reality.
[1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:45.080]  And that only works for so long because when you don't deliver freedom and prosperity to
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:48.440]  the people, but you're telling them that's what they're getting, they're going to begin
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:52.720]  to see through your lies. And at a certain point, they're not going to believe a word
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:58.000]  you say. You know, USA Today in Closing has an article, Trump Cabinet of Disruptors Ready
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.240]  to Go, nominees likely to lead agencies they battled. And they act like, oh, look how discredited
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:07.680]  Trump is. He's crazy. He's putting people in that'll have gridlock. He's putting people
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:14.480]  in that will actually fight with folks. This is terrible. Yes, he put in people. He's putting
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:18.320]  in people that actually opposed globalism. That's what I told you about these nominees.
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:22.880]  It doesn't matter what big companies they came from in those big companies, they battled
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:28.800]  globalism. And again, that's why the elite are panicking because look at how Trump's
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:33.400]  getting results out of the gates on Obamacare, you name it. And notice he said on Obamacare,
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:36.800]  I can leave this for the Democrats and have it destroy them, but it's going to hurt the
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:41.440]  American people. So we're going to reverse it and repeal it now. And of course get criticized
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:45.040]  because no systems perfect, but we're going to do the best job we can because it's what
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:54.000]  we swore to do results, not theater, reality, not fiction. There's a battle between fantasy
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.240]  land and the real world. And I want to be in the reality based community. Now back to
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:03.520]  David Knight and Mr. Schneider at the info wars, new center in Austin, Texas info wars
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:08.560]  dot com. Thank you, Alex. And as you point out, the these award ceremonies, they got
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:14.120]  Obama's Medal of Freedom. It's about as phony and silly as the Golden Globes Awards that
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:18.640]  we just saw put out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. I guess this is the metal
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:23.760]  freedom done by the Hollywood Foreign President Association that was given to Joe Biden because
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:29.240]  everything about their ideas are foreign to America's. I pointed out in the last segment
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:33.500]  Joe Biden coming after Clarence Thomas saying you're not qualified to be a Supreme Court
[1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:37.840]  Justice because you believe in the idea of natural law and natural rights. It's like,
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:41.800]  wow, that's what this country was founded upon. So yeah, we've got the Hollywood Foreign
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:46.120]  President handing out his awards now about a week after the Golden Globes joining us
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:51.000]  now is Michael Snyder of the economic collapse blog dot com. And of course he's a frequent
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.400]  contributor to info wars dot com. Michael, I want to talk to you first about this article
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:15:59.960]  that Alex and I have been talking about earlier in the in the show. Of course, we had Rosie
[1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:04.560]  and Donald come out today and say, hey, let's have martial law to stop Donald Trump. Of
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:09.440]  course, you know, she's she's kind of a failed Hollywood actress. She has a lot of friends
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:16.840]  in New York and Hollywood, but she's has been fired by by Oprah Winfrey as Donald Trump
[1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:22.000]  gleefully pointed out. But nevertheless, she's putting this out there. And it is precisely
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:27.280]  what we've seen George Soros doing as you point out in your article that we had at info
[1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:31.200]  wars dot com in January the 10th. You pointed out we got people like Cornell West. We've
[1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:34.920]  got Bill Ayers. We've got Carl Dix of the Communist Party. They're all working to do
[1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:40.160]  the same sorts of things that we've seen George Soros organizing right after the election
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:44.720]  and even organizing in the run up to the election. All the attacks that all the Donald Trump
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:50.720]  rallies, the black lives matter going to war with the police going to war with white people
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:56.320]  even going to war with other black people. And in Chicago, as we see as many people
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:00.600]  killed during the eight years of President Obama in Chicago, their gun free zone, as
[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:06.480]  were killed soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan during the George W. Bush administration
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:12.040]  about 4,000 inch of those cases. So talk to us about your concerns about what the anarchists
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:15.960]  are trying to do in terms of promoting martial law.
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:21.400]  Yeah, thank you, David. And people need to realize that this starts tomorrow. The radical
[1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:25.880]  left the election of Donald Trump was perhaps the single most galvanizing moment in the
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:29.560]  history of the radical left, certainly since the days of Ronald Reagan, where they didn't
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:34.080]  expect Donald Trump to win. They kind of treated him as a big joke. But now that they've won,
[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:38.520]  they're fired up. They're ready for battle. They're ready for war. While many, many patriots,
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:42.320]  many conservatives have kind of gone to sleep. Many Trump supporters said, Hey, he won. So
[1:17:42.320 --> 1:17:46.880]  now the battle's over. The truth is the battle's just beginning. In fact, an organization known
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:53.160]  as refuse fascism.org recently took out a full page ad in the New York Times talking
[1:17:53.160 --> 1:17:58.600]  about how we need must resist Donald Trump. And if you go to their official website, you'll
[1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:04.680]  see that there's a whole laundry list of activities. And you know, we've heard about January 20th,
[1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:11.080]  how they plan to disrupt the inauguration, but it actually starts tomorrow. January 14th,
[1:18:11.080 --> 1:18:17.960]  Saturday is when the activism in Washington DC begins. People are going to start descending
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:23.400]  on Washington DC. There's another organization as well known as disrupt J 20. They've got
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:28.560]  a hashtag that's going viral all over Twitter, all over Facebook. And that's another organization.
[1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:33.440]  There's multiple organizations all funded by the radical left, people like George Soros,
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:38.600]  all ultimately controlled and dominated by the globalist. But you know, the people who
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:43.680]  are activists, they don't even realize necessarily where the money's coming from. All they know
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:48.040]  is they're being told that Donald Trump is Hitler, that he's the devil, that he must be
[1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:52.800]  resisted. Basically to the left, Donald Trump is the personification of everything that's
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:58.120]  wrong with America. And so what they plan to do on inauguration day, they plan to disrupt
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:02.160]  the activities as much as possible. One of the big things they're planning are blockades.
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:08.160]  They're playing blockades of the major transportation routes into Washington DC, and then the major
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:14.400]  transportation routes in and across the inauguration route. So they want to keep people from getting
[1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:18.140]  there. They want to get on the news because if there's a whole row of bodies across a
[1:19:18.140 --> 1:19:23.640]  major interstate or across a major parade route in Washington DC, that's going to get
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:27.620]  attention. That's going to get on the news and that's what they want. So they say openly
[1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:33.240]  they want to force as much of the inauguration celebration as possible inside. They want
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:38.960]  to turn it into a riot, into chaos. They want to do whatever they can to disrupt things,
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:42.400]  to upset the proceedings, and to get attention for their cause.
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:46.240]  Yeah, of course we're going to continue with Michael Schneider on the other side of the
[1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:49.760]  break. And of course Michael, when they say they're going to create blockades, you know
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:54.240]  that's going to get violent with people just like they did at the Trump rallies. They aren't
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:57.360]  going to be content just to lay down in front. They're going to attack cars. They're going
[1:19:57.360 --> 1:20:00.400]  to attack people. Say what this would be right back.

[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:13.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're talking to Michael Snyder of
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:18.320]  the Economic Collapse Blog.com, a frequent contributor here to Infowars as well. We're
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:23.600]  talking about the run-up to the inauguration and of course in the run-up to the inauguration
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:28.360]  we have people like Bill Ayers, people like Carl Dix, the Communist Party USA as Michael
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:31.240]  Snyder just pointed out and as he pointed out in his article they're taking out ads
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:36.560]  in the New York Times saying that they're gonna create a call to arms essentially to
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:42.200]  refuse fascism. The thing that we see repeatedly used over and over again by the communists
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:46.360]  is this type of rhetoric about fascism and of course there's a lot of different types
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:51.200]  of fascism but that is the way the communists see everything. They don't really kind of
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:55.000]  talk about a left-right paradigm, the false dichotomy that were sold about left and right
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.080]  and that truly in and of itself is a false paradigm but to them you're either with them,
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:04.480]  with the communists or you are a fascist and so that's a very tell-tale thing there that
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:07.680]  we see and we're gonna get back to Michael Snyder. We want to talk about that. Alex wanted
[1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:13.060]  to talk about how do we focus the attention to people's attention on this, the whole
[1:25:13.060 --> 1:25:19.440]  process to subvert the Trump presidency and also to try to create martial law with George
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:23.440]  Soros, how do we focus public attention on that so we're gonna ask that to Michael Snyder
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:28.720]  as well and there's some other articles that he's put out recently about the provocations
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:34.280]  in Europe as well as what's going on economically here at home as we see layoffs with Walmart,
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:38.680]  as we see layoffs with Boeing, we see jobs that people say are coming back but certainly
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:43.520]  it's not the wonderful economy that Obama and others have been talking about. Before
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:48.600]  we do real quickly I just want to remind you as we're talking about this kind of unrest
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:52.760]  as we pointed out last week in the wake of the shooting and actually it wasn't that we
[1:25:52.760 --> 1:25:57.080]  introduced the products at that point in time. Media Matters, George Soros' organization
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:01.720]  criticized me for trying to profiteer they said off of the shooting in Fort Lauderdale.
[1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:05.280]  We weren't at all, we were trying to help people to protect themselves. We had these
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:09.760]  products in place before that happened just as we had water filters in place before the
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:15.520]  Flint, Michigan water situations. We tell people here are the threats. People can believe
[1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:18.720]  us or they can laugh at us, they can call us conspiracy theorists, they can push for
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:23.440]  more gun-free zones, they can push for more disarmament of people but we say look if they're
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:27.200]  not going to let you have your guns you can at least try to protect yourself, protect
[1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:31.280]  your family, especially when you're traveling. This happened in the luggage area. This guy
[1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:36.720]  travels reportedly with the only luggage he had was his gun that he traveled from Alaska
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:40.520]  to Fort Lauderdale to shoot the place up. That in of itself is very suspicious. There's
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:46.600]  a lot of suspicious things in that shooting but if you were there, if you had the cheapest
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:50.960]  form of this body armor that we saw is an insert. It's about $200 and with that insert
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:55.280]  you can put that in your backpack and you've at least got something that is going to stop
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:01.520]  a bullet. This is a patented form of carbon nanotube technology. It's the lightest, strongest,
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:05.320]  most flexible body armor on the market. This is a state-of-the-art stuff folks. It's only
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:09.760]  a quarter-inch thick. It's field tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.800]  It's waterproof, super lightweight, made in the USA, 20-year warranty. You will find it
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:20.760]  at the InfowarsStore.com, our exclusive line of tactical nanotechnology body armor. We
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:26.520]  go from that insert that you can put into a backpack all the way up to a full bulletproof
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:31.720]  vest that previously only law enforcement had. That's something you need to think about,
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:36.080]  especially when we look at the fact that these crazy communists want to try to start riots
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:40.800]  in every city. That's their preferred way to do political activism. They don't want
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:46.760]  to debate you. They want to either fight you, censor you, or shoot you in most of these
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:47.760]  cases.
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:51.960]  So let's go back to Michael Snyder and Michael. When we look at the way they're talking about
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:57.960]  fascism, that is a dead giveaway as to the origins and the political tactics of these
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:27:58.960]  people, isn't it?
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:05.080]  Oh, it absolutely is because it's all coming from the same place. George Soros has funded
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:09.040]  and organized revolutions all over the world, and would they do the same things over and
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:13.920]  over and over again? And now they've been planning for a couple of months now for this
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:19.280]  big event in Washington, DC. And as far as the radical left is concerned, the war starts
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:25.000]  tomorrow. And so from January 14th to January 20th, leading up to January 20th, they're
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.880]  going to have protests, they're going to have events, they're going to try to get as much
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:32.320]  attention on themselves as possible, leading up to January 20th. Now, of course, they can't
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:37.280]  stop Donald Trump from being inaugurated, but what they want to do is they want to completely
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.280]  change the narrative of the day. If you remember past inaugurations, for example, when Barack
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:46.920]  Obama was inaugurated, it was a big celebration, you know, the whole nation came together and
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:51.080]  Barack Obama got out of the vehicle and walked the parade route and it was peaceful and people
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:56.800]  were cheering. They wanted to turn it into the exact opposite chaos and riots and they
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:01.480]  want to make sure Donald Trump maybe even doesn't even make it through the parade route.
[1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:06.600]  Now he's going to be inaugurated, but what they want the news to show is chaos and chaos
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:12.560]  and rioting. They want the news to show people angry, people shouting, people blocking the
[1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:16.720]  streets. And then ultimately, because they want to change the whole narrative, they want
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:21.120]  to say, hey, people are upset. And what they want to do also, they want to provoke a response.
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:25.680]  All these things are about provoking a response. And so they want the National Guard and the
[1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:30.400]  authorities to crack down hard so they can say, hey, look, this is martial law. Look,
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:34.520]  they really are fascist. They're going to go from a love fest that they had with the
[1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:40.360]  media and Barack Obama. They're going to go, look, the country is torn apart by the presidency
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:45.240]  of Donald Trump. The media is waiting for this, waiting to pounce on this. This is all
[1:29:45.240 --> 1:29:51.280]  being performed as a kind of a kabuki dance. We'll be right back with Michael Snyder.
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:30:00.440]  The Empires on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:03.640]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act,
[1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:08.200]  with a 51 to 48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves
[1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:12.160]  of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster. Liberal
[1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:15.960]  tears float heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted
[1:30:15.960 --> 1:30:20.160]  no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner,
[1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:24.160]  to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating at nauseam, debate is not allowed
[1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:28.000]  during a vote. Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.320]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large
[1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:35.240]  blown up photos of children to win sympathy points and try to argue that Republicans are
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:39.680]  ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right? Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims
[1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:43.600]  that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by big wigs
[1:30:43.600 --> 1:30:47.360]  and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:51.680]  Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions. He also said that Republicans
[1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:55.520]  had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to
[1:30:55.520 --> 1:31:25.440]  the debate floor.
[1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:28.560]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:10.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:33:10.720 --> 1:33:21.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and joining us now is Michael Schneider.
[1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:27.400]  We've been talking about his article and of course what is going to be happening in and
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:31.120]  around the Inauguration. It's going to begin tomorrow. And of course, this is a program
[1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:35.880]  that's been put together by Communist agitators, people like Bill Ayers, who hung out with
[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:41.560]  the weathermen, people who've openly talked about revolution for a long time. Joining
[1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:45.920]  with George Soros as we've seen both before the Inauguration, before the election, and
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:49.880]  then immediately after the election, and now they're bringing this up to the Inauguration
[1:33:49.880 --> 1:33:53.840]  and talking about Rosie O'Donnell talking about martial law. This is a common recurring
[1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:57.720]  theme. And we're going to talk about, again, some of the things that may be happening a
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:34:01.680]  little bit more and then we're going to move on to what's going on in Poland. We now have
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:07.640]  Obama moving troops into Poland, stationing them there permanently for the first time.
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:11.200]  These things are not unrelated. So we're going to pull these things together for you and
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:16.840]  show you how, even though in the past, we used to have the people on the right would
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:21.680]  rightly or wrongly label people as communist sympathizers. Now you're labeled as a Russian
[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:26.840]  sympathizer, and this is being done by people who are communist sympathizers like Bill Ayers.
[1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:31.240]  People who genuinely did want to provoke a communist revolution, and now that's what
[1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:34.480]  they're still trying to do. So we're going to talk about that. One of the things he mentions
[1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:39.800]  in his article here is how Michael Moore has announced that he plans to attend the Women's
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:47.040]  March on Washington. Oh, is Michael Moore coming out? I don't know. Anyway, he's going
[1:34:47.040 --> 1:34:51.880]  to be there at the Women's March. He has made a call to arms. He says it's important for
[1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:57.640]  everybody to go there. He said on MSNBC, when we look at this, Michael, they're also talking
[1:34:57.640 --> 1:35:03.400]  about violence. One of the guys that you quoted here said, well, they're not open. You said
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:08.280]  they're not openly telling people to throw projectiles. They're not openly telling people
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:12.600]  to jump barriers. And of course, you've seen that happen at people jumping the barriers
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:17.800]  to get to Donald Trump, people throwing projectiles and getting physical with people who are
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:22.880]  just attending an event. But then they said this. He said, and here's a quote from one
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:28.280]  of the organizers, I can't comment on any specific stuff that we're doing like that,
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:33.040]  mostly because that would be illegal. So we've got stuff planned that is violent, illegal.
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:37.800]  Yeah, we do, but I can't give you any specifics on it. But yeah, it'll get pretty crazy. He
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:42.840]  said, I expect, have fun, I say. That's the quote from one of the guys who organized this.
[1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:49.880]  And I remember Michael, when I was in college, we had Gerald Ford come speak at our university.
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:55.960]  We had some guy thought it would be funny to show up with a squirt gun when he was speaking
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:36:01.160]  and the Secret Service wrestled him to the ground and we never saw him again. I mean,
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:05.200]  seriously, this guy, he was gone for a long time. He never came back to school. I don't
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:10.080]  know what he did with the rest of his life, but he was just gone. But it's gonna be interesting
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:14.200]  to see what happens with this. But as you pointed out, the real point is to get this
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:20.280]  photo op of chaos that the media can then use as a narrative to attack Trump, isn't
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:21.280]  it?
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:25.600]  Oh, it absolutely does because they want to provoke a reaction. They want the television
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:30.760]  cameras and they want the television cameras to see not only their protest and the anger,
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:36.480]  but they want to see the reaction, the cracking down on the protesters and they want it to
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:42.240]  be as harsh as possible. And so they actually, they know the legalities of it. They know
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:46.400]  how far they can go up to the line. So they don't actually say, hey, we're advocating
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:50.160]  violence, but you notice what they're saying. They're saying, hey, we can't legally say
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:55.400]  that, but hey, we're not exactly discouraging people from it either. So and that's just
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:01.680]  the start. And then the next day after January 20th, January 21st is this million woman March.
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:05.520]  That's the March Michael Moore was talking about where it was reported in the New York
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:11.240]  Times. They're hoping to get a million women to Washington DC to protest for abortion rights
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:14.880]  for essentially killing, killing their own children, but they're hoping to get a million
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:19.960]  women there. And Michael Moore says, Hey, that could be the start of 100 days of resistance.
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:23.840]  That's what Michael Moore is calling it. What they want to do is they want to make Donald
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:29.480]  Trump's first 100 days as hard as possible. And Barack Obama, what Barack Obama is doing
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:34.480]  right now is playing right into that. Because, but you know what, when, when a new president
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:38.960]  is elected, the sitting president, the lame duck president, what traditionally they've
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:43.080]  kind of stepped back, they've said, okay, I'm not going to introduce a bunch of new initiatives.
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:47.280]  I'm going to just try to make it an easy transition for the next guy, kind of stepping back and
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:51.360]  saying, okay, the new guys coming in, I'm not going to rock the boat. But instead, Barack
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:55.560]  Obama has done just the opposite. He's been malicious. He's been going crazy, passing
[1:37:55.560 --> 1:38:01.080]  all types of new rules and regulations, establishing national monuments, giving this medal to Joe
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:04.880]  Biden. And it just wasn't the presidential medal of freedom. It was the presidential
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:09.560]  medal of freedom with distinction, which has only been done three times in history once
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:16.120]  for Pope John Paul, once for Ronald Reagan. So I mean, it was just such a far so ridiculous.
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:20.800]  But basically, Barack Obama's trying to squeeze every ounce of presidential power as possible
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:26.280]  out of, out of his remaining time in the White House, including provoking Russia with his
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:31.000]  moving of troops into Poland. I mean, this is the first time it's ever happened. It didn't
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.920]  get a lot of attention here in the, in the, in the US media, but this is a really big
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:40.760]  deal. Not, you know, it's just a few thousand troops. But what this does is it's highly
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:45.920]  symbolic because it, it's really poking the bear, poking Russia because it is very much
[1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:50.600]  aggravating Russia. Cause you have to remember Poland was a member of the Warsaw Pact.
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:57.080]  And so to Russia and it's right in the right close to Russia. So Russia is very, very annoyed
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:02.040]  by this. And we're also in late January, NATO troops are going to be stationed from
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:07.280]  now on in Lithuania. So NATO troops are going into Lithuania, which is actually part of
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:13.320]  the Soviet Union back in the old days. So David, this is, this is a very, very big deal.
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:18.800]  Yeah, we've had, we've had an escalation as we've seen with the so-called Russian reset.
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:23.760]  We've had the reset of the Cold War and it's not, this is permanently putting there. Of
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:28.080]  course, they've had multiple exercises. As you know, Michael, they've had multiple NATO
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:32.760]  exercises that come right up to the Russian border. And so they're just practice and so
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:38.560]  forth and so on. And, and people said that to Vladimir Putin and he just started laughing
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:42.800]  like, yeah, right, you're not trying to send us a message at all. Are you, they would take
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:50.000]  it very seriously if the Russians were to put missiles in Cuba, for example, we know exactly
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.400]  what happened with that, or if they were to go to Venezuela, or if things were to get
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:59.480]  frostier with the U.S. and Mexico and somehow Russia or China or, let's say, North Korea
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:05.840]  were to forward place missiles right in Mexico. And that's the way the Russians see this.
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:11.520]  And rightfully so, it is deliberately provocative. They're trying to be provocative in the same
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:17.400]  way that we have Bill Ayers and these communist organizers are trying to be provocative at
[1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:23.120]  the inauguration. And they're trying to provoke an event just like all these people are. That's
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:26.360]  precisely what they're trying to do. It's a very dangerous thing. And one of the things
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:32.320]  that really disturbs me, Michael, is the fact that anyone who says we don't want to escalate
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:36.680]  tensions, we want to de-escalate tensions. It used to be a virtue when Richard Nixon
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:40.840]  said we're going to have a policy of detente. We're going to ease this strained relationship
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:44.360]  between the U.S. and Russia. Everybody said, that's great. We're kind of tired of a Cold
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:49.000]  War. We don't want to live on the edge of nuclear war. These people, for the purpose
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.760]  of the military-industrial complex now, want to restart this. And if you say that you don't
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:41:00.840]  want this, you don't want war, then these radicals on the left start accusing you and
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:03.960]  mainstream media like Washington Post and New York Times start accusing you of being
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:09.760]  a Russian agent. You're a Manchurian candidate. The papers that come out and told the truth
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:14.160]  about Hillary Clinton, they were probed. I mean, this is the tactic that they're taking.
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:18.440]  Anybody who doesn't want war with Russia is a Russian agent. This is insane.
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:24.000]  Yeah, it absolutely is. And look how far we've come. Because just four years ago, if you
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.500]  remember the 2012 election, and Mitt Romney, there was a famous moment in the debate when
[1:41:28.500 --> 1:41:34.160]  Mitt Romney was explaining how, hey, he believed Russia was a threat. And Barack Obama turned
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:39.600]  to him and said, hey, Mitt, the 1980s are calling. They want their foreign policy back.
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:44.440]  So four years ago, Barack Obama was mocking all this. But now Barack Obama says Russia
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:48.720]  is enemy number one. It's not just the Democrats, but it's the Republicans, too. People like
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:54.400]  Senator John McCain, people like Lindsey Graham. And so it's a bipartisan thing, both sides
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:59.360]  of the establishment party, if you will, both Democrats and Republicans. And so I believe
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:03.160]  this is a trap for Donald Trump, because both parties are going to be putting pressure on
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:08.000]  him to become more anti-Russia. And Donald Trump is going to be surrounded by all these
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.880]  guys in the Pentagon, even Mad Dog Mattis. He was just in front of Congress yesterday
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:17.040]  talking about how Russia was the primary threat to U.S. security. So these people are going
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:21.200]  to be in his ear, people on the left, people on the right, Republicans and Democrats are
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:27.160]  all going to be urging Trump to become more anti-Russia. And so Donald Trump has got to
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:31.720]  be strong. And we've got to urge him not to listen to these people, not to listen to both
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:37.760]  political parties, because they're going to want him to turn on Russia, become so anti-Russia.
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:43.520]  And so, you know, but we should be so thankful that Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated.
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:48.920]  January 20th can't come fast enough, because right now we are on a path to war with Russia.
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:54.080]  When Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, that's the kind of thing you do before a war
[1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:57.880]  starts. You know, and so all these things, I mean, it's been going on for years with
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:05.280]  Ukraine, where George Soros and other organized people of his ilk went in and funded and
[1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:10.000]  organized and helped overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine, then a new
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:16.640]  pro-American government was immediately installed. That severely, severely upset the Russians.
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:20.680]  That very, very much angered them. And that was kind of the one of the big first steps.
[1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:24.560]  And then, of course, with Syria, where we went in, we made a big mess to the Middle
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:29.280]  East and Russia came in and fought ISIS and helped the Syrian government. Tensions between
[1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:34.200]  us and them have arisen there. So those were big steps down the path. And so many things
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:39.280]  now, a cyber espionage, a price of oil, everything else. The tensions between the United States
[1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:43.160]  and Russia are the worst they've been since the heart of the Cold War, maybe since the
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:47.840]  Cuban Missile Crisis. We're on a path to war with Russia. Hopefully, Donald Trump will
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:51.240]  stop us and set us on a better course.
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:55.800]  And as I said earlier, we haven't seen Russians rounding people up, cutting their heads off,
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:01.640]  putting them in cages and drowning them, doing all these bizarre and disturbing forms of
[1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:07.480]  torture, having little children, murder bound men and put the videos up. The Russians aren't
[1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:13.960]  doing that. That's Islamic jihadis, Islamic terrorists. Those phrases that Obama can't
[1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:19.320]  even bring himself to state. And yet, it is Obama. It is the people, as you point out,
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:23.720]  John McCain, Lindsey Graham. They go and they work with al-Qaeda. They work with ISIS. They
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:27.640]  work with al-Nusra, all these different names that they come up with. They're just aliases
[1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:32.760]  for the same group of jihadi terrorists, the same philosophy that's there. And it came
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:38.600]  out that John Kerry was willing to do anything in Syria in order to have regime change. He
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:42.600]  didn't care that the place was set on fire. He didn't care how many children were killed
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:46.720]  like the Lopo boy that we saw, the pitiful pictures of those children there. He didn't
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:51.560]  care about that. He didn't care about the fact that he was empowering ISIS in that area.
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:56.920]  They were willing to do that for their own objectives. And yet, we're told that the Russians,
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:45:00.600]  the only people who are fighting them, by the way, it's not the Americans. We're helping
[1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:05.880]  them. We dropped 25,000 bombs and not a single bomb landed on an ISIS-controlled oilfield.
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:09.520]  What a coincidence. And so, yeah, you're exactly right. We need to really understand.
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:13.320]  I think people do understand where the true threat is. When we look at this, and you pointed
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:17.880]  out Mattis in the confirmation hearings, and we've heard some disturbing things from Mattis.
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:21.960]  We've heard some disturbing things from Tillerson that are contradictory of what we've heard
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:26.280]  from Donald Trump. As RT was pointing out, they're concerned that maybe the deep state
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:29.960]  is winning. Maybe these guys are throwing up the flag. They said Trump finally conceded
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:34.480]  that Russia hacked the election. I know that they're doing some things in these confirmation
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:37.720]  hearings, and when Donald Trump says that, he's just trying to say, okay, fine, let's
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:39.120]  just move on with this.
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:42.160]  Personally, I don't think that's the way to handle this, but these guys are a lot more
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:46.600]  successful than I am. I'm willing to give them a chance to at least get in there. So,
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:52.280]  when we look at Tillerson, they questioned him on things like climate change and other
[1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:56.560]  issues like that, and he really did hedge his bet. He wouldn't give them a straight answer
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:00.360]  as to whether or not he believed that it was man-made. He said the risk of climate change
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:06.120]  does exist, and the consequences of it could be serious enough that action should be taken,
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:08.360]  but the ability to predict it is very limited.
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:11.680]  And so then finally, Tim Kaine comes after him and says, well, do you lack the knowledge
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:16.560]  to answer my question, or are you refusing to answer my question? And Tillerson said,
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:21.760]  a little of both. That's probably the funniest thing that's come out of the hearings. That
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:28.120]  was probably the most truthful candid thing right there. Yeah, I kind of can't answer
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:32.800]  your question. I refuse to answer your question, and hopefully that's what's going on here.
[1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:36.080]  Hopefully these people are not going to be changing the direction that Trump is going.
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:39.040]  Hopefully they're not going to be running in the opposite direction. We saw that happen
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:43.560]  a great deal during the Reagan administration. Hopefully he can keep them going or replace
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:45.160]  them if they're going in the other direction.
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:48.800]  But right now, I think when we look at some of the rhetoric that's coming out of these
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:53.960]  confirmation hearings, I think they're just trying to just get through this without any
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:58.080]  controversy and say, yeah, I agree with you on all these issues. What do you think, Michael?
[1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:03.920]  I think there's some of that going on, David, but also we need to keep into account DC changes
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:08.240]  people. I used to work there and so, you know, I kind of saw it up close, but we've seen
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:13.520]  for decades, you know, good people, good politicians that we thought would do good things, go into
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:17.120]  DC, and they get changed. And all of a sudden they start talking differently. They have
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:22.200]  different viewpoints. Now, there's some exceptions. For example, Ron Paul, he was never changed
[1:47:22.200 --> 1:47:27.920]  by DC, but to a very large extent, a lot of these politicians, they promise us all these
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:32.680]  things. They talk really well, but then they get to DC and things change.
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:36.240]  And of course, that observation is hundreds of years old, you know, power corrupts, absolute
[1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:39.960]  power corrupts. Absolutely. Well, you don't have any place where there is more absolute
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:43.680]  power than in Washington. That's why we have so much corruption there, isn't it?
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:50.160]  Oh, absolutely. And so, and, and it's even worse when both sides of the Republicans
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:55.360]  and the Democrats are all on the same side with as far as this Russia thing is concerned,
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:48:02.400]  you know, because we desperately need a different path because right now we see the anti Russia
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:06.960]  wreck rhetoric here in this country over in Russia. They view the United States is the
[1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:11.800]  great force for evil in the world, you know, back in World War two, you know, the Russians,
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:15.520]  you know, they said, Hey, Nazi Germany is a great force for evil in the world. And Russia
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:19.520]  believes that they played the biggest role in saving the world from that threat. Now,
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:23.720]  and then they fast forward that to today. And they say now, once again, Russia is the great
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:28.360]  force for defending against globalism against all these things. And they believe the United
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:32.400]  States is a great force for evil in the world. And of course, the United States has been
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:36.720]  leading the march of globalism. We have been funding groups like ISIS and al Qaeda in the
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:40.680]  Middle East trying to overthrow the Syrian government. And so, and when Russia goes on
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:46.560]  on on television shows that, Hey, ISIS oil trucks have been rolling into Turkey and oils
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:51.040]  been being sold through Turkey and Obama knew about it the whole time. You know, they're
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:55.640]  right. Russia is right when they show that. And we have done some horrible things. But
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:00.120]  the Russian population sees this and they say, Oh, how horrible United States is. And
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:05.480]  in fact, Gala, middle of last year, they went over and they took a survey over in Russia.
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:09.160]  They asked the Russian people about their approval of current US leadership, i.e. the
[1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:15.920]  Obama administration. The results came back with a 1% approval rating, 1% for current
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:21.000]  US leadership. So that's how the Russians view the United States today, where they view
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:26.520]  us as the big force for evil in the world. They view us extremely negatively. And they
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:31.640]  believe they openly talk on their mainstream news broadcast over there about war could
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:35.440]  be coming with the United States. Yes, that's why they were so excited with the election
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.640]  of Donald Trump. They believe that they had dodged a bullet. We reported on the story
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:44.640]  about the small town in Russia that wanted to change the name of the street that the
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:49.160]  communists had called Godless Street. They wanted to change it. They had started a petition
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:53.040]  to change it to Donald Trump Street. I mean, they realize they have, they have in their
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:59.440]  own collective memory, the understanding of the horrors of war from World War Two in
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:03.440]  a way that we don't in America. We were attacked at Pearl Harbor, but we never had anybody
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:07.920]  invade and bomb the homeland. We didn't have to fight them street by street in the cities.
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:11.240]  They did. And they don't want to see that happen again. They're more concerned about
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:15.160]  this than Americans. Americans are pretty lackadaisical about this, pretty nonchalant
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:19.560]  about nuclear war and all these other things. Very naive. And so they believe that they
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:24.480]  dodged a bullet. And I really do hope that we all have. I hope that Trump doesn't get
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:31.600]  sidetracked by this. I hope that people like Tillerson and others are just pandering to
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:37.720]  the senators who want war so they can get in, but don't really believe that Russia annexed
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:43.480]  the Crimea. I mean, we talk about that really. I mean, they, yeah, they annexed the Crimea,
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:48.960]  but it was done by Catherine the Great in 1783, six years before we had the Constitution.
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:54.080]  And she took it from the Ottoman Empire. It wasn't that Putin took it from the Ukraine
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:58.320]  and they voted to stay with Russia just like Northern Ireland voted to stay with Great
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:01.840]  Britain. When we come back, we're going to talk to Michael Snyder about what we can do.
[1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:05.560]  It makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water. If your
[1:51:05.560 --> 1:51:10.080]  current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:14.800]  a much better way. The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.720]  requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minuteman stove is easy to use,
[1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:23.760]  smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable. For the finest in survival cooking stoves

[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:12.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we have Michael Snyder with
[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:18.880]  EconomicCollapseBlog.com. Joining us before we get back to, and I want to ask Michael
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:25.040]  the question that Alex Jones wanted us to talk about and that is what can be done to
[1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:31.360]  focus attention on these tactics of disruption, of trying to create martial law that we see,
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:35.960]  of trying to burn down the Trump administration. What is it that we can do that the public
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:41.480]  can do? What can you as a member of the public, because it's not just us talking about these
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:46.440]  issues, but it's also important for you to push this out yourself. I think one of the
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:50.280]  key things that's going to be at the inauguration, people keep your phones going. You're going
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:54.400]  to have your phones, you're going to be videotaping this stuff anyway, but of course, if you see
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:58.800]  these people instigating stuff, you can be the eyes on the ground that we can use to
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:04.960]  push back against the mainstream media's narrative. They want this to show the police
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:09.360]  as being the aggressors. If the police are the aggressors, fine, let's show that, but
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:13.000]  that's not going to be the case. I don't think in this particular instance, they're talking
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:16.800]  openly about how they're going to be the aggressors at these events, how they're going to be
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:21.520]  coming after Trump supporters. So make sure you got your cameras rolling to show what this
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:25.000]  is going to be and get that up on social media. I think it's going to be one of the key things.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:31.160]  Real quickly, before we go back to Michael, we have put up a special for a 2017 Make Our
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:35.240]  Bodies Great Again initiative. It's very important this time of year to set up healthy
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:40.160]  habits. One of the things that you can do is make sure that you have the right kind
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:44.960]  of nutrients, essential minerals to fight the toxic garbage that you're going to find
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:49.880]  in your food, your water, and your air. Also, to give your body the nutritional support
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:57.560]  that it needs. We've put a lot of things on sale from 10% to 20% to 30%. We've got a new
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:56:01.800]  shipment now of DNA force. It's just arrived at infowarslife.com. That's been out for some
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:08.400]  time. And of course, DNA force is a powerful lineup of patented ingredients like BiopQQ
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:13.880]  and systemic enzymes. We have 175 clinical studies that show how effective BiopQQ is.
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:18.280]  You can look those up yourself. Just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:23.880]  It's very difficult to produce, very expensive to produce. So 10% is a big discount. And
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:28.160]  also move on this while it is still there. We've just gotten a temporary emergency shipment
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:32.200]  of this. So when that goes out, it could be months before we are able to put that back
[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:37.160]  in again. Also, if you want to make sure that you support that healthy habits that you get
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:41.600]  in, make sure that you always have the supplements that you want, you can sign up for auto-ship.

[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:09.200]  find all of those at infowarslife.com. So Michael, we're going to put this story back
[1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:13.840]  up to the top that you wrote. Anarchists are hoping to turn Donald Trump's inauguration
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:17.080]  into one of the biggest rights in U.S. history. We'll put that there. We'll cut this interview
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:22.400]  and put that in there as well as an update. But apart from that, apart from passing information
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:24.320]  around, what would you suggest that people do?
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:29.680]  Well, that's one of the biggest things, David. People need to realize we're still in an information
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:34.360]  war. And just look at this recent thing with the ridiculous allegations that were made
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:39.640]  against Donald Trump. These were put forth seriously by BuzzFeed, by CNN, and they wanted
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:44.240]  people to believe this stuff. But then the alternative media started making all kinds
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:49.560]  of noise about, hey, this is fake. This was made up. This is a joke. And so the mainstream
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:54.540]  media was then forced to admit that, oh, yeah, this is fake. This wasn't true or whatever.
[1:57:54.540 --> 1:57:59.920]  But that battle was won through the information war. And what's coming up on January 20th,
[1:57:59.920 --> 1:58:04.040]  it's going to be won through information, through winning the battle, through making
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:08.280]  noise or this situation with Russia. We've got to make a whole bunch of noise that we
[1:58:08.280 --> 1:58:13.520]  don't want war with Russia. We've got to win in the court of public opinion. And so everybody
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:18.440]  can make noise. Everybody can let their voice be heard. And that's one of the great things
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:22.440]  about the internet, because with the internet comes the democratization of information.
[1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:27.080]  Absolutely. Everyone can become foot soldiers in the information war. Absolutely. We're
[1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:29.920]  out of time for this segment. We're going to be right back right after the break, short
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:33.320]  break. We're going to be back with Michael Snyder. We're going to talk about some economic
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:37.440]  issues. His other article, why are Walmart and Boeing layoff workers if the US economy
[1:58:37.440 --> 1:59:06.440]  is in the great shape that Obama says it is. We'll be right back.
[1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:35.440]  We're going to be back with Michael Snyder. We're going to be back with Michael Snyder.
[1:59:35.440 --> 1:59:56.440]  We're going to be back with Michael Snyder. We're going to be back with Michael Snyder.

[2:40:42.440 --> 2:41:10.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:39.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:41:40.440 --> 2:42:09.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.

[2:42:40.440 --> 2:43:09.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:39.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:43:40.440 --> 2:44:09.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:39.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:45:09.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:39.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:46:09.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:39.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:46:40.440 --> 2:47:07.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:36.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:48:06.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:36.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:49:06.440]  We're back with Michael Snyder.
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:25.440]  I told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history.
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:42.440]  If I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9-11.
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:50:03.440]  If I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens.
[2:50:03.440 --> 2:50:20.440]  But that's what we did. After my election there was talk of a post-racial America, and such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic.
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:27.440]  Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:37.440]  Now I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:46.440]  You can see it, not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the world.
[2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:57.440]  It's amazing. If only we had enough time to play the full 75 minutes for you, but there is about a five minute report. You can see that on Alex Jones' channel, The Hypocrisy of Obama's Last Speech by John Bowne.
[2:50:57.440 --> 2:51:25.440]  Don't let the door hit you on the way out, oh, good riddance.

[2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:38.440]  I neglected to mention how one world way protein powder has affected my life. Now I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway. One world way solved my irregularity. I've been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[2:53:38.440 --> 2:53:49.440]  Three weeks on one world way set me on a new path. That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since. Will it work the same way for you? I don't know. It worked for me.

[2:53:58.440 --> 2:54:25.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're just looking at Obama's last speech that he made in Shy Rock. That's what a lot of people call it. The kind of a combination of Chicago and Iraq.
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:41.440]  An acknowledgement of the fact that they have so many murders in the gun-free killing zones that have been created by the Democrats' policies there that they've had as many about 4,000 people die there over the eight years of Barack Obama.
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:56.440]  About the same number they've had that died during the Iraq and Afghanistan war under George W. Bush. If I lived in that area, I would want to have some kind of protection for myself and I'm sure that the liberals will next be trying to take away.
[2:54:56.440 --> 2:55:11.440]  As Lionel pointed out, I talked about our body armor yesterday and Lionel said, you know, get it while you can because if you can protect yourself with it, they'll probably try to ban it. And we've had bills introduced in certain areas already by Democrats trying to outlaw body armor.
[2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:24.440]  That's coming. Don't worry. It's coming. They don't want you to be able to protect yourself at all. Not with a gun and not even with something that can't harm anybody. That is simply passive, simply defensive and that is body armor.
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:39.440]  Again, we've put together a line of a patented form of carbon nanotube technology. The lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market, even though it's only a quarter of an inch thick, it is field tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:52.440]  It's waterproof. It's super lightweight. It's made in the U.S. It comes with a 20 year warranty. You can find that at InfowarsStore.com. In the past, this has only been available to the U.S. military and law enforcement.
[2:55:52.440 --> 2:56:07.440]  It is state of the art and body armor. This isn't real heavy metal plates that are going to weigh you down and you can get it, as I pointed out, in just an insert that can go into your backpack to protect yourself at airports or when you're traveling or to protect your kids when they're going to school.
[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:19.440]  While the kids take backpacks, you can put that in there when they're traveling to school in case somebody decides to attack them and they don't allow any adults to carry weapons to protect the kids there at the school.
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:31.440]  That's a very important thing to do for you and for your family. And of course, that insert is the cheapest part of the body armor. You can get that for just $200 and you can find that again at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:49.440]  One of the interesting stories that came up today I thought was Julian Assange, of course the founder of WikiLeaks, he has agreed and gone publicly saying to Barack Obama, if you will release whistleblower Chelsea Manning, I will turn myself over to you.
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:57:01.440]  He says if Obama grants Manning clemency, Assange will agree to U.S. extradition despite the clear unconstitutionality of the Department of Justice case. That's what WikiLeaks tweeted out.
[2:57:01.440 --> 2:57:16.440]  And that's just a reminder of another one of the legacies of Barack Obama, the fact that he has prosecuted whistleblowers and journalists under the 100 year old Espionage Act of 1917.
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:21.440]  He has done that more than all the other presidents over the last 100 years combined.
[2:57:21.440 --> 2:57:31.440]  And remember, we talked to Thomas Drake, one of the NSA whistleblowers, and these are people who right after the Patriot Act was done immediately following the 9-11 attack.
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:47.440]  They came out and said, with William Benny and Thomas Drake and others, they came out and said, we don't like what the government is doing. You're doing dragnet surveillance of the American people, what Joe Biggs was just talking about in that report that we played at the bottom of the hour.
[2:57:47.440 --> 2:57:58.440]  You're doing dragnet surveillance of the American people. William Benny and Thomas Drake and others said, we take our oath to the Constitution very seriously and you can do this without doing dragnet surveillance.
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:09.440]  As a matter of fact, they'd created software to do precisely that, but the government went with the people who had provided this as a private contractor and they made a lot of money by doing that.
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:17.440]  I don't know if there were any kickbacks involved, probably were, and yet Thomas Drake was never prosecuted by the Bush administration.
[2:58:17.440 --> 2:58:35.440]  It was years later, almost 10 years later, when Barack Obama came after him and arrested him on Trump up charges. It was actually a persecution. One of the most shameful things in our history, the way the Obama administration tried to jail that constitutional Patriot, Thomas Drake.
[2:58:35.440 --> 2:58:49.440]  That's his true legacy. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[2:59:06.440 --> 2:59:12.440]  With a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:26.440]  In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality and so many others, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[2:59:26.440 --> 2:59:39.440]  The formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[2:59:39.440 --> 2:59:51.440]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure and resecured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war. That's infowarslives.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[2:59:51.440 --> 3:00:01.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:31.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. In the next segment, fourth hour, we're going to have Leanne McAdoo and Owen Schroyer are going to be joining us to host the fourth hour.
[3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:47.440]  In this last segment, I want to talk a little bit about the CDC and also about the issues that we see with RFK Jr. crossing the lines to work with Donald Trump on a very important issue, and that is the abuses of the CDC specifically towards vaccines.
[3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:58.440]  He was very critical of the CDC in terms of vaccines and what they're mandating to people. And also, at the same time, we see Allison Young, who works for USA Today.
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:14.440]  She's done a series of reports on the problems with biological operations, biological warfare, what they're developing with that, and the lax safety at the labs where they're doing this, especially at the CDC's own labs.
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:21.440]  And as she has repeatedly pointed out, she's got another article here, the CDC keeps secret its mishaps with deadly germs.
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:34.440]  She said the CDC facilities are among a small group of biolab operators that have the worst regulatory histories in the country, receiving repeated sanctions under federal regulations.
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:41.440]  Think about that. The CDC itself is among the worst of the safety of the biolab operators.
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:46.440]  She said they've faced congressional hearings, they've had secret government sanctions, secret government sanctions.
[3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:51.440]  See, they don't want the public to know how dangerous they are and what they're doing.
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:02:01.440]  So if they're going to hide these problems that they have at their biolabs from you, do you think they would hide the problems that they have with vaccines when they have a profit motive in that?
[3:02:01.440 --> 3:02:06.440]  See, that's the issue here. What are they hiding from us on all these issues? They have sloppy safety practices.
[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:14.440]  They keep secret large swaths of information about dozens of recent incidents involving some of the world's most dangerous bacteria and viruses.
[3:02:14.440 --> 3:02:20.440]  She said CDC scientists apparently lost a box of deadly and highly regulated influenza specimens.
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:30.440]  There's the latest one. Experienced multiple potential exposures involving viruses and bacteria, according to heavily redacted laboratory incident reports obtained by USA Today.
[3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:35.440]  See, even when you get an under 40 request, they redact most of the information that's in there.
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:37.440]  Several reports involve failures of safety equipment.
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:53.440]  In one, a scientist wearing full body space suit-like gear to protect against lethal, often untreatable viruses like Ebola had their purified air connector suddenly disconnect again in one of the world's most advanced biosafety level 4 labs.
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:57.440]  That's the most dangerous substances that they're controlling there.
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:09.440]  And so she said the CDC would not answer USA Today's questions about specific incidents which occurred at the agency's lab facilities in Atlanta and Fort Collins, Colorado from 2013 through 2015.
[3:03:09.440 --> 3:03:16.440]  Do you think maybe we need to audit the CDC? Not just the Fed, but the CDC? Yeah, of course they should be audited.
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:22.440]  We ought to audit all these pseudo-government organizations. They pretend to be government and they're private.
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:27.440]  Let's audit these people. Let's find out what's going on. Let's find out what's going on with the vaccine stuff.
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:34.440]  They're hiding this. They're messing around with Ebola at these level 4 safety labs and then redacting the information, keeping it secret.
[3:03:34.440 --> 3:03:38.440]  Even though they're getting sanctioned and penalized by the Congress, they don't want you to know about it.
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:42.440]  Meanwhile, I got this report handed to me from Kit Daniels.
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:49.440]  The Washington Post has got a report from the CDC and guess what they say the real threat to your health is?
[3:03:49.440 --> 3:03:53.440]  Living in the country. You should live in the city.
[3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:58.440]  You see, they say rural Americans are more likely to die from the top five causes of death.
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:04.440]  Here's a Washington Post dutifully reporting the propaganda from the globalist elite.
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:13.440]  The globalist elite who wants you to be living in the cities, part of the Agenda 21, also selling you the climate change stuff, also selling you diesel gates.
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:22.440]  You see, these are all interconnected and they want to tell you that you're at more risk living in the country than you are living in the city.
[3:04:22.440 --> 3:04:26.440]  You know that's not true. That's never been true.
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:31.440]  There's Thomas Jefferson that said cities are a threat to the health, the wealth and the liberty of mankind and nothing has changed.
[3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:33.440]  You know that from your own personal observations.
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:41.440]  And yet you have all these people who are all together on this Agenda 21 that they're pushing on everybody.
[3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:46.440]  People like the CEO of Lyft who was an urban planner. All the urban planners are telling you the cities are utopia.
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:52.440]  It's the suburbs and the rural areas that are bad and it's the cars that get you there that have to be shut down.
[3:04:52.440 --> 3:05:21.440]  You need to be staying in the cities. We need to take your transportation away and keep you confined in those cities for your own safety.
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:25.440]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[3:05:25.440 --> 3:05:32.440]  I fully support imposing martial law delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared of all charges.
[3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:39.440]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed. The only problem with that is there are no charges to be cleared.
[3:05:39.440 --> 3:05:41.440]  Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[3:05:41.440 --> 3:05:45.440]  Remember her side of the fence before the election? When they go low, we go high.
[3:05:45.440 --> 3:05:48.440]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results, so much for that.
[3:05:48.440 --> 3:05:54.440]  Two things were confirmed today. Trump on Twitter is awesome and Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron.

[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:42.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:52.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Owen Shroyer, Leanne McAdoo with you, and we have stacks of news. We were just trying to shuffle through all of it before we got on air here.
[3:08:52.440 --> 3:08:59.440]  And the big thing that I want to start with here, Leanne, is everything that's going on on Capitol Hill right now.
[3:08:59.440 --> 3:09:03.440]  It was a wild week on Capitol Hill. I mean, truly amazing.
[3:09:03.440 --> 3:09:14.440]  I know if there's ever been a more entertaining week on Capitol Hill, certainly in my lifetime, for someone that tunes into C-SPAN regularly, C-SPAN is normally kind of boring.
[3:09:14.440 --> 3:09:17.440]  Not this week. Plenty of entertainment to go around.
[3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:25.440]  Now, the big story, Leanne, yesterday, the House votes on the blueprint of the budget that will allow government to gut Obamacare.
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:29.440]  Today, they started debating and they had a vote in the Senate.
[3:09:29.440 --> 3:09:33.440]  It was very fiery as you can imagine. The Democrats are all crying.
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:37.440]  And, you know, here's the one thing. I got some points I want to talk about. I want to hear from you on this, too.
[3:09:37.440 --> 3:09:45.440]  You know, they all, we need a plan. We need a plan. It's like, okay, yeah, we need a plan. We're not going to come into this, obviously, with nothing.
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:51.440]  But they had this weird attitude where it's like they really think that healthcare is not going to exist. They need some new plan.
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:57.440]  And I'm sitting here scratching my head. I'm like, why don't we just go back to what it was before the Affordable Care Act?
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:02.440]  Am I? Is that like too simple that people can't even wrap their head around it?
[3:10:02.440 --> 3:10:08.440]  Right. And Donald Trump and others have made it known that they like some of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:13.440]  Obviously, that you can't, they can't deny you coverage if you have preexisting conditions.
[3:10:13.440 --> 3:10:17.440]  They're going to keep that regardless of what new plan they come up with.
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:23.440]  That is something everyone can agree on. But they're just going to open up to a little bit of competition so that we can actually get these prices down.
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:28.440]  And Donald Trump's plan that he put out there was opening it up so they can go across state lines.
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:30.440]  Provide a little state competition.
[3:10:30.440 --> 3:10:31.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:10:31.440 --> 3:10:32.440]  Which is kind of nice, too.
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:33.440]  A little healthy competition.
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:37.440]  Exactly, exactly. And kind of just to recap how the whole thing has gone down.
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:48.440]  Yesterday, when they were finished debating and they were having the vote in the House, or I'm sorry, in the Senate, I couldn't believe this.
[3:10:48.440 --> 3:10:53.440]  And I don't think I've ever seen anything like this and people, pundits, were writing about it.
[3:10:53.440 --> 3:11:02.440]  But the Democrats who were voting no on the proposed budget that would eventually gut the Affordable Care Act were up there trying to debate,
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:06.440]  or they were lecturing everybody that was in the hall at the time.
[3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:17.440]  And every time the presiding officer over the hearing had to slam his gavel and, you know, tell the person, hey, we're not debating here.
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:19.440]  Vote! You are wasting everyone's time.
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:21.440]  And I saw it again today.
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:25.440]  This was going on as the House was deliberating on this before the vote.
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:28.440]  Before the vote, it was just like Donald Trump with the media.
[3:11:28.440 --> 3:11:36.440]  These petulant children, as you have been phrasing it for a while, now are having to be scolded like petulant children.
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:37.440]  It's happening on the Hill.
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:39.440]  It's happening in the media.
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:40.440]  It's really amazing to see.
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:51.440]  It's about to be happening at the inauguration with celebrities and scientists and activists and all sorts of people that just cannot stand the fact that Donald Trump's going to be the president.
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:56.440]  We're actually going to talk about that because we've got some news on that.
[3:11:56.440 --> 3:11:58.440]  Obviously, we're going to be at the inauguration.
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:00.440]  This is the place where you want to get the coverage, folks.
[3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:01.440]  We're going to be on the streets.
[3:12:01.440 --> 3:12:03.440]  I'll just leave it at that.
[3:12:03.440 --> 3:12:06.440]  But, you know, here was some irony that I found in this.
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:16.440]  So the Democrats, a lot of them oppose Mattis being allowed to serve his position because of the military rulings there.
[3:12:16.440 --> 3:12:17.440]  It has to be a citizen.
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:20.440]  Technically, he's with the military, but they're voting on a waiver to get that.
[3:12:20.440 --> 3:12:21.440]  It looks like that's going to pass.
[3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:24.440]  But there was a lot of opposition from the Democrats.
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:26.440]  And here's the funny thing.
[3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:36.440]  They're sitting here complaining about how they want to see a plan as what the Republicans are going to do with the Affordable Care Act to replace it.
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:41.440]  Which, again, actually, Republicans time and time again, they bring this up and the Republicans on the floor say, here's the plan.
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:46.440]  They literally shake the binder with the plan and they still say, we need a plan.
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:47.440]  We need a plan.
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:53.440]  But the Democrats need to put out that fake news that they have no plan and they just want to take it away and stop your grandma from having health care.
[3:12:53.440 --> 3:12:57.440]  But get this though. Look at this complete hypocrisy and irony.
[3:12:57.440 --> 3:13:00.440]  They offer no replacement for Mattis.
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:05.440]  So they're up here complaining about how Mattis cannot serve, but they offer no replacement.
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:07.440]  Oh, but we need a plan.
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:09.440]  I need a plan.
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:11.440]  Show me the plan to replace Obamacare.
[3:13:11.440 --> 3:13:12.440]  Show me the plan.
[3:13:12.440 --> 3:13:14.440]  Oh, actually, here's a plan.
[3:13:14.440 --> 3:13:16.440]  The woman's name was Diane Black.
[3:13:16.440 --> 3:13:18.440]  She's from Tennessee.
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:25.440]  And every time one of these Democrats would come up from the Senate today and say, I need to see a plan.
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:29.440]  I cannot just have all these people with health care just go in with no coverage.
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:31.440]  I need to see a plan before we can move forward.
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:35.440]  I can't believe Republicans would even suggest such a thing without a plan.
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:40.440]  And then Diane Black for like the fifth time in 30 minutes goes, here's the plan right here.
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:42.440]  We have binders, a lot of plans.
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:45.440]  People of Donald Trump has offered plans to have state competition.
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:48.440]  Next, that comes up. I need to see a plan here.
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:50.440]  I cannot believe the Republicans.
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:13:52.440]  It's like, what is going on?
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:54.440]  And it does not, they're total disregard for the truth.
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:13:58.440]  They've been given the talking points that the GOP has no plan.
[3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:06.440]  They have no plan because that's, that allows, you know, the people here, the American people to get a little chitter chatter on Facebook and, you know, fight with everyone.
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:07.440]  Well, they have no plan.
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:09.440]  I mean, it just, it's.
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:14.440]  Which they buy completely, obviously, just like, just like, well, we don't need to go down the dossier.
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:15.440]  Just like they bought that.
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:16.440]  Exactly.
[3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:19.440]  Well, anything they can to just stymie Donald Trump becoming the president.
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:27.440]  And so they've, the Democrats have obviously gotten fairly hostile in their posture to just totally resist Donald Trump.
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:36.440]  But the Daily Caller points out how if anyone should have been able to be stopped as far as Donald Trump's appointments, it should have been Jeff Sessions.
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:39.440]  But he almost certainly is going to become the attorney general.
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:45.440]  I mean, they levied all sorts of racist charges against him, at least allegations of racism.
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:49.440]  So he actually had a failed confirmation once before.
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:57.440]  So, you know, the fact that they weren't able to even stop Jeff Sessions, that kind of shows how impotent the Democrats are to stop Donald Trump.
[3:14:57.440 --> 3:14:59.440]  Well, and they just don't have the numbers.
[3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:04.440]  They just flat out the math just does not work out for them right now when it comes to these votes.
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:10.440]  Certainly the tears outweigh on their side, but unfortunately, that's not what measures the vote.
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:14.440]  Now that we were talking about the dossier, this was truly unbelievable, folks.
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:17.440]  I don't know if you saw the story in Salon, Leanne.
[3:15:17.440 --> 3:15:21.440]  This is, Salon gets even worse and worse every day.
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:22.440]  And it's amazing.
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:25.440]  It's actually quite an accomplishment to be able to say that for Salon.
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:28.440]  What do we know about Donald Trump's outrageous dossier?
[3:15:28.440 --> 3:15:29.440]  Almost nothing.
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:30.440]  Almost nothing.
[3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:32.440]  Actually, we know a lot about it.
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:35.440]  It was fake and we know who perpetrated the false narrative.
[3:15:35.440 --> 3:15:41.440]  But Salon clearly knows nothing, except that it exposes his most serious weakness.
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:43.440]  Trump got this far by smashing political norms.
[3:15:43.440 --> 3:15:44.440]  Yeah, thank God.
[3:15:44.440 --> 3:15:52.440]  Now he's left with no real friends, even though he has thousands, 20,000 people at every rally he goes to, and little political capital.
[3:15:52.440 --> 3:15:54.440]  He's the president of the United States.
[3:15:54.440 --> 3:15:58.440]  Salon lives in complete rejection of reality.
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:15:59.440]  They go on.
[3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:00.440]  They go on, Leanne.
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:03.440]  For an ordinary politician who pretty much plays by the rules,
[3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:08.440]  an unsubstantiated story of such salaciousness generally would not even reach the public.
[3:16:08.440 --> 3:16:10.440]  They're blaming Trump.
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:12.440]  Can you believe this?
[3:16:12.440 --> 3:16:15.440]  They're actually blaming Donald Trump.
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:23.440]  Well, it's like, we see how, you know, stories that should have tanked Hillary Clinton decades ago, really,
[3:16:23.440 --> 3:16:26.440]  how they have never made it to the surface, her and Bill,
[3:16:26.440 --> 3:16:30.440]  because the media is there protecting them, so you can see how the media, when they're not protecting you,
[3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:34.440]  they're just going to go and take these salacious allegations that they even spell out.
[3:16:34.440 --> 3:16:36.440]  You really shouldn't believe this.
[3:16:36.440 --> 3:16:37.440]  This probably isn't true.
[3:16:37.440 --> 3:16:39.440]  We're going to put it out there for you anyway.
[3:16:39.440 --> 3:16:43.440]  That's the difference when you have the media hacks on your side versus not.
[3:16:43.440 --> 3:16:48.440]  And then it finishes the little story here talking about credibility mattering.
[3:16:48.440 --> 3:16:54.440]  Salon, who stands up for pedophiles and blames Donald Trump for a despicable dossier against Donald Trump.
[3:16:54.440 --> 3:17:02.440]  And I love also, too, now the new thing they're putting out is this ex-British intelligence officer who was gathering on this intel.
[3:17:02.440 --> 3:17:04.440]  He's James Bond.
[3:17:04.440 --> 3:17:07.440]  He's James Bond. How dare you question.
[3:17:07.440 --> 3:17:09.440]  He's lame Bond.
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:11.440]  A total failure.
[3:17:11.440 --> 3:17:13.440]  It's just so frustrating.
[3:17:13.440 --> 3:17:15.440]  Now, here's the thing.
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:21.440]  I don't know what, it was some sort of a moderator or administrator for 4chan actually talked to Michael Savage yesterday
[3:17:21.440 --> 3:17:23.440]  and they're claiming complete responsibility.
[3:17:23.440 --> 3:17:25.440]  They're like, we planted this.
[3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:27.440]  We wanted to see how far it could go.
[3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:30.440]  Now, that's what I said yesterday when we were talking on the nightly news.
[3:17:30.440 --> 3:17:35.440]  And I'm not sure if that's completely substantiated yet or true, but it certainly had something to do with it.
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:41.440]  Well, it's funny because then you have like anonymous tweeting out, you know, that, I mean, they're all for this dossier.
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:42.440]  They say it's true.
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:45.440]  They say the Russians absolutely have something against Trump.
[3:17:45.440 --> 3:17:48.440]  And so there's like kind of this coup going on with the hackers.
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:17:54.440]  All right, you know what, I want to get into this story on the other side about the Chinese state media and Rex Hillerson yesterday.
[3:17:54.440 --> 3:17:58.440]  But to finish out this segment land, let's talk about this story.
[3:17:58.440 --> 3:18:02.440]  Scientists raised to develop vaccine for the plague amid fears.
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:05.440]  Terrorists could use the medieval disease to kill millions.
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:08.440]  Now, I'm sitting here, I'm scratching my head.
[3:18:08.440 --> 3:18:10.440]  And in this story, it's out of the sun.
[3:18:10.440 --> 3:18:17.440]  And of course, you know, you kind of face this when you're in the media, when you think about what to report or what to say.
[3:18:17.440 --> 3:18:23.440]  For example, them talking about basically how terrorists could use this bacteria to kill millions of people.
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:26.440]  And I'm sitting here like, well, boy, I hope a terrorist doesn't read this.
[3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:27.440]  Yeah.
[3:18:27.440 --> 3:18:28.440]  You know what I'm saying?
[3:18:28.440 --> 3:18:30.440]  Who knows if they have the capability or the capacity.
[3:18:30.440 --> 3:18:39.440]  But a couple years ago, they actually sort of spelled out exactly how a terrorist would be able to take the plague and develop it into.
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:41.440]  And you're like, they're begging for it.
[3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:46.440]  Wow, you actually just spelled it out and let them know the exact means by which to carry this out.
[3:18:46.440 --> 3:18:50.440]  Yeah, it's almost as like, oh, I hope a terrorist doesn't get their hands on that.
[3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:52.440]  Yeah, like Hillary Clinton's open e-mail server.
[3:18:52.440 --> 3:18:59.440]  Oh, I hope nobody hacks the open server I have over here that donated millions to Clinton Foundation.
[3:18:59.440 --> 3:19:01.440]  Yeah, well, and that kind of tied in for me.
[3:19:01.440 --> 3:19:09.440]  For some reason, I was thinking about the, you were talking about those, the little drones that the military was able.
[3:19:09.440 --> 3:19:11.440]  Oh, the miniature, the macro micro drones.
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:12.440]  Yeah.
[3:19:12.440 --> 3:19:15.440]  So talk about a way to, the drone swarm.
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:17.440]  It's like a locus.
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:22.440]  Yeah, that's like a locus swarm of these drones, which are constantly being warned that these could be reverse engineered,
[3:19:22.440 --> 3:19:28.440]  that terrorists could get their hands on them and then think about just attached to a weaponized plague.
[3:19:28.440 --> 3:19:30.440]  Well, actually, it's amazing.
[3:19:30.440 --> 3:19:32.440]  I mean, I lived in St. Louis.
[3:19:32.440 --> 3:19:37.440]  I don't know if this happens in Texas, but the locus come out every seven years or whatever and there's swarms of them in the air.
[3:19:37.440 --> 3:19:39.440]  That's what these drones look like that you're talking about.
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:45.440]  But I don't know if, you know, terrorists have the capacity to create a bacteria weapon.
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:53.440]  I do know that companies have the capacity to mass produce and mass sell vaccines and they love doing that.

[3:23:03.440 --> 3:23:08.440]  Charlie Daniels. He's always loved America. He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[3:23:08.440 --> 3:23:14.440]  There's a very little thing here from Agenda 21 that American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[3:23:14.440 --> 3:23:18.440]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:21.440]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you? It's gonna become a few guns.
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:22.440]  Oh, yeah.
[3:23:22.440 --> 3:23:26.440]  I take it he ain't gonna sit well down my way. At all. It ain't gonna sit well.
[3:23:26.440 --> 3:23:28.440]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[3:23:28.440 --> 3:23:31.440]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reviewers.
[3:23:31.440 --> 3:23:38.440]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.

[3:24:12.440 --> 3:24:14.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:14.440 --> 3:24:17.440]  Fourth hour on Shroyer, Leanne McAdoo with you.
[3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:21.440]  And it has been a crazy week on the hill. The inauguration is next week.
[3:24:21.440 --> 3:24:26.440]  We will have all the coverage. We'll be on the streets and bringing you all the up to date
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:30.440]  footage, protests, news, whatever's going on.
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:35.440]  And we're actually going to get a lot more into that into the next segment.
[3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:41.440]  We've got some developments with the Trump protests, some more disgustingness coming out of the anti-Trump people.
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:47.440]  And also a very interesting and important move out of the D.C. National Guard
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:49.440]  that we're going to cover as well in the next segment.
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:52.440]  But this segment, I want to talk about this.
[3:24:52.440 --> 3:24:58.440]  Chinese state media tells Donald Trump's team to prepare for military clash.
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:01.440]  Now, this story is coming out of a Chinese tabloid.
[3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:06.440]  So how much, you know, gravitas you want to take out of this is up to you.
[3:25:06.440 --> 3:25:09.440]  But there is actually something behind this. I'm going to explain this.
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:12.440]  It says the U.S. should prepare for a military clash.
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:18.440]  A state-run Chinese tabloid newspaper has warned less than 24 hours after U.S.
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:22.440]  Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson appeared to call for a blockade of the
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:27.440]  South China Sea Islands is when the story was put out.
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:29.440]  Now, this is the key here, Leigh Ann.
[3:25:29.440 --> 3:25:36.440]  So Rex Tillerson in his hearing yesterday obviously had to go and answer a lot of questions.
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:41.440]  And I'm not sure the exact nature of the question that was brought up that led to him talking about
[3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:43.440]  the situation in the South China Seas.
[3:25:43.440 --> 3:25:47.440]  But basically he brought up the situation, how there's turmoil and tension in the South China Seas.
[3:25:47.440 --> 3:25:50.440]  There's territorial battles going on.
[3:25:50.440 --> 3:25:53.440]  He talks about how the Chinese are essentially building their own islands out there,
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:57.440]  laming stake to those, you know, militarizing those islands.
[3:25:57.440 --> 3:26:00.440]  It's kind of an unprecedented move, honestly.
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:07.440]  But also it's a move that is making the other countries in the region not too happy about it.
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:13.440]  But there's something that they didn't talk about that's very important here that Rex Tillerson knows damn well.
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:20.440]  Okay, trust me. Now, the territory battle in the South China Sea goes beyond just territory.
[3:26:20.440 --> 3:26:26.440]  There is actually a ton of oil in this region and a lot of oil exploration going on.
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:33.440]  So this territory battle also has a lot to do with claims to the energy that's coming out of the South China Sea.
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:38.440]  And again, Rex Tillerson knows this, folks. Trust me. He knows this.
[3:26:38.440 --> 3:26:44.440]  So this is something to me, Leanne, that is going to be kind of ongoing developing.
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:50.440]  Tillerson obviously knows this. They didn't really touch on it in the hearing yesterday.
[3:26:50.440 --> 3:26:56.440]  But what do you think? I mean, is China, and they actually mentioned this in the story,
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:27:01.440]  how if the US wants to stop what China is doing in the South China Sea,
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:05.440]  they essentially have to send physical troops there, send ships there.
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:10.440]  I mean, it would have to be a physical hot war if they actually wanted to stop this.
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:13.440]  I mean, is this what we're looking at here? I mean, we've been looking at the Russians.
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:16.440]  Maybe we're ignoring a bigger fish here with the Chinese.
[3:27:16.440 --> 3:27:18.440]  Of course, Alex has been saying that.
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:23.440]  Well, the Chinese military has already been making some really aggressive posturing this week as well.
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:27.440]  This was even before Rex Tillerson made that statement.
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:32.440]  So yeah, they're definitely trying to lay claim to those islands there
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:36.440]  because I guess these are islands that kind of have only just come up to the surface
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:39.440]  sort of formed in the last, you know, however many decades.
[3:27:39.440 --> 3:27:44.440]  So no one had really laid a claim to that territory and it's absolutely resource rich
[3:27:44.440 --> 3:27:46.440]  and they are willing to go to war over it.
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:50.440]  And so what is the US? What can the US really do at that point?
[3:27:50.440 --> 3:27:56.440]  Well, what the US can do, well, or what the US has done in the past,
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:28:02.440]  is use the military industrial complex proxy wars to kind of politicize those regions
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:06.440]  so that they can bring in their oil executives to come take that energy
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:09.440]  and then filter that profit to whoever plays the game.
[3:28:09.440 --> 3:28:11.440]  Well, you guys are fighting over this.
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:13.440]  So we're going to take it away from you.
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:15.440]  We'll divvy it up fairly, believe me.
[3:28:15.440 --> 3:28:18.440]  So it should be interesting to see what goes on with that.
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:22.440]  But that's kind of the untold story within the story,
[3:28:22.440 --> 3:28:24.440]  is all the oil and the energy to be had there.
[3:28:24.440 --> 3:28:27.440]  Yeah, we're supposed to have all eyes on Russia, but really, what about China?
[3:28:27.440 --> 3:28:29.440]  And I'm just going to say this about Rex Tillerson,
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:31.440]  and I'm not going to go too deep into this.
[3:28:31.440 --> 3:28:33.440]  You can take what you want from this.
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:38.440]  But I think at this point, Rex Tillerson to me is either a globalist implant
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:41.440]  and perhaps a danger to the Trump administration
[3:28:41.440 --> 3:28:47.440]  or an absolute neutron bomb against the New World Order.
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:49.440]  I think that he's one of those two right now.
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:51.440]  And I'm going to be keeping my eyes close to Rex Tillerson
[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:55.440]  because I actually think if he's the neutron bomb
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:28:57.440]  against the establishment against the New World Order
[3:28:57.440 --> 3:28:59.440]  that he could potentially be,
[3:28:59.440 --> 3:29:02.440]  I think his life might be in danger just as much as Donald Trump's land,
[3:29:02.440 --> 3:29:03.440]  to be honest with you.
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:04.440]  Well, I was reading an article on Breitbart.
[3:29:04.440 --> 3:29:06.440]  They did some pretty fair coverage,
[3:29:06.440 --> 3:29:09.440]  just kind of making fun of the fact that all of the news
[3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:11.440]  was focused on this fake dossier
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:14.440]  that they really didn't tear apart Rex Tillerson
[3:29:14.440 --> 3:29:15.440]  and a lot of the things that he was saying
[3:29:15.440 --> 3:29:18.440]  because he didn't prove the skeptics wrong
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:21.440]  by proving that he was going to be a good man
[3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:24.440]  and choose the more high ground over things.
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:28.440]  He put himself out there as his international relations experience is business
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:30.440]  and that's what it's going to be about for him.
[3:29:30.440 --> 3:29:31.440]  Well, and it was amazing too
[3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:33.440]  because him, Tillerson and Pompeo went along
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:35.440]  with a lot of the establishment talking points
[3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:36.440]  that had a lot of people worried.
[3:29:36.440 --> 3:29:38.440]  So I'm wondering if they're playing possum
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:40.440]  or if Trump really means it when he says think to yourself.
[3:29:40.440 --> 3:29:42.440]  I don't know, more news on the other side
[3:29:42.440 --> 3:29:44.440]  specifically regarding the inauguration
[3:29:44.440 --> 3:29:49.440]  of President McAdoo Alex Jones' show, Fourth Hour.
[3:30:14.440 --> 3:30:17.440]  Every time a Democrat voted no with a nice lecture to go with it,
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:19.440]  forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner,
[3:30:19.440 --> 3:30:21.440]  to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats,
[3:30:21.440 --> 3:30:24.440]  repeating at nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[3:30:24.440 --> 3:30:26.440]  Now today the vote moves on to the house
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:27.440]  where we have had similar results.
[3:30:27.440 --> 3:30:30.440]  The debate has been heated with Democrats speaking past their time,
[3:30:30.440 --> 3:30:32.440]  bringing in large blown up photos of children
[3:30:32.440 --> 3:30:34.440]  to win sympathy points and trying to argue
[3:30:34.440 --> 3:30:36.440]  that Republicans are ending healthcare
[3:30:36.440 --> 3:30:38.440]  like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[3:30:38.440 --> 3:30:41.440]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act
[3:30:41.440 --> 3:30:44.440]  makes up Americans to be screwed by big wigs and fat cats
[3:30:44.440 --> 3:30:45.440]  in the healthcare industry,
[3:30:45.440 --> 3:30:48.440]  ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did,
[3:30:48.440 --> 3:30:50.440]  creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[3:30:50.440 --> 3:30:52.440]  He also said that Republicans had no plan,
[3:30:52.440 --> 3:30:55.440]  to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans
[3:30:55.440 --> 3:30:56.440]  they brought to the debate floor.
[3:30:56.440 --> 3:31:21.440]  I'm Owen Troyer and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[3:31:26.440 --> 3:31:51.440]  I'm Owen Troyer and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[3:31:51.440 --> 3:32:17.440]  I'm Owen Troyer and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:43.440]  I'm Owen Troyer and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[3:32:43.440 --> 3:33:11.440]  I'm Owen Troyer and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[3:33:11.440 --> 3:33:16.440]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[3:33:16.440 --> 3:33:23.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:23.440 --> 3:33:25.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:27.440]  Owen Troyer, Leanne McAdoo with you.

[3:33:29.440 --> 3:33:31.440]  and I've got a special right now.

[3:33:44.440 --> 3:33:47.440]  And this is one that I was talking about the last time
[3:33:47.440 --> 3:33:49.440]  I believe I was on the Alex Jones Show here.
[3:33:49.440 --> 3:33:53.440]  You're going to start seeing these ads on television
[3:33:53.440 --> 3:33:57.440]  talking about telomeres and how this can extend your life,
[3:33:57.440 --> 3:33:58.440]  extending your telomeres.
[3:33:58.440 --> 3:34:02.440]  Well, this is something that infowarslife has been doing
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:03.440]  for a long time.
[3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:05.440]  Doctor Group formulated DNA Force.
[3:34:05.440 --> 3:34:07.440]  I believe it's over a year old now.
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:08.440]  I've been taking it for a long time.
[3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:09.440]  I take one in the morning.
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:10.440]  I take one at night.
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:13.440]  It's one of my favorite infowarslife products,
[3:34:13.440 --> 3:34:14.440]  but it's 10% off right now.
[3:34:14.440 --> 3:34:18.440]  But this is a groundbreaking super advanced product,

[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:25.440]  in the mainstream now, how telomeres are the secret
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:27.440]  to living a longer life.
[3:34:27.440 --> 3:34:29.440]  And, well, we already had this.
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:31.440]  We knew this for a long time.
[3:34:31.440 --> 3:34:33.440]  That's why we're the groundbreaking products
[3:34:33.440 --> 3:34:34.440]  at infowarslife.com.

[3:34:45.440 --> 3:34:48.440]  But that DNA Force, folks, that is a serious product
[3:34:48.440 --> 3:34:50.440]  we offer for you.
[3:34:50.440 --> 3:34:52.440]  And I promise you, you're going to start hearing
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:54.440]  about these telomeres more and more.
[3:34:54.440 --> 3:34:56.440]  Just know, if you want to protect your telomeres,
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:34:59.440]  infowarslife.com is the place to go.
[3:34:59.440 --> 3:35:02.440]  And we don't water ours products down.
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:03.440]  No.
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:04.440]  That's something if you want to...
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:05.440]  Fully juiced.
[3:35:05.440 --> 3:35:06.440]  High energy.
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:08.440]  Even your high brand, expensive ones out there
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:10.440]  don't even have high quality.
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:11.440]  It is amazing.
[3:35:11.440 --> 3:35:12.440]  I mean, Alex...
[3:35:12.440 --> 3:35:14.440]  And actually, I think David was talking about this today, too.
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:18.440]  The days when I don't take all of my infowarslife products,
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:20.440]  all the supplements I take in the mornings,
[3:35:20.440 --> 3:35:22.440]  I don't take that, I can feel it.
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:23.440]  I can feel it by noon.
[3:35:23.440 --> 3:35:26.440]  And then the days where I do, I feel great all day long.
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:29.440]  But I'll tell you what, who doesn't feel great right now.
[3:35:29.440 --> 3:35:31.440]  And that's Madonna.
[3:35:31.440 --> 3:35:32.440]  You know...
[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:34.440]  She's, you know...
[3:35:34.440 --> 3:35:35.440]  Well, come on.
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:37.440]  Baby's blood is doing her all right.
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:40.440]  Look, Madonna said that Trump winning was like a bad breakup.
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:42.440]  It's been really tough for Madonna, folks.
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:45.440]  But she's not done, you know.
[3:35:45.440 --> 3:35:49.440]  Her meltdown continues to spiral out of control.
[3:35:49.440 --> 3:35:50.440]  And it's...
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:52.440]  You know, you thought that she reached a new low
[3:35:52.440 --> 3:35:55.440]  and she offered a little fallatio
[3:35:55.440 --> 3:35:57.440]  in order for you to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[3:35:57.440 --> 3:35:58.440]  No.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:35:59.440]  Nope, it's gone lower.
[3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:00.440]  Get out the vote on that.
[3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:01.440]  It's gone lower.
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:02.440]  No, it didn't work.
[3:36:02.440 --> 3:36:05.440]  Unfortunately, did not want fallatio from Madonna.
[3:36:05.440 --> 3:36:10.440]  But now, on Instagram, she has shared a public hair...
[3:36:10.440 --> 3:36:11.440]  Excuse me, public.
[3:36:11.440 --> 3:36:12.440]  I can't even...
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:13.440]  I don't even want to say this.
[3:36:13.440 --> 3:36:14.440]  A pubic hair.
[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:17.440]  A pubic hair photo with the Nike logo saying,
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:19.440]  just do it.
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:23.440]  And of course, she is referring to protesting
[3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:25.440]  Donald Trump's inauguration.
[3:36:25.440 --> 3:36:29.440]  And this is part of the Women's March on Washington.
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:32.440]  They're expecting over 200,000 people at this march.
[3:36:32.440 --> 3:36:36.440]  And Madonna says with her pubic hair, just do it.
[3:36:36.440 --> 3:36:37.440]  Go up.
[3:36:37.440 --> 3:36:38.440]  You got to protest.
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:41.440]  Hey, I'm not going to tell everyone what you told me
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:42.440]  in the room earlier.
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:46.440]  Why do you got to say that?
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:49.440]  Let everyone know how you really feel about Madonna.
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:52.440]  Look, Madonna, here's the thing.
[3:36:52.440 --> 3:36:53.440]  Look.
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:54.440]  What's your favorite Madonna song?
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:36:56.440]  I can't say a favorite Madonna song.
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:36:58.440]  I can only tell you a favorite Madonna album.
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:36:59.440]  But I will tell you this.
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:01.440]  I will tell you this.
[3:37:01.440 --> 3:37:04.440]  I am glad that when I went to her concert,
[3:37:04.440 --> 3:37:06.440]  I'm glad I ended up not touching her.
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:07.440]  I was close.
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:09.440]  I almost touched her hand after reading this story
[3:37:09.440 --> 3:37:12.440]  and hearing her offer fellatio for a vote.
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:15.440]  I'm glad I did not touch Madonna at that concert.
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:17.440]  But it's just incredible.
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:20.440]  You know, who in their right mind?
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:22.440]  These people aren't in their right mind.
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:23.440]  There's the correct answer here.
[3:37:23.440 --> 3:37:24.440]  So I guess it's a trick question.
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:28.440]  But who in their right mind puts out a pubic hair shop?
[3:37:28.440 --> 3:37:31.440]  This is like J-Lo literally bending over,
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:33.440]  putting a microphone up to her butt,
[3:37:33.440 --> 3:37:35.440]  and then sitting here complaining about how
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:37.440]  Donald Trump objectifies women.
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:38.440]  Right.
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:39.440]  What?
[3:37:39.440 --> 3:37:40.440]  Yes, that's...
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:43.440]  You just put out a picture of your private part.
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:44.440]  Your hoo-ha.
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:46.440]  It looks like it has one of those fake mustaches
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:48.440]  cut out on it.
[3:37:48.440 --> 3:37:50.440]  I'm not going to talk about the actual...
[3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:52.440]  The actual picture itself.
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:55.440]  You can go to infowars.com and check out the article.
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:37:59.440]  But this is just one of the women
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:01.440]  that's supposed to show up to this...
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:02.440]  Katy Perry will be there.
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:04.440]  Katy Perry, Lena Dunham.
[3:38:04.440 --> 3:38:05.440]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:06.440]  We said women.
[3:38:06.440 --> 3:38:07.440]  This is true.
[3:38:07.440 --> 3:38:10.440]  Meanwhile, we do have another actress, Nicole Kidman,
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:11.440]  kind of speaking out saying,
[3:38:11.440 --> 3:38:12.440]  hey, you know what?
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:14.440]  It's time for America to get behind the president.
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:15.440]  But you know what, though?
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:16.440]  Get over it.
[3:38:16.440 --> 3:38:17.440]  I'm sorry.
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:18.440]  I got to cut you off here
[3:38:18.440 --> 3:38:19.440]  because I want to get more to the bottom of this, Leigh Ann.
[3:38:19.440 --> 3:38:20.440]  You're still on the story.
[3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:22.440]  Well, be on Madonna, though.
[3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:23.440]  Okay, so you've got all these women.
[3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:25.440]  They want to march on Washington, all right?
[3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:27.440]  And this is what they're saying.
[3:38:27.440 --> 3:38:29.440]  They are saying they want to send a bold message
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:31.440]  to our new administration on the first day in office
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:34.440]  that women's rights are human rights.
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:36.440]  Is anybody disagreeing with that?
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:39.440]  Is there some sort of a uprising against women's rights
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:40.440]  that I'm missing?
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:41.440]  You're a woman?
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:44.440]  That just goes back to the fake news
[3:38:44.440 --> 3:38:45.440]  where they have to put up that narrative
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:48.440]  that the Republicans don't have a plan to replace Obamacare,
[3:38:48.440 --> 3:38:50.440]  even though they have at least six different versions
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:52.440]  of six different plans.
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:54.440]  But they also have to put that out there
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:57.440]  that Donald Trump is going to, you know,
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:38:58.440]  round up your grandma,
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:00.440]  put her in a FEMA camp,
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:02.440]  and that he's going to do away with women's rights.
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:06.440]  Now, I know he has spoken out about taking federal funding away
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:09.440]  from Planned Parenthood, which a lot of people...
[3:39:09.440 --> 3:39:10.440]  Good.
[3:39:10.440 --> 3:39:11.440]  A lot of people are like,
[3:39:11.440 --> 3:39:13.440]  I do not want my tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood.
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:14.440]  Period.
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:15.440]  Exclamation point.
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:16.440]  Exactly.
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:18.440]  And then if Planned Parenthood is so, you know,
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:22.440]  hard up for cash, why are they paying the leader
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:24.440]  like more than a million dollars a year?
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:25.440]  I forget her name,
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:27.440]  but then they're always having these big parties
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:29.440]  with their celebrities and their celebrity endorsements.
[3:39:29.440 --> 3:39:30.440]  Here's an idea.
[3:39:30.440 --> 3:39:32.440]  How about George Soros can fund Planned Parenthood?
[3:39:32.440 --> 3:39:33.440]  How about that?
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:34.440]  Exactly.
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:35.440]  You don't need to take my money.
[3:39:35.440 --> 3:39:36.440]  Exactly.
[3:39:36.440 --> 3:39:37.440]  Or Bill Gates, who, you know,
[3:39:37.440 --> 3:39:38.440]  thinks there's too many people in the world.
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:40.440]  He wants to vaccinate everyone five times
[3:39:40.440 --> 3:39:42.440]  before the first month of their life.
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:43.440]  So, I mean, you know,
[3:39:43.440 --> 3:39:45.440]  how about he funds Planned Parenthood if it's so great?
[3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:48.440]  I mean, you care about these people, Soros and Gates,
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:49.440]  fund Planned Parenthood then.
[3:39:49.440 --> 3:39:50.440]  Quit taking our money.
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:52.440]  That's illegal and unconstitutional to me.
[3:39:52.440 --> 3:39:56.440]  America Ferrera, she's some actress,
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:39:57.440]  she says, since the election,
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:00.440]  so many fear that their voices will go unheard.
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:01.440]  No, we're hearing you cry.
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:02.440]  We're just laughing.
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:03.440]  Well, that's what's funny,
[3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:04.440]  is that since the election,
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:06.440]  the Hollywood voices are going unheard
[3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:07.440]  because people are just sick and tired
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:09.440]  of being lectured by these Hollywood elites.
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:10.440]  I can't.
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:13.440]  Now, I know that we have another Alex Jones report
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:16.440]  that he's filed on China communism
[3:40:16.440 --> 3:40:17.440]  and the South China Sea,
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:18.440]  and we were just discussing that,
[3:40:18.440 --> 3:40:20.440]  and I would love to get his breakdown
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:23.440]  on that situation there.
[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:25.440]  If you want to...
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:26.440]  All right.
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:28.440]  Well, let's go ahead and hear what Alex has to say
[3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:30.440]  about the situation in the South China Sea.
[3:40:30.440 --> 3:40:34.440]  Communist China is the existential threat.
[3:40:34.440 --> 3:40:38.440]  Communist China was set up in power in 1949
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:40.440]  by the Western powers, by the CIA,
[3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:42.440]  by the robber barons.
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:45.440]  China came out just yesterday,
[3:40:45.440 --> 3:40:47.440]  their official government newspaper,
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:49.440]  The People's Daily,
[3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:52.440]  and said, we are the champions of globalism
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:54.440]  and global government.
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:40:57.440]  We will prop up this worldwide system.
[3:40:57.440 --> 3:40:58.440]  Well, absolutely.
[3:40:58.440 --> 3:41:01.440]  They've been given both ends of the Panama Canal.
[3:41:01.440 --> 3:41:03.440]  They've been given all the major deep water ports.
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:06.440]  They've been given a global monopoly
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:07.440]  on rare earth minerals
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:09.440]  because they've made deals with Goldman Sachs
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:11.440]  and J.P. Morgan and the big central banks
[3:41:11.440 --> 3:41:14.440]  to leverage out economic control of the planet.
[3:41:14.440 --> 3:41:17.440]  Now, there was a public deal going back to the 70s,
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:19.440]  back when George Herbert Walker Bush
[3:41:19.440 --> 3:41:21.440]  was the main ambassador to China
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:22.440]  when Nixon set up this deal,
[3:41:22.440 --> 3:41:25.440]  that they would be set up as an economic superpower
[3:41:25.440 --> 3:41:27.440]  by the 21st century being dominant.
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:29.440]  It'd be the Chinese century.
[3:41:29.440 --> 3:41:31.440]  There's been literally thousands of articles,
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:32.440]  CFR reports on this,
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:35.440]  but the public isn't really aware of these deals that were made.
[3:41:35.440 --> 3:41:38.440]  They weren't official treaties, but they were deals.
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:41.440]  And in the deal, it was established
[3:41:41.440 --> 3:41:43.440]  that they wouldn't ever expand out of their own country
[3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:45.440]  and that they wouldn't dominate the South China Sea
[3:41:45.440 --> 3:41:47.440]  and that they wouldn't dominate Japan
[3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:49.440]  and that they wouldn't be a major military power
[3:41:49.440 --> 3:41:51.440]  but they could have nuclear weapons
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:53.440]  to, quote, defend themselves from Russia
[3:41:53.440 --> 3:41:54.440]  because, believe it or not,
[3:41:54.440 --> 3:41:56.440]  the Chinese have a real issue with the Russians
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:41:57.440]  more than us.
[3:41:57.440 --> 3:41:59.440]  We kicked the Japanese out in World War II.
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:01.440]  Again, our government put Mao Zedong in power.
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:03.440]  That was declassified a decade ago,
[3:42:03.440 --> 3:42:06.440]  actually more than a decade ago, I guess 2004.
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:08.440]  So 12 years ago.
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:10.440]  And John Birch Society's been breaking that down
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:13.440]  since they were founded in the 1950s
[3:42:13.440 --> 3:42:16.440]  expressly on the fact that our government
[3:42:16.440 --> 3:42:18.440]  had sold out to the Communist Chinese.
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:19.440]  But that's a whole other subject,
[3:42:19.440 --> 3:42:21.440]  just giving credit where credit to do.
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:23.440]  Talk about being ahead of their time.
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:25.440]  And so the People's Daily last year said,
[3:42:25.440 --> 3:42:27.440]  we'll basically have war with you.
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:28.440]  We'll crush you.
[3:42:28.440 --> 3:42:29.440]  We're prepared for nuclear war.
[3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:32.440]  We're prepared for wars in the South China Sea
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:33.440]  or in the Pacific period.
[3:42:33.440 --> 3:42:35.440]  We'll take back any islands we want.
[3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:37.440]  We'll invade the Philippines.
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:39.440]  They've been extremely belligerent.
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:40.440]  They've also come out and said,
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:42.440]  we're going to defend globalism
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:44.440]  as it falls apart in Europe and the United States.
[3:42:44.440 --> 3:42:46.440]  We're going to empower it.
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:48.440]  And the Davos group's been bragging about that.
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:49.440]  You name it.
[3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:52.440]  It's the globalist, multi-nationals with China
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:56.440]  and with the Islamists against the rest of the world.
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:42:59.440]  The globalist double-crossed Russia as well.
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:02.440]  They had a deal going back to the early 1990s
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:06.440]  to not take over former Russian territories
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:11.440]  and Russian satellites like Georgia and Ukraine and others
[3:43:11.440 --> 3:43:14.440]  if Russia did not expand outside of its borders as well.
[3:43:14.440 --> 3:43:18.440]  That deal's been broken for about the last 10 years.
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:20.440]  I mean, in fairness to Obama, he didn't break it.
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:21.440]  Bush did.
[3:43:21.440 --> 3:43:25.440]  But it accelerated massively in the last year
[3:43:25.440 --> 3:43:27.440]  and really the last eight.
[3:43:27.440 --> 3:43:33.440]  But in the last year, it has gone to the edge of war.
[3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:36.440]  So there's major jockeying, major political changes
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:39.440]  happening around the world, major realignments.
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:41.440]  But the United States under a Trump presidency
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:44.440]  is going to be realigned with the UK,
[3:43:44.440 --> 3:43:46.440]  countries that break away from the Europe,
[3:43:46.440 --> 3:43:49.440]  with any other nations that want to work with us,
[3:43:49.440 --> 3:43:53.440]  with Japan and others.
[3:43:53.440 --> 3:43:56.440]  And it's China, the global bankers,
[3:43:56.440 --> 3:43:59.440]  the people like Soros, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds,
[3:43:59.440 --> 3:44:02.440]  the same old combine, and the Islamists.
[3:44:02.440 --> 3:44:03.440]  It's those three groups.
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:06.440]  That's the axis of evil against the American Republic
[3:44:06.440 --> 3:44:09.440]  and our own global system of free trade
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:12.440]  and free markets and open governments,
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:15.440]  which was the original globalism that was being pushed
[3:44:15.440 --> 3:44:18.440]  by Eisenhower and others that then got hijacked
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:20.440]  and instead of actually putting in good governments
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:22.440]  in the Middle East and places like that
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:24.440]  that were actually democratized and secular.
[3:44:24.440 --> 3:44:26.440]  By the 80s, they reversed the program.
[3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:28.440]  Reagan really wasn't involved, but it happened.
[3:44:28.440 --> 3:44:30.440]  They reversed the program,
[3:44:30.440 --> 3:44:34.440]  where they basically began to double-cross
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:37.440]  those nations and started putting actual
[3:44:37.440 --> 3:44:40.440]  tyrants in every time they could.
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:42.440]  So again, going back to Owen,
[3:44:42.440 --> 3:44:44.440]  the communist Chinese are openly,
[3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:48.440]  constantly threatening to attack the United States.
[3:44:48.440 --> 3:44:50.440]  They are constantly threatening
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:52.440]  and talking about how they can destroy us.
[3:44:52.440 --> 3:44:56.440]  They are threatening North Korea as a go-between group as well.
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:44:58.440]  So yes, these are real threats,
[3:44:58.440 --> 3:45:00.440]  and the American people are not made aware of them.
[3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:03.440]  What makes me angry is that they keep claiming in our news
[3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:06.440]  that the communist, you know, Chinese aren't a threat
[3:45:06.440 --> 3:45:08.440]  while they're making these threats and while they're expanding,
[3:45:08.440 --> 3:45:11.440]  while telling us that Russia is the existential threat
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:13.440]  and has to be dealt with.
[3:45:13.440 --> 3:45:16.440]  It is absolutely critical that we inform our fellow Americans
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:19.440]  and other people around the world about what's happening.
[3:45:19.440 --> 3:45:22.440]  Also, leftist-controlled CNN always spends this
[3:45:22.440 --> 3:45:25.440]  that we're anti-Chinese or anti-Asian.
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:27.440]  The communist Chinese have killed
[3:45:27.440 --> 3:45:29.440]  over 100 million of their own people,
[3:45:29.440 --> 3:45:31.440]  80 plus million under Mao Zedong.
[3:45:31.440 --> 3:45:32.440]  Okay?
[3:45:32.440 --> 3:45:33.440]  So let's be close.
[3:45:33.440 --> 3:45:36.440]  They're not an anti-Asian operation or anti-Chinese operation.
[3:45:36.440 --> 3:45:37.440]  They're great people.
[3:45:37.440 --> 3:45:40.440]  They are under an exploitive enslaved system
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:43.440]  that's being used to leverage out and take control of the world.
[3:45:43.440 --> 3:45:45.440]  Donald Trump is countering that and saying,
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:49.440]  no more one-sided deals, Americanism, not globalism.
[3:45:49.440 --> 3:45:55.440]  But it is the communist Chinese fascistic crony capitalist model
[3:45:55.440 --> 3:45:58.440]  that is the enemy of any free, open society,
[3:45:58.440 --> 3:46:01.440]  and we must break its back and free the people of China
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:03.440]  back to over the rest of the crew.
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:04.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:07.440]  Now, before we went to break,
[3:46:07.440 --> 3:46:09.440]  we were talking about some stuff that's going on right now
[3:46:09.440 --> 3:46:12.440]  in D.C. around the inauguration.
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:14.440]  And I wanted to talk about this story.
[3:46:14.440 --> 3:46:17.440]  Commanding General of D.C. National Guard to be removed from post.
[3:46:17.440 --> 3:46:18.440]  Now, I was reading the story,
[3:46:18.440 --> 3:46:21.440]  and I was actually glad that I talked about this with Leanne
[3:46:21.440 --> 3:46:22.440]  before coming on air,
[3:46:22.440 --> 3:46:24.440]  because she actually reminded me about something that skipped my mind
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:25.440]  when I was reading this,
[3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:28.440]  how Trump has basically said all presidential appointments
[3:46:28.440 --> 3:46:32.440]  are essentially no longer effective as soon as he becomes president.
[3:46:32.440 --> 3:46:34.440]  So that explains the story more.
[3:46:34.440 --> 3:46:37.440]  But the interesting thing about this is this is in the Washington Post,
[3:46:37.440 --> 3:46:41.440]  and it's basically saying the D.C. National Guard,
[3:46:41.440 --> 3:46:45.440]  General Oral Schwartz is being forced to remove at 12.01 p.m.
[3:46:45.440 --> 3:46:48.440]  that's right after Trump will be inaugurated.
[3:46:48.440 --> 3:46:52.440]  It talks about how he had a big hand in protecting the inauguration,
[3:46:52.440 --> 3:46:56.440]  everything from protests, terrorists, whatever else is going on.
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:47:00.440]  Obviously, working with the police department and FBI, et cetera,
[3:47:00.440 --> 3:47:01.440]  et cetera, secret service.
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:02.440]  But it then goes on,
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:04.440]  and this is the part that was confusing to me,
[3:47:04.440 --> 3:47:08.440]  and then hearing you say what you think the reason is,
[3:47:08.440 --> 3:47:10.440]  and it makes sense, how come he wouldn't know this?
[3:47:10.440 --> 3:47:15.440]  He says a quote that he has not been told why he had to step down,
[3:47:15.440 --> 3:47:17.440]  and then he goes on to say,
[3:47:17.440 --> 3:47:21.440]  I'm a presidential nominee, therefore the president has the power to remove me.
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:23.440]  Do you think he's referring to Trump or Obama there,
[3:47:23.440 --> 3:47:27.440]  and do you think he knows that it was Trump's call to remove him,
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:29.440]  or do you think maybe there's something else going on?
[3:47:29.440 --> 3:47:31.440]  Obviously, Trump has not reached out and talked to him.
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:37.440]  Well, yeah, was he given this order to be relieved at exactly 12.01 by President Obama,
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:40.440]  who's saying, you know what, take yourself out of there,
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:43.440]  and let's see how much chaos we can create when the D.C. National Guard
[3:47:43.440 --> 3:47:45.440]  doesn't have a leader in place,
[3:47:45.440 --> 3:47:48.440]  or is it because Donald Trump put out that call
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:53.440]  that all the presidential appointees needed to go as soon as he was nominated,
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:55.440]  as soon as he took his oath of office?
[3:47:55.440 --> 3:47:56.440]  So it'll be very interesting,
[3:47:56.440 --> 3:48:00.440]  especially when you consider the mass riots that are being called for
[3:48:00.440 --> 3:48:04.440]  with these people that are planning on protesting the inauguration,
[3:48:04.440 --> 3:48:09.440]  protesters plan to paralyze the inauguration with traffic jams.
[3:48:09.440 --> 3:48:13.440]  They're wanting to turn this into a real cluster.
[3:48:13.440 --> 3:48:15.440]  They're planning on getting a little bit violent.
[3:48:15.440 --> 3:48:18.440]  Some people obviously want to just peacefully protest.
[3:48:18.440 --> 3:48:24.440]  Meanwhile, Rosie O'Donnell is calling for martial law as a means to lay the inauguration.
[3:48:24.440 --> 3:48:28.440]  She said, I'd be fully for imposing martial law to lay the inauguration.
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:32.440]  But that's the thing, is it would be the D.C. National Guard
[3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:37.440]  who would be called out to implement martial law.
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:39.440]  So it's very interesting.
[3:48:39.440 --> 3:48:42.440]  We're kind of stuck there in a quagmire with what's going on.
[3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:45.440]  She is stuck in a quagmire, called her own mind.
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:46.440]  But it's crazy.
[3:48:46.440 --> 3:48:48.440]  And again, we're going to be at the inauguration.
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:50.440]  Make sure that you're at infowars.com
[3:48:50.440 --> 3:48:53.440]  and the Alex Jones channel on YouTube to keep up with all of our coverage there.
[3:48:53.440 --> 3:48:55.440]  I'm sure it's going to be absolutely wild.
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:48:57.440]  But it's already getting wild.
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:48:58.440]  We're already seeing the signs of it.
[3:48:58.440 --> 3:48:59.440]  You were talking about it.
[3:48:59.440 --> 3:49:01.440]  We're expecting, I think there might be millions of people there.
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:03.440]  I mean, this is going to be absolutely wild.
[3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:04.440]  Well, yeah.
[3:49:04.440 --> 3:49:05.440]  LA artist.
[3:49:05.440 --> 3:49:06.440]  I don't know if you saw this.
[3:49:06.440 --> 3:49:09.440]  An LA artist creates painting in blood as a Trump protest.
[3:49:09.440 --> 3:49:13.440]  A group of artists working on a Trump protest painting
[3:49:13.440 --> 3:49:16.440]  have now received more than 20 pints of blood
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:19.440]  that they are using to make the painting on the wall.
[3:49:19.440 --> 3:49:20.440]  How do you like that?
[3:49:20.440 --> 3:49:21.440]  It's art.
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:22.440]  This isn't a spirit cooking, mind you.
[3:49:22.440 --> 3:49:23.440]  You just don't get it.
[3:49:23.440 --> 3:49:24.440]  It is art.
[3:49:24.440 --> 3:49:25.440]  This isn't a spirit cooking.
[3:49:25.440 --> 3:49:30.440]  This is cutting yourself and then painting it on a wall to protest Donald Trump.
[3:49:30.440 --> 3:49:31.440]  How about this, Leigh Ann?
[3:49:31.440 --> 3:49:33.440]  You think this will be effective?
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:35.440]  It's just a lot of people out there.
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:36.440]  What do you think?
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:38.440]  Do you think a blood painting on the wall will do anything?
[3:49:38.440 --> 3:49:39.440]  And have them say, thank you so much.
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:41.440]  We are ready to move on to bigger and better.
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:42.440]  You know what you're saying?
[3:49:42.440 --> 3:49:45.440]  Because the social policies put in place in the last eight years
[3:49:45.440 --> 3:49:50.440]  have turned people into freaking insane freaks.
[3:49:50.440 --> 3:49:55.440]  You know what you're saying when you're making a Trump protest painting in blood?
[3:49:55.440 --> 3:49:56.440]  You know what you're actually saying?
[3:49:56.440 --> 3:49:57.440]  What?
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:49:58.440]  I'm crazy.
[3:49:58.440 --> 3:49:59.440]  I need help.
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:00.440]  Help me.
[3:50:00.440 --> 3:50:01.440]  That's what you're saying.
[3:50:01.440 --> 3:50:02.440]  Nothing more, nothing less.
[3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:03.440]  I'm insane and I need help.
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:07.440]  Well, they're willing to draw a little blood with these mass riots
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:09.440]  and these protests that they're planning.
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:14.440]  And then there was someone, one of the major organizers of a protest was asked about violence
[3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:17.440]  and he was basically kind of saying, you know, we're not condoning it,
[3:50:17.440 --> 3:50:19.440]  but you know, it's going to happen.
[3:50:19.440 --> 3:50:20.440]  So, okay, good for you.
[3:50:20.440 --> 3:50:22.440]  They hope to stop his swearing in.
[3:50:22.440 --> 3:50:24.440]  Here's what I would hope for you though.
[3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:27.440]  I would hope that you don't plan any violence around the bikers for Trump
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:31.440]  because most of those guys are probably some big bad dudes
[3:50:31.440 --> 3:50:33.440]  who you don't want to mess with.
[3:50:33.440 --> 3:50:36.440]  Bikers for Trump vow to defend Trump inauguration.
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:38.440]  They are going to form a wall of protection.
[3:50:38.440 --> 3:50:44.440]  Chris Cox, biker for Trump founder, has said that this is their plan during Trump's inauguration.
[3:50:44.440 --> 3:50:45.440]  I can't wait.
[3:50:45.440 --> 3:50:46.440]  I'm excited to see the bikers for Trump
[3:50:46.440 --> 3:50:49.440]  and I hope maybe a couple of them want to form a wall around me
[3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:51.440]  because I have a feeling that I'm going to be a target.
[3:50:51.440 --> 3:50:53.440]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show on the other side.
[3:50:53.440 --> 3:50:57.440]  Owen Shroyer, Leon Met, can do with you for five more minutes.
[3:51:24.440 --> 3:51:27.440]  God was in school, morality had a future,
[3:51:27.440 --> 3:51:30.440]  and beef was for supper.
[3:51:30.440 --> 3:51:33.440]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[3:51:33.440 --> 3:51:34.440]  We're the solution.
[3:51:34.440 --> 3:51:37.440]  Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:39.440]  Storying Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels,
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:42.440]  and special ops general, Jerry Boykin,
[3:51:42.440 --> 3:51:44.440]  theatrical screenings on demand,
[3:51:44.440 --> 3:51:47.440]  DVDs now available with long sheds and tears
[3:51:47.440 --> 3:51:49.440]  over the red, white, and blue.
[3:51:49.440 --> 3:51:51.440]  Revelation, the movie.
[3:51:51.440 --> 3:51:53.440]  The movie.info.
[3:51:53.440 --> 3:51:55.440]  Americans need to see this film.
[3:51:55.440 --> 3:51:58.440]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[3:51:58.440 --> 3:51:59.440]  Let's fix it.
[3:51:59.440 --> 3:52:01.440]  Men, if you're like me,
[3:52:01.440 --> 3:52:04.440]  you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave
[3:52:04.440 --> 3:52:05.440]  from a quality blade.
[3:52:05.440 --> 3:52:09.440]  The sort of shave that cuts clean without the burn.
[3:52:09.440 --> 3:52:12.440]  So why are you messing around with generic razors
[3:52:12.440 --> 3:52:14.440]  that cost 32 bucks for an 8-pack?
[3:52:14.440 --> 3:52:16.440]  When you can shave with Harry's high-quality
[3:52:16.440 --> 3:52:19.440]  German engineered blades for half the price.
[3:52:19.440 --> 3:52:21.440]  And because Harry's is so confident
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:23.440]  in the quality of their blades,
[3:52:23.440 --> 3:52:25.440]  they'll send you their most popular set,

[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:40.440]  Their way of saying thank you for trying them.
[3:52:40.440 --> 3:52:42.440]  How is Harry's able to save you all this money
[3:52:42.440 --> 3:52:45.440]  and still give you the best shave you'll ever enjoy?
[3:52:45.440 --> 3:52:48.440]  By owning the factory that manufactures the blades.

[3:54:16.440 --> 3:54:24.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Fourth hour, final segment.
[3:54:24.440 --> 3:54:28.440]  We have some amazing body armor available right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:54:28.440 --> 3:54:32.440]  The most advanced body armor on the market right now
[3:54:32.440 --> 3:54:35.440]  and it is being sold at a ridiculous price.
[3:54:35.440 --> 3:54:38.440]  This is some of the lightest, most comfortable body armor
[3:54:38.440 --> 3:54:40.440]  that you can find on the market.
[3:54:40.440 --> 3:54:43.440]  And it's also some of the strongest too.
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:47.440]  And it's amazing to think that you might need something like this
[3:54:47.440 --> 3:54:49.440]  but this is the times that we live in.
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:51.440]  Obviously, you know, it's amazing, you know,
[3:54:51.440 --> 3:54:54.440]  the shooting that just happened at the Fort Lauderdale Airport.
[3:54:54.440 --> 3:54:56.440]  You talk about, you know, David talks about getting that,
[3:54:56.440 --> 3:54:59.440]  the backpack body armor that we have
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:02.440]  that's just basically a flat shield that you can put in the backpack
[3:55:02.440 --> 3:55:06.440]  to protect your child if they're at the airport or a school shooting.
[3:55:06.440 --> 3:55:10.440]  We've obviously, you know, seen these things happen in the past.
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:13.440]  But it's amazing, you know, we live in these times
[3:55:13.440 --> 3:55:15.440]  where you might need body armor.
[3:55:15.440 --> 3:55:18.440]  And I was just thinking about this, how that whole Fort Lauderdale shooting
[3:55:18.440 --> 3:55:21.440]  kind of just ended up being a 24-hour news cycle story.
[3:55:21.440 --> 3:55:26.440]  But there's a reason why people want to get body armor like this
[3:55:26.440 --> 3:55:28.440]  because they want to be able to wear it.
[3:55:28.440 --> 3:55:30.440]  They want it to be practical, but they want it to protect them.
[3:55:30.440 --> 3:55:32.440]  They want it to save their life.
[3:55:32.440 --> 3:55:34.440]  And that's what this body armor can do for you.
[3:55:34.440 --> 3:55:37.440]  Again, this is some of the most advanced body armor
[3:55:37.440 --> 3:55:40.440]  that you can find at the best price.
[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:42.440]  Protect yourself, protect your children.
[3:55:42.440 --> 3:55:45.440]  Go check it out, infowarstore.com, check out that body armor.
[3:55:45.440 --> 3:55:48.440]  I promise you, just like the DNA force,
[3:55:48.440 --> 3:55:50.440]  soon they'll be talking about this as groundbreaking.
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:52.440]  Well, we broke it first.
[3:55:52.440 --> 3:55:55.440]  That backpack could also be really good during these protests coming up, too.
[3:55:55.440 --> 3:55:56.440]  You know what, I'm glad you said that.
[3:55:56.440 --> 3:56:00.440]  Protect all of your equipment there from any of the gas canisters
[3:56:00.440 --> 3:56:02.440]  that might be fired up protesters.
[3:56:02.440 --> 3:56:03.440]  Well, who else?
[3:56:03.440 --> 3:56:05.440]  A lot of journalists out there might need...
[3:56:05.440 --> 3:56:07.440]  You don't have to wear a helmet.
[3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:09.440]  Yeah, you're definitely going to be...
[3:56:09.440 --> 3:56:11.440]  My goodness, it's going to be crazy.
[3:56:11.440 --> 3:56:13.440]  All right, what do we want to finish off with?
[3:56:13.440 --> 3:56:14.440]  Let's see, Leanne.
[3:56:14.440 --> 3:56:16.440]  Oh, actually, I wanted to mention this.
[3:56:16.440 --> 3:56:17.440]  It is now official.
[3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:24.440]  The House has joined the Senate in approving the 2017 budget blueprint,
[3:56:24.440 --> 3:56:27.440]  the first step towards dismantling the Affordable Care Act.
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:28.440]  So there you go.
[3:56:28.440 --> 3:56:29.440]  It's now final.
[3:56:29.440 --> 3:56:30.440]  They've held the vote on both sides.
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:32.440]  Nenny-Nenny boo-boo, liberal tears,
[3:56:32.440 --> 3:56:34.440]  will water my garden for the entire year.
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:35.440]  I'm a little bit...
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:37.440]  I saw Rand Paul standing up against that
[3:56:37.440 --> 3:56:41.440]  and just being very disappointed with how much debt
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:45.440]  that is going to levy to the American taxpayer with that budget.
[3:56:45.440 --> 3:56:46.440]  Well, unfortunately...
[3:56:46.440 --> 3:56:48.440]  Maybe we'll talk a little more about that on the nightly news tonight.
[3:56:48.440 --> 3:56:51.440]  Unfortunately, that debt is so out of control
[3:56:51.440 --> 3:56:57.440]  and it's going to take more than just one aspect of government spending
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:56:58.440]  to reel that problem.
[3:56:58.440 --> 3:57:00.440]  Pints of our blood?
[3:57:00.440 --> 3:57:02.440]  20 pints of blood for an anti-Trump protest
[3:57:02.440 --> 3:57:04.440]  that says nothing more than I'm crazy.
[3:57:04.440 --> 3:57:05.440]  Good luck with that.
[3:57:05.440 --> 3:57:09.440]  Hey, wasn't Whoopi Goldberg supposed to leave the country if Donald Trump won?
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:12.440]  Unfortunately, I think she's still here
[3:57:12.440 --> 3:57:15.440]  and she's decided to open her big mouth again.
[3:57:15.440 --> 3:57:19.440]  Whoopi Goldberg isn't here for Kanye West's recent comments,
[3:57:19.440 --> 3:57:21.440]  calls him an idiot boy.
[3:57:21.440 --> 3:57:27.440]  So now Whoopi Goldberg is calling out Kanye West for Trumping while black.
[3:57:27.440 --> 3:57:31.440]  And again, I'm pretty sure Whoopi Goldberg was one of the celebrities
[3:57:31.440 --> 3:57:35.440]  who said they would leave the country if Trump won.
[3:57:35.440 --> 3:57:37.440]  Yeah, there she is right there.
[3:57:37.440 --> 3:57:39.440]  Aw, poor little Whoopi.
[3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:41.440]  I guess things are better in America after all.
[3:57:41.440 --> 3:57:42.440]  What do we do?
[3:57:42.440 --> 3:57:44.440]  Aren't things nice in America after all, Whoopi?
[3:57:44.440 --> 3:57:47.440]  We had Steve Harvey actually just left the Trump Tower
[3:57:47.440 --> 3:57:49.440]  and said he had a great meeting with him
[3:57:49.440 --> 3:57:51.440]  and he thinks that he's a real deal.
[3:57:51.440 --> 3:57:53.440]  So I think there's a lot of people out there
[3:57:53.440 --> 3:57:55.440]  that are not afraid of Trumping while black.
[3:57:55.440 --> 3:57:56.440]  And that's the thing too.
[3:57:56.440 --> 3:57:58.440]  Once people meet Trump and speak to him,
[3:57:58.440 --> 3:57:59.440]  they're like, oh, the meeting was long.
[3:57:59.440 --> 3:58:00.440]  This is actually a nice guy.
[3:58:00.440 --> 3:58:02.440]  Here you go, though, burning memorabilia.
[3:58:02.440 --> 3:58:04.440]  The Chargers are now leaving Chicago.
[3:58:04.440 --> 3:58:07.440]  And what are football fans in San Diego doing?
[3:58:07.440 --> 3:58:09.440]  They're burning all their memorabilia.
[3:58:09.440 --> 3:58:12.440]  These people care more about losing their football team
[3:58:12.440 --> 3:58:15.440]  than losing their country, their freedom, or their future.
[3:58:15.440 --> 3:58:17.440]  This is what needs to change in this country.
[3:58:17.440 --> 3:58:18.440]  Thank you, Leanne.
[3:58:18.440 --> 3:58:19.440]  Thank you, David Knight.
[3:58:19.440 --> 3:58:20.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:58:20.440 --> 3:58:21.440]  Thank you to the entire crew.
[3:58:21.440 --> 3:58:23.440]  The Alex Jones Show will be back next Monday.
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:25.440]  It's Inauguration Week next week, folks.

[3:58:27.440 --> 3:58:30.440]  We'll be back Sunday.
[3:58:30.440 --> 3:58:59.440]  Sunday Show, Sunday Show, Sunday Show.
