[00:00.000 --> 00:19.400]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.840]  Now ladies, one of the biggest, ladies and gentlemen, one of the biggest stories this
[00:42.840 --> 00:54.480]  week has been how the Wuhan lab leak theory was actually correct and the mainstream media
[00:54.480 --> 00:59.240]  that told you that was disinformation told you not to share that, not to spread that,
[00:59.240 --> 01:06.560]  censor you, ban you if you did, all the American news outlets, politicians saying no, it did
[01:06.560 --> 01:13.320]  not come from a laboratory and in fact that's racist for you to say that and Trump is a
[01:13.320 --> 01:19.760]  racist for him to say that and of course they were wrong.
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.600]  Now why are they talking about this now?
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.800]  Is it because China is getting involved with Russia going into Ukraine?
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.720]  Is it because Joe Biden and his family have been caught in many of their criminal enterprises
[01:32.720 --> 01:39.880]  laundering money, 10% for the big guy, foreign influence, blackmail bribery, he just sent
[01:39.880 --> 01:46.280]  a guy to jail who exposed it, he didn't hear about that, did you, I've already, I mean
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.240]  you don't know his name, I think it was Galt, I covered it yesterday, I already forgot the
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.960]  guy's name because they're not talking about it 24 seven on the news, but yeah, a guy that
[01:55.960 --> 02:04.280]  showed Biden's potential foreign business dealings being criminal, Biden had him arrested.
[02:04.280 --> 02:10.560]  Isn't that something and that's a theme by the way that we're going to have today because
[02:10.560 --> 02:17.040]  info wars is the canary in the coal mine.
[02:17.040 --> 02:20.160]  So what they do to Alex Jones, what they do to info wars eventually they'll do to everybody
[02:20.160 --> 02:28.840]  else, but that'll be the theme ongoing, but I want to play a clip for you from April 2022
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.520]  from Anne Applebaum, you want to know how propaganda works folks, this is how it works
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.560]  right here, you want to know how the leftist ideology justifies it, this is all right here.
[02:37.560 --> 02:43.080]  Now today, Anne Applebaum is out supporting the war in Ukraine, supporting the war propaganda
[02:43.080 --> 02:47.960]  for the Atlantic, just like she always does, state sponsored, state run propaganda from
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.160]  Anne Applebaum, but if you want to know how it all works, listen to what she said in April
[02:52.160 --> 02:58.080]  2022, after they all told us the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation, remember
[02:58.080 --> 03:01.920]  that they told you the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation, same people that
[03:01.920 --> 03:09.000]  told you that COVID-19 did not come out of a Wuhan laboratory, same people that told
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.800]  you that told you Hunter Biden's laptop was disinformation, they lied.
[03:13.800 --> 03:21.680]  And here was Anne Applebaum addressing that lie during a question and answer session.
[03:21.680 --> 03:24.800]  Listen to what she says here, it tells you everything.
[03:24.800 --> 03:29.800]  Let's take a, it's amazing, thank you, thank you for doing this, really appreciate it,
[03:29.800 --> 03:32.920]  I'm Daniel Schmidt, I'm a freshman at the University of Chicago.
[03:32.920 --> 03:38.120]  My question is for Ms. Applebaum, so in 2020 you wrote, those who live outside the Fox
[03:38.120 --> 03:42.440]  News bubble do not of course need to learn any of the stuff about Hunter Biden, referring
[03:42.440 --> 03:48.160]  to his laptop, of course, a poll later after that found that if voters knew about the content
[03:48.160 --> 03:52.560]  of the laptop, 16% of Joe Biden voters would have acted differently.
[03:52.560 --> 03:55.800]  Now of course we know a few weeks ago, the New York Times confirmed that the content
[03:55.800 --> 03:56.800]  is real.
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.400]  Do you think the media acted inappropriately when they instantly dismissed Hunter Biden's
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.680]  laptop as Russian disinformation, and what can we learn from that and ensuring that what
[04:05.680 --> 04:11.040]  we label as disinformation is truly disinformation and not reality?
[04:11.040 --> 04:14.840]  My problem with Hunter Biden's laptop is I think totally irrelevant, I mean it's not
[04:14.840 --> 04:21.800]  whether it's disinformation or, I mean I don't think the Hunter Biden's business relationships
[04:21.800 --> 04:26.720]  have anything to do with who should be President of the United States, so I don't find it to
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.880]  be interesting, I mean that would be my problem with that as a major news story.
[04:31.880 --> 04:35.800]  Yeah, you didn't answer the question though, did you?
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.720]  And notice what you said, well it's not about disinformation, it was about it was irrelevant.
[04:39.720 --> 04:43.240]  No it was about it being disinformation, that's what we were told to, that was the lie, that
[04:43.240 --> 04:44.760]  was the point.
[04:44.760 --> 04:48.400]  But see, but there's their attitude, well we don't think the Hunter Biden laptop story
[04:48.400 --> 04:51.800]  is relevant, so we're just going to censor it and make sure nobody sees it.
[04:51.800 --> 04:56.040]  Well 60% of voters that voted for Biden thought it was relevant, so why do you get to decide
[04:56.040 --> 05:01.280]  for them too, huh?
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.880]  book that documents the globals in their own words, planned for our future, that is a hellish
[05:09.880 --> 05:10.880]  future.
[05:10.880 --> 05:14.360]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[05:14.360 --> 05:18.360]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[05:18.360 --> 05:22.520]  Amazon, or infowarshore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.200]  the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of
[05:27.200 --> 05:28.200]  them right now.
[05:28.200 --> 05:33.800]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowarshore.com,
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.720]  and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[05:37.720 --> 05:41.360]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know
[05:41.360 --> 05:43.240]  that you help keep infowars on the air.
[05:43.240 --> 05:46.840]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned
[05:46.840 --> 05:51.800]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com
[05:51.800 --> 05:55.680]  and get a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library
[05:55.680 --> 05:57.920]  or give it to the local school.
[05:57.920 --> 06:05.880]  This is an info war, I'm counting on you to thank you for your support.
[06:05.880 --> 06:13.280]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Owen
[06:13.280 --> 06:17.920]  Troyer, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:17.920 --> 06:23.480]  You know what I got to tell you, it's a real shame that Alex isn't on here right now with
[06:23.480 --> 06:36.800]  us because the theme for today, a lot of the theme for today is going to be how you're
[06:36.800 --> 06:40.360]  not wasting your time here.
[06:40.360 --> 06:44.440]  Are you tuned in every day now to find out how the world really works?
[06:44.440 --> 06:50.080]  Are you sharing these links to the live streams and the reports at banned out video with your
[06:50.080 --> 06:54.120]  friends and family so that they can find out how the world really works?
[06:54.120 --> 06:56.400]  Are you part of the information war yet?
[06:56.400 --> 07:02.640]  Are you becoming a modern day Paul Revere yet?
[07:02.640 --> 07:10.280]  It's not the are you entertained from the gladiator, it's are you not informed?
[07:10.280 --> 07:12.720]  Do you not understand how the world works?
[07:12.720 --> 07:16.880]  Are you not seeing around the corner?
[07:16.880 --> 07:20.240]  Can you tune in here every day?
[07:20.240 --> 07:27.040]  Of course you are, that's why you're here and that's why the tyrants want it shut down.
[07:27.040 --> 07:31.400]  They want that vision around the corner, they don't want you to know so that they can take
[07:31.400 --> 07:34.120]  advantage and leverage it.
[07:34.120 --> 07:37.840]  But that's why we're here.
[07:37.840 --> 07:43.920]  But why do I say I wish Alex was here because on the Joe Rogan podcast with Russell Brand
[07:43.920 --> 07:49.720]  yesterday, which probably is his biggest of the year, I would say, two heavyweights in
[07:49.720 --> 07:55.560]  podcasting right now, Rogan and Brand.
[07:55.560 --> 08:00.080]  One of their topics of discussion was Alex Jones and it wasn't even necessarily Alex
[08:00.080 --> 08:05.880]  Jones, it's just that the phenomenon of the mainstream media lying to you about everything
[08:05.880 --> 08:11.600]  and then now it used to be, you know, next decade's news today or maybe next year's news
[08:11.600 --> 08:17.080]  today, now it's like, I mean, the spiral, the velocity of the news cycle moves so fast
[08:17.080 --> 08:23.840]  now is so tight now where it's just like a couple months or a couple days.
[08:23.840 --> 08:34.920]  So they're discussing that how Alex was ahead of that curve and has been for decades.
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.200]  And look at what Alex and us, you in the audience, look at what we've built here, the mother
[08:39.200 --> 08:51.400]  ship of information and human intelligence for the people, by the people, all of us together.
[08:51.400 --> 08:57.920]  And there were a couple of news stories today that it was like that same phenomenon where
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.200]  we talked about it on Tuesday, on Wednesday, on Thursday, and now here we are Friday and
[09:02.200 --> 09:08.000]  boom, they're now saying it in the mainstream news.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.520]  All kinds of different examples from what's going on in Ukraine to now the lawfare that's
[09:14.520 --> 09:19.600]  about to be launched against Fox News and any other big conservative outlet till they
[09:19.600 --> 09:27.560]  can crush you, just like they did to Info Wars in Alex Jones.
[09:27.560 --> 09:33.040]  And they brag about it now, they don't even hide it.
[09:33.040 --> 09:40.840]  Or maybe we could look over here, you know, two Democrat senators are hospitalized right
[09:40.840 --> 09:41.840]  now.
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.160]  Yeah, can't do their job.
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.640]  Diane Feinstein and John Federman hope they're getting better.
[09:51.640 --> 09:54.120]  But right now it's not good.
[09:54.120 --> 09:55.120]  They're not there.
[09:55.120 --> 09:56.520]  They're in the hospital.
[09:56.520 --> 10:01.080]  And Federman is somehow co-sponsoring bills.
[10:01.080 --> 10:05.120]  The Republicans have demanded proof of life.
[10:05.120 --> 10:11.320]  And the only proof that has been offered is a co-sponsorship of a bill, which they're
[10:11.320 --> 10:17.280]  doubting the legitimacy of as they should.
[10:17.280 --> 10:27.040]  Even Newsweek, even Newsweek has an issue with that.
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.520]  But how about this?
[10:30.520 --> 10:39.800]  I felt some relief because after we had the CPS segment yesterday, that was probably the
[10:39.800 --> 10:47.480]  biggest part of that show yesterday, got shared a lot that moment.
[10:47.480 --> 10:56.360]  In Tennessee, they signed a bill banning drag queen story time for kids and other such things.
[10:56.360 --> 11:03.080]  And I was on the phone with another local reporter talking about following up on this,
[11:03.080 --> 11:09.720]  thinking kind of like how it normally is like, hey, if we don't push the gas on this thing,
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.800]  and if we don't apply the pressure on this thing and stress us this thing all the way,
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.720]  no one else will, because that's how it's been here for Alex Jones and Infowars for
[11:18.720 --> 11:19.720]  so long.
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.840]  And then one of the biggest stories, Tennessee bill banning transgender story time, banning
[11:25.840 --> 11:31.840]  trans youth surgeries.
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.520]  And while I'm still going to do the follow up reporting with this other local reporter
[11:35.520 --> 11:39.920]  here on the issue, it was just such a sense of relief.
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.800]  It's like we really do have good people now that are in the government and are doing the
[11:45.800 --> 11:47.840]  right things that need to be done.
[11:47.840 --> 11:50.440]  It's really happening.
[11:50.440 --> 11:57.480]  And granted, we're playing from behind and with a shortened deck, but we're coming on
[11:57.480 --> 12:02.280]  fast and we're much more skilled and agile than our enemy.
[12:02.280 --> 12:08.600]  They're just a brute force.
[12:08.600 --> 12:15.040]  So we'll be covering that today as well.
[12:15.040 --> 12:19.760]  You've got infrastructure collapsing all around you, a stunning video.
[12:19.760 --> 12:25.160]  And you kind of, again, you're getting this stuff every day, every week, whether it is
[12:25.160 --> 12:32.600]  a man getting shot execution style in the streets of St. Louis in broad daylight with
[12:32.600 --> 12:42.480]  people filming it, just that kind of unreal scenery in our cities.
[12:42.480 --> 12:47.040]  There was a police chase in Baltimore last night.
[12:47.040 --> 12:57.040]  Officers get out of control, skid into a building and the building collapses on the vehicles.
[12:57.040 --> 13:01.480]  Baltimore.
[13:01.480 --> 13:05.720]  We know who runs Baltimore, don't we?
[13:05.720 --> 13:13.000]  We know the old party that runs Baltimore has for so long.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.840]  That's wild stuff.
[13:14.840 --> 13:21.880]  And it's every day, whether it's a massive structure fire, an explosion, a train derailment,
[13:21.880 --> 13:33.760]  plane crash, processing plants, facilities for food, for metal, for energy, it's just
[13:33.760 --> 13:36.600]  every day.
[13:36.600 --> 13:42.080]  And sure, we can sit here and say, this is Biden's America and that's fair, but it's
[13:42.080 --> 13:45.640]  much deeper than that.
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.120]  This problem has been building beneath the surface, but really not even beneath the surface.
[13:50.120 --> 13:53.360]  We've been watching this happen in front of our eyes for decades.
[13:53.360 --> 13:54.360]  We've been watching this.
[13:54.360 --> 14:01.320]  We've been watching U.S. inner cities crumble and collapse right before our very eyes for
[14:01.320 --> 14:04.480]  decades.
[14:04.480 --> 14:13.640]  And now it's just reached the point where it's literally collapsing on top of you.
[14:13.640 --> 14:17.120]  The building is literally on fire, blowing up.
[14:17.120 --> 14:22.520]  The trains are off the tracks.
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.600]  So sure, this is Biden's America, this is Democrat America, and they can try to distract
[14:27.600 --> 14:36.400]  like Gavin Newsom does responding to the bill in Tennessee saying, Tennessee has the eighth
[14:36.400 --> 14:38.840]  highest murder rate in the nation.
[14:38.840 --> 14:45.760]  Well that's funny because we can investigate that and find out that the reason why Tennessee
[14:45.760 --> 14:54.440]  has the eighth highest murder rate is because of Memphis, which is run by Democrats.
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.200]  Should I remind Gavin Newsom of that?
[14:58.200 --> 15:02.720]  And we do have Bob Barnes coming up in the third hour today with big news on the legal
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.640]  front with the vaccine issue, and I also want to cover these bills banning the tranny story
[15:07.640 --> 15:14.240]  time for kids and the chop, the weenie chop for little boys that the liberal progressive
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.040]  Democrats want and probably mandate it if they could.
[15:19.040 --> 15:26.920]  So all of that coming up on the Alex Jones show, but are you not informed?
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.120]  Are you not tuned in here to find out how the world really works?
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.480]  You see, some people don't want you to know how the world really works.
[15:35.480 --> 15:41.360]  That way they can beat you at the game of life and take advantage of you and manipulate
[15:41.360 --> 15:43.560]  and deceive you.
[15:43.560 --> 15:45.560]  And we don't want that to happen to you.
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.840]  And that's why they want to shut down and that's why your support at infowarstore.com
[15:51.840 --> 15:54.840]  is paramount.
[15:54.840 --> 16:01.240]  We'll be right back.
[16:01.240 --> 16:07.040]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infowarstore.com

[16:48.600 --> 16:49.600]  these products.
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.600]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to infowarstore.com right
[16:54.600 --> 17:00.360]  now and get these great info wars products at infowarstore.com.

[17:09.360 --> 17:10.360]  That's the good news.
[17:10.360 --> 17:11.360]  They're amazing.
[17:11.360 --> 17:16.200]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever
[17:16.200 --> 17:19.440]  go to infowarstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.960]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war.
[17:22.960 --> 17:27.880]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[17:27.880 --> 17:33.360]  Think of what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarstore.com
[17:33.360 --> 17:35.280]  and got some of these amazing products.
[17:35.280 --> 17:39.920]  I would recommend Tomb Rink 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the
[17:39.920 --> 17:43.280]  biggest effects so you reorder and see how great it is.
[17:43.280 --> 17:48.160]  Also we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your
[17:48.160 --> 17:53.600]  neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well or real Red Pill Plus.

[18:02.120 --> 18:08.000]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life and info wars for decades has been at the very
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.800]  forefront of the fight for a pro human future.
[18:11.800 --> 18:15.400]  We can't stay on air without your help and I want to thank you all for your past support
[18:15.400 --> 18:19.040]  and I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at infowarstore.com
[18:19.040 --> 18:23.160]  to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[18:23.160 --> 18:27.280]  My bone broth finally sold out for over two years back in stock.

[18:33.480 --> 18:34.480]  critical.

[18:38.040 --> 18:42.040]  all available at in stock ready to ship to you right down infowarstore.com.
[18:42.040 --> 18:46.560]  And the final 1200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World
[18:46.560 --> 18:50.560]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that are exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[18:50.560 --> 18:51.560]  as well.
[18:51.560 --> 18:53.560]  For the first month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have
[18:53.560 --> 18:54.560]  them for sale.
[18:54.560 --> 19:23.560]  And now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[19:23.560 --> 19:36.560]  It was almost as if it were a plan in focus, if you're paying attention.
[19:36.560 --> 19:40.280]  You will always have conspiracy theories, they are nothing but distract.
[19:40.280 --> 19:45.000]  You guys censored Harvard Educator Dockers, you silenced those voices.
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset, but as soon as we start exposing The Great
[19:51.000 --> 20:01.000]  Reset, the soonest seeds from the list are going to prison.
[20:01.000 --> 20:12.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:12.000 --> 20:39.000]  Are you not informed?
[20:39.000 --> 20:59.920]  Do you not understand how the world works?
[20:59.920 --> 21:05.280]  Have you not been informed?
[21:05.280 --> 21:18.960]  I feel like we are having our gladiatorial moment in the media landscape right now.
[21:18.960 --> 21:28.120]  Have you not been informed on this Friday, March 3, 2023, Alex Jones show transmission
[21:28.120 --> 21:39.680]  on Troy filling in, have you not been informed, I feel that this truly is the Info Wars gladiator
[21:39.680 --> 21:48.680]  moment in the middle of the arena, been stabbed, been spit on, been lied about, been set up,
[21:48.680 --> 21:57.560]  been framed, been sabotaged, standing in the middle of the arena saying have you not been
[21:57.560 --> 22:00.560]  informed?
[22:00.560 --> 22:04.400]  Are you not informed?
[22:04.400 --> 22:09.320]  Do you not see how the world works?
[22:09.320 --> 22:17.480]  Have you not had the future foretold for you right here?
[22:17.480 --> 22:24.320]  You have and that's why you're tuned in today and that's why you spread the links to your
[22:24.320 --> 22:30.400]  friends and family and here we are.
[22:30.400 --> 22:35.360]  Now what examples do I want to use?
[22:35.360 --> 22:42.280]  Now I came on the first of the year on this show and I said get ready for major economic
[22:42.280 --> 22:53.320]  distress and a volatile market and things to go down economically and now it's the business
[22:53.320 --> 22:59.720]  insider today, a perfect storm of recession, debt and out of control inflation is coming
[22:59.720 --> 23:04.960]  for markets this year.
[23:04.960 --> 23:09.360]  Remember when we told you that whatever they do to Alex Jones and Info Wars they're going
[23:09.360 --> 23:16.440]  to be doing to you next, first it was the censorship, now it's the lawsuits and we played
[23:16.440 --> 23:22.240]  the video from Robert Forth Reich on Tuesday where he's just bragging about it now, they
[23:22.240 --> 23:27.760]  don't even lie, they don't even hide it, Robert Reich does an entire video and he says our
[23:27.760 --> 23:33.160]  way of ending conservative news, our way of silencing our opposition is to sue them just
[23:33.160 --> 23:39.080]  like we did to Alex Jones, he said that.
[23:39.080 --> 23:43.000]  This isn't even us warning you that's what they want to do anymore, they're doing it
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.960]  and they're celebrating it and they're putting it out as their public blueprint on how to
[23:48.960 --> 23:58.000]  destroy their opposition and silence them, Robert Forth Reich and now Fox News in billion
[23:58.000 --> 24:08.280]  dollar lawsuits, Rupert Murdoch in billion dollar lawsuits and now Nina Djankovic who
[24:08.280 --> 24:18.240]  is an expert they say on disinformation has just announced and is asking for donations
[24:18.240 --> 24:25.320]  for a lawsuit because she got removed from her Department of Homeland Security job which
[24:25.320 --> 24:35.360]  they said didn't even exist, they said we're going to make the disinformation team here
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.000]  and then they launched their secret department and she was in it and they said never mind
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.520]  we're not doing it, it didn't exist and she never worked here and now she's suing and
[24:43.520 --> 24:46.840]  blaming that on Fox News.
[24:46.840 --> 24:52.000]  Now we know that's totally illegitimate, it's all totally illegitimate, it's like Robert
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.720]  Forth Reich said they've found the way to silence their opposition, they have found
[24:56.720 --> 25:03.640]  the way to censor the people they want censored and that is through legal warfare and lawsuits
[25:03.640 --> 25:06.760]  and they know they have enough minions out there to go along with it, they know they
[25:06.760 --> 25:10.480]  have enough brainwashed fools out there to go along with it, they know they got enough
[25:10.480 --> 25:15.480]  bought off judges to go along with it, Soros judges and attorneys to go along with it,
[25:15.480 --> 25:21.640]  so they're just launching it, they're just going full public with it, I told you that
[25:21.640 --> 25:29.040]  was coming, we told you the situation in Ukraine is not what they claim it to be and now we've
[25:29.040 --> 25:35.920]  got the numbers we're going to be going through today from the Council on Foreign Relations,
[25:35.920 --> 25:41.840]  how much aid has the US sent Ukraine, here are six charts, we'll go through those charts,
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.480]  we'll go through those charts, but I'm going to tell you, I don't know how they're going
[25:45.480 --> 25:55.800]  to keep this under wraps, folks, Ukraine is being devastated right now, devastated.
[25:55.800 --> 26:03.440]  And I mean, it's impossible to know specific details because I know we can't trust the
[26:03.440 --> 26:10.920]  mainstream news, I don't trust the US government, but it looks like at this point probably hundreds
[26:10.920 --> 26:18.640]  of thousands of Ukrainians have died, maybe tens of thousands of Russians, again the numbers,
[26:18.640 --> 26:23.800]  it's hard to get real specific numbers or good details, but that's what it's looking
[26:23.800 --> 26:32.000]  like and we're talking about entire Ukrainian cities destroyed and you've got to wonder
[26:32.000 --> 26:43.000]  who's organizing this Ukrainian army, putting their troops, putting their military operations
[26:43.000 --> 26:51.800]  in the middle of critical infrastructure zones and residence zones and community center areas
[26:51.800 --> 27:00.720]  and the Russians just come and mop it all up and then there's nothing left and you know
[27:00.720 --> 27:06.240]  what is even sicker about this and this is why I think at this point my analysis would
[27:06.240 --> 27:12.840]  be Russia is eventually going to, they're going to get to the Nipro River probably next
[27:12.840 --> 27:18.680]  year, I mean it looks like they're accelerating, but I'm still probably thinking next year
[27:18.680 --> 27:23.360]  is when the next big development happens and they'll basically give Zelensky one last
[27:23.360 --> 27:28.160]  out to say resign, move from power and we're going to have an election and then they'll
[27:28.160 --> 27:34.920]  have an election and then a pro-Russian president will be elected if, I mean that'd be the most
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.280]  peaceful route when it gets to that point or they can start, try to get a larger war
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.560]  with Ukraine going, but I don't think that's what the Biden administration actually wants,
[27:42.560 --> 27:51.920]  what I think is going to happen after Ukraine has been properly destroyed, which is what's
[27:51.920 --> 28:00.560]  going to happen after Ukraine has been properly destroyed, BlackRock is going to come in and
[28:00.560 --> 28:09.520]  get $300 billion to rebuild Ukraine of your money.
[28:09.520 --> 28:16.920]  See how it all works, the weapon manufacturers and contractors get paid, the Ukrainian assets
[28:16.920 --> 28:26.560]  and rat holes get funded and then at the bottom line BlackRock the biggest group, the biggest
[28:26.560 --> 28:32.080]  funding group on the planet gets to come in and gets the $100 billion contracts to rebuild
[28:32.080 --> 28:42.320]  Ukraine, that's what's going to happen, so we've got more instances of the theme of
[28:42.320 --> 29:00.560]  the day, Alex Jones was right and other news stories coming up, don't go anywhere.
[29:00.560 --> 29:04.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.800]  book that documents the globals and their own words, planned for our future, that is
[29:08.800 --> 29:15.760]  the hellish future, now you'll be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and
[29:15.760 --> 29:20.360]  the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarshore.com, but you will never be
[29:20.360 --> 29:25.200]  able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and
[29:25.200 --> 29:29.640]  there's about a thousand left of them right now, so get your copy of The Great Reset and

[29:51.720 --> 29:56.200]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give it to the
[29:56.200 --> 30:00.240]  local school, this is an info war, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[30:00.240 --> 30:05.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars has proven itself the last 28 years to be over the globalist
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.960]  target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants and we fund our operation

[30:33.000 --> 30:38.200]  just empower you and enrich your life, but again will keep this broadcast transmitting.

[31:00.040 --> 31:02.120]  I've got some good news.

[31:09.080 --> 31:10.080]  That's the good news.
[31:10.080 --> 31:11.080]  They're amazing.
[31:11.080 --> 31:16.040]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go
[31:16.040 --> 31:19.160]  to infowarshore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[31:19.160 --> 31:22.680]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war.
[31:22.680 --> 31:27.600]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[31:27.600 --> 31:33.080]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarshore.com

[32:02.160 --> 32:08.120]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane
[32:08.120 --> 32:09.120]  place.
[32:09.120 --> 32:10.120]  World War III has already started.
[32:10.120 --> 32:12.640]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[32:12.640 --> 32:13.640]  There's mass censorship.
[32:13.640 --> 32:15.960]  James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas.
[32:15.960 --> 32:18.280]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[32:18.280 --> 32:22.920]  The good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating, it's away.
[32:22.920 --> 32:26.920]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[32:26.920 --> 32:30.440]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for
[32:30.440 --> 32:34.840]  the broadcast and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at infowarshore.com.

[32:57.440 --> 33:26.880]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now
[33:26.880 --> 33:31.240]  your host, Owen Shroyer.
[33:31.240 --> 33:36.360]  What is the American media leaving out of the Ukraine story?
[33:36.360 --> 33:38.800]  What are they not telling you?
[33:38.800 --> 33:41.360]  What are they getting wrong?
[33:41.360 --> 33:42.880]  And why?
[33:42.880 --> 33:48.600]  Well, they're not reporting how devastated Ukraine is right now, they're not devastated
[33:48.600 --> 33:54.520]  the massive destruction of Ukraine, they're not properly covering the massive amount of
[33:54.520 --> 34:04.880]  death that's happened in this war, they're not properly covering the amount of support
[34:04.880 --> 34:09.320]  this war is getting, they want you to think this is a popular war backed by Europe, backed
[34:09.320 --> 34:18.000]  by other countries, it's not, it's not, and they want you to think that you need to be
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.120]  concerned about Ukraine's border and you need to think Vladimir Putin in Russia is the bad
[34:23.120 --> 34:32.720]  guy that we are going after and saving Ukraine from, which is not accurate either.
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.880]  And I don't know if we're quite there yet, but I've been around long enough and I've
[34:37.880 --> 34:45.580]  been the target of censorship, political persecution and prison enough to know what my enemy has
[34:45.580 --> 34:48.360]  planned for me next.
[34:48.360 --> 34:55.000]  And so depending on how this all goes, and I think at this point I'm convinced that they're
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.440]  just going to let Russia probably take Ukraine, destroy Ukraine and then Black Rock come in
[34:59.440 --> 35:03.000]  and build it all up.
[35:03.000 --> 35:11.120]  But if this thing gets more serious and instead of letting Zelensky resign or flying him out
[35:11.120 --> 35:18.680]  of there or saving his ass in about a year from now, and they decide to ramp it up, they
[35:18.680 --> 35:23.360]  will start the Department of Justice, if it's still run by Democrats, that is, if still
[35:23.360 --> 35:26.960]  a Democrat or controlled opposition in the White House and controlled asset in the White
[35:26.960 --> 35:33.800]  House, the Department of Justice, the FBI and others will start rounding up people that
[35:33.800 --> 35:40.160]  they call Russian assets, Russian spies, what have you, and none of it will be accurate.
[35:40.160 --> 35:45.400]  It won't be people that are Russian anything, it'll just be Americans that don't support
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.360]  the war and they'll start rounding them up, arresting them and throwing them in gulags.
[35:50.360 --> 36:00.600]  So we're not quite there yet, but I see that around the corner, 100% being the case.
[36:00.600 --> 36:06.600]  So right now it's like low risk level to cover this war accurately, a year from now might
[36:06.600 --> 36:12.280]  be moderate risk, and then if another Democrat or Biden wins again in 2024, it will be high
[36:12.280 --> 36:22.320]  risk to cover the war in Ukraine and not be fully on board for it and supporting Zelensky.
[36:22.320 --> 36:27.560]  You'll be arrested and called a Russian asset is where I see that going.
[36:27.560 --> 36:29.280]  You think that's crazy?
[36:29.280 --> 36:37.520]  They still have veterans, doctors, parents rotting in jail cells for walking on grass
[36:37.520 --> 36:41.760]  or walking through velvet robes at the Capitol, years of jail time.
[36:41.760 --> 36:47.720]  No, they'll lock up your ass 100% and throw away the key for political purposes.
[36:47.720 --> 36:49.440]  They don't care about you.
[36:49.440 --> 36:52.880]  Your life means nothing.
[36:52.880 --> 36:55.000]  Collateral damage to these tyrants.
[36:55.000 --> 37:02.080]  But let's look at these numbers because when you see it, I think the story hits a little
[37:02.080 --> 37:04.480]  harder.
[37:04.480 --> 37:06.280]  And this is the Council on Foreign Relations.
[37:06.280 --> 37:14.600]  I mean, I'm not telling you the be all end all of truth, but when it comes to a breakdown
[37:14.600 --> 37:23.440]  of the money being spent in Ukraine, I've not found a better resource with the illustrations
[37:23.440 --> 37:26.560]  than this from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.040]  How much aid has the U.S. sent Ukraine?
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.240]  Here are six charts.
[37:32.240 --> 37:37.320]  And let's just review these charts, shall we?
[37:37.320 --> 37:40.000]  Let's start with the first chart here.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.960]  Now again, are these numbers accurate?
[37:42.960 --> 37:45.120]  It's hard to keep track of.
[37:45.120 --> 37:52.320]  And the last time these numbers were updated, this chart that is, was January 15th.
[37:52.320 --> 37:53.960]  So are these numbers accurate?
[37:53.960 --> 37:54.960]  I don't know.
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.240]  There's so much money being thrown over there and weapons and everything.
[37:58.240 --> 37:59.400]  We can't even keep track.
[37:59.400 --> 38:03.480]  There's no oversight, but this is what the Council on Foreign Relations is reporting
[38:03.480 --> 38:05.320]  as of January 15th.
[38:05.320 --> 38:13.520]  Now what do you notice about this little bar graph that we have here where military aid
[38:13.520 --> 38:19.720]  is at $46.6 billion, financial aid is at $26.4 billion, and then what is that tiny little
[38:19.720 --> 38:22.600]  sliver at the top there?
[38:22.600 --> 38:24.360]  Humanitarian aid.
[38:24.360 --> 38:29.400]  Tiny little, little, little humanitarian aid, yeah, it'll give you a little bit.
[38:29.400 --> 38:33.400]  It'll pinch a little off the top for the people.
[38:33.400 --> 38:43.880]  So I mean, you do the math, according to this, it's just shy of $100 billion, and most of
[38:43.880 --> 38:50.360]  it is military aid.
[38:50.360 --> 38:57.200]  So do you think if people saw this graph, they might change their mind?
[38:57.200 --> 39:01.600]  So they're saying total $77 billion as of January 15th, and we know at least another
[39:01.600 --> 39:05.280]  billion has been sent since then.
[39:05.280 --> 39:12.600]  And the vast majority of that military, military, tiny little humanitarian, and then a little
[39:12.600 --> 39:16.960]  just financial, whatever that means, we're just sending them cash, I guess, so that they
[39:16.960 --> 39:24.120]  can pay their pensions, pay their military, you know.
[39:24.120 --> 39:28.200]  And then the smallest little sliver so that they can have food and water, and the biggest
[39:28.200 --> 39:29.200]  being military.
[39:29.200 --> 39:37.760]  So the military industrial complex, they're getting their cut, but you might say, well,
[39:37.760 --> 39:40.240]  how does that stack up though?
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.720]  How does that stack up with aid to other foreign countries?
[39:44.720 --> 39:47.880]  You know, we give plenty of military aid, and we give plenty of aid out to other countries.
[39:47.880 --> 39:48.880]  How does it stack up?
[39:48.880 --> 39:50.440]  Maybe it's not much.
[39:50.440 --> 39:57.640]  Oh, actually, it's quite a bit.
[39:57.640 --> 40:03.160]  U.S. military assistance to Ukraine since the invasion, compared with that to top recipients
[40:03.160 --> 40:13.280]  in 2020, Israel being the top at 3.3 billion, and here's Ukraine since the invasion, military
[40:13.280 --> 40:17.840]  aid, not all the aid, just military aid here, 46 billion.
[40:17.840 --> 40:21.000]  So how does that stack up with aid given to other countries?
[40:21.000 --> 40:31.080]  Well, you can stack them all up together, and it still won't even see the top.
[40:31.080 --> 40:36.040]  That's really going on in Ukraine, but you might say, well, what about the rest of the
[40:36.040 --> 40:37.040]  world though?
[40:37.040 --> 40:39.160]  What about the rest of the world?
[40:39.160 --> 40:40.520]  What about the European countries?
[40:40.520 --> 40:44.360]  The NATO countries, surely they're throwing tens of billions, hundreds of billions of
[40:44.360 --> 40:46.160]  dollars at the situation as well, right?
[40:46.160 --> 40:47.880]  I mean, let's level this out.
[40:47.880 --> 40:48.880]  Wrong-o.
[40:48.880 --> 40:49.880]  Wrong-o.
[40:49.880 --> 41:01.840]  Chart number three, once again, stack up all the aid from every other country on Earth
[41:01.840 --> 41:08.800]  plus the EU as a separate institution, and you still would not equal what the United States
[41:08.800 --> 41:09.800]  has given.
[41:09.800 --> 41:12.040]  Now, is this a victory for capitalism?
[41:12.040 --> 41:16.040]  I'm just wondering for you, liberal leftist Democrats out there that hate capitalism
[41:16.040 --> 41:18.720]  so much, but you love the war in Ukraine.
[41:18.720 --> 41:22.040]  How are you going to fund that war without that capitalism you hate so much?
[41:22.040 --> 41:23.040]  You ever thought of that?
[41:23.040 --> 41:30.360]  Kind of like, how are you going to confiscate our guns without guns, but I'm digressing.
[41:30.360 --> 41:32.360]  So there it is.
[41:32.360 --> 41:33.360]  Nope.
[41:33.360 --> 41:34.360]  Nope.
[41:34.360 --> 41:35.360]  Nope.
[41:35.360 --> 41:36.360]  Nope.
[41:36.360 --> 41:37.640]  You're not getting the support from Europe.
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.960]  You're not getting the support from NATO and NATO countries.
[41:41.960 --> 41:50.440]  EU institutions, that's a nice little whatever that is, EU institutions are heavily supporting
[41:50.440 --> 41:51.840]  it out of Europe, but that's it.
[41:51.840 --> 41:55.160]  That's all you got.
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.160]  The United Kingdom actually supporting more than anybody else, which is odd, and then
[42:00.160 --> 42:03.440]  Poland in there.
[42:03.440 --> 42:04.440]  So nope.
[42:04.440 --> 42:05.440]  Nope.
[42:05.440 --> 42:07.400]  You're not getting the support from Europe.
[42:07.400 --> 42:08.400]  Nope.
[42:08.400 --> 42:09.400]  You're not getting the support from NATO.
[42:09.400 --> 42:12.520]  No, but this war is not popular around the world.
[42:12.520 --> 42:17.920]  No, the world is not getting behind Ukraine.
[42:17.920 --> 42:21.840]  That is not the case.
[42:21.840 --> 42:25.480]  And no, Ukraine is not winning either.
[42:25.480 --> 42:26.880]  Ukraine is losing.
[42:26.880 --> 42:28.800]  Ukraine is being devastated.
[42:28.800 --> 42:31.720]  Ukraine is being destroyed at this rate.
[42:31.720 --> 42:37.960]  If the war keeps up, you're going to have probably at least half a million dead by next
[42:37.960 --> 42:43.920]  year when the Russians get to the Neapro River and surround Kiev and probably offer
[42:43.920 --> 42:46.480]  Zelensky one last chance to stand down.
[42:46.480 --> 42:52.120]  That's if he's still there at that time, which he may decide to get out of there because
[42:52.120 --> 42:54.440]  that might be his last chance.
[42:54.440 --> 42:56.440]  That's what's really going on in Ukraine.
[42:56.440 --> 43:01.440]  Still support it?
[43:01.440 --> 43:07.240]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com
[43:07.240 --> 43:11.040]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[43:11.040 --> 43:13.120]  and your body and keep us on air.
[43:13.120 --> 43:18.320]  I am humbly, head in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many
[43:18.320 --> 43:21.680]  of you for years and never gone to info or store.com.
[43:21.680 --> 43:27.200]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to info or store.com
[43:27.200 --> 43:30.120]  and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[43:30.120 --> 43:33.640]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[43:33.640 --> 43:34.640]  That's great.
[43:34.640 --> 43:35.640]  I thank you.
[43:35.640 --> 43:37.320]  I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
[43:37.320 --> 43:38.320]  Thank you.
[43:38.320 --> 43:39.320]  Thank you.
[43:39.320 --> 43:40.320]  Bye.
[43:40.320 --> 43:41.320]  Bye.
[43:41.320 --> 43:42.320]  Bye.
[43:42.320 --> 43:43.320]  Bye.
[43:43.320 --> 43:44.320]  Bye.
[43:44.320 --> 43:45.320]  Bye.
[43:45.320 --> 43:46.320]  Bye.
[43:46.320 --> 43:50.040]  products, they keep us on air, plus you're missing out on these products. So get off
[43:50.040 --> 43:55.600]  the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to infowarstore.com right now and get
[43:55.600 --> 43:59.040]  these great info wars products at infowarstore.com.
[43:59.040 --> 44:08.080]  Info wars, tomorrow's news today. This is their big move. So yeah, you say, why doesn't
[44:08.080 --> 44:13.560]  Biden address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[44:13.560 --> 44:19.600]  He's not the president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[44:19.600 --> 44:27.280]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand
[44:27.280 --> 44:37.240]  one word, no, no, no. Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to
[44:37.240 --> 44:42.560]  you shutting down our businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you
[44:42.560 --> 44:47.720]  censoring our free speech. We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.440]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three. You're right. We stand against autocrats
[44:52.440 --> 45:21.440]  like you, Joe Biden. And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[45:21.440 --> 45:41.880]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distract. You guys censored
[45:41.880 --> 45:45.240]  Harvard Educator Doctors, you silence those voices.
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.960]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset, but...
[45:48.960 --> 45:52.120]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset,
[45:52.120 --> 45:55.640]  the soon as these globalists start going to prison!
[46:00.640 --> 46:02.560]  I've got some good news.
[46:02.560 --> 46:05.000]  Our high quality supplements really work
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.520]  and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[46:09.520 --> 46:10.360]  That's the good news.
[46:10.360 --> 46:11.480]  They're amazing.
[46:11.480 --> 46:14.640]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less
[46:14.640 --> 46:16.280]  of our actual viewers and listeners
[46:16.280 --> 46:19.640]  ever go to infowarstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[46:19.640 --> 46:21.240]  So you're missing out on these products,
[46:21.240 --> 46:23.040]  plus it funds the info war.
[46:23.040 --> 46:25.440]  Think of what we've done with just 1%
[46:25.440 --> 46:27.960]  of our massive audience actually buying products.
[46:27.960 --> 46:31.480]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence
[46:31.480 --> 46:33.720]  actually went to infowarstore.com
[46:33.720 --> 46:35.600]  and got some of these amazing products.
[46:35.600 --> 46:38.120]  I would recommend Tomb Raek 95 for your joints,
[46:38.120 --> 46:41.320]  your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects.
[46:41.320 --> 46:43.200]  So you reorder and see how great it is.
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.720]  Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil
[46:47.720 --> 46:49.400]  that's so good for your neurological systems,
[46:49.400 --> 46:52.200]  your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[46:52.200 --> 46:53.600]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[46:53.600 --> 46:56.280]  Just go try the product, fund the info war
[46:56.280 --> 46:57.960]  and help us defeat the new order together.
[46:57.960 --> 47:00.000]  infowarstore.com.
[47:01.120 --> 47:03.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[47:03.920 --> 47:11.600]  of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:11.600 --> 47:22.480]  All right, I've got more on the situation in Ukraine,
[47:22.480 --> 47:30.400]  including a familiar name that's involved in all of this.
[47:30.400 --> 47:35.240]  Very suspicious, very suspicious.
[47:35.240 --> 47:39.120]  Alex Vindman?
[47:39.120 --> 47:42.000]  Him again?
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.400]  Not him, no way.
[47:45.400 --> 47:47.400]  Yes, way.
[47:47.400 --> 47:51.080]  I really don't know how the Western media,
[47:51.080 --> 47:53.840]  the Biden administration, is going to keep the story
[47:53.840 --> 47:56.080]  the truth about what's going on in Ukraine under wraps
[47:56.080 --> 47:56.880]  much longer, folks.
[47:56.880 --> 47:58.800]  I really don't.
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.800]  And depending on how aggressive or accelerationist
[48:03.800 --> 48:07.960]  Russia wants to be in this advancement,
[48:07.960 --> 48:10.360]  perhaps will be the ultimate determination.
[48:10.360 --> 48:12.320]  It's not going to be whether they decide to have integrity
[48:12.320 --> 48:14.200]  overnight or not.
[48:14.200 --> 48:15.640]  It's not going to be whether or not
[48:15.640 --> 48:17.880]  they want to support the Biden administration's lies
[48:17.880 --> 48:20.320]  or wars or the military industrial complex or not
[48:20.320 --> 48:21.920]  that they've already decided.
[48:21.920 --> 48:24.080]  It's just going to be a matter of can they possibly
[48:24.080 --> 48:30.640]  keep it under wraps what's really going on in Ukraine?
[48:30.640 --> 48:32.520]  But eventually, the rest of the world
[48:32.520 --> 48:35.000]  is not going to want to carry the weight and carry
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.920]  the water for the corrupt Western media.
[48:36.920 --> 48:38.040]  The rest of the world is not going
[48:38.040 --> 48:40.200]  to want to carry the weight and carry the water for the corrupt
[48:40.200 --> 48:41.720]  Biden administration.
[48:41.720 --> 48:42.960]  They're already sick of it.
[48:42.960 --> 48:45.240]  They're already sick of it in Europe.
[48:45.240 --> 48:46.360]  And they're sick of it elsewhere.
[48:48.840 --> 48:53.520]  And the wildest thing is the ultimate, the final linchpin
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.720]  in this whole deal is the American liberal.
[48:57.720 --> 49:00.760]  As soon as you brainwashed idiots,
[49:00.760 --> 49:04.720]  realize you've been conned, admit you've been lied to,
[49:04.720 --> 49:08.480]  not, oh, Jimmy Kimmel, we didn't know it came out of the lab
[49:08.480 --> 49:10.040]  and we still don't know.
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.000]  And the view, it doesn't matter if it came out of the lab.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.960]  Trump is racist.
[49:15.960 --> 49:25.480]  And the rest of you hacks, it's just unbelievable.
[49:25.480 --> 49:27.120]  You end up being the linchpin that
[49:27.120 --> 49:30.680]  is holding together the very military industrial complex
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.800]  that you claim to hate.
[49:31.800 --> 49:34.160]  You end up being the linchpin that
[49:34.160 --> 49:37.680]  is holding together the big pharmaceutical, big agra,
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.600]  big government, big tech collusion that you claim to hate.
[49:41.600 --> 49:43.800]  You're the linchpin holding it together.
[49:43.800 --> 49:47.760]  And the whole world knows it.
[49:47.760 --> 49:49.800]  And you're just going to have to, I mean,
[49:49.800 --> 49:51.360]  you're never going to accept it, though.
[49:51.360 --> 49:54.080]  You never accepted it when masks didn't work.
[49:54.080 --> 49:57.120]  You never accepted it when Hunter Biden's laptop was real.
[49:57.120 --> 49:59.800]  You never accepted it when the Wuhan lab league theory was
[49:59.800 --> 50:00.360]  true.
[50:00.360 --> 50:02.400]  You'll never accept it.
[50:06.440 --> 50:11.480]  Now, before I get into the latest here out of Ukraine,
[50:11.480 --> 50:13.880]  we are listener supported, and that's how we're
[50:13.880 --> 50:18.360]  able to tell the truth and speak our minds freely.
[50:18.360 --> 50:20.040]  And so thanks to the audience, shopping
[50:20.040 --> 50:21.920]  at infowarstore.com, buying the products.
[50:21.920 --> 50:24.360]  We are still on air today, despite all the censorship.
[50:24.360 --> 50:25.760]  Not many, folks.
[50:25.760 --> 50:28.120]  Not many, if any.
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.040]  Very small handful of people could endure the censorship
[50:32.040 --> 50:35.720]  we've taken and still be here to tell the tale.
[50:35.720 --> 50:38.760]  But more importantly, report the news and the truth every day.
[50:38.760 --> 50:40.360]  Not many.
[50:40.360 --> 50:43.280]  And that is thanks to you in the audience supporting us.

[50:55.400 --> 50:58.880]  when I see them saying it's the greatest CBD full spectrum
[50:58.880 --> 51:01.200]  supplement product they've ever had.

[51:24.760 --> 51:26.120]  that keeps us on the air.

[51:29.240 --> 51:33.880]  click on the Donate tab, and fund us that way as well.
[51:33.880 --> 51:38.560]  Now, this was shared by Jack Pasobek here
[51:38.560 --> 51:43.720]  from the UKWSSC concept briefing.
[51:43.720 --> 51:49.640]  Some slides here, slides 28 and 29.
[51:49.640 --> 51:54.560]  Bottom line, Ukraine needs UKWSSC.
[51:54.560 --> 51:57.120]  And it's just saying, like, Ukraine
[51:57.120 --> 52:00.200]  can't survive without all the support, which is true.
[52:00.200 --> 52:05.480]  And then, what are the points of contact here?
[52:05.480 --> 52:11.520]  Oh, Alex Vindman, CEO Trident International LLC.
[52:11.520 --> 52:15.480]  And that's that little Trident that Zelensky's wearing
[52:15.480 --> 52:17.120]  everywhere?
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.640]  So Zelensky's Trident is tied to Alex Vindman.
[52:21.640 --> 52:30.480]  And the United 24 logo is tied to a Balenciaga designer.
[52:30.480 --> 52:33.520]  That's what's on his sweatshirt that he wears everywhere
[52:33.520 --> 52:36.040]  that they're selling, by the way.
[52:36.040 --> 52:39.280]  You can buy one.
[52:39.280 --> 52:44.240]  Balenciaga, creative, inspired.
[52:44.240 --> 52:49.560]  And Alex Vindman, Trident International, inspired.
[52:49.560 --> 52:52.920]  Or they're all just on the same team.
[52:52.920 --> 52:56.240]  And then, who's Yevgeny Vindman?
[52:56.240 --> 52:58.160]  Well, is there another Vindman now?
[52:58.160 --> 52:59.600]  We've got multiple Vindmans.
[52:59.600 --> 53:01.400]  These Vindmans are running around everywhere.
[53:01.400 --> 53:06.800]  They're like naked mole rats running around foreign policy.
[53:06.800 --> 53:09.720]  Let's not forget it was Alex Vindman.
[53:09.720 --> 53:13.000]  You know, before he was the Democrat whistleblower,
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  before he was the anti-Trump hero,
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.520]  remember, he was offered jobs in Ukraine.
[53:18.520 --> 53:19.880]  Remember that?
[53:19.880 --> 53:24.800]  He was offered jobs in Ukraine for their military.
[53:27.960 --> 53:30.440]  And he thought, you know, it'd probably be safer
[53:30.440 --> 53:33.600]  and more profitable if I just started a business
[53:33.600 --> 53:34.840]  and did work with you guys.
[53:34.840 --> 53:36.640]  Ah, yes.
[53:36.640 --> 53:38.480]  Very smart, Alex.
[53:38.480 --> 53:41.640]  Very wise indeed.
[53:41.640 --> 53:43.640]  And we'll make you a darling of the media.
[53:43.640 --> 53:46.320]  And we'll make you a darling of the Democrat Party.
[53:46.320 --> 53:49.960]  You know, a nice warmonger like us.
[53:49.960 --> 53:52.200]  So now the Vindmans are tied into this, too.
[53:52.200 --> 53:56.160]  Who's all getting paid off in Ukraine right now?
[53:56.160 --> 53:57.960]  How many Republicans and Democrats
[53:57.960 --> 54:00.040]  are getting paid off in Ukraine right now?
[54:00.040 --> 54:01.440]  I know the ones that aren't.
[54:01.440 --> 54:03.000]  It's the ones that want to stop the war
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.200]  and stop funding it, like Marjorie Taylor-Green
[54:07.200 --> 54:10.880]  and Matt Gaetz and others.
[54:10.880 --> 54:13.400]  What about the rest of them?
[54:13.400 --> 54:15.960]  How many people are getting those billions
[54:15.960 --> 54:16.880]  that are going to Ukraine?
[54:16.880 --> 54:18.120]  10% for the big guy?
[54:18.120 --> 54:19.400]  How much is Hunter Biden getting?
[54:19.400 --> 54:20.680]  How much is Vindaman getting?
[54:20.680 --> 54:21.680]  Who's getting paid off?
[54:21.680 --> 54:22.680]  Who's making money?
[54:22.680 --> 54:24.840]  How much is BlackRock going to make in the cleanup
[54:24.840 --> 54:27.120]  and the rebuild?
[54:27.120 --> 54:28.800]  And they don't even hide it, folks.
[54:28.800 --> 54:29.320]  What?
[54:29.320 --> 54:34.320]  We covered it earlier this week or last week.
[54:34.320 --> 54:37.000]  I think it was the Associated Press or MSN.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.840]  The story was vindicated everywhere.
[54:41.840 --> 54:45.080]  The next big project, rebuilding Ukraine.
[54:45.080 --> 54:46.720]  And so they have all these subtle ways
[54:46.720 --> 54:48.040]  of telling you what's really going on
[54:48.040 --> 54:51.320]  without telling you what's really going on.
[54:51.320 --> 54:53.000]  But if you can read between the lines
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.800]  and if you find the right sources of information,
[54:55.800 --> 54:56.640]  you figure it out.
[54:56.640 --> 54:58.520]  It's like, oh, oh, I get it.
[54:58.520 --> 54:59.720]  I get it.
[54:59.720 --> 55:03.320]  Send all the weapons into Ukraine.
[55:03.320 --> 55:04.920]  Start the war in Ukraine.
[55:04.920 --> 55:07.360]  Destroy Ukraine.
[55:07.360 --> 55:09.880]  And then come in and rebuild afterwards.
[55:09.880 --> 55:12.480]  Brilliant, brilliant.
[55:12.480 --> 55:16.360]  The Pied Piper of the military industrial complex.
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.120]  Or kind of like, let's fund, gain a function research
[55:20.120 --> 55:21.800]  in a laboratory.
[55:21.800 --> 55:25.280]  And let's have the virus leak from the lab
[55:25.280 --> 55:26.560]  and then get a bunch of people sick.
[55:26.560 --> 55:28.840]  And then with the media that we own and control,
[55:28.840 --> 55:30.840]  we'll have them build it up to be the biggest story,
[55:30.840 --> 55:31.400]  the pandemic.
[55:31.400 --> 55:33.200]  And then with the media we own and control,
[55:33.200 --> 55:37.320]  we'll tell everybody to take our vaccine.
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.240]  And then with the government we own and control,
[55:39.240 --> 55:41.600]  we'll force them to buy our vaccine
[55:41.600 --> 55:45.160]  so that it's quote unquote, free.
[55:45.160 --> 55:48.040]  Oh, the big pharmaceutical industrial complex.
[55:48.040 --> 55:50.760]  Works just like the military industrial complex.
[55:50.760 --> 55:52.920]  And do they care how many people die?
[55:52.920 --> 55:56.480]  No, as long as they get filthy rich.
[55:56.480 --> 55:57.440]  And they do.
[55:57.440 --> 56:00.280]  More money going into Ukraine now, more than ever.
[56:00.280 --> 56:03.280]  More money into big pharmaceutical and their vaccines
[56:03.280 --> 56:04.200]  now, more than ever.
[56:06.680 --> 56:08.400]  Who's still falling for this crap?
[56:08.400 --> 56:09.800]  I'm telling you, I don't know how they're
[56:09.800 --> 56:12.000]  going to keep this under wraps, though.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.880]  NBC reporter goes to Crimea, shocks viewers
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.320]  by telling the truth and how everyone in Crimea
[56:18.320 --> 56:20.080]  is pro-Russia, anti-Zelensky.
[56:20.080 --> 56:21.360]  I mean, you can't say everybody.
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.480]  But it's like going to East Palestine, Ohio,
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.760]  and asking people about Biden or Trump.
[56:29.760 --> 56:36.520]  Going to be a pretty obvious majority response there.
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.480]  Yeah, you go to Crimea.
[56:37.480 --> 56:40.120]  Yeah, you go to Eastern Ukraine.
[56:40.120 --> 56:42.160]  Yeah, you go to Northern Ukraine.
[56:42.160 --> 56:43.240]  Yeah, you talk to people.
[56:43.240 --> 56:45.040]  It's going to be pretty obvious how they
[56:45.040 --> 56:47.440]  feel about the situation.
[56:47.440 --> 56:52.400]  And it's not the way you think.
[56:52.400 --> 56:55.040]  No, it's not.
[56:55.040 --> 56:57.160]  NBC reporter goes to Crimea, shocks viewers
[56:57.160 --> 56:59.360]  by telling the truth.
[56:59.360 --> 57:02.520]  Mainstream media correspondence for major US networks
[57:02.520 --> 57:04.560]  rarely, if ever, report from inside Crimea
[57:04.560 --> 57:06.920]  and certainly are nowhere near Russian held territory
[57:06.920 --> 57:08.160]  in Eastern Ukraine.
[57:08.160 --> 57:12.360]  Patrick Lancaster is, though, reporting the truth there.
[57:12.360 --> 57:14.600]  However, this week, NBC News' chief international
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.080]  correspondent Kier Simmons went to Sevastopol,
[57:18.080 --> 57:20.640]  surrounded by a significant Russian military presence,
[57:20.640 --> 57:24.440]  given it is home to Russia's navy's Black Sea fleet.
[57:24.440 --> 57:27.560]  And a live segment admitted that it's not all realistic,
[57:27.560 --> 57:29.760]  at all realistic, that Zelensky and Ukraine forces
[57:29.760 --> 57:31.480]  can ever hope to take Crimea.
[57:31.480 --> 57:34.800]  And probably never Eastern Ukraine either.
[57:34.800 --> 57:36.960]  You've been lied to by your media.
[57:36.960 --> 57:39.640]  Zelensky is not the media darling in Ukraine.
[57:39.640 --> 57:40.520]  He is in the West.
[57:40.520 --> 57:41.360]  He's not the hero.
[57:41.360 --> 57:44.400]  He is in Ukraine, as he is here in the West.
[57:44.400 --> 57:47.400]  And the people there, actually, are mostly pro-Russia,
[57:47.400 --> 57:50.040]  pro-Putin at this point.
[57:50.040 --> 57:52.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset
[57:52.520 --> 57:54.560]  and the War for the World, is a historic book
[57:54.560 --> 57:56.760]  that documents the global to their own words,
[57:56.760 --> 57:59.760]  planned for our future, that is the hellish future.
[57:59.760 --> 58:02.000]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books,
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.320]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[58:03.320 --> 58:05.400]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset
[58:05.400 --> 58:07.840]  and the War for the World, at bookstores, Amazon,
[58:07.840 --> 58:09.160]  or infowarsore.com.
[58:09.160 --> 58:11.480]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy
[58:11.480 --> 58:14.760]  of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[58:14.760 --> 58:17.280]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[58:17.280 --> 58:19.200]  So get your copy of The Great Reset
[58:19.200 --> 58:22.680]  and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowarsore.com.
[58:22.680 --> 58:25.520]  And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser
[58:25.520 --> 58:26.640]  to keep us on the air.
[58:26.640 --> 58:28.840]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[58:28.840 --> 58:30.480]  and this powerful book, you'll also know
[58:30.480 --> 58:32.520]  that you help keep infowars on the air.
[58:32.520 --> 58:33.800]  I'm gonna thank those of you that have gotten
[58:33.800 --> 58:36.440]  signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies.
[58:36.440 --> 58:39.360]  But I wanna encourage all of you who haven't yet
[58:39.360 --> 58:42.080]  to go to infowarsore.com and get a signed copy
[58:42.080 --> 58:43.600]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[58:43.600 --> 58:46.800]  and donate it to the library or give it to the local school.
[58:46.800 --> 58:48.600]  This is an info war, I'm counting on you
[58:48.600 --> 58:50.120]  and thank you for your support.
[58:51.800 --> 58:56.440]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023
[58:56.440 --> 58:58.240]  and the world is an insane place.
[58:58.240 --> 58:59.960]  World War III has already started.
[58:59.960 --> 59:02.320]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[59:02.320 --> 59:03.440]  There's mass censorship.
[59:03.440 --> 59:05.640]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[59:05.640 --> 59:07.920]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[59:07.920 --> 59:09.200]  But the good things that are happening
[59:09.200 --> 59:12.560]  is humanity is really accelerating, it's away.
[59:12.560 --> 59:15.320]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack
[59:15.320 --> 59:16.480]  by the establishment than ever.
[59:16.480 --> 59:18.960]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word
[59:18.960 --> 59:21.120]  about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast,
[59:21.120 --> 59:22.720]  and to keep the broadcast on the air
[59:22.720 --> 59:24.880]  by getting great products at infowarsore.com.
[59:24.880 --> 59:26.440]  And whether it's a final signed copy,
[59:26.440 --> 59:27.600]  they're almost all sold out,
[59:27.600 --> 59:28.960]  with a great reset in the world,
[59:28.960 --> 59:30.760]  or ultimate bone broth, finally back in stock
[59:30.760 --> 59:33.600]  after over two years, it's all available at infowarsore.com.
[59:33.600 --> 59:35.280]  These are truly amazing products.

[59:38.400 --> 59:41.480]  and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[59:41.480 --> 59:44.120]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air,
[59:44.120 --> 59:46.400]  so please take action now at infowarsore.
[59:46.400 --> 59:48.360]  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[59:52.880 --> 59:55.400]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[59:55.400 --> 01:00:01.400]  you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.000]  I've been through the desert on a worst-of-own day,
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.280]  and felt good to be no more.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.240]  Headline from the Micey's Institute.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.040]  One year later in Ukraine,
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:16.560]  Washington and NATO got it very wrong.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.920]  Or have they just been lying to you?
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.080]  Or have they just been lying to you?
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.520]  Now, again, infowars, Alex Jones,
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.400]  the Canary in the coal mine, what they do to us,
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.040]  they're going to do to you next.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:36.080]  And I'll just give you this little advanced warning, too.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.680]  They want to put you in jail next and in prison you next.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.480]  So, but we won't expand into that.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.440]  Surely you understand that.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.840]  They've done that to me.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.520]  So just as a warning, but infowars was the hottest thing
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:54.040]  on the internet, and live streaming on the internet,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.840]  obviously a big source of information
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.760]  at some of the biggest watched shows and commentaries
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.760]  there now, specifically YouTube.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.240]  And when Alex Jones was there and infowars was there,
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.720]  we were the top dog.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.160]  I mean, who knows where our numbers would be now
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.240]  if we were still there five years after the ban hammer.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.440]  But what's the phenomenon for cable news?
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.280]  Well, it's Fox.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.880]  Fox dominates the ratings.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.400]  And it's not just Fox News, by the way, it's Fox Business.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.080]  Fox Business dominates as Kudlow celebrates one year
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.440]  as number one business program on cable news.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.280]  So Fox is just dominating the cable news rankings.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.640]  And so they have to be stopped, and they have to be shut down,
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]  and they have to be sued.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.680]  Now, we played the Robert Forthreich video earlier this week
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.840]  where he's telling you their plan.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.240]  They don't hide it anymore.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.360]  They don't even subtly lie about it anymore.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.080]  Like, we need to censure them because of this, that,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.280]  they just say, hey, we just want to censure them.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.240]  They're our political opposition.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.640]  And we're telling you they're bad guys.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.840]  We just need them off the air.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840]  We just need to censure them.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.320]  And you know what?
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.600]  We don't know how to do this because of the First Amendment.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.640]  But we've got law fair and legal fair.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.400]  We can just crush these people with legal bills and lawsuits
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:07.880]  and everything.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.680]  And we've got billions of dollars on our side.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.800]  We're good lefties with our good billionaire capitalist
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.240]  friends that fund everything we do.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.840]  Or, I mean, communist friends.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.760]  And so we don't need to care about money.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.400]  We can sue all these people, shut them down,
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.440]  and it's not even our money.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.120]  It's great.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.480]  Robert Reich even told you that.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.200]  And now it's happening.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.960]  And now they're going after Fox.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:38.480]  And now it's Nina Jankiewicz, Nina Jankiewicz
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.560]  asking for donations for a lawsuit
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.440]  because she lost her job at the Department of Homeland
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.960]  Security that they claim she never had and didn't exist.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.320]  And now she's suing Fox News.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.560]  And she wants your money to do it.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.880]  The blood is in the water.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.640]  Here it is, Nina Jankiewicz.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.520]  My name is Nina Jankiewicz.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.360]  I'm asking for your financial support of a lawsuit
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.560]  I want to bring against Fox News for their malicious,
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.520]  reckless lies against me.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.360]  A year ago today, I realized a lifelong dream
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.360]  and entered public service as a US government official.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.800]  A lifelong dream.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.400]  I spent the better part of a decade
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.320]  working on both sides of the aisle
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.240]  to counter disinformation.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.120]  I've published two books.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.160]  And I've always been an advocate for free expression.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:29.720]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.160]  The main thesis of my work is we can't fight disinformation
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.840]  simply by removing content or restricting speech.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.280]  On March 2nd, 2022, I began a job leading a new entity
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.200]  within the Department of Homeland Security
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.200]  which they said didn't exist.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.920]  called the Disinformation Governance Board.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920]  And they said it didn't exist.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.480]  My role was to make sure different entities across DHS
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.640]  were coordinated to bring the latest research to bear
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.520]  in the department.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.200]  Against conservatives.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.680]  And to help the department ensure
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.200]  that its policies about its existing
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.560]  counter disinformation work were grounded in American values.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.160]  Privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.280]  That's all the board was.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.360]  It didn't have the ability or the authority
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.960]  to act on its own.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.880]  After my position was announced, baseless claims
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.600]  that the board was an Orwellian Ministry of Truth
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.360]  and I was President Biden's chief censor spread,
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.000]  even though the board had nothing
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.840]  to do with arbitrating or disrespecting.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.440]  This is truly incredible stuff.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.120]  We'll continue this on the other side.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.880]  So remember, it was reported that the Disinformation
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.880]  Board didn't exist.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.520]  They said, nope, it doesn't exist.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.880]  It's not real.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:47.920]  Now she's using its existence to fund a lawsuit
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.880]  against people that claimed it didn't exist.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.160]  I don't exist.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:55.840]  I'm not real.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.280]  But by the way, I'm suing Fox News.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.400]  Please help me.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.800]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.520]  that have gone to info or store.com
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.040]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life,
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.160]  that empower your immune system and your body,
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.320]  and keep us on air.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.800]  I am humbly, had in hand, talking to the viewers
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.720]  and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.760]  and never gone to info or store.com.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.240]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.400]  never actually go to info or store.com
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.200]  and never experienced these great products
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.600]  and never found the operation.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.440]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article,
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.640]  you tell folks about the show.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.000]  That's great, and I thank you.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.520]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.320]  Plus, we've got really great products
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.760]  that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.840]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.920]  and our nitric oxide and our real red pill.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.040]  Plus, all of these are really great products
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:46.920]  that keep us on air.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.640]  Plus, you're missing out on these products.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.720]  So get off the bench, get in the game,
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.600]  step to the plate, and go to infoorstore.com right now
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.880]  and get these great info or products at infoorstore.com.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:18.680]  Hi, I'm Nina Jakowicz, and I never
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.400]  worked for any US government position about disinformation.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.440]  It never existed.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.120]  And anybody reporting that it existed
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.400]  lied to you like Fox News.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:36.080]  And so now I'm suing Fox News for reporting on my position
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.760]  at the Department of Justice.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:46.120]  And they're reporting costing me my job that didn't exist.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.160]  So Fox News lied when they said I worked there
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.560]  to disinformation bureaucracy.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.720]  And that cost me my job at the disinformation bureaucracy,
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.760]  which never existed.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.560]  And so now I'm suing them for getting
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.080]  me fired for my job that didn't exist.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.880]  Guys, why did you stop the music?
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.920]  The show's not over.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.640]  We're still in this.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.000]  What the?
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.440]  Hi, I'm Nina Jakowicz.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.280]  Fox News lied when they told you that the Biden administration
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.520]  had a disinformation bureaucracy
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.360]  and that I worked there.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.240]  It never existed.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.240]  And now because of Fox News' reporting,
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.840]  I've lost my job at the disinformation bureaucracy.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.480]  And so I'm suing Fox News for costing my job,
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.760]  working as a disinformation expert for the Bidens
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.600]  at a federal bureaucracy, none of which ever existed,
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.080]  by the way.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.800]  Are you feeling the Twilight Zone effect yet?
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.320]  Are your eyes wide open?
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.560]  Are you spinning in confusion at all of this?
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.440]  This is so ridiculous.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.120]  But what is it really all about?
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.520]  They don't care that they lie to you.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.320]  They don't care that they know that we know
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.480]  that they're lying to us.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.520]  That's the point in the social contract
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.520]  that we've reached now.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.000]  That's the point in this social exchange
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.560]  that we've reached now.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.600]  They know they're lying.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.480]  We know they're lying.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.760]  They know we know they're lying.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.680]  And they lie anyway.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.160]  But we know what this is really all about.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.160]  It's not about Nina Jankiewicz and her job or whatever.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.480]  It's about them suing to get all their political opposition
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.240]  off the air.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.400]  Now they wish they could be like Vladimir Zelensky
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.760]  and just act like a dictator and shut down
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.720]  political opposition media.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.640]  That's what Zelensky did in Ukraine,
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.440]  backed by the Democrats.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.720]  They can't do this here because we
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.800]  have this pesky First Amendment that they hate so much.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.320]  So as Robert Fourth Reich said, we showed you the video.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.840]  And we should probably just put it up
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.920]  just so people can see it.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.280]  But he tweeted it out himself.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:57.880]  You can go find it.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.800]  It is a whole breakdown.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.000]  And he uses the Alex Jones Info Wars example of, hey, look,
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.280]  we can crush free speech.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.520]  Look, we can crush media operations we don't like.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.760]  All we have to do is sue them.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.760]  And we own the judges.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.800]  And we own the juries.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.760]  And we own the attorneys.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.880]  So it's all good, baby.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.000]  It's all in the bag.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.080]  It's a kangaroo court.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.440]  It's a rigged trial.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.080]  We got this.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.520]  All we got to do is sue now.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.920]  The message has been sent out and received.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.720]  The message has been sent out and received.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.200]  Doesn't matter if you have a case or not.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.040]  Sue your political opposition for billions of dollars.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.320]  Doesn't matter how outrageous.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.480]  Doesn't matter evidence or lack thereof, case or lack thereof.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.120]  Just do it.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.640]  And we're going to win the whole thing's rigged.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.960]  And it's Robert Reich admitting it all.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.000]  And now Nina Jankiewicz is in on the party.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.720]  Scary Poppins.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.200]  Nina Jankiewicz is crowdfunding to Sioux Fox News.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.400]  Must be nice.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.960]  The blood is in the water now, folks.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.120]  The sharks are active.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.320]  And I can just tell you, this is how it works from firsthand
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:11.120]  experience, which if this is what happens to me,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.200]  I'm imagining it's 10 times, 100 times this, at levels above
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.120]  me, where when some of this lawsuit stuff was happening
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.960]  with Alex Jones and InfoWars, and I was involved in some of it,
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.240]  and people were writing stories about InfoWars having
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.720]  all this money, and people started writing stories about me
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.880]  having all this money.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.800]  And it doesn't matter that we got entirely stripped down,
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.680]  and our financials gone through, electronic records,
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.120]  everything.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.200]  I mean, they did a full probe of all of us, folks.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.360]  You know what these people are like.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.400]  I don't have to explain what they wanted to find,
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.760]  and how desperate they were to find it.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.160]  Now, they didn't find any of it.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.920]  That's why they are so crazy now,
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.680]  because they didn't find any of this stuff
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.240]  that they were looking for, and everything they told you
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.040]  about us was alive.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.560]  But what I'm saying is, and this happens every time,
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.800]  when there's a lawsuit, but more specifically,
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.320]  when these numbers come out, and they say,
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.480]  we're going to sue Alex Jones for a trillion dollars,
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.240]  and they write stories talking about hundreds of billions
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.520]  of dollars that InfoWars has.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:15.600]  And I get people that will message me asking for money.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.800]  Like, hey, I heard you got millions of dollars.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.280]  I heard you got a bunch of money.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:19.840]  Can we get it?
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.720]  I need some money.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.600]  I need some money for this.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.360]  I need some money.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.000]  I don't have millions of dollars.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.080]  And if you actually looked into it, you'd find that out.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.840]  But it's like blood in the water.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.560]  After those lawsuits, I got like three, four other lawsuits
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.840]  dropped on my desk, dropped off at my house,
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.840]  not even kidding you, such egregious lawsuits
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.040]  that judges just toss them out.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.920]  They're not even real.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.000]  It's like, that's how eerie it is.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.760]  People are like, hey, you got millions of dollars.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.400]  Let me get some money for this.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.800]  No?
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.800]  Ooh, ooh, Shroyer's getting sued and all these suits.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.720]  Oh, I'm going to sue him too.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.760]  I'm going to get some of that.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.440]  I'm going to get some of that, Jack.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.680]  And then the judge just tosses it out.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.840]  It's like, it's not even real.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.560]  Blood in the water, it's like chum for sharks, folks.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.240]  And so the chum is in the water now,
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.200]  the shark-infested waters now.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.160]  So now everybody's going to be suing Fox News.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.600]  It's not going to stop at Nina Jankiewicz.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.240]  It's not going to stop at Dominion.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.480]  It's not going to stop at any single host.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.240]  It's going to go everywhere.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.400]  As usual, Infowars, Alex Jones, the Canary, and the coal mine.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.480]  So we've just been warning you.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.040]  Once again, next year's news today,
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.760]  next year's next decade's news today, this is what's coming.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.880]  And the next level after this is imprisonment.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:58.280]  Censorship, financial attacks, imprisonment.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.960]  So you don't have a voice to defend yourself.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.720]  You don't have the capital to defend yourself.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:09.680]  Then you can't defend yourself, prison.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.440]  That's their strategy.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.960]  We're just a test case because we
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.520]  climb over the barbed wire to get to the necks of these
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.640]  tyrants politically before anybody else.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.680]  And you see, that's the big aspect of this.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:30.840]  And again, I try different ways to impart this to the people.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:37.720]  But you look at the video from last week in East Palestine
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.360]  with Savannah Hernandez when she goes up and confronts
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.080]  Pete Booty, Judge.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.520]  Now, of course, Savannah Hernandez
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.680]  started here at Infowars.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:50.040]  I'm very proud that that's where she first worked
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.160]  and learned how to do this job properly.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.120]  Because here's the mindset that all these yuppies
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.400]  and guppies in the media have.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.960]  Oh, my gosh, it's Pete Booty, Judge.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.000]  Oh, oh, I need to have class.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.080]  I need to have respect.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.400]  I need to have decorum.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.720]  No, you don't.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.480]  You owe Pete Booty, Judge.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.480]  Nothing.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.280]  He is not your king.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.120]  He is not your daddy.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.520]  He is not your boss.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.360]  And it's all changing now, folks.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.400]  Because guess what people are realizing, huh?
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.800]  That's the kind of coverage that works.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.640]  That's the kind of activism that works.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.160]  So this whole mentality is about to change, folks,
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.400]  because it's not just going to be Infowars and Alex Jones
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.240]  under the attack.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.280]  They're coming after everybody now.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:54.000]  So yeah, Pete Booty, Judge doesn't deserve decorum.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.600]  When he shows up in East Palestine three weeks after the event
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.160]  for a photo op, and his press secretary says,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.840]  please put your cameras away.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.600]  We don't want to answer questions.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.760]  Well, then what are you doing here?
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.440]  But this whole notion is going away, folks.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.920]  And I'm telling you, it used to be, oh, we
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.520]  don't want to do news coverage like that.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.600]  We don't want to do that.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.720]  We here at this organization, we're not like that.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.520]  We don't do this.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.680]  We don't do that.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.200]  It's all done.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.560]  That whole notion is going away, because now that they're
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.120]  under attack, they understand, oh, OK.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.240]  Gloves are off.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.720]  You guys are playing for keeps.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.320]  Decorum, respect, honor, integrity?
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.200]  No.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.400]  They're playing for keeps.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.280]  This is how it's going to go.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.840]  But you know what their response is going to be.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.080]  Sue, censor, and imprison.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.600]  But we're ahead of their plan.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.640]  We see it all now.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.280]  and the War for the World, is a historic book that
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.360]  documents the globals in their own words,
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.880]  playing for our future.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.320]  That is a hellish future.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.600]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books,
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.880]  I guess, they're starting to ban them,
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.960]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.400]  and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon,
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.720]  or info.orgshore.com.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.040]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.320]  of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.880]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.280]  a signed copy at info.orgshore.com.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.080]  And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.200]  to keep us on the air.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.400]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.240]  and this powerful book.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.800]  You'll also know that you help keep info words on the air.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.960]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:46.080]  of the book or unsigned copies.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.960]  I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.680]  to go to info.orgshore.com and get a signed copy
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.200]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.400]  and donate it to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400]  This is an info war.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.240]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars has proven itself
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.880]  the last 28 years to be over the globalist target
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.640]  and having the biggest effect out there
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:07.720]  against those tyrants.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.000]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners support
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.160]  while selling you great products at the same time.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.320]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.720]  who have supported us over the years
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.280]  by spreading the word, praying for the broadcast
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280]  and buying product.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.920]  But I really want to encourage those of you
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.960]  that have been on the fence and never actually gone
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.800]  to info.orgshore.com to go there and get the great books
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.760]  and films and supplements and survival gear that's there
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.200]  that won't just empower you and enrich your life

[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.800]  So whether it's real red pill plus
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.080]  or super high quality CBD oil or the 50% off
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.080]  or a great physio magnesium product

[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.920]  of our actual viewers and listeners
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.440]  ever go to info.orgshore.com

[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.280]  Or real Red Bull Plus.

[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.840]  your destiny, our children's destiny.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.240]  And that war is something that we can win
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.200]  but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.240]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully

[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:09.800]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:45.440]  Yeah, remember when the Department of Justice,
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.760]  the FBI came after me and a judge said,
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.720]  well, how are you doing this?
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.960]  He's a journalist.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.400]  This is violating Obama's rule
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.880]  and protection for journalists and they didn't care.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:03.120]  But see, they're throwing the chum in the water now.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.160]  Trump can be sued for January 6th riot harm,
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.280]  Justice Department says.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.200]  The Justice Department might as well take a neon sign
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.880]  or no, you know what, they can do better than that, actually.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.520]  They should take a gigantic blimp,
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.520]  maybe one of those Chinese spy balloons,
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.480]  get a nice big Chinese spy balloon sized blimp
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.640]  and put a huge sign on it that says,
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.600]  Sue Trump, we have your back, signed Justice Department.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.680]  They're just begging for people to,
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.760]  they're throwing the chum in the water.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.040]  Infowars was the test, Infowars was the start,
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.520]  a stress test, a pressure test of their control.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.280]  How much do they control the courts?
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.960]  How much do they control the media?
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.880]  How much can they control juries, attorneys?
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.640]  And what did they get?
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.440]  They got the outrageous results
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.600]  in the Alex Jones Infowars cases
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.920]  and people are still trying to sue and come after us.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.640]  So, oh, okay, this is what we can do.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:04.440]  Now let's get Trump, now let's get Fox News
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.120]  and they're throwing the chum in the water.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.960]  They're waving the flag, they're putting the neon sign out.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.400]  Sue them, sue Fox News, sue Donald Trump,
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.760]  we'll shut them down just like Alex Jones.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.360]  We'll get them too.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.520]  And you're a little dog too.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.320]  And then they come after for Alex's cat
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.600]  and your little cat Lu Shu too.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.480]  Trump, the Associated Press, I mean, are you kidding me?
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.480]  The Associated Press, please sue Donald Trump.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.840]  Please just sue the man, sue him so badly.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.400]  Trump can be sued for January 6th,
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.240]  Ryan Harman, Justice Department says, that's great.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.360]  I wanna see this precedent applied equally.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.200]  That's what I'd like.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.080]  I'd like to see this get applied equally.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.120]  But again, they've stress tested their control over all of it.
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.200]  If Trump can be sued for the January 6th, Ryan Harman,
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.960]  then how much can CNN, MSNBC, ABC, Democrats
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.320]  be sued for the George Floyd riots?
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.840]  What about the hundreds of police officers
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.880]  hospitalized during those riots?
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.200]  What about the ambushes and the murders of police officers
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.560]  because of all the anti-police rhetoric on television
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.560]  and in the Democrat Party?
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.720]  Can they be sued?
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.480]  Can we get a little equal application here?
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.880]  Can we get a little logical consistency here?
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.560]  Imagine that applied equally.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.760]  What about all the Trump supporters
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:37.440]  that have been assaulted over the years, like yours truly?
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.000]  Can we sue because of the lies told about us?
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.440]  Do we get to take advantage of this?
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.960]  No, this is nothing about justice.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.080]  This is all about them waving the flag.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.760]  We own the legal system.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.360]  We own the juries.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.080]  We own the attorneys.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.640]  We own everything.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.880]  Go for them.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.120]  Green light, chum in the water, eat them up.
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.000]  They're protected.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.800]  Democrat, liberal privilege, they're protected.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.280]  And they will do everything they can
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.320]  to help your case against their political opposition.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.160]  And they're waving the flag,
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.040]  putting up the neon light in the sky,
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.160]  sue, sue, sue, we've got your back.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.560]  While they protect their own,
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:35.120]  Attorney General Merrick Garland overruled FBI agents
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.560]  who wanted to close Trump document probe,
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.160]  approve the Mar-a-Lago raid.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.560]  I'm telling you, there's a little bit of a,
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.360]  we'll call it a cold civil war, if you will,
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.440]  inside a lot of these federal bureaucracies.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.320]  Not everybody at the FBI is a corrupt criminal.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.640]  Not everybody at the FBI is a Democrat,
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.040]  but I repeat myself.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.200]  And so when agents are like,
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.880]  look, hey, we need to stop this.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.720]  There's nothing there.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.560]  There's no case.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]  Garland says, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.920]  We're going after Trump, don't you know?
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.880]  It's a green light.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.720]  It's political persecution time.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.880]  It's takeover time.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.520]  Go in for the raid.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.000]  And so they did it.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.840]  And then you saw Garland squirming around
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.280]  like a grub worm during the hearings.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.720]  Whistleblower reveals how the corrupt FBI
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.760]  is using a threat tag to target pro-lifers
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.960]  as domestic threats.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.760]  FBI retaliated by suspending him.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.520]  Yeah, they're targeting Christians, conservatives.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.320]  Same thing with the IRS.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.680]  Pentagon Inspector General, Joe Biden
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.720]  is hiding classified documents detailing side deals
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.320]  he made with Taliban and against US troops.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.520]  Oh, is that why he had all those secret documents
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.560]  stashed all over the United States?
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.800]  But he had no idea.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.040]  How did they get there?
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.440]  That's not mine, baby.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.880]  I'm just clueless, stupid old Joe.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.400]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.800]  But don't worry, the deep state will protect me.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.480]  And then when there's a whistleblower
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.560]  in Israeli Professor Whistleblower
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.240]  who turns over evidence of Joe Biden's
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.160]  potential crimes overseas,
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.040]  Joe Biden has him arrested and locked up.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.760]  FEC complaint filed over squad member
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.840]  Corey Bush's private security payments to husband.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.760]  Nice, nice.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.000]  The squad keeps paying off their people.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.080]  Ilhan Omar pays off her family.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.320]  Corey Bush pays off her family.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.640]  AOC pays off her family.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.960]  That's amazing, that's amazing.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.200]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars even.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.640]  Millions, probably all of them combined.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.480]  Isn't that great?
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.560]  Oh, they want to stop government corruption.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.360]  Oh, they're against the big government.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.120]  Yeah, there ain't no establishment.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.280]  And they take that blank check from daddy government
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.120]  and hand it right to themselves.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.280]  Nice, very nice.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.000]  You guys are really fighting the system.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.840]  Twitter file number 17 drops the state-sponsored blacklists.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.880]  Matt Taibbi releases the Global Engagement Center
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.080]  and state-sponsored blacklists.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.720]  Yeah, you kind of, I look, I don't know.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.120]  We'll see if this ever equals to anything.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.560]  Maybe in some congressional hearings,
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.440]  but as far as the media approach is concerned
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.560]  with your little timed release story, it's over.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.400]  It's over.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.000]  You should have done one big comprehensive story,
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.080]  dominated the cycle for a day or two,
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.680]  forced Congress's hand to act.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.280]  But now you're doing this weird controlled release
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.720]  and people are yawning.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.440]  And we already know the story.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.320]  Give it all over to Congress.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.920]  Give it all over to the members of Congress,
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:55.520]  the Republican Party that want to take legal action,
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.200]  release it all to the public, do a comprehensive story,
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.520]  and let's get some action.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.480]  But you do this controlled release
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.920]  and now people are yawning and moving on to other stuff, sadly.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.720]  And you know, I was reading this in the Washington Post
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.920]  and the story did not go the way I thought it would.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.120]  Fox News bosses scolded reporters
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.120]  who challenged false election claims.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.160]  And while it does give you some of the backroom talk,
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.160]  and you can expect what goes on in personal conversations.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.560]  Yeah, I mean, they were talking about it.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.560]  And they were talking about the seriousness
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.680]  of the allegations and the seriousness of January 6th,
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.520]  but it wasn't, you know, I thought it would be a lot more
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.480]  Fox News making sure it was censored and all this.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.920]  And it, well, not really.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.120]  But I guess maybe the Washington Post wanted that.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.680]  The Washington Post wanted Fox News
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.960]  to censor its news hosts.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:49.200]  I guess that's the problem they have though.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.160]  Washington Post, pro censorship,
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.920]  where democracy dies in darkness.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:55.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.840]  The Great Reset in the War for the World,
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.120]  is a historic book that documents the globals
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.080]  and their own words,
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.040]  planned for our future, that is the hellish future.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.360]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books,
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:06.640]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.680]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.520]  in the War for the World at bookstores,
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.440]  Amazon, or info.org.com.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.640]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.720]  of the book after the signed copy
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.640]  of The Great Reset in the War for the World
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:21.480]  and you will never be able to get another signed copy
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.240]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.800]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.720]  So get your copy of The Great Reset
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.920]  and The War for the World,
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.200]  a signed copy at info.org.com.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.520]  And there is a markup there
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.160]  because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.360]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.200]  and this powerful book,
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.040]  you'll also know that you help keep infoers on the air.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.920]  I'm gonna thank those of you that have gotten signed copies
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.000]  of the book, or unsigned copies.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.880]  But I wanna encourage all of you who haven't yet
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:51.600]  to go to info.org.com and get a signed copy
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.120]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:56.320]  and go to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.120]  This is an info war I'm counting on you
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.920]  and thank you for your support.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:04.240]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:07.560]  that have gone to info.org.com and gotten The Great Products
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.440]  that enrich your life,
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.600]  that empower your immune system and your body
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.800]  and keep us on the air.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.480]  I am humbly, had in hand,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.680]  talking to the viewers and listeners
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.200]  that have tuned in many of you for years
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.240]  and never gone to info.org.com.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:23.720]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.920]  never actually go to info.org.com
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.720]  and never experienced these great products
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.080]  and never found the operation.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.960]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article,
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.520]  you tell folks about the show, that's great and I thank you.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.040]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.840]  Plus, we've got really great products
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:39.240]  that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.280]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait

[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.480]  Plus, all of these are really great products
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:46.360]  that keep us on the air.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.080]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.160]  So get off the bench, get in the game,
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:54.040]  step to the plate and go to infowarstore.com right now
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:57.360]  and get these great info wars products at infowarstore.com.

[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.760]  of the fight for a pro-human future.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.440]  We can't stay on air without your help

[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.680]  and I wanna encourage those of you
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.200]  that have never bought products at infowarstore.com
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.560]  to go there and experience how amazing
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.920]  these products really are.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.080]  Ultimate bone broth finally sold out
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.240]  for over two years back in stock.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.920]  Real red pill plus, simply amazing.
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:31.200]  Nitric boosts what it does for your heart
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.920]  and cardiovascular, critical.

[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.000]  ready to ship to you right now at infowarstore.com.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.200]  And the final 1200 signed copies of my book,
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.680]  the great reset in the world for the world.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.040]  And I'm not gonna sign any more after that,
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.160]  are exclusively available at infowarstore.com as well.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.560]  In the last month, I got a little busy
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.480]  so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.160]  But now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.840]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.760]  exposing the cartels and like coming under fire
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:06.680]  or you're on the streets of some American city
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.640]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.400]  And now you've gone to ground zero
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.880]  of a massive chemical spill.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.680]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.800]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.640]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.360]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.880]  And again, I have info words to thank for that.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.920]  Looking back on the day,
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:27.080]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.600]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.920]  under Alex Jones and under the info words team.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:35.560]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.760]  to get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.920]  was go where the story is,
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.520]  go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.720]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.520]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.200]  and helping the American people.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.240]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know,
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.960]  really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.400]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.360]  You found it.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.400]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:16.520]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:19.800]  Next year's news today.
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:22.440]  And I'm like Abraham Lincoln.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.080]  I'm actually Abraham Lincoln's clone.
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:27.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:29.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:33.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.800]  I'm not.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.680]  But I cannot tell a lie.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:43.120]  I cannot tell a lie.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.020]  And so, well, we've been proven right
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.160]  on a couple of other stories,
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.340]  but I cannot tell a lie.
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:50.880]  I like being right.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.880]  I do.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.280]  I like being right.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.280]  You got me.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.280]  I like being right.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.320]  That's why I work at InfoWars.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:59.560]  I like free speech, and I like being right,
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.680]  so here we are.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:09.540]  And now I have to tell you that I am on some performance enhancers though.
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.540]  This is true.
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.900]  I am on some performance enhancers.
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:19.940]  And today it's Rainforest Ultra from infowarstore.com is the performance enhancer that I'm on.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:23.140]  Maybe makes me sound a little smarter than I am actually.
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:33.620]  But seriously, the phenomenon of prescription pills that people are given to deal with ADD
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:40.620]  or ADHD, specifically kids, I would just say I personally would suggest against that just
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:47.740]  being antifarma as a foundation towards healthcare.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:55.020]  But aside from that, I would say at least give something all-natural and organic a try
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.420]  when it comes to mental energy, mental focus.
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:04.940]  And try Brainforce Plus or Brainforce Ultra from infowarstore.com, currently 50% off.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:05.940]  It might work.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:08.140]  It might work even better for your kid.
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:13.980]  Before you consider that pharmaceutical pill they want to prescribe your child, maybe
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:20.180]  just give something all-natural and organic a try, like Brainforce Plus or Brainforce
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:26.980]  Ultra from infowarstore.com, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:32.380]  And you won't have to give them that pharmaceutical product anymore.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:36.940]  But if you're out there, you got big presentations, you got to work long hours, work long nights,
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:40.100]  you're a student, prepare for an exam, what have you.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:48.420]  I suggest Brainforce Ultra and or Brainforce Plus from infowarstore.com, currently 50% off.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:51.340]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:59.540]  Now, there are two stories that I've been harping on for a long time on the war room
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:08.540]  here at Infowars, and that's these paid for Democrat propagandists that we've been reporting
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.460]  on for years, and they really don't even hide it anymore because they all get invited to
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:13.460]  the White House.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.100]  They have all their secret meetings at the White House, I shouldn't say secret, they
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.860]  post their pictures and brag about it.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:25.940]  It's like this weird flex, like, I'm anti-establishment, look at how I'm part of the establishment.
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:30.820]  But as if we don't have enough confirmation that these are paid for Democrat operatives
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.900]  that you see, like Jojo from Jurrs is one example.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:38.060]  You don't follow these people, but their crap always ends up in your newsfeed.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:41.180]  Now that's changing, but that's coming up next.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:50.620]  Well, Jojo from Jurrs is looking for dates on a dating app called Bumble, and on her
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:54.220]  little profile here, let's see what she has.
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:57.940]  A mom of two amazing kids separated since 19.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:04.900]  I work in social media, oh, is that what you call it?
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:06.220]  Is that what you call it?
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.340]  You work in social media.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:14.900]  So that's what you call being a Democrat paid propagandist on Twitter, is it?
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:19.900]  Do you need any other proof?
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:24.620]  And then another one that you're probably not seeing as much of anymore because Twitter
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:31.340]  and Elon Musk are fixing the rigged algorithms that made you see their crap, like Angelina,
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:37.060]  Bob Balcamino, a real nasty wench.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.100]  And she's pointing this out that, hey, I used to be popular on Twitter.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.860]  I used to get all kinds of impressions.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.860]  What happened?
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:47.260]  Well, the algorithms that were rigged to make you popular, the algorithms that were rigged
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:52.620]  to make you seem popular have been fixed, and you're not popular.
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:38:00.180]  She tweets out, in the past, I could tweet an emoji and get a thousand likes.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:04.700]  Now I could tweet a picture of my beep and not break 50.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:08.980]  Yeah, you were never popular.
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.860]  You were never organically popular.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.260]  You're not an E-celeb.
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:20.500]  You're a propaganda agent prompt up by the Democrat Party and their friends in big tech,
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.620]  but Elon Musk is not their friend.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:27.740]  And the algorithms that you've been taking advantage of for so many years are now gone,
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.820]  and you're realizing it the hard way.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:37.340]  But don't worry, because she'll probably post a picture of her beep to try to get that
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:39.980]  popularity back.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.380]  Good for you, Angela.
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:49.060]  Ah, you'll love it when they tell you who they are, don't you?
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:51.820]  You'll love it when they tell you who they are.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:53.220]  And here's another example.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:59.140]  This is, you know, how do you feel about this out of Texas?
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:06.140]  Texas Republicans introduced a bill to give huge tax cuts to straight couples having children
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:11.500]  with up to 100% cut in property taxes for having 10 kids.
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.660]  The bill's author said, get married, stay married, and be fruitful and multiply.
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:22.540]  Now the liberal commentator covering this says, this is handmade tail type stuff.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:29.220]  So get married, be happily married, and have children is handmade tail stuff.
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:30.500]  You guys are really reaching.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.060]  You guys really hate the family, don't you?
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:35.660]  Well, how else are you going to control the youth if they don't have a family unit?
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.940]  So that's why they want to destroy the family.
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.900]  You know, I have always wanted to have kids.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:47.020]  I've been a little more married to my career and my personal work and not really very interested
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.260]  in dating, quite frankly.
[01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:54.180]  But boy, if anything was going to, if anything would accelerate me towards getting married
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:56.540]  and having kids, this would actually do it.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:01.460]  I would have 10 kids just to stick it to the U.S. government.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.540]  I'm not even kidding.
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:07.020]  How many people would say, oh, I don't have to pay taxes if I had 10 kids?
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.220]  Let's get to work.
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:10.660]  How long is this going to take?
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.660]  Let's go.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:16.500]  Can we have Irish, can we have Irish, what do they call it, Irish twins or Irish brothers
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:17.500]  and sisters?
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:18.500]  That's probably racist.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:22.140]  Oh, the Irish are white, so it's cool.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:24.140]  Get married, stay married and be fruitful.
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:27.620]  The liberals say, how dare you?
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:31.900]  Get married and have kids and stay married.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.060]  How will we destroy the family if you do that?
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.340]  How will we destroy cities if you do that?
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:38.780]  How will we destroy the youth if you do that?
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:41.180]  How will we control their minds if you do that?
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:44.980]  How will we have drag queen story time if you do that?
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:51.020]  Get it down.
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:54.620]  Ten kids, I don't have to pay taxes.
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:58.820]  Oh, but they're telling you who they really are.
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:03.380]  They hate the family, hate it.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:09.300]  Atheist group, furious at New University of Colorado head coach Deon Sanders for infusing
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.780]  his program with Christianity.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:12.780]  Oh my gosh.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:17.740]  Deon Sanders wants the young men that he brings into his football program to be good
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:23.500]  upstanding men and godly men that build strong families like he did.
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.660]  Oh my gosh.
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:28.900]  Oh no.
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:33.260]  And by the way, I've been kind of following the story with Deon Sanders.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:41.980]  What he's doing at the University of Colorado is actually amazing, inspiring, game changing
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:43.180]  what he's doing.
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.380]  He's changing the game.
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:49.020]  Very pro black, by the way, good for him.
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:54.740]  And so he wants to bring in young black men to play football for Colorado and he wants
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:59.420]  to teach them how to be godly men and that angers the liberal.
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:05.100]  Oh, you mean Deon Sanders doesn't want guys that are going to get arrested and Deon Sanders
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:08.740]  doesn't want guys that will go to the NFL and ruin their careers before they can fully
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:13.660]  blossom and Deon Sanders wants to have men that go through his university be good strong
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:20.980]  godly men that have families and good husbands and children.
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:29.820]  And they're pissed, they're angry, good, good, be angry, go after Deon Sanders.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:34.460]  You're only going to commit him to his mission even more.
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:37.220]  You're only going to make him more stronger and I'll go ahead and make a prediction right
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:38.220]  now.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:43.500]  The Colorado Buffalo's haven't been a noteworthy football program in decades.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:50.020]  I bet you Deon Sanders has them in the top 25, if not by the end of this season, certainly
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:54.140]  by the end of next season, and that will have the liberals panic because he'll probably
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.900]  say a prayer on the field with his team after the game.
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:43:03.820]  Oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen, info wars has proven itself the last 28 years to be
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:08.140]  over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants and

[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:17.340]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners of support to some of the years by spreading
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:21.740]  the word, praying for the broadcast and buying product, but I really want to encourage those
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:25.820]  of you that have been on the fence that have never actually gone to info wars.com to go
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:31.940]  there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there

[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:47.900]  fizzy magnesium product or whether it's down and out or a sleep phase is back in stock,
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:48.900]  it's all there.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:52.140]  Our turmeric 95% Humanoid strongest out there to make 95.

[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.620]  This is their big move.
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:09.420]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:11.180]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.420]  That's not his job.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.180]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:18.460]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:22.460]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:23.460]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.460]  And that's who we are.
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:31.340]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no, exactly.
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.900]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:37.980]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:40.460]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.960]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:46.580]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:49.140]  We say no to you getting us into World War three.
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.140]  You're right.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:54.540]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no.
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:57.900]  And we say no to your war.
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:03.860]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had.
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:06.180]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:09.580]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:13.460]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:18.980]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.500]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:27.860]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:30.900]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:36.260]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:37.260]  us.
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.260]  I know you spread the word.
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:39.260]  I know you pray for us.
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.260]  And that's wonderful.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:41.260]  Keep doing it.
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:45.260]  But most viewers and listeners never go to info wars store.com and you never buy great
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:49.140]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:52.900]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at info wars store.com.
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.660]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to info wars store.com, our funding problems
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.660]  will be over.
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:45:59.660]  Please take action now.
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:02.340]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:07.220]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.220]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.220]  It takes commitment.
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:16.860]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to info wars store.com and buy great
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:21.780]  products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very

[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:45.300]  you have never shopped at info wars store.

[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.700]  the step to go to info wars store.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:54.820]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.

[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:27.180]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:37.180]  What is the future of Democrats Senators?
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:44.380]  Diane Feinstein's hospitalization leaves Senate Democrats without outright majority.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:48.900]  John Federman sponsors another bill from hospital bed.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:55.100]  Even Newsweek is doubting this.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:58.500]  Newsweek headline, John Federman letter from hospital bed raises questions.
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:04.140]  So Feinstein, she's like 99, she's unable to do her job, she's in the hospital.
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:10.820]  John Federman, he's suffering from massive problems with a stroke or whatever the hell
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:15.620]  is going on with the thing on his neck and other such things.
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:18.740]  But this is the future of the Democrat Party.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:25.580]  After all, it's kind of like this, Romanian Prime Minister using AI to advise cabinet.
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:27.700]  Well, yeah, that's the future of the Democrat Party.
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:34.380]  You invite somebody who's a vegetable in a hospital bed or you invite somebody with such
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:37.100]  a mental incapacity that it doesn't even matter.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:44.300]  You just have AI or somebody else is voting for them or AI or a computer or they're voting
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:45.300]  by proxy.
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:51.420]  That's Diane Feinstein, Senator Feinstein in there for the 700th year, the 89-year-old
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:56.860]  and then John Federman who during his campaign for Senate couldn't talk, couldn't walk, couldn't
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:04.580]  debate, couldn't even do interviews without technological assistance and is now in the
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:07.020]  hospital and nobody even knows what's going on.
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:11.060]  And the Republicans asked for proof of life and they got nothing, but somehow he's cosponsoring
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:13.180]  bills.
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:15.620]  That's the future of the Democrat Party.
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:18.140]  It's like, where are all the Democrats?
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:21.740]  Oh, they're in the hospital, they're in the mental ward, they've been institutionalized,
[01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:30.780]  but they're still voting, they're still voting, it's all good there.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:33.620]  Let's not forget about the people of East Palestine still suffering.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:39.420]  The New Ground Zero, East Palestine workers reporting migraines and nausea.
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:43.140]  Rail workers in East Palestine at the site of the toxic train derailment are reporting
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:48.140]  intense headaches and nausea, prompting fears that the cleanup could constitute a New Ground
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:51.580]  Zero health disaster and they say, oh, it's fine, it's fine.
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:55.100]  Pete Booty Judge shows up for a photo op and his press secretary says, we're not taking
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:56.940]  questions.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:03.900]  Rail worker who cleaned toxic Norfolk Southern derailment site, getting sick after government
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.540]  officials said everything is fine.
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:13.220]  Nothing to see here, all good baby, baby.
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:17.140]  Pete Booty Judge is in control.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:21.900]  Senate votes to declassify all government intelligence documents related to COVID-19 origins is
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:28.620]  Fauci nervous yet, well, we are finding out all the hundreds of millions he was making
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:35.260]  while he was running the NIH or whatever other alphabet bureaucracy he was involved with
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.020]  making just hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:42.460]  And when Rand Paul asks where the money goes, Fauci says, I don't have to tell you that.
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:43.460]  Really?
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:50.540]  31-year-old star of Elvis movie, rushed to the ER, body just shut down.
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.660]  Body just shut down.
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:57.900]  While he was there, doctors ran a battery of test and determined that the pain was caused
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:00.740]  by stress and exhaustion.
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:07.660]  He was complaining about chest pain, severe chest pain, but don't ask if it has anything
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.660]  to do with the vaccine or if he had a vaccine.
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:13.220]  Same thing with Justin Bieber.
[01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:17.340]  Justin Bieber's justice world tour canceled after several postponements.
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:26.140]  Now, remember Bieber had the Geyon beret incident after the vaccine, had to cancel shows and
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:28.860]  now an entire tour.
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.860]  But don't ask about the vaccine.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:38.940]  Bill would ban vaccinated donors from giving blood due to high count spike proteins, HB645
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:45.220]  would find vaccinated people or people suffering along COVID, $500 for knowingly donating tainted
[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:49.260]  blood as well as donation centers that receive it.
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:56.100]  A bill proposed in Montana seeks to bar people injected with COVID-19 mRNA jabs from donating
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:58.620]  to a blood bank.
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:04.220]  So the realization, the truth about this vaccine is being revealed.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:08.540]  And we've got Bob Barnes coming up in the third hour in studio here in about 10 minutes
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:14.460]  to discuss some of the further legal advancements on this issue.
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:20.660]  But you see, this is how it goes with these corrupt liberals.
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:23.380]  They pretend it's all about green energy, sustainable energy.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:24.380]  No, it's not.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:27.140]  It's all about stealing your money, just like it always is.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:33.420]  Biden's EPA awards nearly $1 billion in climate grants, while at the same time orders a pause
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.780]  to clean up East Palestine.
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:44.540]  Yeah, he's got to pay off his friends, his buddies that have these green new energy companies
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:46.900]  and they get billions of dollars.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:51.740]  And then all the people that own their stock also, they get a nice bump in their stock.
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:52.740]  It's all rigged.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:59.300]  It's not about stopping manmade climate change, it's about making money and stopping man.
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:02.820]  And they do a great job, don't they?
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.820]  The mother is demanding an apology.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.900]  Reporter asks Karine Jean-Pierre if Biden regrets laughing at grieving mother who lost
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:10.620]  her son to fentanyl poisoning.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:13.020]  Well, it's all a joke.
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:15.380]  It's all a joke to the liberals.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:23.420]  Now this next video is actually so insane, I'm wondering if it's even real.
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:31.820]  It is Women's History Month and as if Hershey's putting a man as the face of their new Women's
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:41.180]  History Month wasn't enough, that's right, Transface of New Hershey's campaign blasts
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:42.700]  transphobic response.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:50.020]  It's a man, it's a man that's the face of Women's History Month.
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:51.420]  One more time.
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:52.980]  You heard me right.
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:54:03.300]  It's a man that is the face of Women's History Month for Hershey chocolate and they've changed
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:06.740]  their name spelling it too, Hershey, like it's a pronoun.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:13.940]  Well as if that's not ridiculous enough, the Toronto Raptors NBA franchise, then guys
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:17.060]  see if there's any other news out there because I just came across a story, this is so hard
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:19.180]  to believe.
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:28.500]  Put out a video that's pro-woman and they ask the basketball players, what's so great
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:29.500]  about women?
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:30.620]  Why are women so great?
[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.140]  And do we have that video by the way?
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:39.540]  So here's the response, why would this Toronto Raptors video warrant an apology?
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:42.540]  Here it is.
[01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:47.620]  Girls warrant a word because they the only one that can procreate, they burr everybody.
[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:50.220]  All women are great because they're all queens.
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:57.660]  Oh my gosh, all women, they burr everybody, they're the only ones that can procreate,
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:11.580]  oh no you didn't, not in the year 2023 you bigot, so apparently Toronto is, have they
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:16.020]  offered an apology for this?
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:27.300]  Toronto Raptors, apologize for misguided Women's History Month video.
[01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:37.100]  So they take a man and they make a man the face of Women's History Month and then they
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:40.780]  ask men why women are so great and they say women are great, they're the only ones that
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:50.100]  can procreate and they gave me birth and the Raptors have to apologize because that's what?
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.620]  Not true?
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:58.660]  Is that what we're arguing, is that not true?
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:04.780]  You cannot make this stuff up, we are in Looney Tunes land at this point, I mean literally
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:10.900]  it's Looney Tunes land, it's Michael Jordan in Space Jam dunking from half court with
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:16.780]  five aliens attached to his back, it's like what does Bugs Bunny say it's you're in the
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:26.180]  cartoon world, you're in the cartoon world Mike, oh we're in Looney Tunes land now,
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:34.220]  if you say women can procreate that's bigoted, wow.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:43.300]  Remember the teacher in Canada with the gigantic fake breasts, you know this one, so it turns
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:48.980]  out it's true that that was either a troll or at least the teacher was only wearing them
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:50.480]  in school.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:56.380]  Teacher with prosthetic Z cup breasts put on leave, now get this, they didn't put the
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:57:05.220]  teacher on leave for wearing the fake breasts during school, they put the teacher on leave
[01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:12.060]  because the teacher doesn't wear the breasts outside of school.
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:19.820]  Now this is wrong for so many different reasons, we all know gender is fluid, so maybe the teacher
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:24.300]  identifies as a woman in the classroom and nowhere else, so how bigoted is it to put
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:30.980]  this teacher on leave because they identify as a different species or gender outside the
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:36.180]  classroom than they do inside the classroom, how dare you bigots or did they find out he
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:40.980]  was just trolling with the fake breasts and that's why they're punishing him, so you know
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:45.380]  wearing gigantic fake breasts to class okay, but doing it as a political stunt to show
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:49.860]  how insane people are no good.

[01:59:54.980 --> 02:00:03.820]  are the resistance, alright a couple of the heavyweights and podcasting got together yesterday,
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:15.460]  Joe Rogan and Russell Brand and man, it sounded a lot like an info wars transmission and rightfully
[02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:22.860]  so Alex Jones was brought up numerous times in the conversation and so I wanted to play
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:28.660]  some of the highlights here from Russell Brand on the Joe Rogan experience, here's just some
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:34.220]  of it and then bringing up Alex Jones, Bill Gates ain't Willy Wonka, he ain't doing this
[02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:38.180]  for like a competition, there's no golden ticket at the end of this, it's like not for
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:42.060]  profit organizations making profit, an incredible amount of influence in areas that he profits
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:47.620]  from, all sorts of peculiar business practices like in India and on the continent of Africa,
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:54.180]  there's like palpable suffering and profit in his case, the Africa thing is wild and
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:01:00.020]  that's a big part of the real Anthony Fauci book, he talks about Bill Gates quite a bit
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:04.380]  and one of the things he talks about is how they've always used Africa as a place where
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:09.100]  they test out medicines, they've used Africa as a place where they test out, this is another
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:12.780]  thing that I learned from Alex Jones, Alex Jones was saying that they were giving kids
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:17.420]  the polio vaccine in Africa and Bill Gates was involved in this and they had to stop
[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:22.260]  doing it because it was actually giving kids polio and I was like what and they pull up
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:28.180]  an AP article, there was an AP story about this and it shows this terrified little African
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:32.820]  baby and they're dropping the polio vaccine in his mouth like squeezing his face, dropping
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:39.980]  his mouth, I'm like what the fuck man, they gave kids polio with a vaccine?
[02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.780]  Even when you accept everything that they say at this late point when it appears impossible
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:49.660]  to do that, they wouldn't release patents so that African nations could recreate the
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:53.660]  vaccines over there, so clearly there's a profit motive and I saw him publicly talk
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:56.100]  about that and say oh no it's not as simple as that, you can't just give people the patents
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:02:00.140]  and stuff like that, but it seems like if you recognise that what drives them always
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:04.980]  is power, finance and dominion, if you always look at that and then track their actions
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:08.820]  you hardly ever see a disruption in that pattern.
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:14.820]  These characters that have become so maligned and marginalised even in my lifetime where
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:20.420]  I still worked in mainstream media, people like Alex Jones or David Ike, they were like
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:26.300]  even people that were sceptical about them or even people that ridiculed them didn't
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:31.740]  try to posit them as dangerous and the same I'm assuming with Robert Kennedy, they were
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:32.740]  sort of...
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:36.340]  Well the David Ike one they always made fun of him for lizard people because he always
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:40.660]  would say that they're shape shifters and they're lizards and there was no evidence,
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:45.900]  they just seemed really preposterous and then in the beginning of the pandemic he was trying
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:51.460]  to connect COVID with 5G, there was a lot of weird...
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:57.420]  He's got some squirrely ones, believe it or not, it's hard to say to the general public
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:02.460]  Alex Jones is way more reliable than David Ike, but he's way more reliable than David
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:03.460]  Ike.
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:09.180]  Alex made a tremendous mistake with Sandy Hook and he did that in a time of his life
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:11.780]  where he's experiencing a psychotic break.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:17.220]  He was drinking a lot and he was having a mental breakdown and he really believed that
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:23.100]  everything was a conspiracy and that the government is essentially run by these evil demons who
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:27.420]  are trying to depopulate America and ruin people and he thought they were trying to
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:32.740]  take away people's guns and he was convinced that someone had convinced him.
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:39.140]  I don't know what documentaries or what videos he saw but he was convinced that
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:43.220]  they were using crisis actors and that they were orchestrating a false flag.
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:48.940]  He was obviously very wrong and has admitted that he was wrong about that, but he's been
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:54.540]  right about a lot of things, so many things and I've talked about this many times but
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:58.220]  he was the guy who told me about Epstein's Island more than a decade ago and I thought
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.740]  it was the craziest thing I'd ever heard.
[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:01.660]  I was like, what are you saying?
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:07.860]  There's an island, it sounds like a plot in a movie, there's an island where they fly
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:14.460]  famous rich scientists and politicians and they compromise them with underage girls and
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:18.220]  get it on film so they could use it against them like what?
[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:19.220]  That sounds like weird.
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.220]  That sounds like lizard people.
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:26.980]  It sounds like 5G creates COVID, same thing, but it turns out it was true and it's one
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:27.980]  of many things.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:30.740]  He was the first one to warn me about a social credit score system.
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:34.740]  He's like, they're going to try to implement a social credit score system and your money
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:39.500]  is going to be tied, they'll have centralized digital currency and your money will be tied
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:42.940]  to your social credit score system and you step out of line, you won't be able to buy
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:45.780]  things, you won't be able to travel, you won't be able to do anything.
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:49.100]  They're going to try to keep you within a 15 minute radius of your home and they're
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:53.860]  starting to do that in places, all of it's real and in China the social credit score
[02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:59.340]  system is 100% real and implemented.
[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:03.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic
[02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:07.660]  book that documents the globalists and their own words, plan for our future, that is the
[02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:08.660]  hellish future.
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:12.420]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:16.420]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:20.620]  Amazon or infowarshore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:25.380]  book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:26.380]  right now.
[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:31.700]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowarshore.com
[02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:35.780]  and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:39.380]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:41.380]  that you help keep info wars on the air.
[02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:44.860]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:49.820]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:54.580]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple unsigned copies and go to the library or give them
[02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:55.580]  to the local school.
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:06:07.140]  This is an info war, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:13.380]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:17.860]  Jones show and now your host Owen Troyer.
[02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:24.860]  With Bob Barnes in studio, we got a bunch of legal subjects to discuss here, but I really
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:31.780]  just want Bob Barnes to come up here and give us an update on all the different proceedings
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:35.420]  that are going on right now that you're involved in or others.
[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:40.740]  When it comes to the vaccine mandates, people losing their jobs, where it stands, where
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:47.580]  it's going in the future, because from my perspective, it looks like their plans for
[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:50.620]  the vaccine tyranny, the medical tyranny really have failed.
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:54.980]  I mean, they gave out the cards, right, that had five things, here's your five vaccine
[02:06:54.980 --> 02:07:00.620]  cards, this is your vaccine pass, well, that's gone, so that's failed and people are not
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:05.420]  getting five vaccines, but there's still some fallout, people losing their jobs, mandates.
[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:09.620]  So with some of the litigation you're involved in, where do you see it going and where is
[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:10.620]  it right now?
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:14.140]  Really, the biggest case that's going to determine and decide whether they're ever held accountable
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:19.180]  for their various lies, that Pfizer lied and people died because of those lies, is going
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:24.060]  to be the Brooke Jackson case, where we had oral argument this week in Beaumont, Texas
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:25.060]  on Wednesday.
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:28.380]  The court allowed about four hours of oral argument on it.
[02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:30.700]  There's a lot of briefing that happened before then.
[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:34.700]  The court expressed concern with the Pfizer's argument, that the net effect of Pfizer's
[02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:39.700]  argument could be that there's no role for the judiciary in overseeing what takes place
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:44.580]  if the FDA simply continues to go along with the Pfizer fraud.
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:48.380]  And so the court's concern was just as a matter of principle.
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:49.380]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:51.940]  The court's going to decide whether that case proceeds to discovery or not.
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:55.180]  It's going to be issuing a written opinion at some point in the next either several weeks,
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:56.980]  several months, depending on how long it takes.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:08:00.900]  The court to review everything, a lot of extensive and expansive briefing in the case, a lot
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:04.460]  of argument in the case, but what was extraordinary to me was Pfizer's defense.
[02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:07.180]  Pfizer's defense was not that these allegations are false.
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:10.980]  They challenge whether the allegations are true, but at this stage of the pleadings they
[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:13.900]  have to assume them to be true legally.
[02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:20.780]  Their argument was solely even if they created a dangerous, ineffective drug that they disguised
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:25.820]  as a vaccine, that they said would be for the prevention of COVID-19, that didn't prevent
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:26.820]  COVID at all.
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:31.180]  In fact, in some cases, it appears the infection rate, it goes up with COVID, depending on how
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:35.700]  many booster shots that you've had, not only other dangers of the vaccine, that none of
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:36.900]  that matters.
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:42.500]  That as long as the Biden administration and the Justice Department and the FDA and the
[02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:47.420]  Defense Department go along with this scam, that nobody can ever hold them accountable.
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:51.540]  They have special immunity under the PREP Act, and they have additional immunity under
[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:52.540]  this contract.
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:56.140]  The only way to hold them accountable is the Brooke Jackson suit.
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:09:01.860]  That's why they've gone all out to deny discovery, to publicly attack Brooke Jackson, to publicly
[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:06.700]  attack me and to publicly attack others, is they can't afford any discovery or ever be
[02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:07.700]  held accountable.
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:12.220]  Because I think what we will find is, what Brooke Jackson saw was she was just this ordinary
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:17.140]  person who oversees clinical trials, had been doing this for almost 20 years.
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:20.780]  They tried to portray her as an anti-vaxxer, it's completely false.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:24.100]  She's just someone, in fact, she had no reason to doubt anything about this drug or this
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:27.780]  vaccine, was excited to be part of it, wanted to see it be successful.
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:33.420]  She stumbles into a complete disaster, and so bad that you would walk in and you could
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:35.460]  see needles sticking out of bags.
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:40.540]  You could see people's private medical records stuck on the walls for anybody to look at.
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:47.740]  You saw people rolling out in the side corridors who were not being monitored for their adverse
[02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:49.980]  events that they were suffering from.
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:52.980]  You saw people's blood being not taken in the proper way.
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:56.780]  You saw people, basically it's supposed to be a randomized test, it wasn't, supposed
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:01.180]  to be a placebo-controlled test, it wasn't, it's supposed to be a blinded clinical trial,
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.180]  it wasn't.
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:07.420]  All the data was doctored, all the data was in many ways fabricated or falsified.
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:13.140]  The certifications were fraudulent, the invoices were bogus, and Pfizer's whole other argument
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:17.820]  was, well, really we didn't have to comply with the FDA rules, but right in the contracts
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:21.820]  as the court itself started out the hearing with, the court started out with, well doesn't
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:27.980]  this provision of the contract say that Pfizer will comply with all of the FDA rules and
[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:28.980]  regulations?
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:29.980]  Yes, it does.
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:34.900]  Does it say later in the contract that in fact this is all part of the entire process?
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:36.500]  Yes, it does.
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:43.220]  Indeed, what Pfizer promised the Trump Defense Department is goes beyond what just FDA approval.
[02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:51.140]  They said we will deliver a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:55.900]  The words for the prevention of COVID-19 are listed as a deliverable item more than a half
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:00.980]  dozen times in the contract Pfizer signed with the Defense Department.
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:02.580]  And yet what did they deliver?
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:06.660]  They delivered something that was not safe, in fact was uniquely and extraordinarily dangerous
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:10.660]  according to the government's own vaccine adverse event reporting system that is not
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:16.340]  effective as the whole world knows and as Pfizer's own CEO admitted to the European authorities
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:19.740]  saying we didn't even really test for whether it was effective or not.
[02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:22.620]  It didn't prevent infection, it didn't prevent transmission.
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:25.380]  We now know, of course, it wasn't a vaccine.
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:26.580]  It was a gene therapy.
[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:30.700]  It's important to note this Defense Department contract was created at a time where the word
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:32.540]  vaccine still meant vaccine.
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:36.620]  It still meant something that inoculated and immunized against a disease.
[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:42.380]  Now if they try to pull a quick one and say we changed the definition, does it hold what
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:44.140]  the definition was at the time?
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:48.700]  It doesn't in this case because here the definition of vaccine in the contract was the definition
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.460]  commonly understood at the time.
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:54.140]  So they would have to go back and rewrite that contract and they never have.
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:58.020]  They've never managed the Biden Justice Department and the Biden Defense Department has never
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.820]  gone back and redone this contract.
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:04.660]  The only contract was the one signed by the Trump Defense Department and the Trump Defense
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:09.620]  Department said you will deliver this and you'll only get paid if you deliver it.
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:15.620]  You must deliver something that's been FDA approved as a safe effective vaccine for the
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:16.620]  prevention of COVID-19.
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:20.660]  So they can't just say, well, it's anything we put into your arm as a vaccine.
[02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:26.580]  So it has to be, by definition, basically a weak version of the virus is what it was
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:27.740]  at the time put into your arm.
[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:28.740]  It has to be that.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:29.740]  Exactly.
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.740]  It has to be something that inoculates.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:35.300]  And it was key, like even the contract language said there's three things you could deliver.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:37.580]  You could deliver something that's a diagnostic tool.
[02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:41.820]  You could deliver something that is a treatment tool or you could deliver something that is
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:43.660]  a preventative tool.
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:47.700]  So it distinguished the three and it said what you're going to deliver as Pfizer if
[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:51.660]  you're going to get paid is you're going to deliver something that is a preventative
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:55.100]  tool that it will prevent COVID-19.
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.980]  That was repeated all the way through the contract.
[02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:02.780]  That's where if President Trump fully appreciates the Brooke Jackson case, he would understand
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:08.580]  he was lied to by Pfizer and that it is time for the president to recognize he was lied
[02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:13.380]  to by Pfizer that the American people were lied to by Pfizer and he should say they should
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:20.180]  be held accountable for the lies they told because this is the biggest mass crime by
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:22.940]  any company in the history of the United States.
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:23.940]  Since Pfizer.
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:24.940]  Since Pfizer.
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:25.940]  Since Pfizer.
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:26.940]  Yeah, they're trying to one up themselves.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:27.940]  Completely.
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:31.900]  I've always told people that Pfizer makes El Chapo look like a street corner drug dealer.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:38.260]  That no Mexican drug cartel could ever imagine having the deletrious and damaging and destructive
[02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:42.420]  effect that Pfizer has had and nothing like what they've done here.
[02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:43.420]  And this is why they're desperate.
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:47.380]  Their whole argument to the court was judge the Biden administration is with us.
[02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:49.740]  So don't let this case go forward.
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:51.700]  They didn't have an argument from the contract.
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:53.380]  They didn't have an argument from the facts.
[02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:55.420]  They didn't have an argument from the law.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:59.740]  Their only argument was please judge don't allow the case to go to discovery because
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:03.420]  the food and drug administration is still on our side because the defense department
[02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:04.420]  is still on our side.
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:06.740]  The Biden administration is still on our side.
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:11.140]  And our point was there's a clear conflict of interest with the Biden administration
[02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:14.660]  that it's independent of the politics and the party shifting and the personalities
[02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:16.660]  of the Trump to Biden shift.
[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:19.620]  The big difference is Trump didn't mandate anyone take this drug.
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.580]  The Biden administration did.
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:22.820]  So they have a conflict.
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:26.940]  What if the whole world knew that the top high ranking cabinet officials, including
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:32.060]  the president himself, mandated and forced people to take a drug as a condition of employment
[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:36.820]  as a condition of serving in the United States military, a drug that they knew because Brooke
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:41.420]  Jackson had told members of the FDA that this all the way back at the beginning that they
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:47.860]  knew was not safe, not effective, not a vaccine, didn't prevent COVID-19, that the deliverable
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:53.740]  that Pfizer had brought to the U.S. taxpayers violated the very core, essential, elemental
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:58.180]  requirements of a delivery of what was supposed to be a deliverable to them.
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:02.220]  And then in fact, tens of thousands of people, according to the government's own data, dead
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:05.420]  millions of people disabled and suffering severe injuries.
[02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:07.980]  It would be the biggest public political scandal in the history of the United States.
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:14.540]  Well, and it sounds like too, even though that's the larger issue, the contractual violation
[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:15.540]  is the home run here.
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:18.700]  I mean, that's the ball sitting on the T way to be knocked out of the park.
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:19.700]  That's the fraud.
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:21.340]  That's the obvious self-evident fraud.
[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:22.900]  They said, here's what we're going to deliver.
[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:26.260]  And they sent in an invoice saying, we agree this is in accordance with the agreement.
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:28.820]  This is in accordance with the contract with work performed.
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:32.900]  We're delivering you a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
[02:15:32.900 --> 02:15:33.900]  It wasn't safe.
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:34.900]  It wasn't effective.
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:35.900]  It was an effective vaccine.
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:37.060]  And it didn't prevent COVID-19.
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:38.060]  They lied.
[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:39.060]  People died.
[02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:40.060]  Time to be held liable.
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:41.060]  All right.
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:44.180]  This is a story the mainstream media doesn't want to touch.
[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:48.500]  And that's because at the end of the segment on the mainstream media, it's brought to you
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:49.500]  by Pfizer.
[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:53.180]  Well, we don't have that message in our breaks, do we?
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:54.900]  So we'll talk about this.
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:16:03.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars has proven itself the last 28 years to be over the globalist
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:07.020]  target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:11.020]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great
[02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:12.460]  products at the same time.
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:16.380]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners of support to some of the years by spreading
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:19.220]  the word, praying for the broadcast, and buying product.
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:22.580]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence and have never
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:29.020]  actually gone to infoworshore.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:33.660]  and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life, but
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:36.660]  again, will keep this broadcast transmitting.
[02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:41.700]  So whether it's Real Red Pill Plus or Super High Quality CBD Oil or the 50% Off or a great
[02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:46.940]  Physiomagnetism product or whether it's down and out or a sleep phase is back in stock,
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:47.940]  it's all there.
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:53.580]  Our turmeric 95% Humanoid, strongest out there, turmeric 95, it's all available at infoworshore.com
[02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:54.700]  and it keeps us on the air.
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:17:02.980]  So make the decision to enrich your life and keep us on air infoworshore.com.
[02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:04.700]  This is their big move.
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:08.460]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:10.260]  He doesn't care.
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:11.500]  That's not his job.
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.260]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:17.540]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:21.540]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:22.540]  They must be opposed.
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:29.460]  Autocrats only need to understand one word, no, no, no.
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:30.460]  Exactly.
[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:37.020]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines, we say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:39.500]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:41.980]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:45.580]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:48.180]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:49.180]  You're right.
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:18:00.740]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no, and we say no to your war.
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:06.740]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane
[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:07.740]  place.
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:08.740]  World War Three has already started.
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:11.260]  Biden is a puppet, and this is all over our borders.
[02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:12.260]  There's mass censorship.
[02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:14.540]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:17.540]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening, but the good things that
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:21.100]  are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:25.500]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:29.100]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the
[02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:33.420]  broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at infowarstore.com.

[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:13.820]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support,

[02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:44.820]  And the final 1200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:48.900]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:49.900]  as well.
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.420]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.420]  for sale.
[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:59.220]  But now, I signed the last books, you can get them right now.
[02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:16.580]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:34.340]  Hey, now, that Pfizer lawyer wears the mask in court to protect himself from COVID, don't
[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:35.340]  you know?
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:36.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:37.340]  Even though he's been vaccinated against COVID.
[02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:38.340]  Yeah.
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:39.580]  I mean, you should almost use that as an argument.
[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:40.580]  Oh, it was tempting.
[02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:41.580]  You know, I said next to somebody in the plane.
[02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:42.580]  I can imagine that was tempting.
[02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:46.780]  Oh, well, I said next to somebody in the plane, it was like masked.
[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:49.020]  I saw a double-masker yesterday.
[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:52.580]  I had a little bit of a cold, and I was thinking, I'll probably cough once, and I'll be like,
[02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:57.820]  man, I probably should have been vaccinated, you know, just to have some fun with him.
[02:20:57.820 --> 02:21:01.500]  But I mean, it's the level of insanity of some of these people is extraordinary.
[02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:05.580]  But the key is, can the legal system step up and answer?
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:09.500]  Well, let me bring that up, actually, because here's when we get into the legal system,
[02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:12.260]  and this is kind of something I was saying yesterday, just as a generality.
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:18.060]  When you talk about injustice, most people know somebody personally, probably, that's
[02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:22.260]  gone to jail or been arrested or been charged with a minor drug offense, right?
[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:26.020]  Marijuana, whatever, narcotics, paraphernalia.
[02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:28.500]  But yet they might spend time in jail.
[02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:29.580]  They got to be in and out of court.
[02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:30.580]  They got to pay fines.
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:31.580]  They got to deal with it.
[02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:33.780]  And sometimes it's real life disruption.
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:39.540]  But when you're Pfizer, you can release a drug to hundreds of millions, billions of people,
[02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:40.540]  millions die.
[02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:41.780]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:45.020]  And their argument in court is, come on, Biden's with this man.
[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:46.420]  We got Biden on our team.
[02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:48.380]  But so let me ask you this.
[02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:50.580]  They signed the contracts.
[02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:53.220]  The argument is that they violated the contracts.
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:56.340]  They're wearing a mask in court because the vaccine doesn't work, so they're admitting
[02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:58.700]  the vaccine doesn't work.
[02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:02.700]  But I'm guessing that that money they got's probably already been spent.
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:06.500]  I'm guessing that money's probably already gone to Ching right into some bank accounts.
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:11.540]  Well, I think the next wave of potential litigation is as to Pfizer and Moderna.
[02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:14.380]  It's going to be that they lied to their shareholders.
[02:22:14.380 --> 02:22:15.860]  They lied to the public.
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:19.260]  Because just as they lied to the Trump Defense Department and said, we're delivering you
[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:23.700]  a safe, effective vaccine for the protection of COVID-19, that was actually dangerous,
[02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:27.340]  ineffective, not a vaccine, and didn't prevent COVID-19.
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:31.380]  But in the same, and it actually created all these other harms it wasn't supposed to create.
[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:34.740]  But they also told the stockholders they were delivering that.
[02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:38.060]  They told the stockholders were delivering a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:39.660]  of COVID-19.
[02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:40.660]  And they weren't.
[02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:41.660]  And then more fraud.
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:42.660]  Completely.
[02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:43.740]  And it's fraud on the market.
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:45.500]  And it's one place they have no immunity.
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:47.140]  That's a different case entirely.
[02:22:47.140 --> 02:22:48.140]  Completely.
[02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:49.620]  They don't have any immunity under the PREP Act.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:52.860]  They don't have any immunity under whether the federal government is protecting them
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:53.860]  or not.
[02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:54.860]  They can't.
[02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:59.380]  That's a place that any shareholder out there that had Pfizer stock or Moderna stock
[02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:03.780]  that saw it go down after people discovered they'd been lying, I mean, people like Edward
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:05.220]  Dowd have detailed this.
[02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:06.220]  Others have detailed this.
[02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:09.940]  I talked to Wall Street people all the way back to the beginning of this who were monitoring
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:12.580]  it, who had some of the data before downed it.
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:16.300]  And they told me that what they were seeing was evident they were going to be shorting
[02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:17.300]  the stocks.
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:20.460]  And they said what they had seen was evidence that both Pfizer and Moderna had been lying
[02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:23.740]  systematically and systemically, and that they must have known it.
[02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:24.740]  And that's the evidence.
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:30.020]  I mean, that's what Pfizer, if Pfizer was so right that the allegations were false against
[02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:35.300]  them, then why are they so terrified of any discovery, like right now they're begging
[02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:38.900]  the court to not allow any discovery ongoing in this case.
[02:23:38.900 --> 02:23:41.820]  Please judge, whatever you do, don't allow a single deposition.
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:43.660]  Please don't allow a single request for production.
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:47.340]  Have they tried to get this, I mean, I'll just ask it broadly.
[02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:50.020]  Have they tried to get this case out of the courtroom?
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.020]  I mean, effectively, yes.
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:56.860]  In fact, their argument is that no court process should be allowed, that there should be no
[02:23:56.860 --> 02:24:02.060]  further, there should never be any discovery in the case, that no jury should be allowed
[02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:03.060]  to hear the case.
[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:04.060]  They made this argument explicitly.
[02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:09.260]  In fact, what they said is once the FDA says something, judge, you judge have no more power
[02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:11.540]  to say a single thing about this.
[02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:14.220]  The jury has no more power to say a single thing about this.
[02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:15.380]  Which is obviously not true.
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:17.780]  No, it's directly contrary to the False Claims Act.
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:24.260]  The reason why that exists is because during the Civil War, corrupt union government bureaucrats
[02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:30.100]  were working with outside contractors to deliver faulty products to the ordinary soldier.
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:33.620]  Which is exactly what this is, because this originally started off as all about making
[02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:36.700]  sure our members of our military, our soldiers, had adequate safety.
[02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:37.980]  And they got it mandated.
[02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:38.980]  Completely.
[02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:41.060]  And it was all based on Pfizer's lies.
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:45.740]  And it was, but for Pfizer's lies, none of this is here, none of this happens.
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:48.860]  And in fact, by the way, what's also in the contract, they were supposed to deliver this
[02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:53.540]  safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 prior to the election.
[02:24:53.540 --> 02:24:55.260]  So they screwed Trump twice.
[02:24:55.260 --> 02:25:00.060]  First, they deliberately sandbagged Trump by not delivering it prior to the election,
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:02.500]  so he got no political credit for it.
[02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:05.980]  And then what they turned around and delivered was a total lie, wasn't what they had promised
[02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:07.220]  him from the get-go.
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:12.380]  And they have received billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars on all this.
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:17.320]  And the key is, if this fraud is exposed, that opens the door for them to be held accountable
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:18.660]  across the board.
[02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:19.660]  So we'll see.
[02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:24.260]  And the case that can hold Pfizer accountable is if the grand jury either in Florida that's
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:29.300]  currently open, and my encouragement is if DeSantis' people are sincere.
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:35.900]  And this is, we'll know whether DeSantis is a, whether he's a deep state guy or whether
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:41.100]  he's a legitimate, populist guy, by whether or not the state grand jury that he formed
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:43.540]  actually holds Pfizer accountable.
[02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:48.220]  Because there's zero doubt at this point, we've amassed all kinds of evidence with Brooke
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:52.380]  Jackson that Pfizer knew they were lying to the people of Florida.
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:54.380]  What about the Project Veritas videos, too?
[02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:55.980]  I mean, that's got to be huge.
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:26:00.780]  I mean, there you have a Pfizer executive admitting on tape that they knew what they
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:05.220]  were doing was dangerous, that it was clearly altering various aspects of your body.
[02:26:05.220 --> 02:26:10.220]  Otherwise, it couldn't interfere with menstruation unless it was doing something to the very
[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:12.100]  core of the body's function.
[02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:15.220]  It wasn't that, oh, maybe this will cause an infertility issue.
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:17.180]  It was that this goes beyond that.
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:22.340]  This goes to something's happening with this mRNA delivery platform that, again, and right
[02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:28.500]  in the contract, they said our mRNA platform is uniquely safe, uniquely effective, can
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:31.540]  be uniquely clinically tested in a quick and effective way.
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:35.740]  They were lying about all of it, and they knew they were lying about all of it.
[02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:39.660]  We know what a delicate chemistry it is when a mother is pregnant, and that's why you've
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:43.300]  got all these warnings about do not smoke, do not drink, don't do this.
[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:48.620]  I mean, you know, real holistic health people won't do a lot of things when they're pregnant.
[02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:54.020]  But so let alone injecting an experimental technology into them to see what that'll do
[02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:57.020]  to the chemistry, well, now we know it was doing a lot of harm.
[02:26:57.020 --> 02:26:58.020]  Yeah.
[02:26:58.020 --> 02:26:59.020]  Oh, completely.
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:00.820]  And that they knew it all the way through.
[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:02.620]  They knew it in test after test after test.
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:05.220]  There's more data coming out of Argentina.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:06.980]  There's more data coming out of Israel.
[02:27:06.980 --> 02:27:09.060]  There's more data coming out of multiple countries.
[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:13.260]  Whistleblowers continue to come forward, and we encourage them to continue to come forward.
[02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:17.100]  There are people who participated in these clinical trials all around the world who probably
[02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:19.980]  don't even realize what they saw was illegal.
[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:20.980]  And that was one of Pfizer's arguments.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:25.100]  Pfizer's arguments, well, was Brooke Jackson was there, and she just saw one glimpse of
[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:26.100]  it.
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:29.660]  The reality is she saw a clear window into the scope and scale and severity of their
[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:31.500]  criminality and fraud.
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:35.780]  But they want to say, don't worry, what she saw only happened in Texas.
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:41.420]  So they're trying to say, it's like if there's 10 grocery stores here, like a popular grocery
[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:42.420]  store is HEB.
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:46.820]  So it's like, you got 10 HEBs here, and I go down to one HEB, which is maybe in a
[02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:51.260]  seedy area, and it's kind of dirty and grungy, and there's some, you know, seedy characters
[02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:54.700]  around, and it's like, well, that's just that one.
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:55.700]  That's only that HEB.
[02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:58.180]  But then I go to another one, and I go to another one, and I go to another one, and
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:00.420]  it's the same thing, grungy, dirty.
[02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:01.740]  By the way, I'm not saying that about HEB.
[02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:02.940]  I actually like the people at HEB.
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:03.940]  I got friends who work there.
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:04.940]  So just being clear.
[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:05.940]  But I'm saying that's the analogy.
[02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:07.500]  It's like saying, no, no, no, it's just that one.
[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:10.060]  But then you go to every single one, and it's the exact same thing.
[02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:13.260]  That's why they want to deny all the discovery, because they know if we looked at all the
[02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:15.660]  documents, it probably gets worse.
[02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:20.060]  She was witnessing things she had never witnessed in her near 20-year career.
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:26.620]  I mean, she was just shocked and horrified at it at multiple levels, and that's how bad
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:27.620]  it was.
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:30.100]  And so that's why they don't want the world to know the truth.
[02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:31.100]  They don't want the world.
[02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:34.900]  We have alleged in our complaint that we will show that this was systematic and systemic
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:38.060]  all across the globe in their clinical trials.
[02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:42.300]  Pfizer lied, people died, time for discovery, time for liability.
[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:45.460]  And now I guess the question is, is it going to be like the FTX money?
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:46.460]  It's just gone.
[02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:47.460]  We just don't know.
[02:28:47.460 --> 02:28:48.460]  We don't know where the money is.
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:49.460]  Sorry.
[02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:52.780]  Well, we'll see if Pfizer gets away with it to that extent.
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:53.780]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:54.780]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:29:02.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the World for the World, is a historic
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:06.780]  book that documents the globals and their own words, planned for our future.
[02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:08.220]  That is the hellish future.
[02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:11.780]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, they're starting to ban them,
[02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:15.700]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the World for the World at bookstores,
[02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:17.700]  Amazon, or m4f4.com.
[02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:21.820]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:23.260]  we got run out.
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:25.820]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:31.220]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at m4f4.com.
[02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:35.140]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:38.180]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:40.700]  You'll also know that you help keep m4f4s on the air.
[02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:44.260]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:45.260]  copies.
[02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:50.500]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to m4f4.com and get a signed copy
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:55.340]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and go to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:56.340]  This is an info war.
[02:29:56.340 --> 02:30:00.340]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:06.340]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane
[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:07.340]  place.
[02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:08.340]  World War III has already started.
[02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:10.860]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:30:10.860 --> 02:30:11.860]  There's mass censorship.
[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:14.140]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[02:30:14.140 --> 02:30:16.460]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:21.100]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[02:30:21.100 --> 02:30:25.100]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:28.700]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the
[02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:32.900]  broadcast, and to get the broadcast on the air by getting great products at m4f4.com.
[02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:36.780]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the great reset in
[02:30:36.780 --> 02:30:40.900]  the world, or open bone broth, finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available
[02:30:40.900 --> 02:30:41.900]  at m4f4.com.
[02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:43.900]  These are truly amazing products.
[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:49.180]  So get your info wars products at m4f4.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast
[02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:50.180]  on the air.
[02:30:50.180 --> 02:30:58.180]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at m4f4.com.
[02:30:58.180 --> 02:31:00.220]  I've got some good news.
[02:31:00.220 --> 02:31:07.180]  Our high quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:31:07.180 --> 02:31:08.180]  That's the good news.
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:09.180]  They're amazing.
[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:14.180]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go
[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:17.260]  to m4f4.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:20.780]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the info war.
[02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:25.700]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:31:25.700 --> 02:31:27.340]  Think what would happen.
[02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:32.620]  If those of you on the fence actually went to m4f4.com and got some of these amazing
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:37.500]  products, I would recommend Tomb Raek 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get
[02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:41.100]  one of the biggest effects so you reorder and see how great it is.
[02:31:41.100 --> 02:31:46.540]  Also we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological
[02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:49.900]  systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:51.460]  Or real Red Bull Plus.
[02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:55.100]  Just go try the product, fund the info war, and help us defeat the new ruler together
[02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:59.260]  m4f4store.com.
[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:02.260]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had.
[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:07.580]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[02:32:07.580 --> 02:32:08.580]  us.
[02:32:08.580 --> 02:32:12.060]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:17.580]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:21.060]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in
[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:26.420]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:29.380]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:34.820]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:35.820]  us.
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:38.900]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:43.780]  But most viewers and listeners never go to info wars store.com and you never buy great
[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:47.300]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:51.500]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at info wars store.com.
[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:56.340]  If just 1% more of you took action at info wars store.com, our fighting problems will
[02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:57.340]  be over.
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:32:59.020]  Please take action now.
[02:32:59.020 --> 02:33:22.420]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:36.220]  I want to get into some other topics here with Bob Barnes, who is going to be hosting
[02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:40.140]  the fourth hour by the way, but let's just kind of put a bow on this.
[02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:43.940]  What do you think the people need to know about this ongoing case against Pfizer?
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:50.300]  What, you know, when or if is the next big break going to appear in the media or really,
[02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:51.300]  where is the media?
[02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:52.820]  And here you are with us.
[02:33:52.820 --> 02:33:55.060]  I'm not hearing anybody else cover your story.
[02:33:55.060 --> 02:33:57.020]  Anybody else reached out for comment?
[02:33:57.020 --> 02:34:01.220]  The institutional media has tried to avoid this case like the plague, and that's a sign
[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:02.220]  of its strength.
[02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:06.100]  And if the case was weak, we would have hit piece after hit piece after hit piece.
[02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:08.340]  So we don't, we have almost no coverage.
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:13.100]  There's been sort of blanket non-coverage of the entire, in fact, what happened here
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:17.460]  is once the Biden administration took over the case, so she filed her complaint or made
[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:23.020]  the government aware of it back in the fall of 2020, and the same day she talked to the
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:27.420]  FDA and said, here, look, there's a whole bunch of problems with these clinical trials.
[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:33.060]  Later that same day, she summarily fired, you're gone, don't come back, don't ever come
[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:34.740]  back into the office.
[02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:39.620]  Then after that, she gets contacted by Pfizer's lawyer, who somehow knows her cell phone number
[02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:42.340]  that wasn't on the employment files.
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:45.540]  And so clearly there was a coordinated effort to try to suppress this.
[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:46.540]  She hires counsel.
[02:34:46.540 --> 02:34:50.620]  She, the US government, the Biden administration says, we're seriously investigating this.
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:53.620]  Well, you know, we have to keep, so keep it sealed.
[02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:57.660]  Keep it under the federal court seal, don't, you know, don't, you know, tells her lawyers,
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:35:00.220]  don't talk about the case, don't discuss the case.
[02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:03.420]  Now legally, you're entitled to discuss the facts of the case, not the existence of the
[02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:07.420]  case itself, but the underlying facts, you're free to, to discuss.
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:10.580]  But that wasn't even relayed to her, she wasn't told that.
[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:16.700]  So for about a year, she's kept quiet by her prior lawyers, who it turns out have all kinds
[02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:21.620]  of conflicts involved in the case, and because the US government was saying that they were
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:24.780]  seriously investigating and gonna hold Pfizer accountable.
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:29.100]  And then on the eve of this motion to dismiss, the US government comes in and says, oh, judge,
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:30.620]  please get rid of the case.
[02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:32.300]  It's like, well, what were you doing for a year?
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:33.460]  Were you lying to the judge?
[02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:34.820]  Were you lying to the American people?
[02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:40.060]  Were you lying to her about seriously investigating it in order to cover up the existence of these
[02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:41.860]  allegations for a year?
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:44.580]  So you know, all of that would be subject to discovery.
[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:48.580]  What we told the judges, we not only want discovery from Pfizer, but because Pfizer's
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:53.220]  now claiming that the government would have approved this, even if the government knew
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:59.060]  it was a dangerous, ineffective gene therapy disguised as a vaccine that did not actually
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:03.540]  work for the prevention of COVID-19, our position is we should be entitled to depose government
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:04.540]  officials as well.
[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:09.300]  Well, yeah, and I guess they feel confident enough in the defense that that'll somehow,
[02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:13.260]  I guess, get them off, like, hey, get off our back, go after the government.
[02:36:13.260 --> 02:36:14.260]  Well, I see.
[02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:15.900]  It's like, how about we go after both of you?
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:16.900]  Completely.
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:17.900]  Exactly.
[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:21.100]  I mean, the fact that they may be complicitly in cahoots with high-ranking corrupt members
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:25.700]  of the government is an ongoing damnation of both them and the government officials
[02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:27.060]  that could be implicated.
[02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:31.180]  Because the reason for this whole law is because the Congress said, you know what?
[02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:35.540]  We cannot trust government bureaucrats to protect against fraud.
[02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:39.900]  So we're going to give the American people a direct right through what's called keytam
[02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:45.180]  claims, false claims act, to bring that claim on behalf of the American people.
[02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:49.580]  That's why Brooke Jackson is the relator on behalf of the American people, on behalf of
[02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:54.220]  the United States against Pfizer, and the reason they did it is because we can't trust
[02:36:54.220 --> 02:37:00.340]  the government to do the right thing, unfortunately, too often in scandals, these scale and size
[02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:01.340]  of this one.
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:07.460]  Now, she also has a separate claim, my co-counsel, Lexis Anderson, made the argument in that part
[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:11.740]  of the claim, which is the retaliatory discharge claim, so that she was fired as soon as she
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:13.660]  reported it to the FDA.
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:17.860]  And their only defense was, well, we don't know if that's why she was fired.
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:21.580]  Let's see, she reports it to the FDA, gets fired.
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:23.100]  It's pretty darn obvious what they're doing.
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:26.060]  Have they offered an alternative reason as to why she was fired?
[02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:27.060]  None.
[02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:28.860]  Zero alternative reason as to why she was fired.
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:30.260]  I mean, that's just straight laziness.
[02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:34.260]  I mean, they can't even come up with an excuse, like she was stealing sandwiches from the
[02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:35.260]  employee's fridge.
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:39.980]  Well, they were initially complicit in trying the British Medical Journal, independently
[02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:45.900]  investigated Brooke Jackson's allegations, independently confirmed and verified the authenticity
[02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:48.860]  and the accuracy of her exhibits in affidavits.
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:53.340]  I think they've talked to other whistleblowers in addition to that, and so they came out with
[02:37:53.340 --> 02:37:57.420]  one of the most well-respected, peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, says Brooke
[02:37:57.420 --> 02:38:01.380]  Jackson's allegations are true and accurate about what Pfizer did.
[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:05.060]  And it begins the British Medical Journal asking lots of questions about what's happening
[02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:06.060]  here.
[02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:11.660]  But in that capacity, initially, the company of Intavia that fired Brooke Jackson tries
[02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:17.740]  to libel and lie about her to try to other medical publications to try to limit the coverage
[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:20.300]  the British Medical Journal's publication got.
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:22.740]  In Europe, it got tons of coverage.
[02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:25.660]  In the United States, it didn't get as much coverage.
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:29.700]  And so we actually were talking about suing Ventavia for defamation and libel.
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:32.980]  They backed down, retracted some of their statements, et cetera.
[02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:37.300]  So they knew that lying was not going to be a long-term successful strategy for them.
[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:40.620]  This Brooke Jackson has an impeccable near-20-year record in the industry.
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:44.300]  Well, and yeah, it sounds to me the more I hear about this, and it's funny, Brooke Jackson
[02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:47.340]  is not a household name, she probably should be.
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:52.620]  Brooke Jackson is the hero of this case, coming forward as a whistleblower and exposing the
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:57.700]  corruption that she was seeing in one of the biggest stories when it comes to medicine
[02:38:57.700 --> 02:39:01.860]  and pharmacia in U.S. history with this vaccine.
[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:04.100]  I mean, her name should be the household name.
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:05.100]  Absolutely.
[02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:06.100]  I mean, people can see.
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:11.100]  I mean, her, she has a website, I am Brooke Jackson, she's on Twitter, I am Brooke Jackson.
[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:14.140]  And she was willing to go public about all of this because they'd gone to great lengths
[02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:18.300]  to suppress and censor the existence of this story because she was someone you couldn't
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:19.300]  take apart.
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:21.300]  She's someone that's been in the industry almost 20 years.
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:24.780]  She was someone who had confidence and trust and belief in vaccines and pharmaceuticals
[02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:26.340]  or she wouldn't be in the industry.
[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:31.180]  She was someone who had overseen and supervised various aspects of clinical trials for a long
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:32.180]  time.
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:35.860]  She was someone who believed and wanted this vaccine to work and be effective.
[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:39.100]  And so she had no incentive or motivation to lie about anything.
[02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:43.140]  And instead she keeps reporting it, document it, report it, document it, report it, exactly
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:44.820]  what you're supposed to do.
[02:39:44.820 --> 02:39:49.660]  And that's why they were terrified that somebody that knew what was supposed to happen, because
[02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:53.180]  most of the people that clinical trial, like the people being tested, they don't know what
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:54.180]  the rules are.
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:55.180]  They don't know what blinding is.
[02:39:55.180 --> 02:39:58.020]  They don't know what a placebo, how that works.
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:00.060]  They don't know what the testing requirements are.
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:05.220]  So it's like if you're a referee at a basketball game and the league, the commissioner calls
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:09.420]  you before the finals and says, hey, when the Chicago Bulls score, you're going to count
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:11.340]  that as three points.
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:15.500]  And when the Golden State Warriors score, you're going to count that as two points.
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:18.980]  And the ref would be like, hmm, this doesn't seem right.
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:19.980]  I'm going to take note of this.
[02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:20.980]  I'm going to blow the whistle on this.
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:21.980]  Exactly.
[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:24.260]  And document it and report it all the way up the food chain.
[02:40:24.260 --> 02:40:25.580]  And she was shocked.
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:26.660]  And well, here's the thing.
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:31.900]  Many of the people that were in that hierarchy were confirming that this was systemic.
[02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:35.740]  And the reason it was systemic was Pfizer lied from the very beginning.
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:39.540]  Pfizer's whole pitch was, you know what, we can create a unique system of clinical trial
[02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:43.340]  testing these pharmaceuticals that we can replicate in the future.
[02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:46.380]  That's why it was a protocol agreement under the defense agreement.
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:50.580]  We can create something unique that will provide for our enhanced national security for our
[02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:55.460]  soldiers down the way, because we can accelerate the timetable for clinical trial success that
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:41:00.380]  has never been done in the history of clinical trials based on our mRNA technology, but
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:03.100]  our mechanism of doing these trials, it was all a lie.
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:06.060]  They were just going to rush through the whole clinical trial process, not follow any of
[02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:09.580]  the rules and regulations and restrictions to be able to pretend they could do it when
[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:10.580]  they couldn't do it.
[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:14.980]  Well, if I'm a layman hearing this and forget about, forget about just all the stuff we
[02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:18.540]  know about the world and Pfizer's history and all this, if I'm a layman and I'm hearing
[02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:23.740]  this, well, the story is pretty obvious at just a basic face value here.
[02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:26.780]  There was no way Pfizer could have guaranteed any of this.
[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:29.780]  There was no way they could have guaranteed the vaccines would stop infection.
[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:32.500]  There was no way they could have guaranteed that they were safe and effective.
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:37.700]  They said they were, and I guess the reason why they were so bold was because they knew
[02:41:37.700 --> 02:41:39.740]  they, well, they thought they had immunity.
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:44.600]  They thought that they could do this and be immune from lawsuits, and they saw the money.
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:46.180]  They saw the money sitting on the table.
[02:41:46.180 --> 02:41:47.580]  Well, why wouldn't we rush through this?
[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:50.900]  We're going to get billions of dollars and we're immune from lawsuits, they thought.
[02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:51.900]  Exactly.
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:54.540]  And they assumed that the Brook Jackson's the world would keep their mouths shut because
[02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:59.300]  you look at Brook Jackson, she knows the moment she discloses this, that all of a sudden she
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:04.100]  has no career left in the industry, that she'll be subject to personal smear campaign.
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:06.140]  Geez, what does that say about the industry?
[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:10.880]  It does say, it says too much about the industry, that she knew that in fact that the whole
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:14.620]  nature, that she was seeing one of the worst public health scandals, probably the worst
[02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:19.220]  public health scandal in world history, and she was a personal witness to it, and she's
[02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:23.460]  at the front lines of it, and not long after she reports this, she suddenly fired, then
[02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:27.780]  she has Pfizer's lawyer calling her at home, then all of a sudden her mail is being opened
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:32.420]  up before she even gets to receive it and read it, all kinds of anomalies are happening.
[02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:34.020]  Wow, I am Brook Jackson dot com.
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:35.020]  I am Brook Jackson dot com.
[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:36.020]  For her story.
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:38.380]  Yep, you can get her whole story and follow her on Twitter as well.
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:44.140]  She's a real hero, and Bob Barnes and his legal team, you got a lot of good hungry lawyers
[02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:47.660]  working for you on this case too, that are doing great work, so folks, we're going to
[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:49.060]  continue to monitor this story.
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:53.260]  I do want to change lanes though, when we come back with some other developments, as
[02:42:53.260 --> 02:42:59.100]  far as stopping drag queen story time, this is getting into a legal fight now.
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:04.380]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store
[02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:08.420]  dot com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune
[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:10.820]  system and your body, and keep us on air.
[02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:16.060]  I am humbly, head in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of
[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:19.380]  you for years, and never gone to info or store dot com.
[02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:24.180]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you, never actually go to info or store
[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:27.820]  dot com, and never experienced these great products, and never found the operation.
[02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:31.620]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great,
[02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:35.860]  and I thank you, but we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:40.020]  do amazing things for people like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sweet

[02:43:56.900 --> 02:44:02.620]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:06.420]  The flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:08.940]  Here is a portion from CBS News.
[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:10.940]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:14.780]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:19.020]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:44:19.020 --> 02:44:22.500]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:26.500]  They took the babies out of 80 bears, and let the children to die on a cold spot.
[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:30.260]  It was almost as if there were a plan in full with John Kent.
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:34.420]  We need you to go into the capital, set, set, set.
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:36.620]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:38.260]  They are nothing but distract.
[02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:41.100]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:42.980]  You silenced those voices.
[02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:46.580]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset, but...
[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:52.460]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the soonest, these globalists are going to
[02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:58.540]  be present.
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:01.220]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:06.100]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:10.100]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:11.460]  It takes commitment.

[02:46:59.340 --> 02:47:07.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:18.140]  All right, the great Bob Barnes is in studio, he's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:21.540]  I've got one more segment with him though, I want to get into some other news stories.
[02:47:21.540 --> 02:47:26.860]  Now quickly before I get into what I really want to get into with Bob here, folks, this
[02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:36.140]  story about the mayor of College Park, Maryland is getting worse and worse.
[02:47:36.140 --> 02:47:40.780]  That mayor arrested for possession and distribution of child pornography met with Nancy Pelosi,
[02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:48.780]  the Dalai Lama, Lady Gaga, hung out with Pete Booty Judge and in fact was mentored by Pete
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:50.300]  Booty Judge.
[02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:55.060]  56 counts, possession and distribution of child pornography.
[02:47:55.060 --> 02:48:00.320]  Now we know Lady Gaga is into the spirit cooking type stuff as well as other Democrats
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:07.300]  revealed in the WikiLeaks emails and I think we know plenty about Pete Booty Judge that
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:14.100]  he's mentoring this guy who turns out to be a pedophile charged with possession and distribution
[02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:16.260]  of child pornography.
[02:48:16.260 --> 02:48:26.380]  Distribution, distribution, hangs out with Pete Booty Judge, hangs out with Nancy Pelosi.
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:31.140]  So they're going to try to put this thing to rest, but between Sam Brent and Pete Booty
[02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:37.120]  Judge and Patrick Wojon, I think you're getting a pretty good idea what the modern day left
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:38.120]  is all about.
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:44.500]  Katie Hobbs and Arizona Republicans push out a CPS director who wants to stop child trafficking.
[02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:48.820]  Patrick Halley has that story, we may bring him on next week to discuss it, but I want
[02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:55.740]  to, well we can get Bob's opinion on that or I want to introduce this to him as well,
[02:48:55.740 --> 02:49:02.340]  Tennessee becomes first state to ban drag shows on public property near schools, banning
[02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:07.980]  public drag shows, and then I love this, I'll introduce it to you like this Bob, this is
[02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.340]  from the Associated Press.
[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:17.180]  As Tennessee and others target drag shows, many wonder why?
[02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:21.740]  Well if you're wondering why, you haven't been paying attention I would say if you don't
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:22.740]  understand why.
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:23.740]  What do you think?
[02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:25.860]  What do you think this goes legally?
[02:49:25.860 --> 02:49:29.460]  I think Tennessee wins, I mean I think any attempt to challenge it that is within their
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:35.380]  rights that you don't have a First Amendment right to put other people's kids on your
[02:49:35.380 --> 02:49:39.500]  lap and pretend you're a woman when you're a man in that manner.
[02:49:39.500 --> 02:49:40.740]  That one's not in the Bill of Rights?
[02:49:40.740 --> 02:49:41.740]  That's not included.
[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:46.540]  So you have certain expressive rights in your own home, you have certain expressive rights
[02:49:46.540 --> 02:49:50.340]  in certain settings, so certain adult, but for example think about all the regulations
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:52.860]  over adult clubs.
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:57.460]  If you can put all those regulations in for a strip club, how can you not put in those
[02:49:57.460 --> 02:50:03.100]  regulations when it's limited to please don't do this next to a school or in a public library?
[02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:06.700]  I mean really, I mean you couldn't do a strip club inside of a library, couldn't do a strip
[02:50:06.700 --> 02:50:07.700]  club next to a school.
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:10.180]  I don't give the Democrats any ideas.
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:11.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:12.540]  Be careful.
[02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:16.420]  Yeah, I mean you know, if you want to kill the appeal of strip clubs, have a lot of these
[02:50:16.420 --> 02:50:18.260]  folks do it, tell me the end of it.
[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:23.900]  But I think legally they're absolutely within their rights, they definitely have the basis
[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:24.900]  to do so.
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:27.420]  The left's complaints that this is somehow discriminatory.
[02:50:27.420 --> 02:50:31.660]  The other aspect of this is, the left is pretending this is based on medicine and science.
[02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:34.900]  We're seeing more and more lawsuits and more and more will be brought.
[02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:38.300]  I mean I have a lot of experience representing victims of domestic violence, have done it
[02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:44.420]  for free for 25 plus years, and the worst offenders are in the trans community.
[02:50:44.420 --> 02:50:48.980]  It's the highest rate of violence, of interpartner violence, one of the highest, they're just
[02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:51.540]  mental disturbed individuals overwhelmingly.
[02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:55.900]  I mean a man pretending to be a woman beating up a woman, yeah.
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:56.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:56.900 --> 02:51:01.260]  I mean you have these, especially with these kids, I mean kids are clearly just, some of
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:06.380]  them are playing games, some of them are the rest, but when you start introducing these
[02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:10.900]  cultural mean mechanisms to these kids through the public educational system, through the
[02:51:10.900 --> 02:51:15.740]  public libraries, you're distorting their minds in dangerous and deceiving ways.
[02:51:15.740 --> 02:51:21.020]  But not only that, when you add to it medical interventions, you're ruining their lives.
[02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:24.820]  I mean these people who are not, these kids are not ready to make a decision of that sort
[02:51:24.820 --> 02:51:30.500]  anyway, even if you believe that such a decision could or should be made medically or religiously
[02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:36.020]  or any other reason, they're not ready at 12 years old, 13 years old, 14 years, to start
[02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:39.540]  changing their body, to start changing their body permanently.
[02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:44.460]  The lawsuits are going to be long and coming for a while over that, we're already starting
[02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:45.860]  to see it happen.
[02:51:45.860 --> 02:51:49.940]  And so that's why this is not about discriminating against a vulnerable group, this is about
[02:51:49.940 --> 02:51:54.460]  protecting a vulnerable group from the predators who would like to prey upon them.
[02:51:54.460 --> 02:51:59.580]  What would happen if I set up a tattoo parlor for minors?
[02:51:59.580 --> 02:52:02.340]  And people were coming in under the age of 18, I think that's probably the legal age
[02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:07.180]  in all states, maybe most states, and I was setting up a tattoo parlor for minors and it
[02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:10.420]  turned out, the minors, you know, high school kids, whatever found out, hey, go to this
[02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:13.780]  tattoo parlor, he'll give you a tattoo, it doesn't matter if you're under 18, what would
[02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:14.780]  happen to me?
[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:15.780]  Oh yeah, I mean you'd go to jail.
[02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:20.220]  I mean so, we have all these restrictions, I mean you can't even get earrings at certain
[02:52:20.220 --> 02:52:24.180]  levels, you can't even do piercings at certain ages, so I mean we have all these restrictions
[02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:28.020]  of all kinds of what you can drink, what you can eat at different times, et cetera, and
[02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:31.940]  the idea of how you just put some mark on your body that can actually these days be
[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:37.380]  taken away, not too terribly, but I might attest to that somewhat differently.
[02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:38.380]  You got a little experience.
[02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:42.540]  Yeah, exactly, exactly, it seemed like a good idea at the time I was in Bora Bora, so I
[02:52:42.540 --> 02:52:49.300]  have a plausible explanation, but the nature, the idea that you can do this to little kids
[02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:54.420]  and that you somehow have a right to do so, and that somehow you're protecting the vulnerable
[02:52:54.420 --> 02:52:57.180]  by doing so is just multiple levels of insanity.
[02:52:57.180 --> 02:53:02.100]  This is like, I wish I had like a team of cartoonists or something, because you could
[02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:08.300]  do like a little short cartoon or a movie or something, and two businesses pop up at
[02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:13.500]  the same time, one of them is a tattoo parlor for minors, one of them is a gender transition
[02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:17.180]  surgery for minors, and one of them gets shut down.
[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:18.180]  Which one do you think it is?
[02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:20.700]  And one of them gets government grants, I mean, I mean that's how.
[02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:22.900]  One of them gets promoted on mainstream news.
[02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:28.100]  So Lily, one of them gets paraded as an organization that's helping children, I mean, when it's
[02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:30.660]  hurting children by any objective definition.
[02:53:30.660 --> 02:53:31.660]  Irreversible.
[02:53:31.660 --> 02:53:34.300]  Completely, and it's the sign usually, as other people pointed out, of the decline
[02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:35.300]  of society.
[02:53:35.300 --> 02:53:39.260]  If you want to look at the societies and civilizations that have collapsed over time, one of the
[02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:44.060]  signs is the acceptance of various forms of sexual deviancy, of just, you know, once
[02:53:44.060 --> 02:53:48.220]  it gets too loose, too liberal, too without meaning, too without limits, the net effect
[02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:51.580]  of it is that that's a sign that society itself is crumbling.
[02:53:51.580 --> 02:53:52.580]  And that's what this is.
[02:53:52.580 --> 02:53:56.980]  To preserve our society, not only protect children, Tennessee's laws and laws like it
[02:53:56.980 --> 02:53:57.980]  need to be everywhere.
[02:53:57.980 --> 02:53:58.980]  Yep.
[02:53:58.980 --> 02:54:01.980]  And that's why, I mean, Texas needs to get on board with this, a bunch of states that
[02:54:01.980 --> 02:54:05.700]  have been a little bit slow to act, need to get on board with this, just as they got
[02:54:05.700 --> 02:54:10.140]  on board with prohibiting vaccine mandates, just as they got on board with election law
[02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:14.620]  reform, they need to get on board with protecting our children from, I mean, how many cases
[02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:21.340]  have you seen, read and heard about, of these tranny, the library school drag queens that
[02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:25.940]  end up arrested for issues like you were talking about, or have prior records like the ones
[02:54:25.940 --> 02:54:26.940]  you're talking about.
[02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:27.940]  I mean, it's not a coincidence.
[02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:32.220]  They keep showing up with child porn issues, sexual abuse issues, domestic violence issues.
[02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:37.480]  By the way, hasn't there been some legal precedent as far as like cigarette companies doing marketing
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:41.940]  aim towards children or alcohol companies doing marketing aim towards children?
[02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:43.820]  And they usually win in court.
[02:54:43.820 --> 02:54:49.300]  In fact, I mean, up until a few years ago, it used to be illegal to promote pharmaceuticals
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:50.300]  to children.
[02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:54.220]  Now, of course, they got little Elmo out there and hey, get your little vaccine shot.
[02:54:54.220 --> 02:54:58.100]  I mean, it's just the level of insanity has just gone off the charts.
[02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:00.780]  And you know, that case where we'll have to take to the appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court
[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:05.420]  of Appeals because the federal judge in Waco said nobody can sue, which we think is a problem.
[02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:09.660]  But all of this, another area where legislative reform needs to take place because it's something
[02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:12.660]  that's gone beyond all norms, all boundaries.
[02:55:12.660 --> 02:55:17.860]  I mean, you're seeing these little kids go to school boards, talk out loud about the
[02:55:17.860 --> 02:55:20.140]  crazy crap that's in their library.
[02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:21.140]  Reading from the books.
[02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:25.340]  No, but I mean, remember, we used to go to the store, they used to hide Playboy behind
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:29.340]  like the thing, you know, like the little brown thing, special permission, I always
[02:55:29.340 --> 02:55:30.340]  bring it up.
[02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:34.460]  The my school library at my elementary school would always get the Guinness Book of World
[02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:35.460]  Records.
[02:55:35.460 --> 02:55:36.460]  Every new year it came out.
[02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:37.460]  The kids loved it.
[02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:38.460]  We loved the Guinness Book of Records.
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:39.460]  It was fun.
[02:55:39.460 --> 02:55:40.460]  And then there was one year.
[02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:41.460]  I think it was 2000 or 2001.
[02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:44.380]  They put in the world's biggest breasts.
[02:55:44.380 --> 02:55:49.700]  And on page 99, I may even still remember the page on page 99, it was this woman in a
[02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:53.500]  bikini with her gigantic breasts and what do you know, the guys liked looking at it.
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:54.900]  We liked looking at the breasts.
[02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:58.340]  And so eventually the teachers found out, you know what they did, they ripped the page
[02:55:58.340 --> 02:55:59.840]  out of the book.
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:00.840]  Simple as that.
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:01.840]  Problem solved.
[02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:05.100]  Now they probably say, hey, let's bring in the biggest breasted woman in the world and
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:07.060]  have her do a little striptease for you.
[02:56:07.060 --> 02:56:11.140]  Yeah, well, I mean, especially these books that are basically how-to books on how to
[02:56:11.140 --> 02:56:12.140]  groom a child.
[02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:14.140]  I mean, that's what some of these books are.
[02:56:14.140 --> 02:56:15.500]  They're grooming mechanisms.
[02:56:15.500 --> 02:56:19.340]  I mean, they have no business being in a public library, they have no business being in...
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:23.540]  And I'm someone that's a robust supporter of free speech, but we've always recognized
[02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:25.060]  the right to protect children.
[02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:26.780]  Yeah, child abuse is not free speech.
[02:56:26.780 --> 02:56:27.780]  Exactly.
[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:29.860]  Now, quickly here, Gavin Newsom responds to this bill.
[02:56:29.860 --> 02:56:34.260]  He says, Tennessee has the eighth highest murder rate in the nation.
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:38.700]  It ranks 44th among states for health outcomes, and this is what the governor is focused on.
[02:56:38.700 --> 02:56:42.100]  You know, it's funny, he says, Tennessee, the eighth highest murder rate in the nation.
[02:56:42.100 --> 02:56:45.940]  I'm going to go ahead and guess that most of those murders are happening in Memphis,
[02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:48.700]  run by Democrats, and the rest of the state's probably pretty safe.
[02:56:48.700 --> 02:56:49.700]  I don't know, what do you think?
[02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:52.740]  Oh, I mean, I'm from Tennessee, so it's all going to be Democrat-run cities where the
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:53.740]  crime is.
[02:56:53.740 --> 02:56:54.740]  Number one.
[02:56:54.740 --> 02:57:00.940]  Number two, does anybody think you're safer in LA, in San Francisco these days, almost
[02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:06.500]  anywhere in coastal California than you are in the countryside of Tennessee?
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:07.780]  There's nobody who really thinks that.
[02:57:07.780 --> 02:57:09.820]  There's nobody who thinks, oh, I'm going to...
[02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:11.020]  Well, what about Gavin Newsom?
[02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:12.700]  Wow, yeah, other than Gavin.
[02:57:12.700 --> 02:57:15.380]  I mean, Gavin is invited to Tennessee anytime he wants.
[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:17.780]  He should go hanging out in North Memphis for a couple nights.
[02:57:17.780 --> 02:57:18.980]  Did you have some fun?
[02:57:18.980 --> 02:57:20.980]  Well, they'll be nice to Gavin in Tennessee.
[02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:21.980]  They have no problems.
[02:57:21.980 --> 02:57:25.060]  You know, just as long as he doesn't dress up as a woman and try to get their kids on
[02:57:25.060 --> 02:57:26.060]  his lap.
[02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:32.100]  I think that Gavin Newsom should prove how bad Tennessee is, or how good it is, maybe
[02:57:32.100 --> 02:57:36.300]  by going to Democrat-run Memphis, and he can see just how safe it is hanging out with
[02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:37.300]  Congressman Cohen.
[02:57:37.300 --> 02:57:42.460]  And then you can find out how Tennessee became the eighth murder capital of the United States,
[02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:48.180]  not because of red areas, blue areas.
[02:57:48.180 --> 02:57:52.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:56.420]  book that documents the globalists and their own words, planned for our future, that is
[02:57:56.420 --> 02:57:57.420]  the hellish future.
[02:57:57.420 --> 02:58:01.300]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, that are starting to ban them,
[02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:05.220]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:07.220]  Amazon, or m4chore.com.
[02:58:07.220 --> 02:58:11.340]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[02:58:11.340 --> 02:58:15.340]  we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:58:15.340 --> 02:58:20.740]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at m4chore.com.
[02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:24.660]  And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:28.260]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know
[02:58:28.260 --> 02:58:30.180]  that you help keep m4's on the air.
[02:58:30.180 --> 02:58:33.740]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned
[02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:39.020]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to m4chore.com and get
[02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:43.380]  a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give
[02:58:43.380 --> 02:58:44.860]  them to the local school.
[02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:47.860]  This is an info war I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:58:47.860 --> 02:58:52.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the
[02:58:52.380 --> 02:58:56.180]  globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[02:58:56.180 --> 02:59:00.180]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners support while selling you great
[02:59:00.180 --> 02:59:01.620]  products at the same time.

[02:59:49.340 --> 03:00:03.540]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:05.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:05.100 --> 03:00:09.940]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting today, just got through with some various arguments
[03:00:09.940 --> 03:00:14.500]  in various courts in Texas, and we'll see how all those turn out.
[03:00:14.500 --> 03:00:19.700]  The reason why the vaccine issue goes beyond just this vaccine or this particular drug
[03:00:19.700 --> 03:00:25.300]  company in the case of Pfizer, or goes beyond just some of the issues involving COVID-19
[03:00:25.300 --> 03:00:29.860]  and pandemic response, we're seeing in the World Health Organization's proposed treaty.
[03:00:29.860 --> 03:00:34.040]  Now, there's been various statements out there that have suggested this treaty could
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:38.940]  be constitutionally enforceable without Senate approval.
[03:00:38.940 --> 03:00:39.940]  That is not true.
[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:43.860]  Now, that does not mean that they won't try to do something like that.
[03:00:43.860 --> 03:00:49.260]  But to be very clear, our founders established in the Constitution that the treaty, no treaty,
[03:00:49.260 --> 03:00:54.660]  can be governing law in the United States unless it meets two prior prerequisites.
[03:00:54.660 --> 03:01:00.700]  The first one is the Senate must, two thirds of the Senate must consent and agree to the
[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:02.900]  treaty before it is passed.
[03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:08.020]  So the process is first you have your sort of diplomats or other officials from the executive
[03:01:08.020 --> 03:01:14.460]  branch sign the treaty, then they take that and the president must propose the treaty
[03:01:14.460 --> 03:01:16.300]  to the United States Senate.
[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:21.140]  The United States Senate then must debate it, discuss it, and vote upon it.
[03:01:21.140 --> 03:01:26.580]  Often the way most treaties through history get buried is the Senate never votes on it,
[03:01:26.580 --> 03:01:28.300]  or the president never submits it.
[03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:30.700]  This kind of happened with the Paris Accords.
[03:01:30.700 --> 03:01:35.180]  So you had President Obama sign something and I'll get into when an executive agreement
[03:01:35.180 --> 03:01:38.420]  has certain enforceability rules in just a second.
[03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:43.120]  But the President Obama never submitted it in some cases to the Senate because he knew
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:44.780]  the Senate would reject it.
[03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:49.180]  Other ones that were proposed to the Senate, the Senate never even voted upon and thus died
[03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:53.700]  a slow death, kind of a pocket veto as it's described in some cases when the executive
[03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:55.260]  branch is in that role.
[03:01:55.260 --> 03:01:56.460]  But that's the first part.
[03:01:56.460 --> 03:02:01.020]  But even then, and so even if the president sign it, the president deliver it, the president
[03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:06.140]  propose it, the Senate debate it and the Senate sign it, they're still not implementing legislation
[03:02:06.140 --> 03:02:12.900]  to make its terms enforceable as law under the Constitution in the United States.
[03:02:12.900 --> 03:02:14.940]  That requires a second requirement.
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:18.580]  So first requirement, president approve, president propose, two-thirds of the Senate
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:19.820]  agree.
[03:02:19.820 --> 03:02:24.380]  Second part of the proposal, the House must propose implementing legislation.
[03:02:24.380 --> 03:02:28.340]  The House must then pass that implementing legislation by majority vote.
[03:02:28.340 --> 03:02:33.420]  The Senate must then pass that and the president must also separately sign that.
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:38.860]  That's the second precondition for enforceable constitutional treaties in the United States.
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:43.340]  But it's not all because it also still must be constitutional.
[03:02:43.340 --> 03:02:44.340]  What does that mean?
[03:02:44.340 --> 03:02:50.580]  It means that a treaty is seen as basically equal to a federal statute or an executive
[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:56.980]  action in the sense that it is subject to and subordinate to the U.S. Constitution and
[03:02:56.980 --> 03:02:58.980]  its other requirements.
[03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:01.100]  What are some of those other requirements?
[03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:05.620]  Those other requirements include all of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:11.020]  So to give an example, there is a role for the judicial branch to play if somebody brings
[03:03:11.020 --> 03:03:16.860]  a legal challenge to the treaty and the implementing legislation on the grounds that it violates
[03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:21.840]  some Bill of Rights provision, such as the First Amendment right of press or speech or
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:25.820]  association or religion or the right to petition your government.
[03:03:25.820 --> 03:03:30.220]  There are provisions in this World Health Organization treaty that do in fact violate
[03:03:30.220 --> 03:03:32.860]  core First Amendment rights in the Constitution.
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:36.580]  Now there's a little provision of this, by the way, that in the World Health Organization
[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:41.900]  treaty that it requires that it be passed a consistent to the Constitution of each governing
[03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:42.900]  state.
[03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:48.460]  What does that mean? It means our Constitution is superimposed as conditions, limitations
[03:03:48.460 --> 03:03:54.060]  and restrictions on the World Health Organization treaty itself under our constitutional standards
[03:03:54.060 --> 03:03:57.300]  and under the plain language of the proposed treaty itself.
[03:03:57.300 --> 03:04:01.540]  But so who else can bring a challenge is not only any of those provisions, there's Second
[03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:06.140]  Amendment right of self-defense issues implicated by the World Health Organization treaty, Fourth
[03:04:06.140 --> 03:04:10.660]  Amendment issues against wrongful searches or seizures without probable cause of a crime
[03:04:10.660 --> 03:04:15.660]  or done unreasonable, Fifth Amendment rights to due process of law concerning property
[03:04:15.660 --> 03:04:20.580]  or liberty, Fifth Amendment rights to no property being taken without just compensation, Sixth
[03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:24.460]  Amendment rights, Seventh Amendment rights to trial by jury, Eighth Amendment rights
[03:04:24.460 --> 03:04:29.300]  against unreasonable fines, all of these could be implicated but not the least of which is
[03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:33.740]  the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which is the right of the states to govern
[03:04:33.740 --> 03:04:36.180]  and control what? Healthcare.
[03:04:36.180 --> 03:04:41.060]  This is a key component in provision as well. So when we get back we'll discuss a little
[03:04:41.060 --> 03:04:45.660]  bit more about the real dangers of the World Health Organization treaty, but also the real
[03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:51.420]  constitutional solutions available to us to stop this from becoming enforceable law in
[03:04:51.420 --> 03:04:59.820]  the United States. The dangers are real, but so are the remedies.
[03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:06.340]  Treaty is in a fight for its very life and InfoWars for decades has been at the very forefront
[03:05:06.340 --> 03:05:11.020]  of the fight for a pro-human future. We can't stay on air without your help and I want to
[03:05:11.020 --> 03:05:14.260]  thank you all for your past support and I want to encourage those of you that have never

[03:05:47.900 --> 03:05:51.060]  as well. In the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books so we didn't
[03:05:51.060 --> 03:05:58.540]  have them for sale, but now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[03:05:58.540 --> 03:06:08.660]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[03:06:08.660 --> 03:06:13.020]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[03:06:13.020 --> 03:06:14.020]  one!
[03:06:14.020 --> 03:06:39.420]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:44.500]  The bill of rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the
[03:06:44.500 --> 03:06:49.140]  left doesn't like, at least in government. But there's a new avenue for those who would
[03:06:49.140 --> 03:06:54.620]  like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations. The left have wised
[03:06:54.620 --> 03:07:00.820]  up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it,
[03:07:00.820 --> 03:07:02.980]  the social media giants, and they are.
[03:07:02.980 --> 03:07:07.780]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent
[03:07:07.780 --> 03:07:08.780]  them from speaking.
[03:07:08.780 --> 03:07:12.220]  The far most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio
[03:07:12.220 --> 03:07:13.540]  show host Alex Jones.
[03:07:13.540 --> 03:07:17.540]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big
[03:07:17.540 --> 03:07:21.300]  Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[03:07:21.300 --> 03:07:25.940]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can
[03:07:25.940 --> 03:07:27.300]  you ban this person?
[03:07:27.300 --> 03:07:32.620]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content
[03:07:32.620 --> 03:07:34.340]  will be a little harder to find.
[03:07:34.340 --> 03:07:38.620]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead
[03:07:38.620 --> 03:07:43.500]  attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working
[03:07:43.500 --> 03:07:44.940]  with Big Tech.
[03:07:44.940 --> 03:07:47.860]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[03:07:47.860 --> 03:07:52.460]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:07:52.460 --> 03:07:57.820]  In a free country, everyone can be heard. In totalitarian societies, only the powerful
[03:07:57.820 --> 03:08:05.900]  can be heard.
[03:08:05.900 --> 03:08:10.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Robert Barnes here, guest hosting with Alexis Anderson
[03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:12.500]  here with me in studio.
[03:08:12.500 --> 03:08:17.340]  She had the privilege this week of making her first oral argument in any federal case
[03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:22.580]  concerning the case of Brooke Jackson and the way in which she was retaliated against in
[03:08:22.580 --> 03:08:23.580]  her employment.
[03:08:23.580 --> 03:08:28.060]  And we'll be discussing that and more as the rest of the show proceeds.
[03:08:28.060 --> 03:08:33.620]  One important thing to recognize in all of this as the intro talked about is that the
[03:08:33.620 --> 03:08:38.460]  key to independent information getting out there, the key to whistleblowers finding out
[03:08:38.460 --> 03:08:44.020]  about this case that the mainstream and corporate media has mostly taken great efforts to suppress.
[03:08:44.020 --> 03:08:50.460]  The most important consequential case arguably in the world that could expose and hold accountable
[03:08:50.460 --> 03:08:56.860]  those drug companies like Pfizer that lied in order to be able to get this vaccine, so-called
[03:08:56.860 --> 03:09:02.620]  vaccine out there into the mass public to basically drug up the mass world population
[03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:07.340]  with a drug that turned out to be dangerous, ineffective, wasn't a vaccine, was basically
[03:09:07.340 --> 03:09:13.620]  a gene therapy that did not in fact prevent COVID-19 is because of Infowars. It's because
[03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:21.380]  of your audience. It's because of you. And to continue to support Infowars at infowarsstore.com.
[03:09:21.380 --> 03:09:26.420]  What was supposed to happen a long time ago with the war waged on Alex Jones was first
[03:09:26.420 --> 03:09:32.820]  to take him out. And the goal was to take out Infowars itself, the existence of it, the
[03:09:32.820 --> 03:09:37.220]  network, the people, the audience, the various people who help create content here, and then
[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:43.300]  then to use it as an example to intimidate and terrorize other independent content creators
[03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:48.260]  from even broaching into this space to such a degree that they would censor themselves
[03:09:48.260 --> 03:09:53.660]  and avoid communicating independent information like the critical aspects of Brooke Jackson's
[03:09:53.660 --> 03:09:59.220]  whistleblower claims that expose that Pfizer knew from the get-go that it did not have
[03:09:59.220 --> 03:10:04.740]  honest, accurate clinical data that it could rely upon or trust to be able to make the
[03:10:04.740 --> 03:10:10.500]  claims of safety and efficacy that they falsely made to the Trump Defense Department to secure
[03:10:10.500 --> 03:10:15.740]  billions of dollars for what was in fact a very dangerous drug that was often through
[03:10:15.740 --> 03:10:21.660]  mandates then forced upon people around the world. And so that is only possible. The only
[03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:25.380]  reason why none of that happened. The only reason why the independent content creation
[03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:31.420]  continues to expand and even explode in places like Rumble and places like Locals and a wide
[03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:36.820]  range of diverse technological platforms that are out there is solely and wholly because
[03:10:36.820 --> 03:10:44.620]  of you, the audience keeping Infowars on air. You keeping Alex Jones' voice to be heard.
[03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:48.700]  Your ability not only in sharing the links and supporting the network, but by supporting
[03:10:48.700 --> 03:10:53.700]  it by buying things that make yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser in the process. That is
[03:10:53.700 --> 03:10:59.380]  why continue to go to InfowarsStore.com. Find something that you like. I've been buying
[03:10:59.380 --> 03:11:04.020]  there for the better part of two decades. Find something that you already need that
[03:11:04.020 --> 03:11:09.300]  you already want often at a more affordable price than you can get anywhere else for the
[03:11:09.300 --> 03:11:13.820]  quality that you get. You can read all of the reviews that are on there at some of the
[03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:19.380]  most well liked, well reviewed products of any company in the world and their products
[03:11:19.380 --> 03:11:24.860]  that are designed to compete with companies like Big Pharma by being able to use natural
[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:29.780]  supplements that are not dependent on big drug companies, that are not dependent on certain
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:35.260]  patented protections, that are not dependent upon these corrupt entities who wish to control
[03:11:35.260 --> 03:11:41.380]  us rather than empower us. And you are allowing Infowars the network itself to continue to
[03:11:41.380 --> 03:11:46.340]  exist just by finding things that you like that are there. Whether it's things to help
[03:11:46.340 --> 03:11:51.500]  your brain focus, help you wake up, help you get to sleep, help you process food, help
[03:11:51.500 --> 03:11:56.180]  make your body just healthier on a day to day basis, or whether it's informing yourself
[03:11:56.180 --> 03:12:00.580]  in terms of the books that are available, films that are available, or fun clothes that
[03:12:00.580 --> 03:12:04.820]  you can have, little bumper stickers you can put on. One of the things that I was impressed
[03:12:04.820 --> 03:12:09.940]  with is almost anywhere I go I meet members of the Infowars audience. That was no less
[03:12:09.940 --> 03:12:14.420]  true of the Brooke Jackson hearing. While the big corporate media was running away and was
[03:12:14.420 --> 03:12:18.980]  scared to be in the courtroom to cover the case, there were many independent media members
[03:12:18.980 --> 03:12:23.860]  who were there and wanted to cover the case, and it included disproportionately members
[03:12:23.860 --> 03:12:28.900]  of the Infowars audience. So whether it's Brain Force Plus or anything else, that's
[03:12:28.900 --> 03:12:33.980]  a product I bought, the bone broth is a product I bought, a wide range of products that I
[03:12:33.980 --> 03:12:38.020]  bought, all happy and satisfied with them over the many years, there are things on there
[03:12:38.020 --> 03:12:42.020]  that you can find that you like, that you enjoy, that you need, that are more affordable,
[03:12:42.020 --> 03:12:47.340]  more accessible anywhere else. The quality is unbeatable, that keeps Infowars on the
[03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:52.820]  air, and as long as Infowars is alive, it reminds me of what my great great great granddaddy
[03:12:52.820 --> 03:12:58.220]  said at Bunker Hill, don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes. By keeping Bunker
[03:12:58.220 --> 03:13:02.100]  Hill alive, even though they didn't win that battle that day, we won the Revolutionary
[03:13:02.100 --> 03:13:07.500]  War in part because people held the line. So as long as the audience at Infowars continues
[03:13:07.500 --> 03:13:13.300]  to hold the line by supporting Infowars at InfowarsStore.com, you are taking a critical
[03:13:13.300 --> 03:13:17.860]  essential step because that's one of the things many people ask me, what can I do to make
[03:13:17.860 --> 03:13:22.220]  a difference? What can I do to support what's happening? Well, one of the key ways you can
[03:13:22.220 --> 03:13:27.860]  do it is continuing to shop at InfowarsStore.com. You heard the lawyers in Connecticut after
[03:13:27.860 --> 03:13:33.260]  they won the case, a case that was a disgrace to the rule of law in America of billions
[03:13:33.260 --> 03:13:38.020]  of dollars of so-called damages, they made clear their goal wasn't to collect a penny
[03:13:38.020 --> 03:13:42.660]  in damages, their goal was to shut Infowars down. And they said, you Infowars audience,
[03:13:42.660 --> 03:13:48.500]  now is the time to stop buying from InfowarsStore.com. So there's no better way of paying them back
[03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:54.580]  by continuing to support InfowarsStore.com. There's no better way to prevent them from
[03:13:54.580 --> 03:14:00.440]  their real objective of those bogus claims brought in a courtroom that was contaminated
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:06.580]  from beginning to end in those proceedings than to continue to keep Infowars on the air
[03:14:06.580 --> 03:14:12.260]  alive by supporting it at InfowarsStore.com. And so I thank all of you for doing so. That's
[03:14:12.260 --> 03:14:16.780]  as critical as anything else out there. You cannot underestimate it. The government didn't
[03:14:16.780 --> 03:14:23.620]  have FBI agents dedicated to doing nothing more than watching Infowars affiliated accounts
[03:14:23.620 --> 03:14:28.820]  on Twitter. Some of our Facebook or other social media sites, some of them had 25 followers,
[03:14:28.820 --> 03:14:35.300]  and a lot of times ordinary people forget the real power, the real import, the real consequence
[03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:39.820]  their own individual actions can have. I like to say that the greatest trick the devil ever
[03:14:39.820 --> 03:14:45.420]  pulled is convincing people he did not exist. The greatest trick the system ever pulled
[03:14:45.420 --> 03:14:50.940]  is convincing people you cannot resist. When you realize you can, when you realize how
[03:14:50.940 --> 03:14:55.500]  much power there is in your own individual action with something as simple, something
[03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:59.780]  as straightforward as buying a product you need and you wanted an affordable, accessible
[03:14:59.780 --> 03:15:04.700]  price that keeps networks like Infowars on the line, you realize the power you have is
[03:15:04.700 --> 03:15:10.020]  real. The power you have is palpable. You are just as important and as significant as
[03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:13.980]  the person standing in front of that tank in Tenement Square. And chances are you'll
[03:15:13.980 --> 03:15:19.500]  have more success than they did at being able to recreate the world in an image reflective
[03:15:19.500 --> 03:15:24.260]  of our founders and not the corrupt politicians who dominate Washington, D.C. in the swamp
[03:15:24.260 --> 03:15:30.020]  today. That is what all of this is about. So thank you for continuing to support Infowars.
[03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:35.580]  I encourage you to continue to do so. Go to infowarsstore.com today. Find something you
[03:15:35.580 --> 03:15:39.340]  like. Find something a friend would like. Find something a family member would like.
[03:15:39.340 --> 03:15:44.220]  Find something a neighbor would like. And get it. Continue to keep Infowars on the air.
[03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:48.820]  Continue to keep the Revolution alive. Continue to keep our founders' dreams at the forefront
[03:15:48.820 --> 03:15:55.820]  of the American Liberty experiment. And when we come back, more on the WHO Treaty and more.
[03:16:18.820 --> 03:16:23.020]  I have Infowars to thank for that. Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President
[03:16:23.020 --> 03:16:27.940]  Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically
[03:16:27.940 --> 03:16:32.860]  trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team. I really do credit that as to why I'm
[03:16:32.860 --> 03:16:38.460]  able to, you know, get these types of clips. Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know,
[03:16:38.460 --> 03:16:43.540]  go where the story is. Go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that I'm addicted
[03:16:43.540 --> 03:16:48.140]  to the insanity. I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:16:48.140 --> 03:16:51.820]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, living and filling that within me early on
[03:16:51.820 --> 03:16:55.140]  in my career.
[03:16:55.140 --> 03:17:02.580]  I've got some good news. Our high quality supplements really work and we have about
[03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:08.380]  an 80% reorder rate with customers. That's the good news. They're amazing. The bad news
[03:17:08.380 --> 03:17:14.100]  is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to Infowars.org.com
[03:17:14.100 --> 03:17:18.380]  and ever actually buy the products. So you're missing out on these products plus it funds
[03:17:18.380 --> 03:17:23.620]  the Infowar. Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying
[03:17:23.620 --> 03:17:30.020]  products. Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to Infowars.org.com
[03:17:30.020 --> 03:17:34.580]  and got some of these amazing products. I would recommend Tomb of Rick 95 for your joints,
[03:17:34.580 --> 03:17:38.700]  your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder and see how
[03:17:38.700 --> 03:17:44.580]  great it is. Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good
[03:17:44.580 --> 03:17:49.080]  for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well. Or Real Red
[03:17:49.080 --> 03:17:53.700]  Pill Plus. Just go try the product, fund the Infowar and help us defeat the new ruler
[03:17:53.700 --> 03:17:59.100]  together. Infowars.org.com.
[03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:05.060]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane
[03:18:05.060 --> 03:18:09.620]  place. World War 3 has already started. Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[03:18:09.620 --> 03:18:13.380]  There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas. The list goes
[03:18:13.380 --> 03:18:16.580]  on and on of the bad things that are happening. But the good things that are happening is
[03:18:16.580 --> 03:18:21.620]  humanity is really accelerating its awakening. But those of us on the forefront are under
[03:18:21.620 --> 03:18:25.900]  more attack by the establishment than ever. That's why I'm counting on you to spread
[03:18:25.900 --> 03:18:29.380]  the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to hit the broadcast on
[03:18:29.380 --> 03:18:33.780]  the air by getting great products at Infowars.org.com. And whether it's a final signed copy, they're

[03:19:42.060 --> 03:19:45.300]  Reset in the War for the World, and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively
[03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:49.540]  available at Infowars.org.com as well. In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't
[03:19:49.540 --> 03:19:53.020]  sign the books, we didn't have them for sale. But now, I sign the last books and get them
[03:19:53.020 --> 03:20:00.020]  right down.
[03:20:23.020 --> 03:20:48.020]  This is my book, The Great Reset in the War for the World.
[03:20:48.020 --> 03:20:53.180]  So, you're a young lawyer. What led you to be interested in going into this space in
[03:20:53.180 --> 03:20:58.020]  terms of public advocacy about issues about vaccine mandates, issues about the public
[03:20:58.020 --> 03:21:02.100]  health consequences of Brook Jackson's whistleblower suit, things like that?
[03:21:02.100 --> 03:21:08.300]  Of course. Well, I really do have to credit Infowars to some extent, because it was through
[03:21:08.300 --> 03:21:15.540]  their coverage of the 2020 COVID scam that led me to realize what an issue this was legally.
[03:21:15.540 --> 03:21:19.780]  I was in law school in Maine at the time. I was a second-year law student when COVID
[03:21:19.780 --> 03:21:25.740]  hit, and everything got shut down, and all of a sudden, I was doing virtual Zoom law school.
[03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:31.020]  And businesses were being shut down, the state was shut down, and nobody in my sphere was
[03:21:31.020 --> 03:21:34.860]  talking about the legal ramifications of any of this, none of my professors, none of my
[03:21:34.860 --> 03:21:39.380]  fellow classmates. And I'm sitting there thinking, certainly there are issues here that are
[03:21:39.380 --> 03:21:46.900]  going to have to come up. And so, as we saw that the crazy grab of power that year, everyone
[03:21:46.900 --> 03:21:50.020]  knew that there was going to be a vaccine coming. Everyone knew that there were going
[03:21:50.020 --> 03:21:54.020]  to be vaccine mandates, and Infowars was one of the first people to actually come out and
[03:21:54.020 --> 03:21:57.620]  say, you need to watch out for this. This is something that's going to happen. And it
[03:21:57.620 --> 03:22:01.860]  was at that moment that I realized, you know, I was in school to be an environmental attorney
[03:22:01.860 --> 03:22:07.300]  at the time. That was kind of my plan. I realized that there are such big issues that are coming
[03:22:07.300 --> 03:22:13.580]  down the pipeline, and I couldn't not try to contribute. And so, it was really the vaccine
[03:22:13.580 --> 03:22:17.300]  mandates, the appending vaccine mandates that caused me to get involved in this type of
[03:22:17.300 --> 03:22:22.540]  advocacy. And I had discovered you through watching Infowars and their coverage of the
[03:22:22.540 --> 03:22:28.340]  2020 election. And there was just no turning back at that point. And so, when it came time
[03:22:28.340 --> 03:22:33.060]  for me to graduate, I was still in virtual law school. I decided to get out of Maine
[03:22:33.060 --> 03:22:37.780]  and try to find a job that aligned with my values, because one, I didn't want to be subjected
[03:22:37.780 --> 03:22:43.180]  to a vaccine mandate at a liberal law firm. And two, there didn't seem to be any other
[03:22:43.180 --> 03:22:46.420]  causes out there that I'd rather dedicate my time to.
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:52.100]  And what has been sort of the biggest hurdle or surprise or difficulty in the actual practice
[03:22:52.100 --> 03:22:55.580]  of law since you've begun to practice?
[03:22:55.580 --> 03:23:01.420]  Well, I mean, some of your illusions of the law are definitely shattered doing this kind
[03:23:01.420 --> 03:23:06.180]  of work. You go through three years of law school, and they teach you the theory of what
[03:23:06.180 --> 03:23:09.700]  practicing law will be like. And then you go down to the world in these political cases
[03:23:09.700 --> 03:23:16.420]  and these controversial cases. And even when you have the perfect case, the law is clear,
[03:23:16.420 --> 03:23:21.940]  it's still an uphill battle. It's still, you're facing all of these impediments because it's
[03:23:21.940 --> 03:23:25.980]  just such a contentious issue. And it shouldn't be. None of these vaccine mandates should
[03:23:25.980 --> 03:23:32.820]  be contentious issue. It should not be political. But that's been very surprising and discouraging
[03:23:32.820 --> 03:23:39.620]  at times to see, okay, we should be right morally, ethically, legally, and you still
[03:23:39.620 --> 03:23:45.860]  have to fight it out in court and hope that you, to some extent, get lucky.
[03:23:45.860 --> 03:23:49.820]  And if there are other young students out there going into law school or maybe in law
[03:23:49.820 --> 03:23:54.180]  school thinking about entering the practice of law, what advice would you give them about
[03:23:54.180 --> 03:23:59.100]  continuing to pursue the things that matter to them? In terms of principles, in terms
[03:23:59.100 --> 03:24:04.220]  of values, continuing to represent maybe outsiders, maybe underdogs, maybe dissidents, maybe people
[03:24:04.220 --> 03:24:09.260]  that are not as politically privileged or protected as the political classes or corporations
[03:24:09.260 --> 03:24:14.580]  or others are. What would be your advice to them about maintaining their beliefs, finding
[03:24:14.580 --> 03:24:19.660]  a means of practicing law that's ethical, that's moral, that's principled, that advances
[03:24:19.660 --> 03:24:23.060]  their values? What would be your advice to them?
[03:24:23.060 --> 03:24:27.820]  I think it's more important now than ever that people are willing to take the leap to
[03:24:27.820 --> 03:24:32.940]  maybe get out of the accepted sphere of what success looks like in the legal world. So
[03:24:32.940 --> 03:24:36.060]  a lot of my classmates, they want to work for one of these big law firms, work for a
[03:24:36.060 --> 03:24:43.500]  governmental agency, something with great notoriety and that looks great on a resume,
[03:24:43.500 --> 03:24:50.060]  and they don't want something, they're either going to get a public pushback or perhaps garner
[03:24:50.060 --> 03:24:56.100]  reputation one way or another. But right now, if you have these motivations and these values
[03:24:56.100 --> 03:24:59.700]  and you see problems in the world, now is the time that we have to step up because there
[03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:04.980]  are so few attorneys willing to do this. I talk to young attorneys out there and we'll
[03:25:04.980 --> 03:25:11.420]  compare experiences in our careers. I'm told all the time how lucky I am to get to do this
[03:25:11.420 --> 03:25:17.460]  because they'll be on the other side. They're representing big corporations, big employers.
[03:25:17.460 --> 03:25:21.700]  They don't feel good about the work that they're doing. They don't go home and they're like,
[03:25:21.700 --> 03:25:27.100]  wow, I really fought for the underdog today, fought for people like me, this is great.
[03:25:27.100 --> 03:25:33.100]  They put in these long hours and do soul-crushing work and it's kind of discouraging for them.
[03:25:33.100 --> 03:25:36.940]  So they look at my job and think, wow, that's amazing, you get to do that. So there are
[03:25:36.940 --> 03:25:41.820]  young attorneys out there who do feel this way. I think there's certainly a failing in
[03:25:41.820 --> 03:25:48.140]  our legal education system. It's so liberal now and I'm into a liberal law school and
[03:25:48.140 --> 03:25:54.940]  so that was my experience. But just like all higher education systems, even the law schools
[03:25:54.940 --> 03:25:59.020]  are leading that way and so they're not being introduced to these issues. I guarantee if
[03:25:59.020 --> 03:26:03.300]  they touch upon vaccine mandate cases, they're probably portrayed very differently than how
[03:26:03.300 --> 03:26:09.940]  I perceive them. But there are good young lawyers out there. So if you're one of them
[03:26:09.940 --> 03:26:13.100]  and you see what's going on, I encourage you just get in touch with attorneys that are
[03:26:13.100 --> 03:26:18.060]  doing this kind of work, see how you can participate, maybe just doing research because there aren't
[03:26:18.060 --> 03:26:22.740]  enough of us out there and there needs to be a full force of people willing to take
[03:26:22.740 --> 03:26:23.740]  these cases.
[03:26:23.740 --> 03:26:27.980]  And can you describe for people some of the vaccine mandate cases that you're working
[03:26:27.980 --> 03:26:33.700]  on, what about it the vaccine mandate is illegal, how it does violate people's rights, how they
[03:26:33.700 --> 03:26:38.500]  do have a right to remedy in the process, how they need to exercise it in a timely manner.
[03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:42.620]  Can you describe for people what some of their rights are, if they're subject or a loved
[03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:44.780]  one is subject to a vaccine mandate?
[03:26:44.780 --> 03:26:50.980]  Sure. So we have a number of cases ongoing right now, many against a 3M company, many
[03:26:50.980 --> 03:26:57.620]  against Tyson, another one we just filed last week against Madison Square Garden. And what's
[03:26:57.620 --> 03:27:02.860]  so striking about these is just how these companies just doubled down on their employees,
[03:27:02.860 --> 03:27:08.300]  many of whom had worked there for decades. So the claims that we're bringing are claims
[03:27:08.300 --> 03:27:14.740]  of religious discrimination, primarily and disability discrimination, religious discrimination.
[03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:19.300]  Many of these people, in the case of Tyson, were granted a religious exemption and then
[03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:25.660]  placed on one year of unpaid leave as their accommodation. Anyone who has is rational
[03:27:25.660 --> 03:27:30.220]  and honest with themselves knows that that's absolutely ridiculous and tantamount to termination.
[03:27:30.220 --> 03:27:35.780]  And a lot of other companies just outright denied people's religious exemptions no matter
[03:27:35.780 --> 03:27:42.860]  how sincere, how thorough they were, whether they gave affidavits from religious institutions,
[03:27:42.860 --> 03:27:47.260]  a lot of just absolutely not, no exemptions as an option.
[03:27:47.260 --> 03:27:52.780]  So we're helping people fight back and a lot of these companies, they try to say, oh, well,
[03:27:52.780 --> 03:27:58.380]  we just didn't find a sincere religious belief when it is not even in the company's purview
[03:27:58.380 --> 03:28:02.740]  to be able to determine whether that's the true or not. And then, of course, they try
[03:28:02.740 --> 03:28:08.020]  to claim, oh, well, you're burdening everyone else at the company when the vaccine is neither
[03:28:08.020 --> 03:28:11.900]  safe or effective, increases your chance of getting COVID and comes with a whole host
[03:28:11.900 --> 03:28:17.180]  of other problems. Everyone knows that that is also a ridiculous excuse as well.
[03:28:17.180 --> 03:28:21.460]  And then on the other side for disability, we're arguing that people were perceived
[03:28:21.460 --> 03:28:25.220]  as being disabled because of their unvaccinated status and discriminated on that basis as
[03:28:25.220 --> 03:28:26.220]  well.
[03:28:26.220 --> 03:28:29.980]  Exactly. And for those that are interested in some of the more vaccine cases that are
[03:28:29.980 --> 03:28:35.300]  coming about, there is a Vaccine Safety Research Foundation conference by Steve Kirscher's
[03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:39.940]  organization that will be in Atlanta, Georgia toward the end of March. You can look that
[03:28:39.940 --> 03:28:45.420]  up at the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation. When we come back, we'll be talking about
[03:28:45.420 --> 03:28:50.620]  the World Health Organization's treaties and the threats it poses to America's constitutional
[03:28:50.620 --> 03:28:56.980]  order and ways in which our Constitution provides answers to its dangers.
[03:28:56.980 --> 03:29:01.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the
[03:29:01.620 --> 03:29:05.780]  globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants. And we fund
[03:29:05.780 --> 03:29:09.860]  our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at

[03:32:58.740 --> 03:33:11.780]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.780 --> 03:33:16.820]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Robert Barnes guest hosting here in studio with Lexis
[03:33:16.820 --> 03:33:23.260]  Anderson discussing the World Health Organization Treaty and what risk it may pose, discussing
[03:33:23.260 --> 03:33:27.460]  those people that have been injured by vaccines, what might be some of the remedies, those who
[03:33:27.460 --> 03:33:31.820]  have been injured by vaccine mandates and what might be some of the remedies there.
[03:33:31.820 --> 03:33:35.800]  You're discussing Title VII claims that are brought under the Americans with Disabilities
[03:33:35.800 --> 03:33:41.940]  Act or the Civil Rights Act concerning religious discrimination and other forms of impermissible
[03:33:41.940 --> 03:33:46.620]  discrimination. Some of these have a disparate racial impact, so there's that aspect. Some
[03:33:46.620 --> 03:33:50.580]  have had a disparate gender impact. But can you describe for people, one of the things
[03:33:50.580 --> 03:33:55.460]  most people don't know is that in order to protect their rights under those federal laws
[03:33:55.460 --> 03:33:59.940]  and sometimes there's state analog versions that have their own provisions, but that they
[03:33:59.940 --> 03:34:05.100]  have to go to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the state equivalent thereof
[03:34:05.100 --> 03:34:10.540]  within a certain time frame. Can you describe for people when they need to go to the EEOC
[03:34:10.540 --> 03:34:15.060]  if they fear that or feel that they have basically had some of their rights violated due to a
[03:34:15.060 --> 03:34:19.700]  vaccine mandate? Absolutely. So if you've been discriminated against, it's really important
[03:34:19.700 --> 03:34:24.980]  that you file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within six months
[03:34:24.980 --> 03:34:30.700]  of the time you were discriminated against. So typically the time you were terminated,
[03:34:30.700 --> 03:34:37.900]  but not always. This is a requirement in order to bring claims, a lawsuit under Title VII
[03:34:37.900 --> 03:34:42.420]  or the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you don't go through that process with the
[03:34:42.420 --> 03:34:48.700]  state agency or as you mentioned, the parallel state agency or the federal agency, then
[03:34:48.700 --> 03:34:53.020]  you can be precluded from bringing suit entirely. So this is something that a lot of people
[03:34:53.020 --> 03:34:57.060]  didn't realize at the inception of all of this, that there was this huge administrative
[03:34:57.060 --> 03:35:01.980]  hurdle and process that you have to get through before you can even bring a lawsuit. Exactly.
[03:35:01.980 --> 03:35:05.940]  Now that does not mean that you don't have any remedies. If you're out of time for that,
[03:35:05.940 --> 03:35:10.320]  you might have the right to bring suit. We are challenging some novel interpretations
[03:35:10.320 --> 03:35:15.460]  of the law, arguing that for certain and some state laws have only passed recently. So sometimes
[03:35:15.460 --> 03:35:20.340]  those provide a remedy. We're also seeking remedy under the assault laws because if you
[03:35:20.340 --> 03:35:23.820]  were at your employer and your employer said, you know what, in order to keep your job,
[03:35:23.820 --> 03:35:27.140]  you got to go down through a gang initiation and have the crap kicked out of you before
[03:35:27.140 --> 03:35:32.860]  you come back. Isn't that a conspiracy to commit an assault, a tort of assault? So our
[03:35:32.860 --> 03:35:36.660]  argument is that's what a vaccine mandate is. They want your body invaded with a foreign
[03:35:36.660 --> 03:35:42.100]  substance. They can do a lot more damage to you than any gang initiation could as a condition
[03:35:42.100 --> 03:35:46.540]  of employment. So we're bringing those claims. We're also bringing claims under the Nuremberg
[03:35:46.540 --> 03:35:51.380]  Code. For those that may not remember, this was the Nuremberg Code arose from the trials
[03:35:51.380 --> 03:35:57.100]  at Nuremberg. And the principle was, you know, on what basis were we going to prosecute German
[03:35:57.100 --> 03:36:03.340]  doctors and German military officials and soldiers and prison camp folks? On what grounds
[03:36:03.340 --> 03:36:08.660]  were we going to prosecute them when they didn't violate their own country's laws? What
[03:36:08.660 --> 03:36:14.500]  was our basis to do so? Not only did we prosecute them, we in many cases convicted them and
[03:36:14.500 --> 03:36:20.060]  executed them. Well, what was the grounds to do so? Well, what we established at Nuremberg
[03:36:20.060 --> 03:36:25.500]  was that there is an international code of certain universal truths that are what might
[03:36:25.500 --> 03:36:31.460]  be called and what is called in the law, just Kogan's under the old Latin international
[03:36:31.460 --> 03:36:37.780]  standards, so universal, so automatic that they are so true that they can be enforced
[03:36:37.780 --> 03:36:43.700]  by anybody, anywhere, anytime. That's the principle behind it. Our argument is when
[03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:49.140]  you are effectively medically experimenting on a population through mandates of an experimental
[03:36:49.140 --> 03:36:54.860]  drug in the case, which is the case with these vaccine mandates, that that is a Nuremberg
[03:36:54.860 --> 03:37:00.620]  Code violation and that any individual should have the right to enforce it. Now, a lot of
[03:37:00.620 --> 03:37:04.620]  the courts don't want to. They don't, they only want the government to be able to enforce
[03:37:04.620 --> 03:37:09.140]  the Nuremberg Code. They don't want assault theories to be brought. So they've been somewhat
[03:37:09.140 --> 03:37:14.580]  reluctant or hostile, but those are some of the other additional remedies that may be available.
[03:37:14.580 --> 03:37:19.620]  Now, we're also looking at what we can do for the vaccine injured. Can you explain
[03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:24.180]  to people what are some of the difficult, why is it already so difficult for people
[03:37:24.180 --> 03:37:29.700]  to get remedy if they've been injured by this vaccine in particular? Well, because it was
[03:37:29.700 --> 03:37:36.300]  brought under emergency use authorization. So you have all of these, you know, laws insulating
[03:37:36.300 --> 03:37:43.020]  the manufacturers, insulating anyone who requires this vaccine from suit, because of all of
[03:37:43.020 --> 03:37:49.820]  these legal loopholes. Exactly. And that's where some of the law needs to be changed.
[03:37:49.820 --> 03:37:54.340]  But we are looking at ways you can bring suits for remedy or relief if you've been injured
[03:37:54.340 --> 03:37:58.420]  by a vaccine. We're looking at whether or not you can bring suits under the assault
[03:37:58.420 --> 03:38:02.820]  and Nuremberg Code provisions we mentioned earlier, that we believe may trump in certain
[03:38:02.820 --> 03:38:06.420]  provisions, the various immunity exceptions that exist. We're looking at whether you
[03:38:06.420 --> 03:38:12.900]  can challenge the immunity exceptions as itself unconstitutional as violating your rights,
[03:38:12.900 --> 03:38:18.260]  for example, to trial by jury. Under the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution,
[03:38:18.260 --> 03:38:23.140]  and then as enforceable under both the 10th and 14th Amendments, various state constitutional
[03:38:23.140 --> 03:38:29.740]  provisions give you a right to trial by jury. And what that includes is even the courts recognize
[03:38:29.740 --> 03:38:34.500]  I would have a more robust interpretation of it than the courts do, but the courts recognize
[03:38:34.500 --> 03:38:39.860]  that at least that includes anything you had a right to trial by jury to it at the time
[03:38:39.860 --> 03:38:45.900]  of our Constitution. Well, basic torts like assault, basic torts like invasion of your
[03:38:45.900 --> 03:38:52.060]  bodily autonomy, basic torts like invasion of privacy, recognized in one way shape or
[03:38:52.060 --> 03:38:57.380]  form like say a trespass claim, all the way back to the time of our founding, said you
[03:38:57.380 --> 03:39:03.660]  had a right to a trial by jury on that. Can Congress really take away that right and provide
[03:39:03.660 --> 03:39:11.140]  special immunity either to themselves or to the government or to the big drug and big
[03:39:11.140 --> 03:39:16.820]  pharmaceutical companies or others who are involved in the administration of this dangerous
[03:39:16.820 --> 03:39:22.220]  drug? Our argument is that it's going to be unconstitutional and to challenge the PREP
[03:39:22.220 --> 03:39:27.940]  Act as it's called on those terms. In addition, of course, they're also now adding the vaccine
[03:39:27.940 --> 03:39:33.340]  to the kids list. Could you explain to people what the kids list is and how it might impact
[03:39:33.340 --> 03:39:39.180]  their kid in their state potentially? Sure. So the CDC puts out a list of recommended
[03:39:39.180 --> 03:39:43.380]  vaccinations for children. And it's a whole schedule of what's vaccine they should get
[03:39:43.380 --> 03:39:48.420]  at what age. I think it totals about 70 something by the time they're 18, it's gotten excessively
[03:39:48.420 --> 03:39:55.060]  wrong. So they just recommended that children get the COVID vaccine. And this is a problem
[03:39:55.060 --> 03:40:01.540]  because many states will use that as a guideline for school requirements. And now if you're
[03:40:01.540 --> 03:40:07.500]  a state like I grew up in Maine, they removed personal exemptions in 2018. And so kids in
[03:40:07.500 --> 03:40:11.460]  schools there, you can no longer just say, I don't want it because I don't want it. And
[03:40:11.460 --> 03:40:16.780]  they don't have to accept that anymore. You have to have either medical or religious exemption.
[03:40:16.780 --> 03:40:20.660]  And in fact, in some states, I guess they're even taking away the religious exemption.
[03:40:20.660 --> 03:40:26.260]  Exactly. Exactly. So this is a really big problem because for schools that just either
[03:40:26.260 --> 03:40:31.300]  automatically adopt the CDC's recommended schedule or who just use it as a guideline
[03:40:31.300 --> 03:40:35.620]  and add it because, you know, the CDC said that we should do it. Obviously, we should
[03:40:35.620 --> 03:40:39.660]  require it for our students. You're talking that you're going to have five year olds on
[03:40:39.660 --> 03:40:45.460]  a schedule getting COVID vaccines and no recourse. And obviously, you know, people but not everybody
[03:40:45.460 --> 03:40:48.940]  can homeschool their kids or send them to private school. And so you're going to have
[03:40:48.940 --> 03:40:52.500]  all of these young kids forced injected with a dangerous drug.
[03:40:52.500 --> 03:40:56.220]  And can you describe that we're working with Robert Kennedy at Children's Health Defense
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:40:59.580]  to try to bring legal relief to stop that from happening?
[03:40:59.580 --> 03:41:06.700]  Yes. So for the states where there might be an automatic trigger for adding the COVID vaccine
[03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:13.420]  to the required vaccinations for schools because of the CDC's adding it to their recommended
[03:41:13.420 --> 03:41:17.220]  list, we're going to try to bring suit along with Children's Health Defense to challenge
[03:41:17.220 --> 03:41:21.340]  that on behalf of students who might be adversely impacted.
[03:41:21.340 --> 03:41:26.220]  Indeed. Basically, it's the world that many of you probably saw it coming, but many others
[03:41:26.220 --> 03:41:30.620]  did not. And the reason why many of you probably saw it coming is you are familiar or you've
[03:41:30.620 --> 03:41:35.380]  been following Alex from many, many decades. And whether you read his book, The Great Reset,
[03:41:35.380 --> 03:41:39.380]  which is well cited, well quoted, has a lot of documentation. The reason why on the back
[03:41:39.380 --> 03:41:44.580]  of it has a lot of very favorable quotes from a wide range of influential intellectuals
[03:41:44.580 --> 03:41:50.120]  in American society is because what he has been talking about here, what Russell Brand
[03:41:50.120 --> 03:41:54.980]  just yesterday was talking to Joe Rogan about just the other day, is that Alex Jones has
[03:41:54.980 --> 03:41:59.620]  been predicting many of these things for a long time, to be on alert form for a long
[03:41:59.620 --> 03:42:06.180]  time, to be recognizing the risk when it comes. It is not a coincidence that it was the InfoWars
[03:42:06.180 --> 03:42:11.140]  audience that was at the tip of the spear and at the very front, at the very inception
[03:42:11.140 --> 03:42:16.980]  of all of the protest and rallies all across America to try to prevent the lockdowns from
[03:42:16.980 --> 03:42:21.780]  becoming institutionalized permanently. It's not a coincidence that when I was in court
[03:42:21.780 --> 03:42:27.580]  yesterday arguing with Alexis Anderson on behalf of Brooke Jackson, many of the people
[03:42:27.580 --> 03:42:33.540]  in that courtroom were members of the InfoWars audience. You are the ones who have kept these
[03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:38.340]  information at the front of people's minds so they can be on the lookout for what might
[03:42:38.340 --> 03:42:44.140]  happen. You are our modern day Paul Revere's. Continue to help make that possible by going
[03:42:44.140 --> 03:42:49.540]  to InfoWarsStore.com and supporting and buying products that make that practicable. When we
[03:42:49.540 --> 03:42:54.780]  come back, the World Health Organization and its new treaty to try to control everything
[03:42:54.780 --> 03:43:18.260]  everywhere.
[03:43:18.260 --> 03:43:31.740]  We
[03:43:31.740 --> 03:43:35.700]  need funds to operate plus we've got really great products that do amazing things for

[03:43:58.100 --> 03:44:03.940]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it and it
[03:44:03.940 --> 03:44:09.460]  is because of Lister's viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at info wars, people
[03:44:09.460 --> 03:44:15.700]  behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:44:16.340 --> 03:44:21.060]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:44:21.060 --> 03:44:26.740]  five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole info wars
[03:44:26.740 --> 03:44:32.180]  crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that info wars can
[03:44:32.180 --> 03:44:36.580]  not stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and
[03:44:36.580 --> 03:44:41.940]  that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com and

[03:45:09.620 --> 03:45:13.700]  starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Recent and Worth of the World
[03:45:13.700 --> 03:45:18.660]  at bookstores, amazon or infowarstore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy
[03:45:18.660 --> 03:45:23.620]  of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them

[03:46:57.700 --> 03:47:06.820]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.820 --> 03:47:25.060]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. This is Robert Barnes guest hosting here in studio with
[03:47:25.060 --> 03:47:30.740]  Lexis Anderson. We were earlier this week actually arguing for Brooke Jackson,
[03:47:30.740 --> 03:47:37.060]  the brave whistleblower who exposed the Pfizer fraud and corruption in the billions of dollars
[03:47:37.060 --> 03:47:43.220]  they obtained from the American people based on their lies that led to people dying. Pfizer lied,
[03:47:43.220 --> 03:47:49.060]  people died and we are now requesting discovery in that case to proceed accordingly. If you want
[03:47:49.060 --> 03:47:56.260]  to follow Brooke Jackson you can at imbrokejaxson.com or at imbrokejaxson on social media. She has been
[03:47:56.260 --> 03:48:02.260]  a very brave whistleblower who's been willing to risk her entire career and more to bring these
[03:48:02.260 --> 03:48:08.260]  truths out to the American people. In addition if you're concerned or curious about vaccine injuries
[03:48:08.260 --> 03:48:14.660]  and various legal remedies for it, Steve Kirsch's organization, Vaccine Research Safety Foundation
[03:48:14.660 --> 03:48:20.420]  is presenting a conference that I will be attending along with others in Atlanta. There are still
[03:48:20.420 --> 03:48:25.620]  tickets available for those who wish to attend and get insights and information about how we
[03:48:25.620 --> 03:48:31.860]  may go about protecting and remedying those people who have suffered injury from these dangerous drugs
[03:48:31.860 --> 03:48:37.620]  disguised as vaccines over the last several years. And that is where you can go for that as well.
[03:48:37.620 --> 03:48:43.540]  And of course if you want some farm fresh milk or other great products you can support that at
[03:48:43.540 --> 03:48:50.820]  another client of mine, Amos Miller at amosmillerorganicfarm.com, best milk I've ever had.
[03:48:50.820 --> 03:48:58.580]  I get it every time I can when I'm in town. Amos Miller is the Amish farmer who just wants to
[03:48:58.580 --> 03:49:04.740]  make food the way his family and the way his ancestors had been making it for hundreds of years.
[03:49:04.740 --> 03:49:11.060]  But the U.S. Department of Agriculture has made his life very difficult over the last five years
[03:49:11.060 --> 03:49:17.220]  trying to superimpose their rules and regulations and restrictions on him. They want to control
[03:49:17.220 --> 03:49:22.100]  what goes into our bodies just like they're trying to do it through our medicine. They want to do it
[03:49:22.100 --> 03:49:27.540]  through our food supply. He makes food the way that has been safe and good and effective and
[03:49:27.540 --> 03:49:34.740]  delicious for centuries. And that's what his consumers want. Many of them need it for medical
[03:49:34.740 --> 03:49:40.340]  purposes. Others require it for spiritual and religious purposes. And yet that is being interfered
[03:49:40.340 --> 03:49:46.980]  with by the Department of Agriculture. You can help support Amos and keep his farm alive by buying
[03:49:46.980 --> 03:49:52.500]  things that like like farm fresh milk or great cheeses or yogurts or a whole bunch of other
[03:49:52.500 --> 03:50:00.020]  stuff. It's just fantastic at amosmillerorganicfarm.com. Now in just a second we will get to
[03:50:00.020 --> 03:50:06.900]  what are some of the risks and issues with the various WHO treaty proposals currently there.
[03:50:06.900 --> 03:50:12.660]  But what is your favorite product from InfoWarStore? Oh, there are so many. My pantry is chock full.
[03:50:12.660 --> 03:50:18.420]  I will say on Wednesday when we did oral argument in Beaumont, I definitely took more than the
[03:50:18.420 --> 03:50:23.060]  recommended dose of brain force ultra prior to walking into that courtroom. So that's one of my
[03:50:23.060 --> 03:50:29.140]  favorites. That environmental fusion every morning without a fail. I take that. There you go. Make
[03:50:29.140 --> 03:50:34.500]  yourself healthier, wealthier, and wiser and keep InfoWars on the air by going to InfoWarStore.com.
[03:50:34.500 --> 03:50:39.300]  Well, what about this World Health Organization treaty? Well, let's look at a special report
[03:50:39.300 --> 03:50:46.340]  and we'll discuss it when we come back from it. Let's play SP1. I has for quite some time now
[03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:53.220]  assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.
[03:50:53.220 --> 03:50:58.740]  The eugenics is just getting started. The elites managed to eliminate a fraction of the populace
[03:50:58.740 --> 03:51:05.300]  they must destroy through the virus and vaccines, surpassing the genocide of Nazi Germany. All over
[03:51:05.300 --> 03:51:10.260]  the western world, we are seeing very large, measurable increases in unexplained deaths.
[03:51:10.260 --> 03:51:14.500]  The BBC in Great Britain, for example, just reported that, quote, excess deaths in 2022
[03:51:14.500 --> 03:51:18.420]  are among the worst in 50 years. And does it damage the brain you bet it does? Does it damage
[03:51:18.420 --> 03:51:24.500]  the heart? Yes. The liver? Yes. The bone marrow? Yes. It causes all sorts of harm in the human
[03:51:24.500 --> 03:51:30.580]  body. We should have stopped this before it ever started. I'm seeing tremendous apathy. I'm seeing
[03:51:30.580 --> 03:51:36.580]  deaths, as you've mentioned, but no one seems to care. The family expresses no outrage.
[03:51:37.300 --> 03:51:43.940]  The obituaries don't mention the cause of death. It's just that, you know, 24 year old died. And
[03:51:43.940 --> 03:51:50.420]  that's it. The clinical trials were never ordered. The good manufacturing practice compliance was
[03:51:50.420 --> 03:51:55.860]  never ordered. And, you know, legally speaking, there were never even clinical trial subjects
[03:51:55.860 --> 03:52:00.580]  or investigators because if you cannot have an investigational product, then there is no
[03:52:00.580 --> 03:52:06.500]  investigation. So FDA leadership and then global regulatory leadership, what they did,
[03:52:07.140 --> 03:52:14.580]  they impersonated the regulators so that you fall for this lie and go get injected. Pfizer already
[03:52:14.580 --> 03:52:22.900]  in court stated that please dismiss this case judge. We did not defraud the government. We
[03:52:22.900 --> 03:52:28.900]  delivered the fraud that the government ordered. However, their common goal is to reduce humans
[03:52:28.900 --> 03:52:37.220]  from nearly 8 billion people to a manageable slave populace of 500 million. We cannot hide away
[03:52:37.220 --> 03:52:43.060]  from human population growth because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems.
[03:52:43.060 --> 03:52:48.820]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population
[03:52:48.820 --> 03:52:55.220]  that there was 500 years ago. And so even though the pandemic has been largely exposed as a
[03:52:55.220 --> 03:53:01.540]  manufactured event, the elitists push forward, hedging their bets on more genocide as their
[03:53:01.540 --> 03:53:07.540]  silent kill strategy stumbles through its engineered propaganda. Countries will begin
[03:53:07.540 --> 03:53:14.580]  negotiations on a zero draft of the new pandemic accord. These discussions will be crucial for
[03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:20.100]  building a more effective health security architecture for the future, grounded in
[03:53:20.100 --> 03:53:26.660]  international law, equity and the fundamental right to health for all people. A public health
[03:53:26.660 --> 03:53:33.220]  emergency of international concern or a fake is defined by the IHR as an extraordinary event
[03:53:33.220 --> 03:53:38.340]  which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international
[03:53:38.340 --> 03:53:45.140]  spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response. This year, in 2023,
[03:53:45.140 --> 03:53:49.860]  we may still be in a pandemic for quite some time because this virus is here with us to stay,
[03:53:49.860 --> 03:53:54.900]  which means we have to take measured action, we have to improve all of our system to be able
[03:53:54.900 --> 03:54:01.380]  to reduce the impact of COVID-19 as we go forward. It's a global treaty. They want 127 nations to
[03:54:01.380 --> 03:54:08.020]  sign it and basically does hand over kind of our sovereignty. There's no other way to put it to
[03:54:08.020 --> 03:54:14.100]  what will be a kind of a global health police and giving all of the decision making to the
[03:54:14.100 --> 03:54:18.500]  World Health Organization, which of course is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[03:54:18.500 --> 03:54:23.940]  disproportionately and their best friends, the Chinese Communist Party. The contract of the new
[03:54:23.940 --> 03:54:28.820]  draft is against the Constitution of America, against the laws and protection of human rights
[03:54:28.820 --> 03:54:36.580]  of America, etc., etc. The law in America says whoever conspires to aim or work towards the
[03:54:36.580 --> 03:54:42.980]  goal to undermine the security, the dignity or the integrity of the Constitution of the United
[03:54:42.980 --> 03:54:49.700]  States of America is committing high treason. Find out who from your government worked on that draft
[03:54:50.500 --> 03:54:55.380]  and then go for high treason, then you have the army behind you. The World Health Organization
[03:54:55.380 --> 03:55:01.540]  pandemic treaty is deeply concerning. It seeks to give the discredited WHO huge powers over this
[03:55:01.540 --> 03:55:08.180]  country and our people. Powers to call pandemics, enforce lockdowns, enforce vaccinations and
[03:55:08.180 --> 03:55:14.740]  decide when any pandemic is over. We know from the pandemic and we know from other outbreaks such
[03:55:14.740 --> 03:55:21.460]  as Ebola that these diseases know no borders and it is only through international cooperation
[03:55:21.460 --> 03:55:27.460]  and collaboration together that we will arrive at the solutions to ensure we do not have a repeat
[03:55:27.460 --> 03:55:34.660]  of the last few years. How long before those who know someone who has died suddenly or those
[03:55:34.660 --> 03:55:42.820]  injured by the vaccines strike back once the war on humanity is completely 100% out in the open?
[03:55:42.820 --> 03:55:48.500]  John Bowne reporting. The World Health Organization treaty is as dangerous as people talk about
[03:55:48.500 --> 03:55:54.180]  because it's not just about having a planned international coordinated pandemic response
[03:55:54.180 --> 03:55:59.540]  like some of its promoters pretend. You read the actual language, they talk about things like
[03:55:59.540 --> 03:56:04.420]  equity distribution between different communities within a country and society.
[03:56:04.420 --> 03:56:08.740]  They're talking about controlling supply chains. How do you control supply chains? You control
[03:56:08.740 --> 03:56:13.780]  supply chains by controlling every level of the process, including the original manufacturing
[03:56:13.780 --> 03:56:18.740]  or production of that, including food, including medicine, including other products. We already
[03:56:18.740 --> 03:56:24.500]  know what they mean by an international plan to public health response because we've witnessed it
[03:56:24.500 --> 03:56:29.700]  during the pandemic response of 2020. What does that mean? It means the ability to take away
[03:56:29.700 --> 03:56:36.580]  your right to assemble, the right to speech, the right to religion, the right to expression,
[03:56:36.580 --> 03:56:40.820]  the right to petition your government, all of which are protected under the First Amendment,
[03:56:40.820 --> 03:56:44.980]  your right of self-defense in the Second Amendment on the grounds for various security
[03:56:44.980 --> 03:56:50.260]  and safety reasons, taking away your means of self-defense, including your rights to bear arms,
[03:56:50.260 --> 03:56:54.660]  your Fourth Amendment rights against searches and seizures that violate core liberties,
[03:56:54.660 --> 03:56:59.460]  your Fifth Amendment rights to due process of law before any property or liberty can be taken away
[03:56:59.460 --> 03:57:04.980]  from you, your Fifth Amendment right against takings without just compensation. Didn't we just
[03:57:04.980 --> 03:57:10.180]  witness small businesses all across America, some of which were more than a hundred years old,
[03:57:10.180 --> 03:57:16.100]  removed overnight and not compensated a penny, nickel, dime, or dollar? And we've seen violations
[03:57:16.100 --> 03:57:20.260]  of the Sixth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment, all of it. So what's the answer to this rogue
[03:57:20.260 --> 03:57:25.220]  World Health Organization, this rogue World Health Organization treaty? It's a return to our
[03:57:25.220 --> 03:57:29.780]  constitutional liberty. It's advocates in the court of public opinion and the courts of law
[03:57:29.780 --> 03:57:35.140]  to assert those constitutional rights. And if we stand on the Constitution, then we can keep the
[03:57:35.140 --> 03:57:41.380]  light of liberty alive against these World Health Organization globalists. Thanks for being with us. See you next time.

[03:58:53.540 --> 03:58:58.820]  you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not
[03:58:58.820 --> 03:59:04.020]  his job. He's not the president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:59:05.220 --> 03:59:12.900]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. And that's who autocrats only
[03:59:12.900 --> 03:59:23.380]  understand one word. No, no, no. Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no
[03:59:23.380 --> 03:59:29.380]  to you shutting down our businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring
[03:59:29.380 --> 03:59:34.820]  our free speech. We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to
[03:59:34.820 --> 03:59:40.020]  you getting us into World War Three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[03:59:40.020 --> 03:59:43.540]  And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[03:59:43.540 --> 03:59:54.100]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
