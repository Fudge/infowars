[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, or your mind.
[00:29.840 --> 00:37.640]  Gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, February 5, 2019, Global Broadcast.
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.440]  Minutes before I went live, every day on NewsWords.com and Infowars.com, we'll post
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.120]  a page for the show that day with a live video and audio feeds on the front page, so you
[00:48.120 --> 00:51.840]  don't have to go to Infowars.com for its last show, and some people know what that particular
[00:51.840 --> 00:57.880]  broadcast is going to be about, and I was sitting there and I just couldn't come up
[00:57.880 --> 01:02.480]  with a headline, not for lack of news, but because the things happening are just too
[01:02.480 --> 01:05.280]  incredibly important.
[01:05.280 --> 01:07.880]  You know, the strangest things happen sometimes.
[01:07.880 --> 01:16.080]  I've known Man Cal Muller for 20 years, and he wanted me to do a Fox show, whether Fox
[01:16.080 --> 01:19.920]  offered us a show, he's done shows with Fox, it was a weekend show, and I just, I couldn't
[01:19.920 --> 01:23.320]  fly to New York every weekend.
[01:23.320 --> 01:28.360]  But he's a Christian, and he's told me privately some stuff, you know, he's been in a lot of
[01:28.360 --> 01:33.200]  movies, knows a lot of Hollywood folks, so he knows a lot of what I'm saying is true,
[01:33.200 --> 01:42.600]  because he's lived in LA, but also was number one in San Francisco, and so a lot of the
[01:42.600 --> 01:54.600]  things he's heard me talk about, he knew separately from people in San Francisco, and so I was
[01:54.600 --> 01:59.440]  on his show out of Chicago this morning until we did, we taped a podcast after, that he's
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.320]  been putting out, and I tried to come in here about two weeks ago in the new studio and
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.120]  tape a report on what we just went ahead and got into on here, but I think the way it got
[02:10.120 --> 02:15.840]  laid out on that show was extremely accurate and extremely powerful, and this is kind of
[02:15.840 --> 02:22.480]  a big deal that I'm going to be announcing on air, well, it's beyond a big deal.
[02:22.480 --> 02:28.640]  I've already done it, and the globalists never pick it up, they never cover it, because
[02:28.640 --> 02:30.880]  it's their secret religion.
[02:30.880 --> 02:34.760]  If you really want to know what Satanism is, Luciferianism is, you want to know what's
[02:34.760 --> 02:41.080]  really all going on, folks, this is the unified field theory on how all the secret societies
[02:41.080 --> 02:46.000]  operate the whole shooting match, and I've known this for a long time and I've released
[02:46.000 --> 02:55.840]  pieces of it, but what I talked about for about 30 minutes with him today of the podcast,
[02:55.840 --> 03:05.480]  we talked over an hour, really crystallized all of it, and so as soon as this podcast
[03:05.480 --> 03:10.680]  comes out, I will air that here today, even tonight, I'm not sure what his podcast is
[03:10.680 --> 03:14.760]  going to get released, and we're going to have State of the Union live coverage today,
[03:14.760 --> 03:21.120]  but this is it, and it was the strangest place for me to go ahead and just say it all, and
[03:21.120 --> 03:29.440]  I got it out pretty good, too, so, but this is the big enchilada, this is everything, okay,
[03:29.440 --> 03:36.880]  if you know this, you know it all, and this is it, this is 100% going on, and it's incredible,
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.080]  and let me just say something, you're living in a science fiction thriller, I mean this
[03:41.080 --> 03:46.080]  is unbelievable, we're going to go to break David Knight, he wasn't going to come back
[03:46.080 --> 03:51.240]  for two weeks, more, but he's back, and thank God he'll be in studio with me, David Knight
[03:51.240 --> 03:54.320]  after that heart attack, thanks for all your prayers and support, folks, we got so much
[03:54.320 --> 03:57.680]  big show today, whatever you share the links, that's how we get around the censors, we'll
[03:57.680 --> 04:08.840]  be right back, we need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom, our freedoms
[04:08.840 --> 04:12.320]  don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper, it consists of the things
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.120]  that we're willing to fight for, the First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of
[04:16.120 --> 04:21.800]  the Bill of Rights are prohibitions, they're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[04:21.800 --> 04:26.840]  and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals, you better understand
[04:26.840 --> 04:34.000]  that because they're taking them right now, we have seen what they want to do, they called
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.800]  it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda, they want everybody off of the rural
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.920]  lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities,
[04:44.920 --> 04:52.880]  because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone, never missed your show
[04:52.880 --> 05:14.200]  any day, but I mean never, by leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement
[05:14.200 --> 05:20.680]  family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes
[05:20.680 --> 05:25.440]  and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost
[05:25.440 --> 05:30.020]  but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects, we have developed hands
[05:30.020 --> 05:35.920]  down from our research the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond
[05:35.920 --> 05:41.560]  system in the world, there's nothing else like it, must experience it, it is a total
[05:41.560 --> 05:46.320]  game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit juice or water,
[05:46.320 --> 05:50.880]  whatever you like, warning though, it's very very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a
[05:50.880 --> 05:54.920]  half pack at the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it
[05:54.920 --> 06:23.280]  will take you into overdrive, TurboForce and EnforceLive.com.

[09:18.360 --> 09:26.280]  I went to infowars.com this morning at about 6.30 and at about 8 o'clock I saw it go live
[09:26.280 --> 09:32.040]  at the return of David Knight, so I just got my children off the school, got them in the
[09:32.040 --> 09:39.760]  car with the nanny and went in and was feeding my 22 month old baby on my lap and I had my
[09:39.760 --> 09:45.000]  laptop out and I went David Knight and I said well I haven't seen him since his heart attack
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.760]  over a month ago, about 5 weeks ago and I said let me see how he looks and you know what
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.320]  he looks like 10 years younger, it's amazing and he wasn't going to come back for a few
[09:54.320 --> 09:57.880]  more weeks because he's going to get some more surgery with a member of his family,
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.040]  we've been all working so hard we don't take care of ourselves, I personally have two cracked
[10:01.040 --> 10:04.440]  rotten teeth and I'm falling out of the fix this week, get them pulled, that's how hard
[10:04.440 --> 10:07.520]  we're fighting here, I'm not complaining, just letting you know sometimes we'll stumble
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.560]  around a little bit because we're in the trenches but it's good to see him here and it's good
[10:11.560 --> 10:16.880]  to see you so healthy looking because you were really getting white, you were losing
[10:16.880 --> 10:20.520]  a lot of weight, I remember we met like a week before he had the heart attack and I
[10:20.520 --> 10:24.200]  said David you need to take some time off man, you're so stressed looking and you were
[10:24.200 --> 10:28.440]  like well you look pretty stressed too but yeah you've had some family illnesses people
[10:28.440 --> 10:31.920]  you've been taking care of but it's just from everything I've heard from your son, Travis
[10:31.920 --> 10:35.960]  that works here does a great job, I think we've turned the corner and good times are
[10:35.960 --> 10:37.200]  ahead in the night family.
[10:37.200 --> 10:41.880]  Yeah, I think so, thank you so much Alex, you've been very very understanding in terms
[10:41.880 --> 10:47.200]  of giving me time off, you've been very generous with that and well you did have a heart attack.
[10:47.200 --> 10:54.240]  Yeah, I was going to come back that Monday, I thought I could, I got pretty mad, I said
[10:54.240 --> 10:57.640]  I've never thought about firing you but do that again.
[10:57.640 --> 11:01.400]  Well it was the medicine more than anything that I was really feeling the effects of
[11:01.400 --> 11:06.080]  because they put you on a blood thinning medicine to make sure that you don't get a blockage
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.560]  there at the site of the stent and some of the side effects of that or make you short
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.560]  of breath or anything but in the time that I've had off I've been working on trying
[11:14.560 --> 11:21.880]  to get some reschedule myself so that I'm taking a little bit of time for exercising.
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.120]  You look better than the David Knight I first met eight years ago.
[11:25.120 --> 11:30.240]  Well thank you, thank you, I did lose a lot of weight last year and that was intentional,
[11:30.240 --> 11:37.440]  I was on a Keto diet and I thought I was feeling a lot better and I had just been saying to
[11:37.440 --> 11:43.680]  my wife I said you know I've really been blessed because my father had a lot of heart
[11:43.680 --> 11:49.560]  issues by the time he was my age and he'd had open heart surgery several times for bypass
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.800]  for valves and he had other issues my mother did too and I'd never been bothered with
[11:54.800 --> 11:55.800]  any of that stuff.
[11:55.800 --> 11:59.720]  I mean I'm going through talking to the doctors and said you know what have you been in for
[11:59.720 --> 12:05.200]  well nothing you know I didn't really have anything so it was really kind of off the
[12:05.200 --> 12:11.280]  radar I knew I needed to schedule some exercise and things like that but I'd just been putting
[12:11.280 --> 12:12.280]  it off.
[12:12.280 --> 12:13.440]  And then boom you had the heart attack.
[12:13.440 --> 12:19.760]  Yeah, yeah, it came up all of a sudden and people are really glad you're back.
[12:19.760 --> 12:20.920]  Well thank you, it's great to be back.
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.240]  But I don't micromanage you at all, do I ever tell you what to do or say?
[12:24.240 --> 12:25.240]  No, not at all.
[12:25.240 --> 12:29.960]  I'm going to start nannying a little bit plus we have, we've moved the warehouse, we have
[12:29.960 --> 12:32.320]  some more room, we're putting in offices so you can actually have an office not being
[12:32.320 --> 12:36.960]  that big you know bullpen which can be stressful that way you can actually focus and expanding
[12:36.960 --> 12:44.080]  on that you just really need to take care of yourself because I know Gooden damn well
[12:44.080 --> 12:47.880]  that for a three hour show you prepare for three, four hours here and a couple hours
[12:47.880 --> 12:48.880]  at night.
[12:48.880 --> 12:53.480]  David, I mean I hate to tell the illustrators but you just can't prepare double for what
[12:53.480 --> 12:58.080]  you do on air because you get so focused on like you're preparing for a state of the union
[12:58.080 --> 13:03.280]  every day you just, I'm not saying mail it in but you got to find a halfway mark there.
[13:03.280 --> 13:08.800]  I agree, I agree, I've got to adjust things a little bit and it is very important you
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.920]  know part of it is you know looking at the different risk factors it's not just genetics
[13:13.920 --> 13:18.200]  but it's not just you know what you eat making sure that you've got proper nutrition but
[13:18.200 --> 13:22.640]  it's also sleep and that's a big part of you know having an early morning.
[13:22.640 --> 13:27.280]  Oh no doubt you wanted the morning show and I'm like man that's the way you prepare I'm
[13:27.280 --> 13:32.040]  like dude I mean I know I'm not exaggerating you prepare like four or five hours you can't
[13:32.040 --> 13:34.840]  get up at two in the morning and prepare and then come in here and do this.
[13:34.840 --> 13:38.240]  Yeah well I do pretty large survey of the news to find out.
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.920]  Well I mean believe me you're one of the few people and I'm a newshound that always knows
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.040]  more than I do but it's kind of you're an engineer and a lot of other stuff that people
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.640]  want you to be healthy and happy and play a few video clips do some red meat political
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.280]  stuff yeah I mean it but look you've got because we got the demographics that come in we can
[13:53.280 --> 14:01.320]  see it on all the analytics you've got the high-end engineer type astronaut type rich
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.040]  people smart people are listening to you because they know wow this guy actually did research
[14:06.040 --> 14:09.960]  and that's great David you just don't have to like do six seven hours of preparation
[14:09.960 --> 14:13.800]  every day I don't think it's healthy yeah yeah I've got to get solid because David like
[14:13.800 --> 14:18.240]  is a laser beam in a zone you go in there and he's focused with his headphones on and
[14:18.240 --> 14:22.640]  he's just like brainiac hardly even taking breaks I'm like hey dude of course I'm working
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.600]  haul it too so I'm telling David night that I mean this is like the extreme version right
[14:26.600 --> 14:33.840]  here yeah you gotta get a little better perspective and I know when they rested Roger I I drove
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.800]  into town I got on the phone because I just bothered me so much to see that happening
[14:38.800 --> 14:45.160]  you know we just had the CEO of Google under oath say we don't have any we're not shutting
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.480]  down or pushing this agenda or that agenda total I've had absolutely lying about that
[14:49.480 --> 14:53.340]  that came out a couple on its face yeah exactly but you know we're not going to do anything
[14:53.340 --> 14:58.840]  about that there was no craze they're trying to make a big deal out of the fact that Roger
[14:58.840 --> 15:02.680]  is conspiring to try to set up an interview with somebody well that's what do we do here

[20:46.280 --> 20:53.000]  will the globalist reporting one based on pharmacia brainwashing genetic engineering
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.840]  just total evil I have articles where China just ordered the entire population in the
[20:58.840 --> 21:06.040]  next two years to stop serving fat pigs but then you read when the minute I saw it what
[21:06.040 --> 21:09.720]  that's the genetically engineered South Korean pig that's like you know has almost no fat
[21:09.720 --> 21:14.320]  and it looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger and his prime boom bottom of the article oh it's
[21:14.320 --> 21:17.680]  a genetically engineered South Korean pig that the government has now bought the patent
[21:17.680 --> 21:24.120]  to and that they're now built up all the piglet population for his pigs can have like four
[21:24.120 --> 21:29.280]  or five liters a year and that within two years China is ordered to produce this pig
[21:29.280 --> 21:35.360]  because it's healthier and see how they slipped in genetically engineered pigs without even
[21:35.360 --> 21:39.560]  pointing out it's never engineered pigs it's just crazy David Knight's here and a lot of
[21:39.560 --> 21:45.360]  people David asked me why are you still supporting Trump when he said okay have an amnesty because
[21:45.360 --> 21:49.520]  he knew they'd say no not even that he's I mean I know what he's doing and he hasn't
[21:49.520 --> 21:52.280]  gone after the vaccines yet he's done some things I don't like but trying to pull us
[21:52.280 --> 21:56.840]  out of wars trying to reform the criminal justice system so blacks don't get triple the time
[21:56.840 --> 22:00.920]  whites do that's something really racist we need to deal with because he's prisons are
[22:00.920 --> 22:07.640]  like colleges of crime and marching in pro-life rallies and getting us out of TPP and the Federal
[22:07.640 --> 22:11.160]  Reserve raising interest rates obviously to try to hurt the recovery clearly he's trying
[22:11.160 --> 22:15.960]  to be an American president so I support him more that he's so in battle but now as Rand
[22:15.960 --> 22:19.680]  Paul has said we're gonna play the clip in a moment long 15 minute speech but just this
[22:19.680 --> 22:25.000]  two minutes is powerful how dare all of you say he's bad and a traitor and now the Democrats
[22:25.000 --> 22:31.880]  in national polls 54 percent in Gallup polls want more war and think that the defense budget
[22:31.880 --> 22:36.080]  should be even bigger and that Trump's so now they're the party of war the party of
[22:36.080 --> 22:40.320]  locking black people up but I guess they always were Hillary calling them super predators
[22:40.320 --> 22:45.880]  it's so upside down world David and quite frankly I've never been prouder of Trump
[22:45.880 --> 22:51.160]  with the situation trying to pull our trips out of these these these no-win fake situations
[22:51.160 --> 22:55.560]  where we're you know we're talking 50 billion a year right now in Afghanistan it's usually
[22:55.560 --> 23:01.040]  a hundred plus billion I mean the wall doesn't cost you know that this is crazy yeah absolutely
[23:01.040 --> 23:07.720]  and you know we have to I think help present 70 percent of the Republican voters according
[23:07.720 --> 23:11.840]  to the latest poll so they want something done about the border and I think that we
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.240]  have to understand that he's getting a lot of pushback from even people in the Republican
[23:16.240 --> 23:20.680]  party like Mitch McConnell pushing back against him I mean he had pushed back against him
[23:20.680 --> 23:25.360]  from Paul Ryan who has always been for open borders I mean Paul Ryan was there with Mitt
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.280]  Romney they knew that they were gonna get Romney care or Obamacare whatever there's
[23:30.280 --> 23:33.200]  no difference between the two they knew they were going to get that they were their hedge
[23:33.200 --> 23:38.080]  position in case something went wrong with Obama but I think Alex it would be perfect
[23:38.080 --> 23:43.000]  for President Trump to actually read as I in the last segment of the show today I had
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.640]  some quotes from President Obama that he read at one of his State of the Union's talking
[23:47.640 --> 23:51.800]  about the border and the kind of stuff that he was a rhetoric is stronger than Trump's
[23:51.800 --> 23:56.440]  yeah exactly exactly and yet you know Trump is supposed to be a racist no what we've seen
[23:56.440 --> 24:02.120]  in the last couple of weeks with this governor out of Virginia is we have seen the overt
[24:02.120 --> 24:06.440]  racism of the Democrat Party which has always been there look at Robert Byrd look at the
[24:06.440 --> 24:09.760]  origins of the Southern Poverty Law Center what Morris Dees was doing is only involved
[24:09.760 --> 24:15.120]  because the South was great in many ways we're Southerners but it was also about playing
[24:15.120 --> 24:19.000]  poor white farmers off against poor blacks and that's been the management system so
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.840]  the Democrats they play people off against each other they do yeah for 200 years that's
[24:23.840 --> 24:28.560]  who they are they've been the demographic party and they've always played one demographic
[24:28.560 --> 24:33.440]  against the other they've always been a racist party they still are all that they see is
[24:33.440 --> 24:37.640]  racist racist racist you hear that from them there's not a much of it which race that they're
[24:37.640 --> 24:42.000]  going to demonize is the only thing that changes and I always like Martin Luther King but man
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.480]  I go back and watch his speeches now about unity and what we stand for and it's like
[24:46.480 --> 24:51.440]  and the Democrats haven't just rejected it they have run it over and it was Republicans
[24:51.440 --> 24:54.920]  he was a Martin Luther King was a Republican it was Martin Luther King the Republicans
[24:54.920 --> 24:59.280]  forced the Democrats to stop being demons so they flipped and now turn the minorities
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.280]  into a bunch of racists I mean this is the craziest crap I've ever heard here but here's
[25:03.280 --> 25:09.200]  the good news Trump on the war front there's no point to have our military there we put
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.680]  in over a trillion dollars in Afghanistan it's almost two trillion now and then China gets
[25:13.680 --> 25:18.000]  all the rare earth minerals we get none let them go die for the damn minerals we are
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.420]  literally doing nothing but propping up all these regimes for China for US companies
[25:24.420 --> 25:29.520]  out live with China pull out of Afghanistan it's the right move get completely out here's
[25:29.520 --> 25:37.640]  Rand Paul is Afghanistan a mess sure it's a mess it's always been a mess and always
[25:37.640 --> 25:45.360]  will be a mess but now our mission has changed to nation building I want to compliment President
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.600]  Trump for being bold and brave and saying enough's enough let's spend that money at
[25:50.600 --> 25:57.360]  home we spend fifty one billion dollars a year in Afghanistan that money could be spent
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.560]  at home I've got three members of my family in the military I don't want them to go to
[26:02.560 --> 26:09.440]  Afghanistan every one of our political and military leaders Republican Democrat and
[26:09.440 --> 26:15.840]  independent will tell you there is no military mission in Afghanistan and yet we say some
[26:15.840 --> 26:20.600]  of the very same people who say we have no mission in the next breath say we need to
[26:20.600 --> 26:26.920]  send more troops there we sent a hundred thousand and we completely had victory and then they
[26:26.920 --> 26:33.320]  came back as our troops came down or we descend a hundred thousand and keep them there forever
[26:33.320 --> 26:38.440]  this resolution is an insult to the president I will oppose it this resolution is put forward
[26:38.440 --> 26:45.240]  by Republicans who say to President Trump that you are leaving precipitously from Afghanistan
[26:45.240 --> 26:53.000]  how do you leave precipitously after seventeen years seventeen years we are no longer fighting
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.920]  anyone who attacked us on nine eleven the people we are fighting were not even born
[26:57.920 --> 27:03.880]  when nine eleven happened the war over there has nothing to do with nine eleven it has
[27:03.880 --> 27:08.200]  to do with nation building and profit man I'll tell you what one Navy SEAL told me that
[27:08.200 --> 27:12.640]  I met a year or two ago he says we'll go anywhere we'll kill our enemy we'll do what
[27:12.640 --> 27:19.840]  you ask of us but the mistake is when you ask us to stay plant the flag and become policemen
[27:19.840 --> 27:24.720]  they don't want to be policemen our military do not want to be the policeman of the world
[27:24.720 --> 27:30.600]  we fight when we have to we should come home that money should be spent here at home what
[27:30.600 --> 27:36.960]  I'm saying with this resolution is I'm for replacing it completely and saying to President
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.200]  Trump we think you're doing a great job and thank goodness for being bold enough to say
[27:41.200 --> 27:47.080]  it's time to start thinking about America first so I would like to ask unanimous consent
[27:47.080 --> 27:52.200]  that we get rid of the resolution condemning the president and that we replace it with
[27:52.200 --> 27:58.320]  a resolution that says simply this that we applaud President Trump for being bold and
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.560]  brave enough to consider bringing our troops home declaring victory and ending America's
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.880]  longest war now I have a tendency David do a fewer minutes with us in the next second
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.960]  I know you've got to go to an appointment I have a tendency of not telling you the big
[28:12.960 --> 28:19.440]  news up front and then getting to it later Mitch McConnell they pass this resolution
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.800]  and they threaten to impeach the president and this is the this is the republic of the
[28:22.800 --> 28:28.600]  democrats together this is a shameful moment ladies and gentlemen you want blacks not getting
[28:28.600 --> 28:33.640]  three times the senate's whites trump did it you want the in wars trumps doing it and
[28:33.640 --> 28:37.600]  then the democrats Haiti more these people are shameful David it's absolutely amazing
[28:37.600 --> 28:42.200]  and you know it's Afghanistan has a history of being where empires go to die you know we
[28:42.200 --> 28:46.400]  saw that was soviet union we saw Alexander the great two thousand plus years ago look
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.840]  at what they did the british empire to speak we don't understand is a joke yeah it's a bunch

[33:31.880 --> 33:36.280]  government put a internet control switch in place so that all internet coming into the
[33:36.280 --> 33:39.720]  country and out could be censored in fact they said we're going to adopt chinese style
[33:39.720 --> 33:43.920]  censorship then they backed off because of lawsuits and governmental changes but I've
[33:43.920 --> 33:49.040]  been flooded with emails calls just all over info wars dot com news wars dot com that the
[33:49.040 --> 33:54.400]  video and audio streams both from info wars are being cut off and blocked in australia
[33:54.400 --> 34:01.080]  we've got it looking at that but we are running into next level attempts to not get the broadcast
[34:01.080 --> 34:08.280]  out so everything's free to air we send the tv show out on satellite over the internet
[34:08.280 --> 34:11.840]  anyone wants to pick it up anyone wants to carry it anybody wants to chop it up you want

[37:12.880 --> 37:18.640]  you were making some really good points during the break about how we can't build the wall
[37:18.640 --> 37:24.840]  you know the cost 5.6 billion a total wall 12 billion but we can spend almost 2 trillion
[37:24.840 --> 37:30.320]  afghanistan yeah and you were saying we can spend 30 40 billion on putting up these football
[37:30.320 --> 37:35.520]  stadiums we sure as hell can build football stadiums we just can't build a wall yeah if
[37:35.520 --> 37:41.120]  you look at professional sports and you look at the stadiums that we provide for these billionaires
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.800]  and of course it's actually been a profit center for a dozen of the football teams to
[37:45.800 --> 37:51.160]  have these stadiums put in place and the question is why are we going into bondage for this
[37:51.160 --> 37:56.000]  because that's what's happening we're having these bond issues being put in and it is subsidizing
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.160]  of these people you don't hear anything about that when we talk about what's going on with
[38:00.160 --> 38:04.560]  the border by like Trump should say that yeah Trump should say hey we can pay two three
[38:04.560 --> 38:09.880]  billion dollars per stadium on local taxpayers we're not going into bondage for this we have
[38:09.880 --> 38:16.080]  Latin America collapsing we must build the wall it's a symbol of national sovereignty yeah
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.320]  well look at everything that they've done look at the amount of money that we give to
[38:19.320 --> 38:24.640]  the UN twice as much as what he's asking for look at what we did in Syria we never had
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.440]  a vote or discussion about whether we're going to put American troops here but they built
[38:27.440 --> 38:32.360]  more than a dozen bases they built four airfields there they did it very quickly they did it
[38:32.360 --> 38:36.960]  without any debate they did and the American people didn't even know that was there and
[38:36.960 --> 38:40.880]  yet you know we're told that we can't do anything let's be clear this country if we were building
[38:40.880 --> 38:43.480]  empires was good we'll go to the end of the second I was gonna play a clip it'll come
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.840]  up at the break if we were gonna be evil like you know like the British Empire but actually
[38:48.840 --> 38:52.200]  brought a lot of good things the countries they controlled or the Roman Empire where
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.000]  we actually get stuff back to the home country the homeland we pay to protect yeah China's
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.280]  interest for US trader companies in Afghanistan they bring out all the rarest minerals we
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.160]  get zero you look it up yeah so we're paying 50 to 100 to 150 billion a year depending on
[39:07.160 --> 39:14.160]  the year to be in Afghanistan we're unpaid mercenaries unpaid mercenaries we're pay America
[39:14.160 --> 39:18.480]  is China's mercenaries that's right and that's the and when you look at what is how we built
[39:18.480 --> 39:22.600]  the Panama Canal and just gave it to him yeah yeah look at what is happening I mean look
[39:22.600 --> 39:28.920]  at the every time we turn around it's the Chinese who are threatening in aggressive
[39:28.920 --> 39:34.240]  ways threatening Taiwan for example threatening any American ships are going through international
[39:34.240 --> 39:38.760]  waters because they do that deliberately to keep those waters open to international traffic
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.040]  but they are very aggressively moving towards that and yet we never see any criticism of
[39:43.040 --> 39:49.360]  China in the media whatsoever they always get a free pass it's amazing how they can
[39:49.360 --> 39:53.660]  eviscerate our industry how they can get subsidized how they can set up these control
[39:53.660 --> 39:57.960]  structures because they are the beta test site for what the globalists want to do to
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.120]  this country that's right the globalists made the deal to parlay China's hardworking
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.200]  smart population but controlled to be they didn't have robots to replace humans yet so
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.120]  they got Chinese mm-hmm now Macron in the left oh humans are obsolete robots will replace
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.080]  you they want people that'll take orders well they've got China authoritarian for six thousand
[40:15.080 --> 40:20.840]  years yeah and they'll have any genetic engineering any corruption killing of Christians Buddhist
[40:20.840 --> 40:25.840]  anything goes and you know the average American thinks oh China's Chinese people no I go in
[40:25.840 --> 40:28.760]  Chinese food restaurants all over the country suddenly all my food's being bought by the
[40:28.760 --> 40:34.920]  owners they just love me there's fall-on-gong you newspapers epoch times everywhere almost
[40:34.920 --> 40:40.680]  everybody I meet in America whose Chinese is absolutely loves Trump and by the way Trump's
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.640]  popular in China people are sick of this crap oh yeah they're sick of the Communist Party
[40:45.640 --> 40:50.800]  of China is not the Chinese people it's not your daughter that's right yeah we adopted
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.960]  my daughter from China but you know Alex when we look at this it's the total that they can
[40:55.960 --> 41:01.040]  go to China because there's absolutely no ethical restraints by the Communist leadership
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.760]  there they'll do anything to anybody for their purposes and that's what we're starting to
[41:04.760 --> 41:08.800]  see in this country that's one of the things out of this back and forth with this Virginia
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.800]  governor and the fact that he can openly talk about a newborn baby sitting it on the table
[41:13.800 --> 41:18.520]  making the decision whether they're going to destroy that baby or not and there's no
[41:18.520 --> 41:23.480]  reaction from the Democrat base he's only lost 20 points from his Democrat base they
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.320]  definitely already had that blackface thing and then leaked out so because to move along
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.720]  yeah because I mean him saying we keep the baby comfortable it is good and that stupid
[41:32.720 --> 41:37.640]  fake Southern accent that he plays on it's a woman's choice to stay out of it well look
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.880]  at how they're expanding this I mean started with Cuomo New York we've got the governor
[41:41.880 --> 41:45.240]  and Rhode Island they're pushing the same type of thing late exactly we're trying to
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.040]  like you say just don't kill eight-month-old babies they're like screw you we'll kill
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.640]  them after they're born which has always been the next wave yeah it's what Peter singer

[47:50.440 --> 47:55.200]  hearing research during the next break because i want to be dead sure about this but this

[47:59.480 --> 48:07.480]  release this information the office of the inspector general just dropped a bombshell
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.040]  it doesn't list the fbi agents but we know their names because i'm just double checking
[48:12.040 --> 48:18.640]  but this is filings of misconduct by fbi special supervisory agent for making false representations
[48:18.640 --> 48:23.640]  working for an fbi contractor accepting gifts from fbi applicant assisting the fbi applicant

[49:06.440 --> 49:09.540]  and then i i think i know the answer and then i just gotta have a little bit of time to
[49:09.540 --> 49:14.080]  slow down but you know what that's not the nature of war is it it's the fog of war that's

[50:12.320 --> 50:19.920]  to calculate the cabbage jeff bezos the richest man in the world not the god dominant to say
[50:19.920 --> 50:27.240]  how much money he's got worth the real money is hidden jeff bezos gets a dollar fifty on
[50:27.240 --> 50:31.560]  every package he ships out he's a globalist he does all this bad stuff but he's into himself
[50:31.560 --> 50:35.840]  he's done this whole remodeling he's this cool james bond character and everything so
[50:35.840 --> 50:42.320]  he spent millions of dollars on multiple ads at the super bowl about how he's a hero and
[50:42.320 --> 50:53.240]  journalist or heroes and all the rest of it and his own writers who are being laid off
[50:53.240 --> 50:59.720]  or having their pay cut they're getting really really really really upset about all of this
[50:59.720 --> 51:05.000]  uh but i mean what a group of lying scum anyways the washington post you work for scum you
[51:05.000 --> 51:11.200]  are scum stop complaining mercenaries and of course all the obama funding and bezos
[51:11.200 --> 51:16.040]  best buddies with him uh to put out fake news and attack the free press and do all this
[51:16.040 --> 51:21.280]  the main tranche the main funding of that ran out last week so that's why they're so upset
[51:21.280 --> 51:28.320]  that's why they're so scared so a listener has put together a great video that is a parody
[51:28.320 --> 51:35.720]  of this uh wapo alternative hanks video and let's go ahead and roll this powerful piece

[53:45.080 --> 53:50.600]  you seeing unified corporate media with all the same headlines in the same order over
[53:50.600 --> 53:57.360]  and over again i'm about to drop a huge bombshell on new listeners this is coffin nails to the
[53:57.360 --> 54:02.840]  system congress gets involved in this the president takes action against this it's
[54:02.840 --> 54:11.480]  came over so this got pointed out by some of our researchers teres and smith and i went
[54:11.480 --> 54:17.080]  and looked it up and sure as hades i'd read the executive orders i'd read the bill two
[54:17.080 --> 54:21.880]  years ago two and a half years ago that obama signed and i'd forgotten that it elapsed and
[54:21.880 --> 54:27.640]  it ended last week and that's why there were all the giant layoffs at dozens and dozens
[54:27.640 --> 54:34.800]  of major leftist globalist propaganda outfits like buzzfeed and hovegan post and others
[54:34.800 --> 54:40.600]  and more huge ones are set to be announced this week now why is that dr. mckham shot
[54:40.600 --> 54:48.840]  please for tv viewers this is out of a public affairs washington post 2013 obama its law
[54:48.840 --> 54:55.360]  passed legalizing cia engaging in deception against the american people us repeals propaganda
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.960]  ban spreads government made news to americans hiding in plain view obama signed that executive
[55:00.960 --> 55:06.720]  order they passed the defense bill that he signed in december 2016 so two years and three
[55:06.720 --> 55:12.800]  months ago and it gave billions of dollars trunched out in a hundred million two hundred
[55:12.800 --> 55:20.120]  million packages for what you've seen so when you see all the tv shows demonizing trump
[55:20.120 --> 55:25.680]  and alex jones and you see every netflix show and you see homeland that was two billion dollars
[55:25.680 --> 55:32.520]  a taxpayer money and it's all right here this is the scandal of scandals of scandals and
[55:32.520 --> 55:39.200]  trump was set to sign executive order to kill it but he never did well guess what obama
[55:39.200 --> 55:44.880]  could only put defense spending out two years that's how it is so he signed in funding against
[55:44.880 --> 55:50.360]  trump and america for all the disruption you see not just against me but the taken knees
[55:50.360 --> 55:55.200]  and the cop killing groups and black lives matter that's all we have the documents funded
[55:55.200 --> 56:02.360]  to destabilize the country so think about how huge this is and no one's reverse engineered
[56:02.360 --> 56:08.280]  this but us and zero hedge so u.s. repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news
[56:08.280 --> 56:15.480]  to americans and it continues on from there the india legalizes the use of propaganda
[56:15.480 --> 56:25.280]  on u.s. citizens business insider austrian american statesman u.s. senate panels ok funds
[56:25.280 --> 56:33.600]  for fight online propaganda 2016 and it says hundred and sixty million dollars in the effort
[56:33.600 --> 56:41.160]  over the next two years starting in late january when the defense authorization rolls over 2017
[56:41.160 --> 56:46.320]  and rolling for two years just ended last week boom that's just one of the funding
[56:46.320 --> 56:52.400]  groups and that's why those groups shut down they were on record getting the money out of

[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:36.360]  to run again. That was real intel. It's time for me to adjust to what happened. I said
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:43.160]  she intended to run. The Democrats have totally rejected her. Her funding's all run out.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:48.440]  Their deep state funding, Obama's all run out. A group of insane crazed socialists have
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:58.720]  seized the party. And Hillary Clinton is not going to be running for president in 2020.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.600]  All the numbers are there. The facts are there. She tried to do it. She was still controlled
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.640]  the party. She still had control of the money. But it's being taken away from her right now.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:20.000]  And this is a good moment. In the words of Darth Vader, this will be a day long remembered.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.440]  We've seen the end of Hillary. We'll soon see the end of George Soros.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:32.440]  Vacuation on a moment of triumph. I think you overestimate their chances.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:41.040]  Okay. Maxine Meltdown waters, begs America to turn off TV during state of the union.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.480]  We're going to come back with that video. It's on DrudgeReport.com right now. Boy's name
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.560]  got him bullied. Now Trump's going to be defending with the species. His last name's Trump. You
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:59.680]  know, I was thinking, if you had the last name Trump, which is just a German name, what
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:06.200]  must that be like? Because anti-Trumpers are such ignorant people. Just a name means so
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.120]  much to them. I've always been lucky. I got such a common name that nobody blames me for
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:17.000]  like Jim Jones having the same name, the same last name. So Jones is like when you've got
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:29.760]  a rare name like Trump or maybe Kaczynski, you're like, oh, what are you, the unabomber?
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.720]  So that's coming up tonight. State of the Union. It's going to be pretty amazing. We're
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.040]  going to have live coverage, seven o'clock central at infowords.com forward slash show.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.680]  And again, we're battling censorship. They're a tip to shut us down. When you get excited
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.640]  about something as an audience and you share it on your email or your text message, they
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.960]  can't censor that yet. Or your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. Hey, see the censored state of the
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.680]  Union coverage tonight. That's what overdrives the enemy. So that we're in a position to
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:04.160]  break investigative journals in the future, have reporters on the ground. It's amazing.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.200]  You know, the Super Bowl was down by 30% as people are sick of race painting. Just with
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.000]  our auxiliary reporters, I haven't really been keeping track of it. There's no monetization
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.680]  of it. We don't make money from it, which is what we need to fund things. Caitlyn Bennett
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:27.240]  alone had over 20 million views the last two weeks, 20 million. That's 20 million eyeballs
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:33.800]  or I guess that's 40 million eyeballs that watched her. That's just one of our reporters.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.200]  And you've got Will Johnson and you've got Millie Weaver and all these other great people
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.880]  out there kicking butt, Owen Schreuer, just tens of millions of views. And so we're, we're
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:48.600]  fighting on. That's really my job is administratively to try to keep him full worth here or audience
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:54.720]  funding the mothership so that we can continue with the cadets who were already winning great
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:00.680]  battles doing better than we've done out there earning their bones in the fight. So again,
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.640]  ladies and gentlemen, I just keep going back to this. Thank you for your support. And remember,
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.720]  this is an epic fight in your word of mouth is paramount, but above the mountaintop is
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:16.480]  the sky. And what's heavenly is your prayer. So spreading the words paramount financially

[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:39.320]  Big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny will so does he live
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:53.960]  from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, it doesn't happen
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:59.160]  very often, but I agree with Maxine waters. She has come out a new video and ordered people
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.160]  not to watch the state of the union. You're a Democrat said they should even carry his
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:07.080]  own law speech. I agree. He doesn't get free speech info wars doesn't get free speech.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:13.120]  You don't only Maxine waters get speech. I agree with this authoritarianism. America
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.040]  sit down and shut up and accept world government and hail our queen Maxine waters. Here she
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.800]  is. I don't even know why he wants to come and give the state of the union. The state
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:28.040]  of the union under him has not been good and he has been divisive and I think he's putting
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:33.520]  us all in harm's way. And so he's not worthy of being listened to. I don't know why anybody
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.920]  want to pay attention to anything that he has to say. He lies over and over again. Like
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:43.480]  I said, 6,000 lives have been documented since he's been there. I just can't imagine what
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.640]  he's going to try and say. But since he is a great liar, he'll say anything because he's
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:54.160]  capable of saying anything without facts, without research. And so I'm not looking forward
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.400]  to his state of the union. And I hope that people will turn the television off. Yeah,
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.000]  like you've turned internet freedom off and all the rest of it. I mean, what a month and
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.200]  they always just show like 10,000 lies, 5,000,000 lies, like 20 containers of gumballs. These
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.480]  are all lies from a pack of liars. Oh, they play games like he said, there's a mile high
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:20.880]  burgers. There was only 2,000 hamburgers. It's hyperbole. It's like saying somebody
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.360]  knocks it out of the park because they got an A plus. They didn't literally knock a baseball
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:32.120]  out of the park like Babe Ruth. Unbelievable crap from that lunatic woman. Well, guess what?
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:39.400]  Let me look at camera one real quick. Maxine waters has commanded us not to watch the state
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:42.520]  of the union. We're about to put a video and I agree with her. There's no first woman
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:48.120]  America. Don't listen to Trump. Just believe her when she says he's a liar. Just believe
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.880]  her. Just believe in mainstream media. Just do it and don't watch tonight at info wars.com
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.680]  or slash show. Whatever you do, don't want to come and give the state of the union. The
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:03.800]  state of the union under him has not been good and he has been divisive. And I think
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.920]  he's putting us all in harm's way. And so he's not worthy of being listened to. I don't
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.440]  know why anybody want to pay attention to anything that he has to say. All right, shut
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.880]  her up. She wants to shut everybody else up. I already played her once. I can't listen
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.320]  to it again. This is the demoralization of America. If you wonder the scum that globalists
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.800]  would hire to swendle America, to bankrupt America, to raise interest rates, to stop
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.680]  the recovery. This is it. You want to look at the bottom of the barrel, folks. It's maxi
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:36.520]  waters with all their $5 million homes and Bentley's and everything and her husband getting
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:42.920]  all that bailout money from her direct cash his bank. This is a hateful, arrogant, crazed
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:53.560]  demon who is only pissed that Trump is trying to remove this tick from our neck. Wow. Does
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:58.360]  she give Trump credit for trying to get black folks out of prison or try to end the wars?
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:04.840]  No. She supports the wars. She supports Hillary that said black men are super predators. Because
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:11.560]  listen, it went back to the Romans and it went back to the sugarcane plantations 400 years ago
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:17.080]  in the Caribbean and to the south were, you know, 1% of the population had slaves. The
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:24.520]  establishment always tries to find a black lady as the Judas go to go out and to lead
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:31.240]  black families into slavery. She is the house slave of the globalist Maxine waters is a house
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.520]  slave to make sure the blacks get aborted. She's the house slave to make sure that you never get
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.480]  a job. Make sure you make your trip as quickly as possible right to present for her Lord and
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:48.760]  Savior, Hillary Rodden Clinton, who says that blacks are super predators. They need to be
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:54.840]  brought to heal. In fact, can we cue that up because that's an actual video. I'm just imagine
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:04.040]  if anybody else said that. Let's see, Hillary can because, well, you know, she's Hillary Clinton,
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:09.240]  so she's allowed to do whatever she wants. Bill Markets say the n-word. Bill Markets say he
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.280]  likes pedophilia. Doesn't get in trouble. Anybody else does it. You got a problem because look
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.440]  at her. Just look at how ugly she is. I don't mean just because she's old, but the total
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:24.360]  they go back to the earlier photo, the total disconnect with reality. It was the photo before
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.320]  that two photos before that. Oh, I mean, look at her. Just look at that. It's like a great white
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:36.600]  shark. Back it up one, a great white shark just cresting out of the water. It's just a psychotic
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:42.040]  demon from hell. Like I've invaded your planet or death murder. I love it.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.320]  The earth will serve as well. Prepare operations for destruction.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.040]  It's an actual dialed in transmission from Hillary.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.280]  You know, I was the first to point out that she looks like a great white shark cresting.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:11.640]  Now it's a luscious juicy meme. Let me get serious. Yeah, McGinnis is popping in after his
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.480]  big press conference yesterday. We're going to play some clips of that.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.520]  But the first big thing I want to do is just tell you some of the other big news that's coming up
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:27.560]  here. I mentioned it last hour, but I think this is something that should be re-mentioned because
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:34.200]  it's so big. Mitch McConnell, the Republicans with the Democrats passed a near unanimous resolution
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:41.160]  to continue maximum troop deployment in Afghanistan and Syria.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:46.200]  Despite the fact that they meant there's no strategic value in it and that it's for globalism
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:52.440]  and that we're basically China's mercenaries. So that story is up on info wars.com. Very,
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:13:05.080]  very sick. Meanwhile, China took gorge on double muscle frankenswine pigs
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:15.000]  after ditching fat. And when you look at these pigs, they're genetically engineered to not have fat.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:28.040]  And the government has ordered people to come out with these. The government
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:38.840]  has ordered the population to breed these cloned chimera pigs that have all sorts of
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.880]  bizarre neck engineering put into them. And so this just shows that China has no bottom.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.760]  The bottom is falling out. They've got chickens that they breed in China
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:56.600]  that don't have wings. They have nothing but four legs. And so the government's banning
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.440]  traditional pigs because they have fat on them. I mean, look at that video. Click on that video,
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.560]  those franken pigs. I mean, that looks like something out of a nightmare vision of hell.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:14.600]  So that's what's going on in the world. And this is just the beginning. I remember like
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.920]  10 years ago on the BBC, China now has human milk produced by cows that are part of human
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.040]  and the milk's identical to human milk. Yeah, right. And he's being sold in stores as babies milk.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.360]  And this is just the stuff they're showing you.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:37.880]  This is just the stuff they're showing you. Record profits puts new bull's eye on tech giants.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:49.000]  Absolutely. And then when we come back, there's big articles out here dealing with the fact that
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.760]  women's brains are different than men's. And then there's even a discussion. Are we allowed to say
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.880]  that? I don't know. Are women different than men? They have a uterus. They have a totally different
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:07.640]  cycle. There are species. And you have straight up scientific journals going,
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:15.560]  are we to say in the journals that women have vaginas and uteruses? And they sit around with
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:22.440]  straight faces going, is it offensive? That's the total cult brainwashing, right? As all the GMO
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.080]  floods and all the transhuman and human clones, they've got us so confused. You can't say men
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:32.280]  and women exist or families exist, but you can have franken pigs and franken cows and human clones
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.920]  for their organs and kill political dissidents. They're just frying everything. They're telling
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:42.760]  moral people, mothers and fathers and families are bad. They don't exist. But franken pigs and
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:51.000]  franken chickens, they do. You can just see the little gremlins at their transmission tables,
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.880]  interfacing with San Francisco. They got a video game for them as they carried the planet apart.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:03.320]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.920]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:16.040]  World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.560]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I,

[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.880]  so this is the way modern psychology works this is the way that the the psych warfare system operates
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.920]  they get the corporate media lined up with a set of talking points
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:57.000]  and then they will target a few people out in the general public uh to be attacked to be demonized
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:04.120]  be destroyed based on a lie and then once they've done that they can then start targeting other
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:09.400]  people who will then prostrate themselves on the ground begging saying please don't come after me
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:17.640]  next and now they've got a stampede of fear going and then no matter how many mentally ill you know
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:24.120]  six foot four linebacker dudes and pink shirts go in and tear up stores and physically attack people
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:31.000]  saying i'm a ma'am you must bow down to it and then the general public sees that and says well
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.640]  this is total mental illness but i better go ahead and submit to it and at that point there's a total
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:43.240]  collapse in the society so cults always try to get you to do weird stuff because if you'll do it
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.200]  you'll do anything so this is all cult programming this has all been cooked up by the cults that are
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:55.240]  modern psychology modern psychiatry and now it's gotten to the point where they have major scientific
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:01.240]  journals and others i have the articles right here going it's time to change medical books
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.200]  you can't have men and women because if you have men and women some people aren't men and women it
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:11.800]  hurts them that you're a man or a woman and you're so privileged so we can't actually have medical
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:18.440]  books about how to do server surgery on a cervix because it doesn't exist you're like this sounds
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:29.960]  like comedy but see they mean business this is mass designed mental illness and so imagine the sun
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:38.920]  is yellow it's a yellow star it's a yellow star well what if someone was uh wasn't yellow and they
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:44.920]  said well it hurts my feelings i'm not yellow so the sun can't be yellow because someone else
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:50.280]  isn't yellow google said last week we're looking at how to control the name family other people may
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:56.280]  not have them so if you use the word it could be hurtful well that's mentally ill that doesn't
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.160]  make no it makes perfect sense you're attacking language you're attacking words to where if you
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:08.360]  try to type it on your android phone words you're not supposed to it won't let you do it that's the
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:14.760]  total control and if they'll get you to say family doesn't exist well then nothing exists so there's
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:22.280]  an article around new york mag the nature of sex and it says suddenly feminist groups are mad
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:28.120]  that men are showing up in bathrooms and little girls showers and saying they're women no women
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:33.560]  are saying we're women see first they get women to divide themselves from the family and say we're
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:39.640]  women hear me roar now they're like well actually i'm a man hear me we're on a woman so they taught
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:44.680]  women in the early phase using territorialism to say i'm women i'm not man we're all in one
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.240]  community really you're an individual but you're part of a communal but once they did that now they're
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:57.720]  like no no no now you are not a woman or a man and feminists are like no i'm all into women power and
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:05.240]  women and when women are separate from men we got uteruses we blah blah blah we've got mitochondrial
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.880]  DNA men don't even have it yeah exactly women really figure out why you're targeted the folks
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:16.200]  telling you i mean articles can men get pregnant all of this is just oh look oh two penguins are gay
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.520]  because male penguins taking care of an egg that's what penguins do male penguins take care of eggs
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:30.280]  even if it's not theirs if a if a if a tiger seal eats a male penguin another penguin takes over the
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:37.160]  egg but everywhere nationwide look at the gay penguin he's taking care of an egg everything
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:45.000]  is to jack with your kids to screw you up so it might be a sign of the end times or simply
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.840]  function of our currently scrambled politics but earlier this week four feminist activists three
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.240]  from a self-described radical feminist organization women's liberation front appeared on a panel at
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.760]  the heritage foundation together they argue that sex was fundamentally biological oh wow and not
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:07.480]  socially constructed and that there is a difference between men and women and trans women that needs to
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.560]  be represented and respected yeah in japan if you're going to call yourself a woman you got at least
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.440]  cut your genitals off you're not really a woman you're a unit now but okay you you put some skin
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.040]  in the game you can call yourself a woman for this they were given a rousing round of applause
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:26.760]  by the trump supporters religious right members natural law theorist and conservative intellectuals
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:35.240]  and it goes on what it two plus two equals four but again it's a total attack on reason attack on
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:40.600]  the west in fact let's play the audio of the standing ovation and this is what upsets the left
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.480]  like we say the emperor has new clothes they point out he's naked and they're getting together and the
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.160]  left isn't buying it well my god how far are you gonna go it's all about nambla admits this saying
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.600]  well i identify as a child nambla says so i can have sex with your five-year-old and it's some 400
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:06.920]  pound gross dude it's not dude it's baby boy and so this is all just part of the mental illness
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.400]  where you'll have a woman that says she's turned into a man and then they get pregnant so they
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.720]  say a man's having a baby no you're a woman that says they're a man that's having a baby
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:23.080]  who we're sure you're gonna screw up let's bring the rest of story here's the guardian
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.960]  women's brains are four years younger than men's yeah they live four years longer on average too
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.560]  baby girls are stronger and live longer than boys that's all known women's blood brain barriers
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:41.160]  are stronger yeah women are different women have a whole double set of dna the scientists came and
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:48.760]  figure out meanwhile women's brains are nearly four years younger than men's at least in how they
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:55.080]  burn fuel according to scans performed by researchers so the question is is it okay to
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.280]  even call them women this is like a fever dream but it's the takedown plan
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:07.480]  i don't know is my mom different than my dad this is how you take a civilization over obesity

[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:30.840]  has to say because people like mad maxine are saying don't watch it turn it off the democrats
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.440]  have also said you know don't even let him have oval office discussions uh mitch McConnell's basically
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:42.760]  threatened impeachment and passed a resolution saying if you try to pull our trips out of
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:48.200]  syria or afghanistan will impeach you i mean it's the must be the president that's over these wars
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:54.760]  and congress that funds them and so just we're seeing a lot of bizarre globalist behavior right
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:01.880]  now but i for one i'm very very proud of the president for what he's been doing and i rarely
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.280]  play a clip twice in the same show the full 15 minute video is up on info wars dot com
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:15.320]  and news wars dot com you know don salazar article uh rand paul lashes out against forever wars
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:20.680]  our military do not want to be the policeman of the world very powerful 16 minute video
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.640]  on info wars dot com it'll only get out of you get it out uh i mean where's the left not
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.080]  wanting all these illegal wars where's the left not wanting blacks to get three times
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:34.680]  the president's sentence of whites trumps into it all and they want his impeachment i mean
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:43.960]  that is so twilight zone or or or black mirror or outer limits for me to just to know that trumps
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:47.960]  is trying to turn the economy on and and trying to get us a better deals and trying to get all
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:52.760]  these secret technologies declassified and and the deep states hijacked america it's like no
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:58.840]  you're not doing that we own and run this man china gets over a hundred billion dollars a year of
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:05.400]  rare earth minerals out of afghanistan we get zero we pay to protect it on average over a hundred
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:11.000]  billion dollars a year in the last 18 years 17 and a half years and then china gets all the stuff
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.440]  i mean i'd still be against it if we were getting all the rare earth minerals but china's been giving
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.440]  the monopoly like okay well we're there for the minerals it's still immoral let's get out of there
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:26.680]  but it makes it worse that we pay for it and we die and people get their arms and legs blown off
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:34.760]  and get sent home in pine boxes to mommy and daddy it's insane i looked the numbers up we
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:42.920]  spend a hundred billion on average in the last 17 years so it's approaching two trillion and it's
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:50.280]  it's been cut under trump so it's it's down to 54 billion dollars a year that's five times the
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:56.360]  complete wall and again the sport stadiums the last decade 40 billion i looked it up david was
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:08.840]  saying 35 40 billion smackers 40 billion smackers 40 billion dollars for sports stadiums that these
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:13.640]  billionaires get built for free hey if you're if your football team's so damn important you pay for
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:20.520]  it oh but we don't have money to build a wall we can just build 40 billion dollars of sports stadiums
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.280]  so let's go to the ram paul clip here because this is so important
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:33.960]  two minute boil down where he lays it out and i totally agree with him is afghanistan a mess
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:40.920]  sure it's a mess it's always been a mess and always will be a mess but now our mission has
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:48.200]  changed to nation building i want to compliment president trump for being bold and brave and
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:55.480]  saying enough's enough let's spend that money at home we spend 51 billion dollars a year in
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:01.560]  afghanistan that money could be spent at home i've got three members of my family in the military
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:09.240]  i don't want them to go to afghanistan every one of our political and military leaders republican
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.840]  democrat and independent will tell you there is no military mission in afghanistan and yet
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.920]  we stay some of the very same people who say we have no mission in the next breath say we need
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:27.240]  to send more troops there we sent a hundred thousand and we completely had victory and then
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:31.720]  they came back as our troops came down or we descend a hundred thousand and keep them there forever
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.920]  this resolution is an insult to the president and i will oppose it this resolution is put forward
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:45.720]  by republicans who say to president trump that you are leaving precipitously from afghanistan
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:54.040]  how do you leave precipitously after 17 years 17 years we are no longer fighting anyone who
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:39:00.600]  attacked us on 9 11 the people we are fighting we're not even born when 9 11 happened the war
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:07.160]  of there has nothing to do with 9 11 it has to do with nation building and i'll tell you what
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.520]  one navy seal told me that i met a year or two ago he says we'll go anywhere we'll kill our enemy
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:19.560]  we'll do what you ask of us but the mistake is when you ask us to stay plant the flag and become
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.200]  policemen they don't want to be policemen our military do not want to be the policeman of the
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.720]  world we fight when we have to we should come home that money should be spent here at home
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:37.000]  there's still some good people you know and i'm mad at trump for not going after deep state more
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.880]  and for not going after vaccines more and some things but overall i mean he's it's not less
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:45.480]  or two evils it's a told different ballgame of what hillary would have been doing right now
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:50.920]  now and all the evil stuff she wanted to carry out and the fact that he he is like there's no
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:56.200]  mission here and we're spending 30 40 billion in syria and 50 something billion here that's 100
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:01.720]  billion bring it back uh get the troops raises he's already done that twice and they're just like no
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:06.600]  and the average person i know even even you know non-commissioned officers who've been in
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:14.360]  10 15 years they can barely pay their bills but don't worry the big companies themselves are
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:18.520]  making billions of dollars i don't care if these companies make a lot of money that that's what
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:23.080]  builds up infrastructure but don't do it at the expense of the damn country and we lose the whole
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.960]  nation when the country's collapsing and there's a whole raft of socialist candidates about to
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:36.440]  take over and and we can't even take care of people to va so they don't commit suicide and and the
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.560]  president can't even say it's okay to love your nation they call that evil and say the word nation
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:48.440]  is evil and father and mother and and family is evil these people are the enemy gosh
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:57.160]  i mean it's so clear it's it's we have just it's our fault we've let a bunch of crazy criminals
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:03.400]  run things and now they think it's crazy we even exist anymore we're so tolerant we let these
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:08.440]  lunatics do whatever they want and now we're sitting here and they're telling us that well hey

[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:17.480]  suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:24.040]  authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won they don't want us to
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:29.880]  have that victory they don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the

[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:52.040]  making false representations working for an fbi contractor according to gifts from an fbi applicant
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:58.280]  receiving them accepting the fbi applicant in an employment selection process and misusing a
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:04.920]  government vehicle and cell phones so a lot of shoes are about to drop on that front the battle
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:10.920]  is joined now joining us speaking of joining is gab mcginnis who just filed suit against the
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:16.760]  very mysterious globalist multi-billion dollar consortium of the southern prairie law center
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:23.160]  that started out trying to help poor white and black farmers in alabama when they got screwed
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:31.480]  over you know 50 years ago and got taken over uh and got uh turned into a whole new situation
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:37.960]  where they just demonized anybody that it that isn't for george soros so we had part of his press
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:43.880]  conference yesterday but he's uh joining us joining us right now to give us the latest
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:51.480]  gabin good to have you with us thanks for having me alex well wow so uh break this down how the
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:57.080]  press conference go what's the response been like the response is great we've already raised
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:03.960]  about uh 35 000 i think on defend gabin dot com uh we'll need to raise a lot more of course it's
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.520]  going to be a hell of a battle because we're going up against people that are worth hundreds of millions
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:14.280]  of dollars i mean even that payout they did to majid noah's of 3.7 million that was just a parking
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:21.320]  ticket to them this is this we are up against a major force right now let's break down like you do
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:25.160]  in your in your press release who these people really are what their plan is because they're
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:30.920]  seen as god by the banks the media and when they say you're a bad person you go right to the ovens
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:36.520]  this is more than just a hate list it's not just a random list that you appear on and it doesn't
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.600]  matter and it doesn't just affect your twitter account or stop you from putting a picture on
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:47.480]  instagram they are deeply embedded in all social media and they are getting involved in banking
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:53.720]  and affecting what companies can bank with whom i mean it's sort of like the al sharp in racket
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:51:00.520]  where they say you better use us as uh your your your policy guide is your ethics commissioner
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:05.560]  or we're going to blackball you and make you seem evil and put you on our hate list so it's a form
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.920]  of extortion at this point and they've got this new thing called change the terms where they want
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:16.920]  to get deeply involved in all social media which is really getting involved in the way us americans
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:22.040]  talk to each other they want to prevent us from talking to each other and it's it's really insidious
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:26.680]  it's really our william and it's it's mostly directed at christians and conservatives but
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.240]  i'm telling you the left knows how to cannibalize itself and it's going to start affecting everyone
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:36.440]  on all sides of the spectrum this isn't just going to be i'm against bigots this is going to be
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:44.600]  whoever the splc dislikes is deep person across all platforms and unable to do business bankrupted
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:50.840]  well let me raise this because joe rogan's been getting 40 000 to you know 5 000 dislikes since
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:55.960]  it came out that he's on the payroll of jack dorsi and twitter for for product placement not telling
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:00.760]  people and promoting uh bitcoin and and other securities without telling people that he's being
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:05.080]  paid which is illegal a lot of folks get paid major fines and gel time for that i'm just pointing
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:10.520]  out that you know he wants to be holier than now we're going to expose it uh but don't worry google's
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:16.360]  a parent company of youtube says we're looking to get rid of the thumbs up thumbs down because that's
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.160]  a hate uh being able to vote being able to show you like something you're not which is the whole
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:26.200]  systems based on uh that group voting well that's evil democrats love voting it's illegal alien
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:31.480]  they don't want you voting haters can't hate if there's no dislike button user slam youtube
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:38.680]  for mulling thumbs down fix that was yesterday uh they're officially saying today uh that they
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:45.240]  are planning to get rid of it uh i mean that's just next level you know this is all just a war on
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:52.280]  color and a war on fun the war on you uh alex is a war on people who are hyperbolic and thumbs
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:57.080]  down thumbs up that's how we express ourselves you know you know that non playable character meme
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:02.040]  and the learn to code meme they're going to start calling those hate speech and they'll
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:07.960]  outlaw those well they banned a whole bunch of people saying learn to code is white supremacist
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:12.040]  so now that's actually banned now a leftist can say i'm going to kill you and all that if you
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:18.200]  say hey learn to code well you're off twitter it's a war on jokes remember orwell said within
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:23.640]  every joke it's a tiny revolution and these people are extinguishing jokes extinguishing color
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:30.680]  extinguishing fun and it's under the guise of egalitarianism but that's a lie that the splc
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:35.480]  ran out of actual bigots a long time ago and now they just generate the matter of thin air and in
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:39.800]  that sense they're the real hate group because they are generating hate where there is none
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:46.600]  think about google came out last week and said we're looking at how to control the word family
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:51.800]  it's hurtful so now family i mean that you talk about a cult and you talk about getting rid of
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:57.000]  color it's about 1984 everybody wears gray outfits the houses are ugly to dehumanize or trying to
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.040]  end the family they haven't figured out how to do it he was a top fabian socialist who was on board
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:07.640]  till he found out how bad the socialists were and 1984 is about how bad fascists and socialists are
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:11.960]  and and and so yeah they're getting rid of the real diversity they're getting rid of
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:18.840]  of what really makes us great and it's what makes america unique i mean free speech isn't a big
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:23.800]  thing in canada in fact the canadian human rights commission proudly touts that they are not about
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:28.120]  free speech that's an american thing britain one of the reasons why jidna was was able to sue the
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:34.360]  splc is because britain doesn't really have free speech laws it's it's easy to sue over there um
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:41.640]  when you when you decided someone has offended you and the beauty of america is we are the ugly
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:46.840]  americans it's already danger filled in caddy shack we're crass we like to make inappropriate jokes
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.400]  you know this is the home of beavers and butt in and they're taking that all the way and they're just
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.080]  they're draining america of the red white and blue and just making it gray
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.720]  i forgot to send this to the producers a few days ago when i saw it but a famous british
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  author uh chris hitchens little best buddy he does this video it's time to talk about alex jones
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:15.320]  and white supremacist and then he says jones says kill the parkland parents jones says kill children
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:21.000]  at parkland i never said that he says jones said no one died at parkland so now they've just moved
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.720]  on from sandy hook and are just making up the most insane crap i've ever seen in my life
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:32.200]  i it's exhausting i mean you read these huffington post articles and you go there's so many
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:38.680]  falsities in here that it would take it would take me like 500 of lawyer time to identify them all
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:43.640]  it's it's getting tedious now and then you look up a lot of these authors and you see that they're
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:48.680]  closely linked with ntifa and you realize journalism is dead journalism doesn't involve
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:54.120]  research anymore journalism is all just opinion pieces now and they're really bad writers too
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:57.480]  that's the worst part you're reading fiction by incompetent writers
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:01.320]  what's the next shoot a drop
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.400]  what do you mean for me or in general in society well no just just at every level because i asked
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:14.760]  you like two years ago when will we get peak liberal insanity and an outrage you said all
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.680]  things going to get much worse and so what's next for you what's next for their moral outrage
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:26.120]  i think what's next with the the far left the splc is total domination of all communication
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:31.080]  platforms so conservatives christians and conservatives have no voice and it will just
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:36.440]  be this infinite loop bubble of people making up stories about trump and about conservatives and
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:41.960]  about guys like you and me and we won't be able to defend ourselves and the guava tangent until
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:48.040]  we are inhuman we were easy to kill you've had so many lies about this person being a nazi that's
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:52.920]  it seems ethical to kill him and that's where i think we're headed to we're headed to intense
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:59.400]  violence towards christians and conservatives well that's it and just the insanity of these people
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:04.280]  and their arrogance and a lot of it is big free societies create a lot of bums and a lot of stupid
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:09.080]  people i mean that's that's a side effect of freedom and like you go to a democratic event i
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:14.200]  mean these are like it looks like a mental institution escaped but they're all hateful
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:19.480]  and they're all pissed and they all want to run your life and it's like we've met authoritarianism
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:26.120]  and i think we've let this happen i think you're right um i'm getting another call from a uh

[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:20.440]  need to get to first and that's martin aims when we return because i saw this a couple days ago
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:30.600]  and and literally 99 of the comments there's more comments than views are you are the biggest
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.040]  fake moron pickled brained idiot we've ever heard in our life but you've got to understand
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:45.080]  well these guys that's all they do is just walk around and bloat and just and just like pause on

[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:01.800]  can stick a tap in that pure whiskey would come right out of it so anyways this is hilarious
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:08.520]  because you need to get in the mindset of these guys and you've got to understand what you're
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:14.840]  dealing with so we're going to be talking about that when we come up but joe rogan literally
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:22.200]  does all these soros talking points from soros organizations he cites soros organizations
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:33.560]  and then says i'm a liar no i'm not a liar so you can run run run you can run run run
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:42.200]  but you can't get away for your date with destiny joe joe joe rogan metaphysically
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:48.760]  is a christmas hog and i'm gonna politically haul him up by his back legs and slit his throat
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:05:04.680]  his blood will fill buckets politically not violently get ready joe
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:12.920]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:19.080]  and energy supplements but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:23.800]  chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:30.440]  side effects we have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy energy drink
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:36.360]  pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing else like it you must experience it
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:42.120]  it is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packaged mixed-sale fruit juice or water
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:47.240]  whatever you'd like warning though it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half pack
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:52.040]  the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:06:15.960]  overdrive turbo force and enforce live com
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:23.960]  ah
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:32.520]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:38.360]  i already told you globalist and all you minions of the system a long time ago
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:47.480]  i'm afraid of god when i'm not fighting you i feel scared when i'm fighting you i see god
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:54.760]  smiling in the center of my soul right in my heart i know the wind is feeling my shales and i'm on a
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:07:02.360]  journey where i'm supposed to go i'm on the path of my ancestors a path beyond the stars
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:09.880]  a path to fall that's why i do this because to not do it is to lose the soul
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:20.680]  and you've all chosen your lot with the devil and i've chosen that i must take you on it'll be
[02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:26.600]  this contest that defines us it'll be these wars these fights make us who we are
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:34.760]  once we stop fearing the devil and start taking the devil on is the day we start living
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:43.880]  and then you see the horizon you realize god's in control and the bluff's got to be called
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:49.080]  the enemy's got to be engaged bone's got to meet bone
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:56.840]  thord's got to meet shield the axe has got to come down on that skull and in the end we'll see heaven
[02:07:56.840 --> 02:08:09.160]  you know one of my greatest frustrations is that the enemies of freedom are so pathetic you know
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:15.080]  it's in revelation that after for a thousand years the devil will be bound and and basically be an
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:21.000]  amusement and people are going to walk by and see the antichrist see the devil and say that's what
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:30.520]  did all this that this this was able to do it but see don't joke too long because god's going to let
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:39.320]  him out again after a thousand years of life extension and nobody dying and the secrets of
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:44.920]  the dimensions and everything on this planet unlimited potential a jump point to the universe
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:52.200]  people will turn against god again when they've already seen it and know everything
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:59.720]  but after that this whole reality that god had created is a simulation will be rolled up like a
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:09.480]  scroll and everyone that was part of the enemy plan is gone and we go to the next level
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:19.240]  i know about you but i want to be i want to be on the next level right let me explain some of you
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:24.520]  this isn't my cosmology this isn't something out of a book this is studying the enemy
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:31.240]  and who they are and who they serve and the darkness they're involved in these are collaborators
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:41.320]  with the worst crap in the universe you see god's free will these individuals are against
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:49.960]  free will so let me shift gears to this guy a couple days ago somebody emailed me the video
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:56.840]  and they said look at this guy i mean is this guy reporting from another dimension is this guy
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:07.400]  reporting from another reality and it was an image for the video of myself and a burning swastika
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:15.880]  maybe we can pull the youtube up for folks and what to do with evil ideas so he goes on to
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:24.840]  misrepresent what i've said and done compares me the nazis martin amos and says i need to be taken
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:31.880]  off the air is basically the video and you talk about someone in love with themselves the way he
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:41.880]  talks real slow and then kind of and he says the most insane stuff like if the media hadn't been so
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:49.400]  even handed and balanced we'd have president clinton and judge what like giving her all the
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:57.560]  questions and rigging the polls and 93 negative if the media hadn't been so fair and then he says
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:02.520]  something that he is in the poll position and within the next few months i've already followed
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:07.720]  some suits i'm filing suits against people that say that i've harassed the sandy hook families or
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:12.280]  say that i'm currently saying it didn't happen which is out of context but he goes further he
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:18.520]  says that i say no one died at parkland and they're all crisis actors others i never said that
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:23.480]  that i said that there was a police stand down first youtube took my videos down and said that
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:29.720]  we had copies ourselves put them up drudge link to it had 14 million views on two videos
[02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:33.800]  and youtube had to say okay it's true you didn't say that and put it back up but even if i had said
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:39.240]  that it's free speech i want to say the moons man cheese i should be able to know that the
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:48.200]  shooting happened and there was a police stand down as usual and he says not only is he saying
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:54.600]  parkland didn't happen he's trying to kill the parents he's saying murder them now you talk about
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:12:01.960]  fire in a theater that's not free speech if i'm saying murder people of course i didn't say that
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:07.240]  he doesn't show it so he sits there with this big giant alcoholic root off the red nose reindeer nose
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:13.640]  and he looks like someone you find in a mental institution and it goes back to christopher
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.240]  hitchhens and him and all these pseudo-intellectuals because they walk around going yes i'm wearing
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:28.760]  gloves and cigarettes with long filters i'm going oh god doesn't exist piss on him i'm so smart
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:36.760]  to he does this is some ideas are so evil you just don't allow them i mean this is what we're fighting
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:46.040]  these people are jokes i mean i could sit here and speak about how you're completely
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:51.800]  festooned with that entire flotilla of cliches and anti-free speech
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:58.200]  popery but i don't you hold let me do this hold on i'm putting my finger to my face
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:08.600]  do you realize how advanced that is so this is called the big think and the big think says
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:18.760]  you can't hear this information this alex jones is so horrible we've him removed so cowards like
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:27.000]  this man martin amos can lie about them what he's saying is oh dear the litmus test to get
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.600]  some attention no one's paying attention to me under my rock under my alcoholic rock wrapped
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:42.760]  around a vodka or scotch bottle i'll make myself popular with the young ones and i'll come out

[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:09.560]  what to do with evil ideas saman ruski has argued that um that you can't be you know it's
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:16.040]  idiotic to say you're above politics because politics is all around you and above you and
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:24.920]  beneath you it i was resistant to that idea but it it's clearly true isn't it it's um
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:31.160]  it's clearly true isn't it that there shouldn't be free speech i mean i do like one thing a year
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:40.440]  and just drink alcohol and piss blood all day and i i i'm threatened by sorry go ahead yeah but it
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:48.520]  it's clearly true isn't it that um that it's very hard to imagine um a piece of writing

[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:16.200]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:20.600]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:25.960]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:31.720]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:37.160]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:43.640]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:49.720]  it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to

[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:27.640]  just sounds nasty snake farm and pretty much is snake farm it's a reptile house snake farm
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:36.520]  ramona's got a keen sense of humor she got a tattoo down her arm instead of a python
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:42.680]  eating a little mouse we're gonna say the hat that says snake farm snake farm it just sounds
[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:49.400]  nasty snake farm and pretty much is snake farm it's a reptile house snake farm
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:00.760]  all right poll watch is taking over like 15 after but i gotta take a little bit of his time
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:10.360]  because i need to get into facts here i need to get my account set in life in the universe
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:18.760]  so the cia created timothy leary and put out the whole psychedelic revolution
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:27.320]  and then we looked at the groups funding joe rogan who single handedly has pretty much
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:32.760]  relaunched the whole dmt iowaska movement with retreats
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:40.920]  in every city i know and the police stand down and universities are involved which shows you
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:46.600]  there's government funding and joe himself is involved in fitness groups and self-help groups
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:54.680]  that conduct thousands a year into iowaska dmt you name it in stuff that is mk ultra on steroids
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:49:03.800]  and that's a fact and so this is all hidden in plain view so i was on joe's podcast a couple years
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:08.520]  ago wonder why he never had me on in like eight years but i wasn't mad he wasn't having me on
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:13.800]  was just kind of weird he was so i go on it's the biggest podcast he's ever done and then
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:20.200]  he starts to criticize me in the next year and a half and he starts to repeat government talking
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:26.600]  points and soros talking points over and over again and so i'm a busy guy i'm not watching
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:31.960]  his podcast on a regular basis but i start paying attention to it my son says yeah joe rogan used
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:38.840]  to like you he's now joe the snake rogan and so cnn has like half a million viewers on their bigger
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:45.000]  shows joe has probably 10 million viewers for his average show that's a very conservative number
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:49.240]  his bigger shows 40 50 million so you could say he's right up there at the top of podcasters
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:55.080]  and poody pie won't go under their control and others won't so they're getting censored but but joe
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:50:00.760]  suddenly you know people send me clips is like yeah george soros fought hitler was a hero in
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:05.080]  world war two well no george soros told 60 minutes he was a nazi collaborator didn't feel bad for
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:10.520]  and then joe says well alex is lying about george soros george soros is a hero and then alex joe
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:14.920]  says nobody died at sandy hook and he's still attacking the families when i can question anything
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:21.720]  i want free speech but the internet questioned sandy hook so i questioned it like seven years ago
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:27.800]  moved off the subject the media is trying to make it who i am because hillary made it a talking point
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:32.600]  the 2016 election i'm sick of talking about it i think it happens school shootings happen the media
[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:37.720]  seizes on it they blame gun owners i'm tired of it but i was on chicago radio this morning they're
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:44.760]  like oh why are you attacking the families i mean i showed earlier this martin aames british washed up
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:52.120]  you know alcoholic he looks like you know weirdo saying jones is saying killed the parkland parents
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:58.040]  never said that so it's it's reached crazy count so i start calling joe about a year ago and i say
[02:50:58.040 --> 02:51:05.240]  listen you don't need to have me back on schiff said i'll have you back on everybody i said no just
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:11.080]  just listen i think sandy hook happened i think school shootings happened but things have been
[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:16.040]  staged before so people have a right to question so stop going the talking point i said it's really
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:22.840]  scary how you follow every talking point the established was putting out well then he gets even worse
[02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:29.400]  and then he calls me and says i'm gonna have you on before the election because i think some
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:33.640]  pacifism deal right when i was getting banned and then he doesn't return my call so i start
[02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:42.040]  researching joe and now he's the main sponsor he's got is jack dorsi and twitter and bitcoin and
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:49.160]  they're doing stuff that you know floyd mayweather had to pay 300 000 fines for their they're saying
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:53.880]  buy these products do these things and they're not saying they're paid by it it's illegal
[02:51:55.160 --> 02:52:00.440]  so the more i look at joe i'm like oh my god this guy is dirtier than a dirty diaper man i mean it's
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:09.240]  like and then i talk about some of it and then i get up at six a.m this morning and i go check the
[02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:14.840]  internet and boom joe rogan responds to alex jones and it's him all trying to act tough
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:20.680]  and like oh man if i saw you i'd hug you i'm still your friend but you know don't say i'm in the cia
[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:26.040]  and don't lie to me about this and that i never said you were in the cia i said all the iowaska
[02:52:26.040 --> 02:52:32.520]  dmt pushers are on record a cia program and then eddie bravo told me that you've been threatened
[02:52:33.240 --> 02:52:36.840]  and then joe idea said you'd met with a bunch of professors out of san francisco
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:41.240]  and i mean it doesn't matter you're pushing the agenda so he changed the subject into that
[02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:49.560]  and then it's this whole thing like i still want to hug you no joe i want you to be my enemy
[02:52:49.560 --> 02:52:57.480]  i don't like you i'm guilty i was ever nice to you i knew you were bad news 20 years ago
[02:52:57.480 --> 02:53:04.440]  i should have ignored that you're a charming guy i want war joe i want war i don't want to be nice

[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:04.440]  down the globalist and we're gonna take down soros and we're gonna take you down because god
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:12.600]  wants purity god wants things hot and cold not lukewarm god wants me to wage war god told me
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:25.560]  destroy joe rogan yes sir jesus i will do it no more games war ah the real thing war

[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:42.840]  the harvest of war is here and i will detonate thanks to god's blessing not the defeat of hillary
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:48.360]  but the next great mission before i'm done i will detonate the war that leads to your destruction
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:56.040]  and joe is only a baby in this but he's an example of these fools who must first be destroyed before
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:06.440]  they're cleansed now when we come back i'm going to play these pathetic clips i mean you couldn't
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:11.080]  write this stuff the way joe does it where these devils think they're so smart they have nothing
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:18.040]  he literally says i don't follow talking points i follow media matters that's owned and run by
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:27.000]  george soros so here's the deal i don't take pleasure in this i actually feel bad about it
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:33.560]  but i have to take pleasure in it or i just can't commit to this so here's what's going on folks
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:38.200]  they bought everybody off there's a bunch of candy asses out there but just bow to these
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:42.040]  corporate people and i'm not going to do it and i'm not going to take part of it and i'm not going
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:49.960]  to be involved in it it's that simple and i'm not going to sit there and push iowaska and dmt on a
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:55.480]  bunch of kids so they can get opened up to all this demonic influence i'm just not going to be
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:57:02.600]  part of it and i've never felt more alive than getting ready like a big old jugger not they just
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:08.600]  loaded up with fuel and pulled the pen on to get ready to come after all you people because now i
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.880]  realize my real mission is just about to start and i'm going to take over all these people i'm
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:19.720]  going to run every last one i'm over so that's what they and it was fearing they're going to get it
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:28.680]  now now the game's on get ready load the engines kickstart it all and let's go to valhalla
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:37.560]  so when we come back we're going to go through jack dorsi and joe rogan and his worship of the new

[03:03:27.560 --> 03:03:34.360]  about me lately is one of the weirder things that i've dealt with because first of all i've
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:38.840]  always had good dealings with alice in person person to person but he's obviously in a world
[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:43.000]  of sh** right now there's a lot going on with him with this sandy hook and pause where you come back

[03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:44.200]  i can set my fingers and go on radio stations with 200 400 500 600 radio stations that dwarf
[03:07:44.200 --> 03:07:50.120]  even with the internet can offer today those are audiences of 10 million five million two million
[03:07:50.680 --> 03:07:58.680]  actually listening but joe rogan and his podcast became the darling of silicon valley they decided
[03:07:58.680 --> 03:08:04.920]  it was the power source and then what joe had me on was the biggest podcast ever a couple years ago
[03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:13.160]  february of uh 2017 and and i i didn't care about going to show but i said joe you keep bashing me
[03:08:13.160 --> 03:08:19.080]  me paul watch is coming up by the way i'm gonna come after you and he goes oh i'm not doing uh
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:24.040]  talking points and he goes but media matters says jones says sandy hook never happened
[03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:28.760]  media matters has some edited tape i have a right to say sandy hook never happened
[03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:33.640]  and when the internet doubted it i looked at it and said i can see how people think it's
[03:08:33.640 --> 03:08:38.040]  totally synthetic in fact because of all the other false things we've seen dead babies and
[03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:43.160]  incubators and all the other fake news and then they edit that and then they sue me
[03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:50.440]  in rig jurisdiction whatever i'm not worried about that so so so he's saying oh i'm in trouble
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:55.960]  no i'm not in trouble i've gotten this fight joe i didn't try to climb up the butt of hollywood
[03:08:55.960 --> 03:09:03.080]  and tv and the establishment like you did and so you want to attack carlos mancia you want to attack
[03:09:03.080 --> 03:09:10.040]  uh other people you say still jokes dude you read off talking points you say i don't read talking
[03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:17.000]  points but media matters says that you know jones does this that's george soros on record
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:19.720]  i just said stop
[03:09:22.360 --> 03:09:28.200]  let's see my instincts always right i wanted to go after you earlier with the stuff i see but
[03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:34.040]  the fact that you did this now i mean dude we're like a weekend to me coming after you and our
[03:09:34.040 --> 03:09:39.240]  audience is powerful the real people i mean they change the world we're getting a nationalist
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:46.760]  like everywhere we're a vicious force and long after i'm gone though that force will still be there
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:56.760]  and oh your mma you got a bald head you're so tom so scared joe i'm so scared right now i'm so scared
[03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:01.720]  of your oh your big wigs in vegas and all the stuff you told me about 20 years ago about the
[03:10:01.720 --> 03:10:05.480]  mafia owning ufc and everything i already knew that when you told me that you think it's so
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:11.240]  impressed with that and all the rest of your weird ass crap so it's just an end of the day dude
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:16.760]  you've been acting like a tough guy for a long time that destroyed me give me your power show me
[03:10:16.760 --> 03:10:26.040]  what you can do here i am see see how it works now oh i'm so scared joe here i am joe you can't do
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:34.200]  anything because you're a devil and you can't stand against truth and you've chosen the wrong
[03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:40.760]  side and you're going to be destroyed no matter what happens to me joe you're done it's like captain
[03:10:40.760 --> 03:10:53.000]  ahab and and the whale moby dick you know is joe rogan captain ahab or is he moby dick i don't carry
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:11:02.760]  their way the point is is that i sit there with the number one political show on youtube
[03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:09.560]  that joe is viciously jealous of and admit it was way bigger than his show and then i get taken off
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:14.680]  and then he gets up there and and talks about how i won on his show and all this crap dude i don't
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:21.080]  want laurels that i didn't earn i don't want to be you i don't want to be given everything
[03:11:21.080 --> 03:11:29.960]  i want to earn it and so you think alex isn't a lot of trouble alex is being taken down
[03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:34.280]  see captain ahab isn't fighting

[03:20:35.400 --> 03:20:39.800]  i was going to do Joe Rogan today and i started getting into him but you know it's not proper
[03:20:39.800 --> 03:20:51.400]  i need to politically metaphysically butcher this hog properly and i want to go through
[03:20:51.400 --> 03:20:54.520]  what i'm doing because i'm not a vindictive person i'm not an infighter but he's the
[03:20:54.520 --> 03:20:59.160]  darling of the system he's putting out these talking points he's doing all this and you
[03:20:59.160 --> 03:21:05.400]  know he gets into all this crap about oh i'm not cia no we know the cia is pushing dmt and iowaska
[03:21:05.400 --> 03:21:10.600]  and oh you know i don't follow talking points but you know media matters says you're bad that's
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:16.040]  literally george soros joe but i'm going to stop there because we have coverage coming up tonight
[03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:21.160]  seven o'clock central after the war with oan shroyer but oan has big breaking news paul wasis
[03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:27.400]  taking over uh right now but i gotta tell you i'm not somebody that gets into trolling or
[03:21:27.400 --> 03:21:34.840]  or taking scalps but paul wass let me bring you up and you got a lot coming up this hour but
[03:21:37.720 --> 03:21:39.160]  when i'm looking at joe rogan
[03:21:41.320 --> 03:21:46.600]  and how he talks his crap constantly and doesn't think somebody else is going to strike back against
[03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:55.880]  him and then i see him lose hundreds of thousands of subscribers and it's eight to one downvotes when
[03:21:55.880 --> 03:22:01.880]  his normal video got 90 positive like argyz used to and he keeps doubling down and he gets worse for
[03:22:01.880 --> 03:22:08.840]  him he doesn't get when he chose to fight us he put himself in that position and he goes oh i'm not
[03:22:08.840 --> 03:22:15.240]  fighting you but then he's doing that that is fighting us and it's just so i don't want to like
[03:22:15.240 --> 03:22:21.000]  oh joe rogan's this big popular podcaster maybe number one i want to bring him down so i feel big
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:25.400]  i already had the number one news app we already had the number one podcast i'm not even mad
[03:22:25.400 --> 03:22:30.280]  if joe was number one it wasn't a dick wasn't selling people out i wouldn't care but the fact
[03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:35.480]  that he plays ball and ask jack dorsion and doesn't say he's heavily funded three hundred
[03:22:35.480 --> 03:22:40.680]  thousand dollars a month i wouldn't look at the at twitter's own twitter files corporate stuff
[03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:44.280]  they've been spending like three hundred thousand dollars for like three years a month i mean
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:48.600]  what's three years twelve times three hundred thousand it's millions of dollars i mean so
[03:22:48.600 --> 03:22:55.080]  so they were like oh god joseph's right he he's funding it exactly so i mean i'm just like dude
[03:22:55.080 --> 03:22:59.720]  do you want to punch me in the nose and then you worry why i fight back what do you think's
[03:22:59.720 --> 03:23:03.640]  going to happen out of this paul because i don't want to end fight but i'm not going to sit there
[03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:09.720]  and see so-called old friends lie about me lie about what we say and do and and and you know
[03:23:09.720 --> 03:23:16.760]  say that we're attacking a a a a parkland families now it's like oh well the sandy hook bs is gone
[03:23:16.760 --> 03:23:20.760]  so now let's just say this i mean a certain point paul i'm ready to fight what do you think
[03:23:22.760 --> 03:23:27.960]  well he had to come out on instagram i saw and do a kind of semi walk back on it alex
[03:23:27.960 --> 03:23:34.440]  i'm looking at the jack dorsi interview now 9.9 thousand thumbs up 63 thousand thumbs down so
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:39.240]  he's never had that before on any of his videos and as he's running the interview with dorsi
[03:23:39.880 --> 03:23:45.480]  when they asked dorsi directly why you were banned on twitter why the final decision was made
[03:23:45.480 --> 03:23:50.840]  he said he didn't know he didn't know why you were banned it was the biggest story of the year
[03:23:51.400 --> 03:23:57.800]  they banned you at the time we thought for being mean to a cnn reporter you know meantime blue
[03:23:57.800 --> 03:24:02.520]  checkmarks can call for yeah that's what by the way i was up the other night as i couldn't sleep
[03:24:02.520 --> 03:24:07.400]  they deleted tens of thousands of down votes too so that's that's a rig number it's more it's way worse
[03:24:08.680 --> 03:24:14.120]  well it's it's six to one against and you'd never get that on another joe rogan video but again
[03:24:14.120 --> 03:24:18.360]  he asked jack dorsi and he didn't know why he banned you and then rogan didn't follow up so
[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:23.560]  understandably people are miffed by this and he's getting a lot of criticism for the first time ever
[03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:32.360]  i would imagine all i know is i don't want to get paul credit for this but paul's always been uncanny
[03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:36.600]  and about a month into sandy hug first we're like oh they're going to use it to be anti-gun we weren't
[03:24:36.600 --> 03:24:41.080]  the guys that said it and there were some anomalies and then it turned out paul looked at him and he's
[03:24:41.080 --> 03:24:46.200]  like yeah they're at the fire station i remember like seven years ago paul calls me he goes he never
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:51.240]  calls me paul doesn't talk a lot i'm not kissing paul's ass it's just he's got to get credit he goes
[03:24:51.960 --> 03:24:57.560]  alex this is uh they're at the fire station i don't know why they're going in circles it's not the
[03:24:57.560 --> 03:25:03.880]  school how big is crazy this is going to hurt us and i'm like well okay people are questioning
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:11.960]  and i'm just questioning and so paul was the first guy seven years ago to say but we have a we're
[03:25:11.960 --> 03:25:18.600]  allowed to ask questions but but paul you were there but then years later like within i'm like
[03:25:18.600 --> 03:25:24.520]  okay it happened they then they go oh god he's weak let's say it he he he's currently doing it and it's
[03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:30.440]  like they're doing it in my name saying that i'm doing it what do you think well what should i do
[03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:37.560]  because at a certain point this is insane this is insane paul i don't know alex the the point is
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:44.600]  people were going to sandy hook parents houses years years ago like immediately after it happened
[03:25:44.600 --> 03:25:49.800]  we had absolutely nothing to do with that as you just said i i said we should get away from it no no
[03:25:49.800 --> 03:25:54.280]  you rarely call me i mean i wish why were you so concerned i mean you you've proven uncannily
[03:25:54.280 --> 03:25:58.840]  because i saw the people who were talking about it on the internet and they weren't that you know
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:03.160]  they'd some of them were actually unhinged people so i wanted to get as far away from those kind of
[03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:09.480]  people as possible but yeah the fact they still claim that you still to this day encourage people
[03:26:09.480 --> 03:26:15.160]  to go to that to the parents houses is absolutely ridiculous and clearly liable every time it's
[03:26:15.160 --> 03:26:20.680]  printed um without any any question behind it it's ridiculous alex and that's what they used on
[03:26:20.680 --> 03:26:26.040]  roku roku's like no we're leaving him up he's a top app oh they're coming to kill us at our houses
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:31.720]  the lawyer's like please he's coming now it's like it's like well i didn't think you were fake
[03:26:31.720 --> 03:26:39.160]  before but it's getting a little weird right now well exactly alex and you know as owens
[03:26:39.160 --> 03:26:44.280]  gonna lay out now they've just done another move against us which again the media got wind of this
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:48.920]  before it happened on facebook because i was literally on some of these facebook pages 10
[03:26:48.920 --> 03:26:53.640]  minutes ago and they're still up now they're down the media was reporting on it half an hour ago alex
[03:26:53.640 --> 03:26:59.720]  so owen can explain that further well exactly we'll come back because here's the thing like they had
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:04.760]  the the indictment the day before we don't have a cnn in documents and they they did that's illegal
[03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:11.000]  like they're they got seen in reporters at roger stone's houses we confirmed it was staged and there's
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:15.880]  no coverage and that's why they're so pissed about info wars because folks you go to info wars.com or
[03:27:15.880 --> 03:27:22.280]  news wars.com there's stuff nobody's gone i mean this is like twilight zone for me like maybe this
[03:27:22.280 --> 03:27:28.120]  is all a simulation owen well it's it's good that we have minds like paul joseph wasin and yourself
[03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:32.200]  and me and david night to kind of come together when all of this stuff breaks because i'm just
[03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:37.000]  getting ready for the war room and paul's obviously monitoring what what other people are doing and he
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:41.240]  sees the reports coming out oh guess what we're gonna ban everything else in for us there were a
[03:27:41.240 --> 03:27:45.960]  couple spots here and there i mean you know alex you quit coming on the war room you're i mean
[03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:51.080]  the show that you fun because you knew if you came on that they to totally erase that off social
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:57.160]  and i don't even care about me exactly some of it but now they got it now they got rid of that
[03:27:57.720 --> 03:28:01.320]  so so the war room is as of right now we're going to appeal it obviously but as right now the war
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:05.400]  room with myself and roger stone every day three to six p.m. central which is which is the head of
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:10.680]  the gag order he's an indicted person the judge says they're going to silence the judge already
[03:28:10.680 --> 03:28:18.520]  silenced other people there's the no russia gate and and she doesn't let you fundraise so the government's
[03:28:18.520 --> 03:28:25.560]  going to sue you indict you put you in prison and if you put up a go fund me the judge says you get
[03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:30.520]  no money it all just came together the reason why they just hit the war room is because it's
[03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:34.920]  roger stone's last place they didn't put a gag on her on them so we can keep talking but they figure
[03:28:34.920 --> 03:28:38.200]  oh no one will be listening we just got rid of the war room on facebook where our subscribers
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:43.240]  just went up like five thousand this weekend oh i've been told you cut roger blitz you're going
[03:28:43.240 --> 03:28:48.360]  to president it's like how do you give him to that like oh god well let me do that right away and it's

[03:32:34.520 --> 03:32:40.760]  about taking your very sovereignty away this country is in a war so again i want to thank you for
[03:32:40.760 --> 03:32:44.520]  what you've done but i want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you
[03:32:44.520 --> 03:32:49.800]  don't financially get the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win we're dead in the water
[03:32:49.800 --> 03:32:53.560]  i'm in your hands you're in my hands info wars store dot com thank you
[03:32:53.560 --> 03:33:10.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:10.200 --> 03:33:28.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show so honesty is my greatest
[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:37.160]  uh attribute so i'll just be honest i uh feel like humanity's up against the wall and i'm just
[03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:42.040]  trying to generally get people to awake to the globalist and to satanism and to corruption
[03:33:42.600 --> 03:33:50.920]  but instead now i'm like wait a minute i'm gonna attack their minions like they attack me for
[03:33:50.920 --> 03:33:57.000]  promoting liberty i'm gonna go after people that support the system oh and then they get so scared
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:03.160]  and that's the thing is they're not used to liberty lovers engaging them at point blank
[03:34:03.160 --> 03:34:10.120]  range and i think i think that really is the answer on well as soon as it hits your front door
[03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:14.280]  that's when you usually wake up to it whether it's people coming to take your guns whether it's
[03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:18.600]  people saying you can't have that bible whether it's people asking you who'd you worship this morning
[03:34:19.400 --> 03:34:23.080]  you know who knows maybe someday it'll be you they force you to wash the super bowl
[03:34:23.080 --> 03:34:26.840]  or you you know i have to pay a fine or something because the ratings are down so until it
[03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:33.960]  actually hits people's front door the will or the necessity or just the desire to fight
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:39.160]  is not there for the average person alex and and so we're just sitting here trying to say look
[03:34:39.160 --> 03:34:43.560]  it's already at your front door here they are you know it's infanticide here they are calling for
[03:34:43.560 --> 03:34:49.080]  the guns here the governor's like he don't kill them babies but it's like oh until i can't help
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:55.320]  but i want to strangle him like i uh so paul watson what would you call this historical human
[03:34:55.320 --> 03:35:02.520]  point around this planet well it's a great divide isn't it alex and i mean all those people who
[03:35:03.080 --> 03:35:07.320]  failed to defend you when you got the platform they're going to be next which is what we
[03:35:07.320 --> 03:35:14.440]  talked about last week with youtube whereby now they're going to downrank conspiracy videos where
[03:35:14.440 --> 03:35:19.720]  they don't appear in recommended which is half the views on youtube whose conspiracy according to
[03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:25.480]  the buzzfeed article which prompted them to make that change ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Dinesh
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:30.600]  DeSousa so now they're coming for everyone so everyone who failed to defend you they're going
[03:35:30.600 --> 03:35:36.440]  to get it next now they're removing the or at least considering removing the thumbs down button
[03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:42.600]  because their own video on youtube youtube rewind are the most down votes in any for any video in
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:49.960]  youtube history exactly surprise surprise five-year-olds being given money by pervert men people are
[03:35:49.960 --> 03:35:55.160]  downloading that so since san francisco goes like san francisco's literally control of america in the
[03:35:55.160 --> 03:36:00.360]  world it's like they don't want pedophilia ban them it's like it's it's like we've given insane
[03:36:00.360 --> 03:36:07.800]  people control of everything oh yeah it's you know it's similar on twitter whereby you were
[03:36:07.800 --> 03:36:12.840]  essentially banned for being mean to a cnn reporter although jack dorsi couldn't even remember the
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:18.200]  reason but that was the reason they gave at the time meanwhile we've got actual verified people
[03:36:18.200 --> 03:36:23.320]  who were not even suspended and to this day a couple of weeks later still have twitter accounts
[03:36:23.320 --> 03:36:31.480]  who openly encourage people to commit school shootings and to quote fire upon and bomb schools
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:38.040]  attended by covington high school students those same people none of them got banned in fact we
[03:36:38.040 --> 03:36:42.520]  had an article about one of them not none of them got banned alex they were literally calling for
[03:36:42.520 --> 03:36:49.000]  school shootings none of them are off of twitter you were mean to oliver dorsi got in his face for
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:58.280]  five minutes banned forever so paul what do we do because it's it's clear that sorry my
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:04.280]  elbow cold today we've crossed the river gun what do we do at this point because i'm ready for war
[03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:11.400]  but i don't want to prosecute this war improperly well we need to petition the trump administration
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:16.520]  to change the communications act section 230 to make these sites responsible to have a digital
[03:37:16.520 --> 03:37:21.480]  free speech act and if they don't do it they're going to lose the next election simple as that
[03:37:22.040 --> 03:37:27.960]  algorithmic changes can shift 12 million votes in an election they know that they've been given
[03:37:27.960 --> 03:37:34.200]  the studies if they don't do something about it it's game over alex game over so let's talk about that
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:40.280]  well though insurer and paul watson i want to believe in trump and he's done so many good things
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:48.520]  on tpp on jobs and on border and on nationalism being good but then he lets globalists take
[03:37:48.520 --> 03:37:55.640]  control he lets them run all these deals he does all this uh he got mad the federal reserve doing
[03:37:55.640 --> 03:38:02.520]  all these infiltrate highs paul i want to defend trump but if he won't defend himself what are we
[03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:07.720]  supposed to do i don't know alex what do you think we should do i mean we we've said all we can say
[03:38:07.720 --> 03:38:13.000]  at this point um roger stone said he had the conversation with uh you know he's had his
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:17.560]  head of his campaign and he said that no action was in the pipeline we were told action was in
[03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:23.720]  the pipeline months ago that there was about to be an executive order nothing happened so you know
[03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:28.920]  it's going to take more mainstream conservatives like you know the the conserver bros and the never
[03:38:28.920 --> 03:38:34.280]  trumpers even getting banned for them to even bring it up to them so you know we have to be
[03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:38.040]  pessimistic at this point if they're not going to do anything to change the situation where
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:43.480]  they're losing millions of votes because of election meddling which is what it is by these
[03:38:43.480 --> 03:38:48.200]  major corporations then we've done all we can it's in their hands and if they're not going to do
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:55.640]  anything about it they're going to lose and again that's it i don't care if call rove who lives like
[03:38:55.640 --> 03:39:01.000]  three doors down for me and less like makes five million dollars ten million dollars a year just
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:08.200]  don't do it at americans expense and that's the thing is that is that they don't do any targeted
[03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:15.240]  advertising they don't do any resistance everything they do is about selling america out and then
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:20.920]  trumps up there saying all the right stuff but no one below him is defending they've all completely
[03:39:20.920 --> 03:39:29.400]  sold out uh humanity and i just don't know what you do i mean clearly it's not about kissing trumps
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:35.320]  ass it's like rand paul is super insular he's like trumps the greatest thing ever he's pulling
[03:39:35.320 --> 03:39:39.960]  out of wars he's trying to do all this and no one's supporting him and it's i'm the same way it's like
[03:39:39.960 --> 03:39:47.880]  how do you look at something like not putting black people in jail for three times longer i was on
[03:39:47.880 --> 03:39:54.840]  chicago radio this morning and i talked about trump and how he cut president sentences for blacks three
[03:39:54.840 --> 03:40:00.760]  times lower and they were so programmed they said why did you just say blacks deserve to go to president
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:09.320]  and i was at like six a.m seven a.m i started crying because they not because i was kissing black
[03:40:09.320 --> 03:40:15.800]  people's ass those are just humans it's that like there's like programming against truth now where
[03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:21.480]  you're like hillary says blacks are predators and if you go to prison and uh trump just ended it and
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:27.080]  like the why are you a white supremacist well we're just sitting here trying to hold reality up at
[03:40:27.080 --> 03:40:31.560]  this point exactly we're literally like oh my god like this is reality we're trying to hold up and
[03:40:31.560 --> 03:40:36.440]  google is just smashing it with the weight and just everything i mean google is reality now and they
[03:40:36.440 --> 03:40:41.320]  censor everything so google censors reality and we're just up here trying to maintain reality
[03:40:41.320 --> 03:40:45.720]  we're all holding it up over our head it's this crushing weight and alex i just look at you you're
[03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:50.440]  like this old grizzled ship captain you've been around every crevice and people like hey we need
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:54.600]  to do this and you're just kind of like i've already been around that crevice damn it i'm ready to
[03:40:54.600 --> 03:40:59.720]  ramp through and it's just like people just i mean so so they're continuing it's like like you said
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:06.600]  alex these people like look at Gavin Newsom's luxurious mansion he's got he's got gates and fences
[03:41:06.600 --> 03:41:11.240]  and maxine waters with big gates and fences and nancy plosy with big gates and fences and barack
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:15.880]  obama with big gates and fences and they all signed to fund a border wall five years ago they all
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:20.360]  wanted to increase border security five years ago and now all of a sudden just everything changed
[03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:25.640]  now they say walls are immorality oh they never voted for a wall no it didn't happen what are you
[03:41:25.640 --> 03:41:30.920]  talking about so it's just like they know that they rigged reality they know google controls reality
[03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:34.760]  so they can come out and say whatever the hell they want and you're just up here we're just up here
[03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:40.040]  at info wars trying to maintain reality hold it over our head like no they voted for a wall first
[03:41:40.040 --> 03:41:45.000]  they funded a wall first trump's just doing what he said he would do and he's like no trump's races
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:49.560]  you're a racist and it's just you're gonna have paul listen we gotta break paul who do you think
[03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:55.080]  trump is then because trump's doing a lot of good but like he then he hits on halves well who do
[03:41:55.080 --> 03:42:02.360]  you think trump is well people have said alex that he just listens to the latest advice that he gets
[03:42:02.360 --> 03:42:07.160]  and then acts on that so it depends on who's in his inner circle you know i'm not privy to those
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:12.440]  conversations but going back to the to the racing you know they've done studies where liberals dumb
[03:42:12.440 --> 03:42:15.720]  down their language when they're talking to black people so it doesn't matter how much you count a
[03:42:15.720 --> 03:42:20.520]  signal how much you talk about trump preventing black people from going to prison for marijuana
[03:42:20.520 --> 03:42:25.320]  possession or whatever they don't care because they're not anti-racist they're the most racist people
[03:42:25.320 --> 03:42:30.360]  in america now they're literally flinging dirt the same people who go to the women's martin went
[03:42:30.360 --> 03:42:36.040]  pussy hat a flinging dirt and an avonka trump look alike let's talk about that when we come back
[03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:40.680]  because trump is literally trying to get blacks out of prison and trying to fit and like they have
[03:42:41.640 --> 03:42:47.160]  well it's it's it's insane i mean it's like no it's true it's like it's like when they're about to kill
[03:42:47.160 --> 03:42:52.440]  christ and they say give us marabbas i mean that's what this is it's like give us marabbas

[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:14.680]  but we can't respond everybody is talking about you know missions to mars and taking the first
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:21.160]  flight to mars or the first flights to space this is the flight to mars i got on this ship at info
[03:49:21.160 --> 03:49:25.320]  wars right here and i didn't know where i was going to end up i didn't know if i'd make it out alive
[03:49:25.320 --> 03:49:29.320]  but i knew i'm getting on that ship and i'm blasting off and i'm letting it take me to
[03:49:29.320 --> 03:49:34.040]  wherever it frickin takes me and that's why we're here today alex and that's why the audience gets
[03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:38.200]  on board that's why the crew gets on board we don't know where this ship is going to end up we
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:41.880]  don't know where this ship is going to land we know it's probably going to crash land we know it's
[03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:46.920]  probably going to be fatal but we know that our example that was set here will be resonate through
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:52.360]  the rest of time and that's exactly it like we're reaching more people than ever i mean i don't want
[03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:57.480]  to the enemy watches i don't want to get them inside baseball but i mean whoa alex i mean we
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:05.880]  have never here's like they just let's go to paul watson paul what do you make of this 22 alex
[03:50:05.880 --> 03:50:11.720]  jones paul watson you know we can kiss up to them hope they don't banish yet but i mean this is
[03:50:11.720 --> 03:50:20.920]  ridiculous this is crazy well they've banned pages with the words info or wars in them so i guess
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:25.480]  you know there was a there's a website called space wars i guess they're next so it's not even we
[03:50:25.480 --> 03:50:31.240]  don't own these pages alex we don't even own most of these pages we didn't start them we don't
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:37.080]  know i checked during the break one page they ban i never heard of these others like poor people go
[03:50:37.080 --> 03:50:44.520]  info wars they go you can't have that and once again it's it's after all these left wing digital
[03:50:44.520 --> 03:50:49.640]  media websites who are going broke and laying off all their staff said oh why won't because there were
[03:50:49.640 --> 03:50:55.560]  a few left why haven't they banned these pages yet so yet again abusing their platforms to silence
[03:50:55.560 --> 03:51:01.000]  their competition and yet still alex they're going bust but they're up on twitter whining
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:07.160]  about people tweeting harassment at them telling them learn to code no we don't have any sympathy
[03:51:07.160 --> 03:51:13.560]  for you if you dedicate your life to deplatforming other people then you lose your platform how on
[03:51:13.560 --> 03:51:23.640]  earth can you demand any sympathy from anyone no cry me a river paul i run into leftist and they
[03:51:23.640 --> 03:51:29.880]  literally shaking fear but they think like i'm the guy from homeland who who is the left because
[03:51:29.880 --> 03:51:34.760]  we're not against gay people or black people or anybody we just want to have a good life what
[03:51:34.760 --> 03:51:43.080]  is the left created who are who what do they want paul they want raw power alex and the mask is off
[03:51:43.080 --> 03:51:48.920]  we had the pretense for so long that they cared about minorities and people of color and gay people
[03:51:48.920 --> 03:51:54.520]  and transgender people the mask is truly off as i was saying before the break they're literally
[03:51:54.520 --> 03:51:59.240]  throwing dirt at an avonka trump lock now you read an article about from the wars dot com but let's
[03:51:59.240 --> 03:52:06.840]  pull that up there's like a dirt pile what is this it's a performance art exhibit in dc free entry
[03:52:06.840 --> 03:52:13.240]  he will not divide us hinting but it's an avonka trump lookalike and they want you to throw dirt
[03:52:13.240 --> 03:52:19.960]  and she'll vacuum it up because they think that she's an unrecognizable unrealistic feminine role
[03:52:19.960 --> 03:52:25.160]  model truth is they're super scared of an ultra awesome woman i mean like let's worship women
[03:52:25.160 --> 03:52:30.920]  so it's like this whole thing is like about men claiming they're women to uh take over the goddess
[03:52:32.040 --> 03:52:37.400]  i'm not gonna call this i'm a christian but but again men are powerful and women are awesome and
[03:52:37.400 --> 03:52:42.760]  men worship them and they try to take everyone's power and i'm tired of it it's the equivalent of
[03:52:42.760 --> 03:52:49.000]  them having a clarence thomas lookalike and inviting people to throw poop at it to own the racist
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:54.280]  conservatives it's literally the same people who are going to be wearing pussy hats in new york and
[03:52:54.280 --> 03:53:02.040]  dc i agree it's this dehumanization that if trump has a woman she's bad let's attack a woman which
[03:53:02.040 --> 03:53:06.040]  is what the left claims they're against but it's literally an exhibit in their insanity when they
[03:53:06.040 --> 03:53:11.160]  say the woman is it's not the woman's job to vacuum and clean up after the man and then they
[03:53:11.160 --> 03:53:16.120]  make an exhibit that's all about a woman vacuuming and cleaning up after a bunch of miscreants that
[03:53:16.120 --> 03:53:20.440]  go throw dirt at it so it's like enforcing the gender role of a woman vacuuming while they're
[03:53:20.440 --> 03:53:24.760]  telling you don't enforce the gender role of a woman's vacuum i mean it's like these people are all
[03:53:24.760 --> 03:53:30.200]  insane maybe let me let me spend on this let me spend on this i have four children and my son's
[03:53:30.200 --> 03:53:36.600]  already six foot one 240 pounds of pure muscle super smart and cool i don't i love him but he's
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:44.280]  not even on my radar my daughters i have a 15 year old an 11 year old and a two year old and they're
[03:53:44.280 --> 03:53:52.280]  like i mean i just i dream of them i would love them to be president i would love them to be
[03:53:52.920 --> 03:54:00.360]  they're such magical creatures and then the idea that i'm suppressing my daughters is satanic
[03:54:02.040 --> 03:54:05.480]  it's them suppressing women they don't want the real power of women it's like you said
[03:54:05.480 --> 03:54:09.960]  they're actually harnessing the power no the truth is is that i've like ignored my son
[03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:15.480]  i'm totally geared toward women's empowerment like this idea that men don't want women to be
[03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:20.600]  powerful it's like anyone that ever showed up and said i want to be in a war or i want to
[03:54:20.600 --> 03:54:25.720]  be in charge better like oh you're absolutely go right away men aren't suppressing women men worship
[03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:32.600]  women i mean you understand women literally have a whole another genetic code we don't have they
[03:54:32.600 --> 03:54:38.120]  have like the entire football they have the nuclear football and so women are the species
[03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:42.440]  so this idea of paul that that that we're against women i'm not virtue setting the women
[03:54:42.440 --> 03:54:48.600]  women need to understand their power is men men and women together is like it's like explosive
[03:54:48.600 --> 03:54:54.040]  that's the power paul well precisely but again it goes back to the point they don't care about
[03:54:54.040 --> 03:54:59.240]  women they care about power so strong-minded intelligent conservative women in positions
[03:54:59.240 --> 03:55:05.160]  of influence or power are the most hated species to a leftist you could ever imagine and then you
[03:55:05.160 --> 03:55:10.280]  know they know they want victims they want victims yeah and then oh we really care about
[03:55:10.280 --> 03:55:14.600]  the children what you just said this is a big epiphany they fear powerful women this whole
[03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:22.280]  cosmology about us for women is because they fear women fear conservative women yeah and then you've
[03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:27.640]  got that you know that's what i meant they fear women in their mission yeah completely and then
[03:55:27.640 --> 03:55:32.040]  you've got this joshua trump who again was bullied at school because he shared his last name with the
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:38.520]  president go on twitter today who's bullying kim oh it's all the same people who bullied and doxed
[03:55:38.520 --> 03:55:45.240]  the covington high school kids saying that oh well trump called hillary crooked so why why does this
[03:55:45.240 --> 03:55:51.240]  kid get away with a free pass they're literally crapping on a sixth grade kid who's distraught
[03:55:51.240 --> 03:55:56.040]  and crying because he gets bullied all the time there is no low that they won't stoop to alex no
[03:55:56.040 --> 03:56:00.600]  low at this point i agree paul we'll be covering it tonight coming up seven o'clock if you want to
[03:56:00.600 --> 03:56:05.880]  stay up late you join us i appreciate that but how do you see this ending got level is trump
[03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:12.680]  winning or is he losing well the positive thing alex he's back up to 48 percent in approval
[03:56:12.680 --> 03:56:18.120]  which is i think two points more than obama at the same time in his presidency so you know we're
[03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:22.840]  in for a big battle but again they have to look at this social media issue because they're gonna
[03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:28.760]  lose this shifts millions of votes on election day just on election day alone now they're turning
[03:56:28.760 --> 03:56:33.960]  down the volume on on youtube and all these other platforms we need a digital bill of rights act and
[03:56:33.960 --> 03:56:40.360]  we need changes that communications act act section 230 to make it basically punishable by giant
[03:56:40.360 --> 03:56:45.320]  fines if they directly censor people for their political opinions which they claim they don't do
[03:56:45.320 --> 03:56:50.600]  but they're inside track chat transcripts prove they do and in reality it proves they do they've
[03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:55.800]  basically admitted it now with youtube and with facebook that's right we're dealing with corporate
[03:56:55.800 --> 03:57:01.640]  censorship through big tech and if trump doesn't take action it's just waterloo paul great job
