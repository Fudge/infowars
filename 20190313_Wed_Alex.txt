[00:00.000 --> 00:17.700]  It's Wednesday, March 13, 2019. This is the Alex Jones show from the Info Wars World
[00:17.700 --> 00:22.920]  Headquarters in Austin, Texas. I'm Owen Schreuer filling in for Alex Jones. We will be hearing
[00:22.920 --> 00:30.200]  from Alex Jones in the bottom of the first hour, and then in the second hour, Alex has
[00:30.200 --> 00:38.480]  a big message for President Trump. And we need you to share the links today, tell your
[00:38.480 --> 00:46.760]  friends and family, and then take these banned segments, take the banned Alex Jones segments
[00:46.760 --> 00:56.040]  from today's Alex Jones show and re-upload them to your own YouTube channel. Now, I
[00:56.040 --> 01:01.120]  have to say I kind of feel like a jerk for asking you to do that, because in the current
[01:01.120 --> 01:09.600]  environment now, that gets you banned. But hey, this is the Info War. Now, I've got all
[01:09.600 --> 01:18.720]  kinds of news that I really need to be focused and get to today. And it's amazing all the
[01:18.720 --> 01:28.240]  developments that you have right now going on with the Lisa Page testimony being released.
[01:28.240 --> 01:34.200]  You've got Andrew McCabe being referred to for a criminal investigation. That's been
[01:34.200 --> 01:42.160]  going on for a while. Tom Fitton has just sued to get Rod Rosenstein's communications
[01:42.160 --> 01:49.400]  in the 10 days leading up to the Robert Mueller appointment. That could be the bombshell that
[01:49.400 --> 02:01.920]  blows the entire levy and floods the swamp. As if we didn't have enough physical evidence
[02:01.920 --> 02:07.000]  that acting members of the FBI, the DOJ, and even the White House were engaged in this
[02:07.000 --> 02:15.280]  whole fake Russian collusion investigation from the get go, that would pretty much seal
[02:15.280 --> 02:24.120]  the deal. And then you have Adam Schiff, who's trying to keep it all classified. So that's
[02:24.120 --> 02:34.240]  one side of criminal behavior being investigated right now amongst the Democrats. But how about
[02:34.240 --> 02:43.200]  the Collegegate scandal? Oh my gosh, I'm so shocked. You're telling me that a bunch of
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.400]  Hillary Clinton voters were using their money and power and influence to cheat the system?
[02:49.400 --> 02:58.720]  Oh no, I had no idea it was going on. I'm so surprised. Oh, you mean Hollywood that lectures
[02:58.720 --> 03:05.240]  us all day long on how to fight for the oppressed was using its money and power to cheat the
[03:05.240 --> 03:15.920]  system? Oh my gosh, it's shocking, folks. Oh wait, you're telling me that people who
[03:15.920 --> 03:22.640]  had close relationships with the Obamas were also involved? Oh no, friends of the Obamas
[03:22.640 --> 03:28.680]  were also cheating the system the whole time. Oh no. Oh, it's a travesty. America never
[03:28.680 --> 03:34.320]  saw it coming. Oh my gosh, we never knew Hollywood was a bunch of lying scum. Oh my gosh, we
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.840]  never knew Hillary Clinton voters were a bunch of frauds. Oh my gosh, we never knew the Obamas
[03:38.840 --> 03:43.400]  were hanging out with cheaters and liars and scandalous people. Wow, it's finally all coming
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.960]  out, folks. We had no idea nobody could have ever told you. Info Wars has never reported
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.920]  it. Alex Jones has never reported it. He never even exists. And I was sitting looking at
[03:52.920 --> 04:02.400]  all the news coming out and I was like, wow, Info Wars is next year's news today. And so
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.600]  then Alan Dershowitz comes out and says that the College Gate scandal that's being surfaced
[04:06.600 --> 04:14.400]  right now is just the tip of the iceberg. And then when you read into the weeds of the
[04:14.400 --> 04:20.960]  story, folks, you see how far they're willing to go in their deception. Photo shopping pictures,
[04:20.960 --> 04:30.920]  faking injuries, I mean, like next level con games. And just to get their kids into college,
[04:30.920 --> 04:35.280]  what happened to the good old days when you bought a new rec center? I mean, that's how
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.000]  it used to be done. Hey, yeah, sure, my kid just kind of skipped the system. But guess
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.800]  what? The rest of the students get to enjoy this brand new rec center. Guess what? The
[04:43.800 --> 04:48.360]  rest of the students get to enjoy this brown new hall, this brand new library, this brand
[04:48.360 --> 04:53.720]  new computer lab. No, they don't even do that. That's because it's not about anybody benefiting
[04:53.720 --> 05:00.720]  except them. That's what it's all about. It's all about their selfish own egos. Well, I've
[05:00.720 --> 05:04.240]  got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners. This was going to be
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.600]  a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore. 20 year and a half
[05:07.600 --> 05:12.560]  fight. But we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic
[05:12.560 --> 05:17.280]  iodide in the world x two is back. We got it. This deal just happened about a month ago.
[05:17.280 --> 05:21.760]  We rushed it into production. It's been bottled. The labels are being put on today and that
[05:21.760 --> 05:27.080]  it's going to be on an 18 wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies. And
[05:27.080 --> 05:30.920]  it's going to be shipped out to you. Be sure and sign up for auto ship and an additional
[05:30.920 --> 05:37.000]  10% off the 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.120]  Research the iodine conspiracy. Find out why it's so important. Find out why the globalist
[05:41.120 --> 05:47.080]  don't want you to have the good halogen. You have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.080 --> 05:51.200]  That's the umbrella site in force life.com. They should write the supplements and this
[05:51.200 --> 06:01.360]  is the king daddy. Ladies and gentlemen, it is x two original now back at infowarstore.com.
[06:01.360 --> 06:14.720]  From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[06:14.720 --> 06:22.280]  We will be hearing from Alex Jones in the bottom of the hour. And then in the second
[06:22.280 --> 06:30.840]  hour, Alex Jones has an emergency message for President Trump. That you're not going
[06:30.840 --> 06:38.400]  to want to miss. We need you to spread the links to this show. Go to info wars.com slash
[06:38.400 --> 06:43.200]  show. Click on the Alex Jones show link. Download those video segments and then reupload
[06:43.200 --> 06:50.760]  them to YouTube so that we can get the message out. We have to beat this censorship and we
[06:50.760 --> 06:59.720]  need the president to have our back in this battle for free speech in America. So do not
[06:59.720 --> 07:05.720]  miss Alex Jones emergency message to President Trump coming up in the second hour. Katelyn
[07:05.720 --> 07:12.040]  Bennett joins me in the third hour. She got kicked out of a mall for being harassed literally
[07:12.040 --> 07:23.640]  now. It's amazing. Alex Jones is miles away in yet we are on the exact same wavelength.
[07:23.640 --> 07:29.520]  I didn't talk to Alex this morning when I was prepping for the show. But he was talking
[07:29.520 --> 07:33.720]  to the crew and the producers and we have some segments coming up. He's going to be
[07:33.720 --> 07:40.680]  on. But we were both on the same page and that's why I'm wearing this t shirt today.
[07:40.680 --> 07:49.600]  This is the t shirt from info wars store.com and it has the info wars logo. It's the Tiananmen
[07:49.600 --> 07:55.800]  square tank man with the Facebook logo, the Apple logo, the YouTube logo, the Spotify
[07:55.800 --> 08:02.680]  logo all as the tanks getting ready to try and run over info wars. And I didn't even
[08:02.680 --> 08:09.040]  think about this. But if you take my opening segment from yesterday, it pretty much describes
[08:09.040 --> 08:17.640]  this t shirt right here. We will not be moved. We stand as a rock against tyranny. So yeah.
[08:17.640 --> 08:22.480]  So if President Trump says, Well, just behave yourself on social media. You know, don't tweet
[08:22.480 --> 08:28.400]  about vaccines. Don't put on Facebook about vaccines. No, we will do that. We will not
[08:28.400 --> 08:37.360]  be moved. We stand as a rock against tyranny. So that's where we stand. And so that's what
[08:37.360 --> 08:42.000]  Alex is going to be addressing in the second hour and an emergency message to President
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.280]  Trump. Now, I know President Trump is smart and obviously he is the main reason why he
[08:49.280 --> 08:56.680]  won. But I hope I hope that he understands that it was Ann Coulter, Michael Savage and
[08:56.680 --> 09:03.360]  Alex Jones that won him the Republican nomination. He would have never gotten out of that Republican
[09:03.360 --> 09:08.420]  nomination process if it wasn't for alternative media and the likes of Ann Coulter, Michael
[09:08.420 --> 09:15.600]  Savage and of course, Alex Jones. But the Alex Jones audience is just the massive active
[09:15.600 --> 09:23.880]  audience that is just so fierce. And they get so fired up when we get behind a movement
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.520]  that that's what pushed Trump over the edge. So it was really this audience, but it was
[09:28.520 --> 09:36.320]  those three in the media who are all being censored that were the voices in the wilderness
[09:36.320 --> 09:40.680]  supporting Donald Trump when all the other media said it was bad and he would never
[09:40.680 --> 09:46.160]  win. He never wanted to win. He's a joker. He's a clown. All you Trump supporters or
[09:46.160 --> 09:49.640]  jokesters and clowns, you'll never go anywhere. These are some of your favorite voices on
[09:49.640 --> 09:59.760]  Fox News and on the radio. And it's what's even wilder. If you went back four years ago
[09:59.760 --> 10:08.400]  or let's say you go back to the year 2015 and you're watching Fox News, you wouldn't
[10:08.400 --> 10:21.440]  even recognize it. It is so much different today than it was in 2015. So we've got all
[10:21.440 --> 10:29.760]  that coming up. We've got the Democrats that were engaged in treason starting to get exposed.
[10:29.760 --> 10:38.840]  Lisa Page basically admitted all of it in her testimony. Obama knew they were going
[10:38.840 --> 10:47.200]  to make up a false narrative so that they could then spy on Donald Trump and his campaign
[10:47.200 --> 10:55.920]  and then in turn launch an investigation for Russian collusion all made up all concocted
[10:55.920 --> 11:07.200]  all manufactured in the months leading up to the election. And it's all on record. And
[11:07.200 --> 11:15.400]  you know where else it's on record? The Alex Jones channel on YouTube. Oh, but they erased
[11:15.400 --> 11:22.080]  that. Didn't they? How convenient? You see, because they don't want you to be able to
[11:22.080 --> 11:32.720]  go back and watch our videos from years ago out at the front of all of this. And so that's
[11:32.720 --> 11:38.680]  really another level of their censorship. Yeah, they don't want us to be able to break
[11:38.680 --> 11:43.760]  in to a breaking news story to a viral news story to a trending news story and be there
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.640]  available on the Internet at the click of a button when everybody's competing for those
[11:48.640 --> 11:51.640]  videos. They don't want us there. They want to control the narrative. But then there's
[11:51.640 --> 11:59.000]  the other angle that they don't want you to be able to go and share our old videos where
[11:59.000 --> 12:06.440]  we told you that this was all going on years ago. They don't want you to go see the videos
[12:06.440 --> 12:15.640]  where we told you Adam Schiff was a line corrupt scumbag years ago. They don't want
[12:15.640 --> 12:21.000]  you to see the election night videos where Alex Jones said, President Trump, this is
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.720]  just the beginning. Get ready. They're going to come at you with everything they have.
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.160]  And they did. They came after him with Hollywood, Jesse Smallette. They came after him with
[12:31.160 --> 12:36.440]  the mainstream media, Covington Catholic, Judge Kavanaugh. Trump's a racist. Trump is
[12:36.440 --> 12:41.320]  this. Trump is that. They came after him with the Department of Justice. They came after
[12:41.320 --> 12:45.360]  him with the FISA courts. They came after him with the Southern District of New York.
[12:45.360 --> 12:49.600]  They came after him with the appellate courts. They came after him with the New York Attorney
[12:49.600 --> 12:58.480]  General. They came after. So nonstop. And then there's a series of tweets from President
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.600]  Trump that we will be breaking down today as well. And think about this. As we're just
[13:04.600 --> 13:11.840]  now beginning to see what we already knew was going on inside the FBI treason, trying
[13:11.840 --> 13:17.960]  to remove Trump from office. How about the college gate scandal and the fact that you
[13:17.960 --> 13:26.440]  didn't ever hear one leak, not a single leak when it came to the college gate scandal?
[13:26.440 --> 13:37.080]  How incredible is that? And I guarantee you can take it to the bank. That Cortez now wants
[13:37.080 --> 13:40.520]  to blame for everything. When anything goes wrong, she wants the bank to pay for it. Yeah,
[13:40.520 --> 13:51.480]  that's actually her new profound theory. If it would have been Donald Trump engaged in
[13:51.480 --> 13:59.880]  photoshopping pictures or Ann Coulter engaged in Pang bribes or Alex Jones or any conservative
[13:59.880 --> 14:05.480]  involved in any of this stuff, it would have all been leaked. It would have all been already
[14:05.480 --> 14:15.360]  out there and they would have already been using it years ago to destroy those people.
[14:15.360 --> 14:24.160]  And so you can apply that same logic, if you will, to the investigation that's going on
[14:24.160 --> 14:40.160]  right now into James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, Peter Stroke and their cohorts.
[14:40.160 --> 14:46.680]  So you won't know really the full scope of it until they release it because it's not
[14:46.680 --> 14:57.000]  going to get leaked like everything that Mueller tries to do. But President Trump says on Twitter
[14:57.000 --> 15:06.240]  this morning, keep America great. Well, President Trump, if you want to keep America great,
[15:06.240 --> 15:13.760]  you're going to have to start locking some people up and throwing away the key. Because
[15:13.760 --> 15:22.560]  if you don't make an example of these treasonous scumbags in these unelected bureaucracies
[15:22.560 --> 15:32.400]  thinking they run this republic, they'll never stop. They'll never stop. And maybe these
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.560]  people will stop. Maybe you think you can stop these people from continuing in their
[15:37.560 --> 15:43.280]  criminal activity, but they'll just be another round. They'll just be another wave. You need
[15:43.280 --> 15:51.200]  to make an example of these people loud and clear. Lock them up, throw away the key, do
[15:51.200 --> 15:58.120]  it all on public TV and let the world know that the corrupt deep state in the West is
[15:58.120 --> 16:03.160]  dead. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.720]  to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and I've been
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.680]  beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands
[16:11.680 --> 16:15.920]  of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[16:15.920 --> 16:20.040]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless
[16:20.040 --> 16:29.040]  tax case. Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.040 --> 16:34.440]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[16:34.440 --> 16:39.520]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[16:39.520 --> 16:46.400]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.960]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[16:51.960 --> 16:58.920]  with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[20:30.320 --> 20:35.520]  the next segment, Alex Jones is going to be responding and breaking down the College
[20:35.520 --> 20:44.200]  Gate scandal. He is then going to stay with us and talk about the fake hate crimes as
[20:44.200 --> 20:49.240]  Smollett's legal team, if you can believe this or not, says that the case against Smollett
[20:49.240 --> 20:58.600]  is weak. Wow. I don't know how that's a weak case. It's all on record.
[20:58.600 --> 21:07.720]  The guy went on TV, but that just shows you what kind of lawyer represents Jussie Smollett.
[21:07.720 --> 21:13.480]  Then at 1206, to begin the third hour, that is when Alex is going to give his emergency
[21:13.480 --> 21:21.400]  message to President Trump. And I will point you in the direction of a Breitbart interview
[21:21.400 --> 21:28.000]  with President Trump, where President Trump said, in response to social media censorship,
[21:28.000 --> 21:34.000]  you fight it by just being good. You got to be really good. It's much harder for a conservative
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.080]  Republican to win than it is for a liberal Democrat in, quote, well, President Trump,
[21:39.080 --> 21:45.400]  what if you would have just decided to, quote, be really good during the campaign process?
[21:45.400 --> 21:51.840]  What if you decided to, quote, be really good during the nomination process? What if the
[21:51.840 --> 21:58.360]  president decided to be really good during all those press conferences and presidential
[21:58.360 --> 22:07.480]  debates? Do you think he would have won? Do you think America would have heard Donald
[22:07.480 --> 22:14.920]  Trump? Do you think they would have responded the way they did? No, I do not think so, President.
[22:14.920 --> 22:21.320]  So Alex will be responding to that. Then I'm going to open up the phone lines and I'm going
[22:21.320 --> 22:34.040]  to ask you one simple question. What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[22:34.040 --> 22:43.560]  And what I'd like to do is to just rattle off about 15 calls from 1220 Central to 106
[22:43.560 --> 22:48.880]  Central when Caitlyn Bennett joins us and then after she leaves probably two. And I
[22:48.880 --> 22:55.240]  just want you to have one quick answer and I just want to go down the line. Just boom,
[22:55.240 --> 23:00.240]  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I want to hear from everybody. What must the
[23:00.240 --> 23:07.160]  president do to keep America great? This is my new hat that I got now, a gift from my
[23:07.160 --> 23:14.200]  chiropractor. Keep America great. But what, and the president tweeted that out this morning
[23:14.200 --> 23:24.240]  too. What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[23:24.240 --> 23:27.960]  So we will be opening up the phone lines in the next hour. That is my question for you.
[23:27.960 --> 23:32.560]  Please just have a one response. Obviously there's a lot of things, but just pick your
[23:32.560 --> 23:41.800]  most important thing, say it, and we'll go to the next caller. But I've also just got
[23:41.800 --> 23:50.160]  stacks of news and here's the good thing about it. I don't feel as, see some days if I don't
[23:50.160 --> 23:54.720]  get to the news and I don't give you the, the info wars coverage, then you're just not
[23:54.720 --> 23:59.080]  going to get it. But everyone's talking about Lisa Page and Peter Stroke and Bruce Orr
[23:59.080 --> 24:02.760]  and Adam Schiff. So everybody already knows how corrupt that they are. We already kind
[24:02.760 --> 24:06.360]  of broke the floodgates on that. So it's like, I don't necessarily even need to go down
[24:06.360 --> 24:11.920]  that road. Everybody's showing you the college scandal. Everybody sees how it's a bunch of
[24:11.920 --> 24:15.760]  Hillary Clinton donors and liberal progressive Democrats. I mean, literally like the whole
[24:15.760 --> 24:22.040]  list, all of them. You know, they can't go the old fashioned way, you know, oh, hey,
[24:22.040 --> 24:27.640]  you know, help my kid get in the school, I'll buy a new rec center, help my kid get into
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.360]  the, you know, volleyball program or whatever, I'll buy a new library, I'll buy a new computer
[24:32.360 --> 24:40.400]  lab. Oh, wow. And so it's not like Lori Loughlin has a, the Lori Loughlin computer lab at USC
[24:40.400 --> 24:45.240]  with her, with her daughter, who's probably worth millions too. Yeah, because, you know,
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.360]  they can't afford that. So no, it's not the Lori Loughlin computer lab that kids are going
[24:49.360 --> 24:53.920]  to be going to and learning and using to resource and read and everything. No, no, no, no, no,
[24:53.920 --> 25:00.040]  it's just take my money and let my daughter in. No one else gets nothing except us. And
[25:00.040 --> 25:06.560]  so then the good liberal Democrats take the money, cheat the college system, bang, bang,
[25:06.560 --> 25:10.720]  boom, no one benefits but them. And, and, you know, I'm kind of going through this in
[25:10.720 --> 25:14.040]  my head and I don't mean to pontificate on this and Alex is going to be breaking this
[25:14.040 --> 25:20.160]  down in the next segment, but I'm thinking because, because I don't have kids, but like,
[25:20.160 --> 25:22.520]  you know, at a certain level, I'm like, you know, maybe they were really just trying to
[25:22.520 --> 25:27.680]  do its best for their kids and, and you know, so this, they just want to have their kids
[25:27.680 --> 25:30.960]  go to college and they want their kids have the best time and so I'm kind of like for
[25:30.960 --> 25:34.480]  a second empathetic and then I realized, wait a second, no, no, no, no. If they wanted what's
[25:34.480 --> 25:37.880]  best for their kids, they wouldn't pay their way. If they wanted what's best for their
[25:37.880 --> 25:41.320]  kids, they would make them earn it. If they wanted what's best for their kids, they wouldn't
[25:41.320 --> 25:48.480]  lie to their kids about how they got into school. And then once I realized that I realized,
[25:48.480 --> 25:55.680]  oh my gosh, it was never even about the kids going to school. It was about their ego. It
[25:55.680 --> 26:01.280]  was about Lori Loughlin standing up and saying, my daughter goes to USC as an, as an, as in
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.640]  such and such. And all the other ones, my daughter went here and was in the crew. My
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.760]  daughter went here was part of this program. It was all about their own ego. It was never
[26:11.760 --> 26:17.440]  about their kids. It was never about anyone else, but their own ego, but Alex will be
[26:17.440 --> 26:24.360]  responding to that. But here's some of the bull crap that's in the news today that you're
[26:24.360 --> 26:30.320]  not going to get anywhere else. Man accused of sexual assault was an illegal immigrant.
[26:30.320 --> 26:33.960]  I mean, I could read these every day. Illegal immigrant rapes, nine illegal immigrant murders,
[26:33.960 --> 26:37.480]  illegal immigrant steals, limmering in a drunk drives, legal immigrant ransom. I mean, it's
[26:37.480 --> 26:40.080]  every damn day, but you know, it's not a problem.
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.160]  Woman told the cover up before flying out of diverse UK city of Birmingham by Paul Joseph
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.400]  Watson of Wars.com. The girl basically has, I mean, what the average American girl wears
[26:48.400 --> 26:54.720]  out on a Saturday night. So yeah, imagine that American women, you want to fight for
[26:54.720 --> 27:01.000]  quote unquote diversity and the hijab and Islam will get ready to cover yourself up
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.880]  because you won't be wearing a crop top anymore. CDC reports 228 measles cases in 12 states
[27:06.880 --> 27:14.400]  and guess who they're blaming. Unvaccinated Americans. No, not the open borders that have
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.520]  been proven to be bringing these people in. Nope, it's the unvaccinated people. So now
[27:19.520 --> 27:24.400]  in Italy, they're telling you, you have to take a vaccine or you're not going to school.
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.360]  Get ready. That's coming here. That's why you're seeing all the vaccine propaganda now.
[27:29.360 --> 27:36.040]  Even Kim Kardashian. Ooh, even Kim K wants you to vaccinate your kids. Thank you, Kim.
[27:36.040 --> 27:42.920]  Yes. I mean, it's not like Kim hasn't had a few needles injecting silicone and collagen
[27:42.920 --> 27:52.160]  and God knows what else into her. Maybe a little ambrosia, but no, because we will stand
[27:52.160 --> 27:56.280]  in the way of forced vaccinations. Go ahead and vaccinate. But you have the freedom to
[27:56.280 --> 28:00.120]  choose. So when we come back, Alex Jones is going to be responding to the college gate
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.960]  scandal. But first folks, during this four minute break, please jump over to info wars

[33:21.120 --> 33:38.280]  The news broke yesterday like a thousand thunderbolts. It was the top story not just here in the
[33:38.280 --> 33:50.360]  U.S. but across the world. Could you believe it? A massive reported organized crime network
[33:50.360 --> 33:57.120]  meeting thousands and thousands of illegitimate students who couldn't pass the grades and
[33:57.120 --> 34:05.880]  who couldn't even supposedly play the sports in many cases to get the scholarships had
[34:05.880 --> 34:17.360]  paid in some cases $6.5 million on the high end to just get admission into these colleges.
[34:17.360 --> 34:22.440]  How could it ever happen? The CNN headline and the ABC news headline and all the other
[34:22.440 --> 34:30.600]  headlines I saw read the college admissions scam. But I had a lot of trouble finding the
[34:30.600 --> 34:37.440]  word conspiracy even though in the press conference the FBI called it a conspiracy and even though
[34:37.440 --> 34:42.900]  in the criminal filings it's called a criminal conspiracy but you see the media, the corporate
[34:42.900 --> 34:49.400]  media has taught us that there's never a conspiracy, said Bayer Pharmaceutical, 20 years ago for
[34:49.400 --> 34:55.840]  more than five years to knowingly put HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C and the factor eight
[34:55.840 --> 35:01.640]  blood product that killed millions. Of course it came out in their own documents. They knew
[35:01.640 --> 35:04.960]  and thought it was funny and said it would make more money if they just dumped it on
[35:04.960 --> 35:09.880]  the market and by the way there's too many hemophiliacs. That's what they said. It's
[35:09.880 --> 35:18.160]  this eugenics angle so they always have an excuse but I digress. Going back, when two
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.160]  men or two women or two people get together and decide they're going to rob a bank and
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.480]  they plant it out, they decide the day and the time and who's going to say get on the
[35:26.480 --> 35:31.960]  floor and who's going to load the bags full of the money, it's a conspiracy. But when
[35:31.960 --> 35:35.960]  babies get thrown on incubators and their brains bash cows and Congress has told we
[35:35.960 --> 35:39.360]  have to go to war that kills millions, we later learned it didn't happen. Well you're
[35:39.360 --> 35:45.600]  not supposed to ask questions in the future about big events. And so they've so demonized
[35:45.600 --> 35:51.760]  the word conspiracy that the word conspiracy can't exist when we just had the Oxycontin
[35:51.760 --> 35:59.640]  company knowingly, again over 15 years ago, planning the rollout of very addictive drugs
[35:59.640 --> 36:05.720]  to dominate all other opioids to be so strong that no one even wanted the regular opioids
[36:05.720 --> 36:11.880]  and then to even have drugs to take you off the opioids later. That's a cut and dry total
[36:11.880 --> 36:17.760]  conspiracy and it's all come out in the criminal filings, it's all come out in the lawsuits.
[36:17.760 --> 36:26.480]  See how that works. So again, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit a giant conspiracy.
[36:26.480 --> 36:32.520]  And so you read through this latest situation and how from division one sports right through
[36:32.520 --> 36:39.040]  the whole system, from the time kids were in high school, their parents were already
[36:39.040 --> 36:47.560]  spending on average over a million dollars in charitable donations to all these different
[36:47.560 --> 36:51.240]  organizations, all these different college groups, all these different art groups, all
[36:51.240 --> 36:56.720]  these different human rights groups that are all laundering the money, where these people
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.200]  sit on top, these thousands of nonprofits, mainly leftist nonprofits, or the IRS wouldn't
[37:02.200 --> 37:07.000]  have conservative nonprofits for like eight years under Obama. But the Democrats and the
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.840]  liberals, they all get the nonprofits. And then the money's laundered through not just
[37:11.840 --> 37:17.560]  on this college admission scam. There's all sorts of scams out there to get a liver or
[37:17.560 --> 37:21.880]  to get a kidney. There's all sorts of scams to get a media job in major markets. You've
[37:21.880 --> 37:27.600]  got to pay people off. This is all going on the surface and the corruption is just intensifying.
[37:27.600 --> 37:34.560]  So I applaud the FBI for going after this scam, but isn't it really true that college
[37:34.560 --> 37:39.760]  itself is a scam now? As we put all this government funding behind it and make it politically
[37:39.760 --> 37:45.680]  correct with all the affirmative action, all we do is turn it into more of a fraud.
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.360]  As you put more money behind something and basically try to force people to attend it,
[37:50.360 --> 37:54.640]  it drives up the price, just like healthcare with Obamacare.
[37:54.640 --> 38:00.240]  So pulling back from the whole thing, about 90 percent, even Money Magazine and Forbes
[38:00.240 --> 38:05.200]  have met this, about 90 percent of college degrees never pay off. They never pay off
[38:05.200 --> 38:10.960]  the loans that they got. By that, most people pay off the loans, but the amount of money
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.120]  you spend, the amount of loan payments that you end up paying, you never get that money
[38:16.120 --> 38:21.280]  back from the jobs that you get via the degree. And so people then go and start collecting
[38:21.280 --> 38:26.160]  degrees like baseball cards. Degree after degree. Yes, you need an engineering degree.
[38:26.160 --> 38:29.800]  Yes, you need a medical degree. Yes, you need a legal degree if you're going to be in those
[38:29.800 --> 38:37.000]  professions. But the liberal arts and all the rest of it are degrees in search of jobs.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.260]  And that's the big leftist global conspiracy that the Rockefellers wrote about and talked
[38:40.260 --> 38:46.920]  about 60 years ago, that they would create all these degrees of, you know, quote, environmental
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.080]  protection and social worker and all the rest of it, and then they wouldn't have real jobs.
[38:51.080 --> 38:55.360]  So those people would then become lobbies, the lobby government, to create a controlled
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.880]  economy where those jobs were mandated so that they would have a place for their worthless
[38:59.880 --> 39:04.840]  degrees. And that's what the carbon taxes and all of this are about. So there you have
[39:04.840 --> 39:08.840]  it. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[39:08.840 --> 39:11.320]  and millions. They're saying it could be in the billions and billions. No one knows
[39:11.320 --> 39:17.280]  the numbers yet. Multi-year investigation, deep inside, even CNN and others are saying
[39:17.280 --> 39:26.160]  it's open and shut. Oh, but then if we question other big events or other big happenings,
[39:26.160 --> 39:32.080]  we're the bad guys. No, ladies and gentlemen, take vaccines. The inserts of every major
[39:32.080 --> 39:39.520]  vaccine say they can kill you, cause Guillain-Barre's, neurological disorders, narcolepsy, cancer,
[39:39.520 --> 39:44.520]  read it. Not the fact sheet they give you at the pharmacy. Not the quote fact sheet.
[39:44.520 --> 39:48.640]  You want the insert underlaw that's in the packages. By the way, there's been bills
[39:48.640 --> 39:53.840]  introduced the last four years consecutively to my federal law, remove the inserts and
[39:53.840 --> 39:59.560]  not let you have them. So what do you have? Adam Schiff, he put pressure on Amazon to
[39:59.560 --> 40:05.920]  remove bestselling documentaries with medical doctors talking about the dangers of vaccines.
[40:05.920 --> 40:13.760]  Removed. That was just yesterday. They're coming for our free speech because Big Pharma,
[40:13.760 --> 40:19.560]  the same ones that put you on weaponized heroin, synthetic heroin on purpose and flood the
[40:19.560 --> 40:24.040]  market with it. The same ones that give you HIV through their blood products on purpose.
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.720]  The Clintons for over a decade had the state certify blood out of prisons for the HIV and
[40:29.720 --> 40:34.760]  hepatitis and they made millions as well. This is a culture of pure evil and they don't
[40:34.760 --> 40:39.240]  want you questioning it. They go, oh, look, we've got a bunch of measles and mumps. And
[40:39.240 --> 40:45.280]  we've dig into it. It's almost all illegal aliens coming in, unvetted, untested with
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.040]  hepatitis and drug resistant TB and even cholera and even the black plague and even
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.240]  leprosy. But all that gets covered up. And it's just, oh, diseases are on the rise in
[40:55.240 --> 40:59.640]  some areas. We need to arrest anyone that doesn't take the vaccines when the vaccines
[40:59.640 --> 41:07.240]  are Trojan horse systems with liability protection. It's out of control. It's a recipe for disaster.
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.480]  So I would just expect Congress to pass a liability protection act or something to say that big
[41:11.480 --> 41:16.360]  colleges can just fix degrees and you just pay for the highest bidder and we'll just
[41:16.360 --> 41:23.360]  start giving triple doctorates and PhDs to rich guys, morons, sons and daughters that
[41:23.360 --> 41:28.880]  can't even tie their shoelaces because that's where all this is going. But this is a good
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.440]  step in the right direction, ladies and gentlemen. But if you go to UT or any other big university,
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.000]  I've been down there, I've looked at them. It looks like a bunch of lobotomized zombies
[41:38.000 --> 41:46.160]  from day of the dead meets hell on earth, Omega man, I am legend. And we have created
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.440]  a system where we don't really challenge people and it's created a mess and it's out of control.
[41:50.440 --> 42:00.440]  But there you go. The big giant college admissions conspiracy, the college admissions conspiracy,
[42:00.440 --> 42:05.880]  the rest of the story, that's what this is. I'm Alex Jones, back to Owen Shroyer, more
[42:05.880 --> 42:10.480]  special reports I'm filing throughout this hour. And the next, please stay with us because
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.880]  only you can spread the live links, only you can spread the articles, only you can override
[42:14.880 --> 42:19.600]  the censors and you've been doing it. And I salute you. We're in it to win it together.
[42:19.600 --> 42:20.600]  God bless.
[42:20.600 --> 42:30.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, Alex is going to be talking about staged
[42:30.400 --> 42:38.920]  hate crimes, like the Jesse Smollett case, where his team of lawyers are now saying
[42:38.920 --> 42:45.000]  that it's a flimsy case against him. So let's see, he cut the check, we have the check.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.800]  We have him going on national television saying the whole thing, the people that he hired
[42:48.800 --> 42:53.240]  to fake the hate crime admitted it. The police investigated it, the whole thing's been exposed.
[42:53.240 --> 43:00.720]  A nice dirty Hollywood crook lawyer says there's no case here. I've been doing a lot of research
[43:00.720 --> 43:08.200]  into Google and YouTube censorship. And I've noticed that there's one type of video that
[43:08.200 --> 43:15.120]  is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed. And that's the videos where
[43:15.120 --> 43:21.320]  you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds
[43:21.320 --> 43:27.280]  and others get so butt hurt when Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They
[43:27.280 --> 43:33.120]  don't want us to remember what political action did. And that's why the globalist Hillary
[43:33.120 --> 43:38.800]  and others are trying to shut in for us now. This is a fight about taking your speech away,
[43:38.800 --> 43:44.520]  not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war.
[43:44.520 --> 43:48.360]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[43:48.360 --> 43:51.360]  just spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products
[43:51.360 --> 43:56.120]  we have and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water. I'm in your hands, you're
[43:56.120 --> 43:59.600]  in my hands, at M4Store.com. Thank you.

[45:07.600 --> 45:11.800]  systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing
[45:11.800 --> 45:17.880]  Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled
[45:17.880 --> 45:22.280]  with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the
[45:22.280 --> 45:28.280]  body and it supports the M4. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.880]  have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[45:32.880 --> 45:37.080]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to
[45:37.080 --> 45:41.600]  your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world, that patriots

[45:47.440 --> 45:52.000]  of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused

[47:03.560 --> 47:15.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the information war, it's
[47:15.480 --> 47:25.600]  Alex Jones. Years ago, Infowars.com published extensive stories showing hundreds and hundreds
[47:25.600 --> 47:31.440]  of examples of staged fake hay crunch. Now, we've been a little busy covering other issues
[47:31.440 --> 47:36.000]  in the last few years, but Breitbart picked up where we left off and they've published
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.920]  articles showing hundreds of cases where there were staged leftist attacks on themselves.
[47:42.920 --> 47:47.680]  But now, CNN and others are reporting that California High School that was visited by
[47:47.680 --> 47:53.240]  a Holocaust survivor suddenly had swastikas put up after the woman left. Now, this may
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.720]  well have happened. I'm not accusing the old woman or anybody else at the school of
[47:57.720 --> 48:03.680]  staging anything. I'm simply saying since almost every other case has been staged,
[48:03.680 --> 48:06.880]  including remember Trump, right after he got elected, got blamed for being anti-Semitic,
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.440]  because he didn't do enough about somebody tumping over Jewish gravestones and putting
[48:11.440 --> 48:16.360]  swastikas on synagogues in New Jersey. And I said it was probably staged by some leftists
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.920]  to blame Trump. Hell, why was the media jumping on incidents that are disgusting but still
[48:20.920 --> 48:31.760]  nonviolent? On the radar screen, not a major crime, a distasteful crime, a bad thing, but
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.360]  why were they focusing on it? Because obviously the fix was in, it was staged. And Trump came
[48:36.360 --> 48:40.240]  out and said he thought it was staged because he talked to the state police and they called
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.680]  him anti-Semitic. For that, it turned out it had been staged by leftists to make Trump
[48:44.680 --> 48:52.160]  look bad. And so all I'm saying is with the Jesse Smollett situation and all these other
[48:52.160 --> 48:57.000]  big events that just go on and on, we have a right and a duty to question this and every
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.960]  other major event. And this is getting massive, massive coverage. And you tie that in to the
[49:01.960 --> 49:06.960]  college admissions scam, which is only the college admissions conspiracy and the drug
[49:06.960 --> 49:11.000]  company documents that have come out where they're purposely trying to get people addicted
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.160]  to opioids or they're purposely trying to give people HIV, Bayer. I mean, you cannot
[49:16.160 --> 49:22.400]  make this stuff up. And that's why I'm so concerned about Congressman Schiff demanding
[49:22.400 --> 49:27.560]  that Amazon take down bestselling documentaries that are very popular, but even if they weren't
[49:27.560 --> 49:31.920]  popular, people have a right to put out movies saying the moon is made of cheese or the Easter
[49:31.920 --> 49:37.920]  bunny is real. But they're saying because we've got some of these diseases coming into
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.000]  the U.S. and because we've got a few things like months and things and the measles going
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.280]  up that we must absolutely ban anyone questioning vaccines. Well, that's crazy. That's like saying
[49:50.280 --> 49:54.960]  because we have people breaking their legs. We shouldn't question opioids. Vaccines, ladies
[49:54.960 --> 49:59.160]  and gentlemen, have been caught being tainted over and over again. Since the 1980s, they're
[49:59.160 --> 50:03.440]  given liability protection. They've caught the U.N. adding sterilants to vaccines in
[50:03.440 --> 50:10.680]  Africa and in the Middle East and in Central Asia and Pakistan. Look it up. There is a
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.880]  giant Bill and Melinda Gates operation dealing with the vaccines. And this is just incredibly
[50:15.880 --> 50:23.720]  dangerous. But getting back, getting back to the situation on California. Of course,
[50:23.720 --> 50:28.560]  there's rigged systems in the stock market. Of course, there's rigged deals with people
[50:28.560 --> 50:33.520]  buying admission to colleges. In some cases, spending $6.5 million. Of course, there's
[50:33.520 --> 50:39.600]  all sorts of scams and arms dealing and people buying off politicians and giving major contributions
[50:39.600 --> 50:45.480]  so they get the construction rights and get to rig the no bid contracts. Whether it's
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.640]  Halliburton and its history or what goes on in local towns and cities, we all know about
[50:49.640 --> 50:56.320]  this. And in full wars is about questioning known scams that are going on and investigating
[50:56.320 --> 51:01.680]  known scams and looking for other scams. And that's what we do here at Info Wars and it's
[51:01.680 --> 51:05.720]  why the establishment wants us to shut up while they want to shut down because they
[51:05.720 --> 51:15.840]  don't want you questioning, period. So on the subject of the California school, we need
[51:15.840 --> 51:20.640]  to hear from the police about who's being investigated. Because nine times out of ten,
[51:20.640 --> 51:24.440]  these investigations go nowhere. And that's usually when the fix is in. Because when you
[51:24.440 --> 51:28.600]  do investigate, you tend to find out, you don't tend, you almost always find out that
[51:28.600 --> 51:34.360]  it was staged by someone for political gain. Oh, the terrible climate of the country. Oh,
[51:34.360 --> 51:40.200]  all the racism. Oh, all the anti-Semitism because of people like Trump. Meanwhile, you've
[51:40.200 --> 51:47.560]  got Ilhan Omar. What's the new nickname I've given her? Kind of like we have AOC. If you
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.600]  add actually her full name together, I've got it here in the list of things I want to
[51:52.600 --> 52:01.880]  cover. It's I-A-O. Ilhan Abdelay Omar. I-A-O. Sorry, I'm digressing that. She did, by the
[52:01.880 --> 52:07.760]  way, has confirmed. Mary, her brother in a scam to get him here. Just absolutely incredible.
[52:07.760 --> 52:12.440]  We wonder why she's so anti-American. Why she's so anti-Israel. What do you think goes
[52:12.440 --> 52:18.600]  on in Somalia? You're kidnapped in five minutes. You're almost always robbed and killed. Their
[52:18.600 --> 52:25.720]  main business is piracy and kidnapping and terrorism. And then we're going to import massive
[52:25.720 --> 52:29.520]  numbers of these people here and then wonder why the hell as soon as they get in Congress,
[52:29.520 --> 52:35.080]  they start going crazy because they're diabolically opposed to anybody but their system. They don't
[52:35.080 --> 52:40.360]  get along with the tribes around them as well and the other Muslims. A thousand years ago,
[52:40.360 --> 52:45.720]  only a few spots in North Africa had Muslims. Now it's half-Africa. They're taking over.
[52:45.720 --> 52:52.240]  Here's the house of Islam and the house of war outside of Islam. So you've got real threats
[52:52.240 --> 52:55.360]  to the country. You've got real threats to our sovereignty. You've got real threats to
[52:55.360 --> 53:01.680]  our independence and our openness by exporting and then importing all these radical jihadists
[53:01.680 --> 53:05.960]  into our country and it needs to be stopped. But instead, we get to have the daily dose
[53:05.960 --> 53:12.360]  of a poop swastika or the Air Force Academy or the Army Academy at West Point and on
[53:12.360 --> 53:16.920]  and on and on. Somebody writes it inward, you know, in the dorm and it always turns out
[53:16.920 --> 53:21.160]  a month later and the back of the newspaper would have been staged. So this needs to
[53:21.160 --> 53:24.640]  be investigated. It needs to be investigated now. They don't want us to question. They
[53:24.640 --> 53:28.120]  want to outlaw that. That's what we're being demonized, what we're being attacked, but
[53:28.120 --> 53:33.800]  it's not working. In closing, this little analysis I just engaged in, please remember
[53:33.800 --> 53:37.720]  that without you financially supporting us, we're dead in the water. We make it so easy
[53:37.720 --> 53:43.120]  to support them full wars that then promotes the American way of life, the Second Amendment,
[53:43.120 --> 53:47.240]  the right to life. We do radical stuff like stand up for babies that are already born
[53:47.240 --> 53:51.560]  and say that it's wrong to harvest their organs. You know, we're extremist. When you
[53:51.560 --> 53:55.920]  get the books, when you get the videos, when you get the t-shirts, it gives you more knowledge.
[53:55.920 --> 53:58.840]  You can then donate the books and videos to the library after you've watched them or read
[53:58.840 --> 54:02.840]  them. When you wear t-shirts, it helps you meet like-minded people. It helps you spread
[54:02.840 --> 54:07.440]  the word and it helps promote freedom everywhere. We've got a bunch of big specials that are
[54:07.440 --> 54:11.920]  about to end and then FullWarStore.com. So please take advantage today, but whatever

[55:05.040 --> 55:09.400]  take Trump to the woodshed. This is the worst thing Trump's done so far and it just confirms
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.520]  some of my fears. I don't think Trump is bad, but he's going off the rails in some ways.
[55:14.520 --> 55:19.040]  So at the start of the next hour, I'm going to get into the president and how he's gone
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.040]  off the rails and now we've got to get him back on the rails. So please stay with us
[55:22.040 --> 55:23.040]  for this critical message.
[55:23.040 --> 55:29.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now be sure to share the links to this band broadcast
[55:29.960 --> 55:37.200]  so that we can get this message heard and to President Trump. And I'll tell you what,
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.600]  it's totally out of control today because Paul Manafort has now been sentenced to seven
[55:42.600 --> 55:50.120]  and a half years in jail to understand how egregious and this is such an injustice. It's
[55:50.120 --> 56:00.000]  like it's such an injustice. Honestly, if we weren't committed to doing this here every
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.800]  day at InfoWars, I'd just quit. I'd be done. This is a joke. It's seriously such a joke.
[56:07.800 --> 56:13.640]  It's just like, if this is going to go on, what's the point? So I understand why people
[56:13.640 --> 56:17.000]  don't care. I understand why people lay it all down. I understand why people get caught
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.760]  up in sports and pop culture because, yeah, I mean, Jeffrey Epstein, known pedophile child
[56:22.760 --> 56:29.480]  sex trafficker, he's a free man, Tony Podesta, who was working with Manafort with all these
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.960]  Ukrainian things. He doesn't even get indicted. He gets nothing. He gets total immunity. Oh,
[56:33.960 --> 56:37.560]  but Paul Manafort gets seven and a half years because he's an associate of Donald Trump
[56:37.560 --> 56:44.840]  and they want to destroy him. Yeah, great, great. So I understand why Americans just
[56:44.840 --> 56:51.800]  cash in and just give up. And if the president isn't going to do anything about this miscarriage
[56:51.800 --> 56:59.000]  of justice, then, yeah, well, we'll just have to call him out on it and continue to do so.
[56:59.640 --> 57:03.160]  And that's what Alex Jones is going to do in the next segment. But then you have
[57:03.960 --> 57:10.840]  Senator Blumenthal saying, oh, this is Manafort's lucky. He's lucky. He only got seven and a half
[57:10.840 --> 57:17.800]  years. Okay, Senator Blumenthal, do Epstein now. Senator Blumenthal, now do Clinton. Senator
[57:17.800 --> 57:24.600]  Blumenthal, will you do Tony Podesta? I mean, just F these people, man. Just F all of them.
[57:25.960 --> 57:32.280]  It's too bad we've been so cucked. It's too bad there's no men left anymore. It's too bad we're
[57:32.280 --> 57:37.240]  dead already. It's the only way they can get away with it. It's the only way you can throw
[57:37.240 --> 57:40.920]  Manafort in jail for seven and a half years and Epstein walks free because there's no men
[57:40.920 --> 57:44.600]  because nobody stands up to you. We're a bunch of cucks. We're a bunch of pieces of garbage,
[57:44.600 --> 58:08.600]  man. We just let this happen. Fine. Just destroy the whole world while you're at it.
[58:14.680 --> 58:18.920]  In the Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you. Be sure and sign up for auto ship

[58:29.560 --> 58:33.880]  globalists don't want you to have the good halogens. Don't you have the bad halogens at
[58:33.880 --> 58:39.800]  infowarstore.com. That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com. They should write the supplements.

[1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:21.160]  If I wasn't principled, I would actually beg Trump to be an authoritarian dictator right now
[1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:24.200]  because I think that's the only answer to this crap.
[1:00:27.240 --> 1:00:33.320]  Tucker Carlson is dealing with the hate mob. He addressed the potential illegal activity
[1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:37.960]  of media matters last night in his opening monologue. Here is that clip.
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:43.880]  Media matters is a George Soros funded lobbying organization whose sole mission is to punish
[1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:48.440]  critics of the Democratic Party. Media matters often uses propaganda from the Southern Property
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:53.960]  Law Center to bully corporations, news executives and tech companies into punishing people it doesn't
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:01:00.040]  like. Not surprisingly, the media love media matters. One former employee described the group's
[1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:05.400]  relationship with MSNBC this way, quote, we were pretty much writing their prime time.
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:11.720]  When media matters issued a press release, MSNBC picked it up, quote, verbatim. Media matters
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:16.120]  staffers once explained that the organization's close relationships with journalists in the
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:21.000]  national press corps were vast. Here are some quotes, quote, great.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:24.600]  I remember Alex Jones used to report on this years ago when I first started listening. He
[1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:29.240]  literally said everything they do on CNN, mainly MSNBC and all this major news is just talking
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:34.200]  points from media matters. Now they just admit it. I want him to write. The people at Huffington
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:40.040]  Post were always eager to cooperate. Jim Rainey at the LA Times took a lot of our stuff. Brian
[1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:44.360]  Stelter at the New York Times was helpful. Well, Brian Stelter has since left the New
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:49.480]  York Times. He's now the house eunuch at CNN announcing proclamations from his tiny king,
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:55.080]  Jeff Zucker. He takes his talking points, though, still from media matter. Here's Zucker's Puppet.
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:04.120]  They're a little Brian Stelter puppeteer.
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:09.960]  What Fox does in prime time is resentment television, making you resent liberals and others who are
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:14.120]  trying to hurt you. That's the message from Fox. I think all of this matters. It's about
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:20.600]  decency and standards. It's about the corrosive Humpty Dumpty ever because Trump is in office
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:26.120]  and CNN is losing involving some of these hosts. There's no Russian collusion about decency,
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:33.640]  cries the eunuch. We must have decency by which the eunuch means less disobeying more obedience.
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:40.680]  Stop criticizing the program or else this is the face of state media. What does Fox even exist?
[1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:46.680]  They wonder. We've got 11 other perfectly good cable channels, all of them approved by management
[1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:51.000]  and obedient to the people in charge. How could anybody watch something different?
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:56.440]  Fox can't be legitimate. They must be lying. Their viewers must be stupid.
[1:02:57.480 --> 1:03:02.840]  Listen to Don LeMond and the governor's brother tell you why Fox News shouldn't even be allowed.
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:09.400]  As journalists, we have to give you the facts. What happens there is you don't talk about the
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:16.040]  substance of what you said or if it's factual or not. You don't talk about that. What you do is
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:21.880]  you say everybody's out to get me. Everyone is out to get conservatives. You just say,
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:27.320]  oh, there's outrage on the left and they have Trump derangement syndrome and they're always
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:33.000]  out to look without ever addressing the substance. They're not about facts. They're about feelings.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.080]  Their audience just finds it up. Hold on, hold on. Can we have a moment of silence?
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:39.960]  I'd like to take a moment of silence.
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:47.320]  Intellect, common sense, logic and reasoning are dead.
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:56.680]  Okay, continue with Don LeMond. Don LeMond is calling you dumb.
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:01.400]  Savor the moment. But there's an ominous undertone to all of this.
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:07.400]  Don LeMond, hold on. It's not just that you can hear the full videos.
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:13.960]  I think it's on infowars.com. It's not just that Don LeMond is calling you dumb. I mean,
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:20.200]  they're sitting here. I'm stunned. I don't even know what to do. I mean, this
[1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:25.880]  everything is so ass-backwards right now and the president is just like going along with it.
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:28.360]  I mean, I'm just sick of it, dude. I'm just, I'm done.
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:34.680]  Manafort gets seven and a half years simply because he worked with Trump.
[1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:41.160]  Podesta gets nothing. Epstein walks free. CNN is saying that conservatives go by feelings and
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:50.040]  not facts. I mean, you people think there's 700 genders. I mean, wow.
[1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:54.040]  Emergency message from Alex Jones on the other side, folks. This is,
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:58.360]  share these links, folks. Spread the links. There's nobody left in media that says real.
[1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:01.960]  It's simple. If you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take on the new world order,
[1:05:01.960 --> 1:05:06.920]  I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey. I'm not sitting here selling you cancer
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:11.080]  cures. I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:15.720]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill? What is the top tumor? It's the best seller
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:19.880]  because it's anti-inflammatory. And what's the best lab in the country? Okay, they're the highest
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:24.520]  rated. I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid? Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle,
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:29.160]  but that's still incredible, sir. And I'm like, what's the highest you could do? A month later,
[1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:33.960]  90, 95%. No one's ever done that. I said, how much does that cost for a bottle that costs $10?
[1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:38.440]  No one's ever done that, sir. The average competitors, 3% to 5% here. The top brands,
[1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:42.520]  50%. I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid. I mean, you understand, like,
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.920]  that's like our information is explosive. Our fish oil, I go out and I get the cleanest,
[1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:51.560]  the best. My children take it. You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very
[1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:56.120]  damn best on my soul? You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers?
[1:05:56.120 --> 1:05:57.480]  Never in foursword.com.
[1:05:57.480 --> 1:06:05.400]  With heavy heart, I'm forced to report the facts to you, my friends. President Trump is betraying
[1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:12.360]  America. President Trump is throwing America's free speech overboard to the wolves of big tech.
[1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:16.440]  President Trump, it appears, has been bought off and is compromised.
[1:06:19.080 --> 1:06:25.160]  A few months ago, I got really angry at my old friend of 20 years, Joe Rogan,
[1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:30.040]  because I knew that Joe was smart and that he was aware of the coordinated censorship taking place
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:34.760]  against nationalists, against conservatives, against Christians, against patriots.
[1:06:35.320 --> 1:06:39.960]  And then it was un-American what was happening and that he has undoubtedly the biggest continual
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:45.240]  podcast in the world. It's incredible. He probably has 10 million listeners a day now.
[1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:52.520]  I'm very proud that he now has woken up and had myself on to 99% positive reviews
[1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:56.280]  to say that censorship is wrong and needs to be dealt with. And he had Jack Dorsey,
[1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:00.680]  as he promised me he would do, back on the next week and grilled the hell out of him with Tim Poole.
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:07.000]  So when I say this about Trump, I say this because just like Joe needed to be confronted to get him
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:13.160]  out of his, I guess, malaise days, whatever, and I say that lovingly, President Trump needs to be
[1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:19.400]  confronted in hardcore, because Trump knows exactly what's going on way more than Joe Rogan does.
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:24.920]  In an in-depth Breitbart interview linked up on infowars.com, and I'll go to in a moment,
[1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:30.840]  Trump lays out the internal videos at Google, at YouTube, at Facebook, at Twitter, that myself
[1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:35.800]  and Veritas and others got and had put together in legal documents and sent to him last year.
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:39.240]  I had three different law firms send three different reports with connections to the
[1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:43.800]  White House right to him. Their response was to ban me off the internet for doing it.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:47.400]  That's how big tech responded. They saw it as a threat it was to their tyranny. They're setting
[1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:51.640]  up combines, they're setting up monopolies, they're setting up cartels, they're racketeering,
[1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:56.680]  they're violating our civil rights, an organized corporate system to suppress whole groups and
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:08:01.400]  classes of people. They can argue, well, there's just things political oppression. Yes, there is,
[1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:06.440]  and there are laws against political oppression, but there are also laws on oppressing Christians,
[1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:10.680]  and that's the main group that's being targeted. So the president has become completely derelict in
[1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:15.320]  his duty, and he gives this big long interview and says, oh, I know it's terrible. I've seen the videos
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:20.280]  with their coordinating suppressing us. We've got to be good. We've got to really behave ourselves
[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:26.440]  and not get banned. They're banning Prager University. They're banning people like the son
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:32.200]  of Billy Graham. They're going after everybody. They want Trump taken off Twitter. And then,
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:37.800]  it's even worse, Mr. President, you allow Sundar Pichai, the head of Google and the rest of them
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:42.920]  to go before Congress and say there is no censorship. There is no manipulation of links,
[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:47.720]  that it's all an algorithm when you can go to Google and pay to not just have your story or
[1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:53.080]  your video or your movie trailer at the top as an ad, but that you pay now for the top placement.
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:58.040]  And we have all the internal Google documents and internal employees. The stuff comes out every day.
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:03.640]  The new Marvel comic movie coming out, Captain Marvel. All the documents have come out on that,
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:08.600]  all the screenshots, all the internal emails, where it was super unpopular. So they rigged it.
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:13.240]  Rotten Tomatoes was an accurate site about two years ago, and Hollywood just bought it off.
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:17.160]  So now the worst movies out there get the top reviews and went Oscars.
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:23.080]  Just like the college admissions scam, conspiracy, just like all of this stuff,
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:30.040]  it's rigged, rigged, rigged. And the Republican neocon bluebluts have been quarterbacking through
[1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:34.920]  News Guard and these other systems what's actually happening. There's a partnership between top
[1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:41.000]  Republicans and top lobbyists and groups like News Corp that want all of the advertising money
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:47.400]  elections to go through television and through approved means on the internet. So they have
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:52.440]  deals with Facebook, Twitter, and Google to not ban their super PACs. But this is really all to
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:56.520]  shut down all the small PACs and all the more effective groups. Well, I'm not involved in a PAC.
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:00.280]  I'm not involved in political stuff. I've never taken political money. I'm not involved in all
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:06.040]  that. I stay out of it. I am promoting an ideology of freedom. But the truth is, the Republican Party
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:11.400]  is bought off and is in bed with Google and Silicon Valley and is part of this. And they've
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:15.880]  been lobbying Trump at a corporate level. And they've been giving billions and billions of
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:21.240]  dollars to the Republicans. And Trump is knowingly and consciously cutting us loose,
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:26.600]  letting us twist in the wind and saying, you go ahead and you censor them as much as you want.
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:30.120]  And then he tells us, yeah, I know it's terrible. What's happening to you. And I've been promising
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:34.520]  an executive order to stop this. But now I'm not even going to do it if I get reelected. He basically
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:38.680]  says in the interview, he just goes, you better behave yourself. It's like telling a woman that
[1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:42.680]  gets kidnapped off the street and she's getting gang raped at the back of some van or in some
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:47.000]  shack out in the countryside. You know, you better spread your legs good back behind your ears and
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.240]  you better beg them and tell them, you know, that you love it. And then maybe they won't slit your
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:55.960]  throat. So Trump lied to us about the vaccines and how he was going to expose it. You know,
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:01.400]  damn well, Baron got hurt by him, but came back, hadn't done it. He said he would do a lot of other
[1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:05.800]  things that he hasn't done. And now he's starting to make noises against the second amendment.
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:09.960]  And all I can think is maybe they've compromised the president because he's starting to slide
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:14.200]  sideways. I like him standing up against the chai comms in Huawei. I like him trying to defend
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:17.560]  our border. Like a lot of the things the president's doing. He's a hell of a lot better than Hillary
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:22.920]  Clinton. But here's the deal. Hillary Clinton, a president son, we put you in the White House.
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:26.280]  And a lot of us had our lives pretty much destroyed to try to get this Republic back.
[1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:32.840]  And now you want to sit there in Breitbart in an insulting, incredibly disgusting exercise.
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:38.120]  And you want to sit there and you want to tell us that we've got to just sit there and take it.
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:41.400]  Well, I'm not taking it. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very, very angry. I'm very, very
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:46.280]  mad. The only time I got this mad at Trump was after they've caught the rebels staging
[1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:49.960]  three chemical attacks. And Trump did the right thing. And so we're not going to war with Syria.
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:55.080]  Then he attacked a bunch of the sites. That really upset. Later, he did actually pull out
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:59.000]  or attempt to pull out. And so again, I praise the president for that. But there's a love hate
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.240]  situation going on here because if you read his interview at Breitbart.com, it's posted
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:08.600]  at infowars.com and news wars.com. It's disgusting. I mean, here, let me pull it up for you right
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:14.280]  now. Trump plan to fight big tech censorship. Listen to this. Trump plan to fight big tech
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:20.520]  censorship. You fight it by just being good. You've got to be really good. It's really run by a
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:24.840]  small number of people. In an interview with Breitbart News on Monday, President Trump came up
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:29.800]  short when asked whether he had any plans to fight big tech censorship in the 2020 election.
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:34.520]  And he goes on to say, I understand a lot of people wanting to look into it. I mean, normally,
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:39.320]  I'd like to say, let it be free, let it be free, but it's not free. Trump said it's really run by
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:43.320]  a small number of people. The president also referred to reports from Breitbart News exposing tech
[1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:48.200]  giants against a tech bias against conservatives in companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google.
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:52.920]  It's not bias. It's coordinated censorship. Now we've seen it. Now we've caught them. Now we've
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:56.920]  seen the speeches. We've seen the in-house little videos that somehow got released to me.
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:01.480]  That's a very big scandal, he said. Good rhetoric with zero serious policy proposals.
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:05.720]  The president specifically criticized Twitter for blacklisting conservatives on their platform.
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:09.640]  Good. It's like throwing somebody overboard and then saying, sorry, you're drowning.
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:15.000]  When asked by Breitbart News reporter Charlie Spearing about how he planned to fight tech
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.160]  bias in 2020 election, he replied, you fight it by being good. You've got to be really good.
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:26.120]  It's much harder for conservative Republicans to win than it is for liberal Democrats.
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:31.400]  There's no indication he would use the power vested in him to demand an antitrust investigation
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:35.240]  of these blatant monopolies. No indication he would sign an executive order on social media
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:40.760]  censorship, which he floated last year. No indication he would use discrimination laws to go after
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:44.840]  PayPal and others who are blatantly discriminating against right-wingers for their first of unprotected
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:51.160]  political speech. We've all just got to be really good. The best one might say. Yeah, you can have
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:56.280]  all these Islamic people in Congress saying America sucks and, you know, the communism and
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:01.560]  socialism is great in Venezuela. You can have all this garbage going on. You can have Antifa
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:06.120]  going around and beating people in the head with bike locks. But when PayPal bans a bunch of innocent
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:11.960]  conservative Christian groups, the president doesn't do a damn thing when his own son Don Jr.
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:16.680]  goes all over the news and begs his father to do something and begs the people to lobby his father.
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:20.840]  But let's listen to Don Jr. and other patriots. Let's call the White House. Let's go to Trump
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:26.360]  events. Let's call talk radio. Let's call C-SPAN. Let's get this audio file that'll be posted in
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:31.800]  FullWars.com out to everybody and say, look, we've got a lot of fire under Trump's ass to get him to
[1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:36.280]  take action, or he's screwed. We're all screwed. The country's screwed. This is such a blind spot
[1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:41.160]  for the president. He's got a bunch of neocon advisors controlling him and manipulating him,
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:45.800]  and being nice is not going to get his attention. I've talked to a lot of folks that are very close
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:50.120]  to the president, and they say the only way you get his attention is absolutely getting angry
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:54.600]  and upset and lobbying the hell out of him. So ladies and gentlemen, Trump doesn't understand
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:59.320]  the internet. He's 72 years old. He understands a lot of things. He doesn't get what's happening.
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.920]  He doesn't understand. He still thinks, well, there's some misbehavior. That's what we're
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:08.360]  being taken down. No, we have the internal documents. Google said it's to stop Republicans
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:13.160]  getting elected in the future. Jim Jordan gets it. Nunez gets it. A few others get it.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:21.800]  The Texas Congressman, Gowdy gets it. Trump doesn't get it, and it's time to make damn sure he does.
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:26.920]  Period. Trump is throwing us overboard. He's throwing himself overboard, and we cannot put
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:31.560]  up with this garbage. But regardless of what he does, we're going to continue to file lawsuits.
[1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:34.760]  You're going to continue to spread the articles in the videos. We're going to need to march forward
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:38.920]  against this garbage one way or another. We're going to win, and nationalism and patriots are
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:43.000]  being elected all over the world, and nothing is going to stop the march of human enlightenment
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.760]  and the new Renaissance. God bless you all.
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:52.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take your phone calls on the other side of

[1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:35.080]  40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:39.000]  and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped

[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:16.840]  infowarstore.com with the best iodine in the world. X2, it's available. I thought X3 is great. We
[1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:20.840]  still got another deep breath crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine, the
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:26.280]  scientists that do that. It sold a lot that people want original X2. I was resigned the fact we
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:31.960]  didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:37.480]  So, hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same

[1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:10.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:10.920 --> 1:20:30.600]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones. And now your host,
[1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:36.600]  Owen Shroyer. You know, I kind of feel like a boxer right now that just took
[1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:45.800]  a cheap shot before the bell. And I'm just kind of staggered right now, kind of fumbling around
[1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:50.760]  the ring, just trying to find the ropes. Because I got all this news I want to cover. I've got all
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:57.560]  this analysis, and it's just like, I've got Senator Blumenthal saying that Paul Manafort's
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:02.600]  sentence was light, and that's a miscarriage of justice. I mean, literally the exact opposite is
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:09.480]  true. The case against Paul Manafort was already was already determined by a judge to not need
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:15.480]  jail time years ago. He was involved in all of these Ukrainian deals with Tony Podesta. Tony
[1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:20.520]  Podesta gets absolutely nothing. His name is in no headlines. By the way, the judge that
[1:21:21.160 --> 1:21:25.160]  just ruled the man in Manafort case, I believe it's Jackson, the Obama appointee, said there's no
[1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:30.680]  Russian collusion. And it has nothing to do with Russian collusion. But it has everything to do
[1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:37.320]  with Russian collusion, doesn't it? Even though there was no. And so we just,
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:45.640]  we just allow that to happen. Like a gut blow. It's like a low blow. And so you're like, whoa.
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:50.600]  And then you're trying to catch your breath from the unbelievable miscarriage of justice. And then
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:54.840]  the Democrats say, Oh, it was a miscarriage of justice. The other way around. Meanwhile, Hillary
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:22:03.720]  Clinton walks totally free. Jeffrey Epstein walks totally free. Then you have Elizabeth Warren
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:13.720]  saying she has no sympathy for those who frauded the colleges. Elizabeth, you did that. I mean,
[1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:19.240]  that's just ridiculous. And then I mean, just so much news. But again, it's just like,
[1:22:19.240 --> 1:22:25.480]  I'm just like fumbling, looking for the ropes. Like, whoa, what the hell's happening? We just keep
[1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:30.120]  getting hit with all these lies and all these this tyranny. So but here's what I'm going to do. I'm
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:39.960]  going to open up the phone lines for the remainder of this hour. 877-789-2539. 877-789 Alex. What does
[1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:47.320]  President Trump have to do to keep America great? He tweeted that out this morning.
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:55.080]  That's his new campaign slogan. That's his new hat. What does President Trump have to do to keep
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:23:01.080]  America great? Now, I know that there's a litany of things. I just want one. And so we're just going
[1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:11.800]  to plow through a ton of calls. I want 60 second responses. What does President Trump need to do
[1:23:11.800 --> 1:23:19.800]  to keep America great? Arrest Peter Stroke. Arrest Andrew McCabe. Because they're back in the news
[1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:26.120]  today. The Lisa Page transcripts make the Obama just department look exactly like it was a broken
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:30.360]  and corrupt machine. Hopefully justice will finally be served much more to come. That's from President
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:40.760]  Trump. You're the president of the United States of America. Do something about it. Excuse me.
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:45.560]  This is what happens at this big new studio. I tend to yell louder. President Trump again.
[1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:50.440]  James Comey testified under oath that it was a unanimous decision on crooked Hillary. Lisa
[1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:57.000]  Page transcript showed he lied. That's perjury, President Trump. Do something about it.
[1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:07.480]  Nice tweets, though. Nice tweets, Mr. President. Really great tweets, Mr. President.
[1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:12.280]  By the way, you know some of us aren't allowed on Twitter, Mr. President, but you say just behave.
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:18.520]  Your friend Paul Manafort just got seven and a half years in jail. The Democrats do the exact
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:23.160]  same bull crap. They get immunity. Your friend Roger Stone is about to get put in jail, too,
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:39.160]  for literally nothing. What does President Trump need to do to keep America great? We're
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:43.880]  taking your phone calls. I need just a 60-second response. Let's get at it now. We've got Liberty
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:48.200]  calling in from Oklahoma. What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:54.520]  You know, and I'm just as pissed off and discouraged as you. The number one thing he
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:25:01.160]  asked to do and what he promised to do was jail these traitors, these deep state traitors. We
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:07.320]  all know who they are. And the number two thing is he has to fall through on this censorship and
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:13.480]  stop it right now. It's got to be made clear to him. I'm so ticked off, and you've talked to me
[1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:20.520]  before. You know who I am. So I'm so ticked off at this, and I'm a peace-loving and American.
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:26.120]  But this is enough. If not, you know what it's going to turn into, and it won't be great. What
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:32.920]  do you think? Well, I mean, it's like, how many times do I have to get politically spat in my
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:37.320]  face until I do something? I mean, it's just ridiculous. Thank you for the call, Liberty.
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:44.680]  I mean, again, this is from John Radcliffe. Lisa Page confirmed to me under oath that the FBI was
[1:25:44.680 --> 1:25:48.680]  ordered by the Obama Department of Justice not to consider charging Hillary Clinton for gross
[1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:56.680]  negligence in the handling of classified information. I mean, hello, Earth to President Trump. Earth
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:26:03.400]  to anyone. Is there anyone alive in the United States government? Let's go to Dustin in Alabama.
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:07.800]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great? Go ahead, Dustin. Hey,
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:17.000]  Owen, can you hear me? Yeah. Hey, man, I believe if he legalizes marijuana that he will absolutely
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:23.880]  get 2020. But hold on a second, though, Dustin. Just Trump winning 2020 does not keep America great.
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:30.760]  That is true. That is true. But I do think that if he were to finally crack down on all of the
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:35.640]  deep state people that I really do think that he needs to crack down on them, you know?
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:41.480]  Boy, I'll tell you what, thanks for the call, Dustin. I'll tell you what,
[1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:49.480]  Q better be real or we're so screwed. I mean, folks, we're done. Like the country's done. Do
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:54.440]  you get it? They will arrest and put anyone in jail that they want.
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:27:03.160]  Let's go to Daryl in Texas. What does President Trump need to do to keep America great? Go ahead,
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:09.880]  Daryl. Trump needs to not forget where he came from. And there's two things. One thing,
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:16.600]  he's a scrapper. And then the second thing is he needs to get to what he does best. He needs to
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:25.320]  rely on regular people that he can bring in to Washington to fight for him. The first thing
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:31.080]  about being a scrapper, he needs to go for their power. They wield all their power in the media.
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:39.080]  That's on social media, but it's also on television. And I'm not sure exactly what he
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:45.160]  can do through the FCC or through going out. Well, that's actually a good question, Daryl.
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:48.040]  And we're going to break here. We're going to continue to take your calls. Here's the thing.
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:56.040]  Obviously, the president can't do anything about the censorship or let's say Facebook and Twitter.
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:59.560]  I mean, they're allowed to censor. It's part of their free speech. But you're telling me
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:04.440]  if you don't launch an investigation into those companies, you're not going to find
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:09.960]  something, folks. I mean, can you imagine if you sent a Mueller-type probe after Zuckerberg
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:16.120]  or Dorsey? I mean, give me a break. See, but that's the thing. Republicans and conservatives aren't a
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:20.920]  bunch of corrupt dicks that just want to ruin people's lives for their politics. Excuse my
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:26.280]  French, but it's true. That's all these people are. Robert Mueller, Adam Schiff. I mean, at least
[1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:32.200]  they're a bunch of jerks. I mean, who knows what really goes on with these people. But that's the
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:40.520]  problem. And so, yeah, we just sit here and just take it. But I guarantee you if we launch an
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:45.640]  investigation, I mean, Facebook and Google and Twitter, mainly Facebook and Google, they've
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:51.400]  been fined out the wazoo. They've already had record fines in Europe. Do an investigation into
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:55.800]  those companies. That's how you stop the censorship. Stop whatever's going on there.

[1:33:14.440 --> 1:33:30.840]  Waging war on corruption. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:36.920]  This country is totally out of control and it's only getting worse.
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:43.400]  We're spiraling into tyranny, total lack of freedom and choice. And you know,
[1:33:43.400 --> 1:33:45.800]  we thought we elected the president to do something about it.
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:51.960]  No, I was trying to explain to people last week how they're about, really it was three weeks ago
[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:56.520]  and then it happened last week and then it's still happening, how they're pushing this forced
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:02.600]  vaccination thing, this mandatory vaccination thing hard. I mean, it's every damn day in
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:07.560]  mainstream news, ladies and gentlemen, forced vaccinations is what it's all about. It's all
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:13.000]  about tyranny. It's all about control. It's all about you not having the choice. It's all about
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  the state being your daddy, the state being your mommy. Oh my gosh. You know, look,
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:28.600]  I have a bit of the primal urges still in me. And so like, when I absorb this and I know what it
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:35.480]  all means, I really want to start breaking shit. Excuse me, dump that. I just need to go back
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:39.560]  your calls. It's just, it's just, it's just unbelievable. I mean, if we don't, if we don't
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:44.680]  start standing up for America, it's gone. It's done. You'll be forced to vaccinate.
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:48.040]  The state will take your kid. The state will abort it. They'll say, oh, it's legal.
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:53.320]  And nobody seems to care. And we thought we elected the president to do something about it.
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:35:00.760]  I mean, I hope Q is real folks or you can kiss this country. Goodbye. So what does the president
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:04.440]  have to do to keep America great? We are asking you today. Oh yeah, there's a story. I couldn't
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:09.800]  even get to it because I'm just so enraged. This is from NBC News today. Amazon removes books,
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:15.640]  promoting autism cures and vaccine misinformation. Are you seeing it yet? Are you seeing it yet?
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:19.880]  Let's go to Chris in Minnesota. What does the president do?
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:24.280]  What does the president need to do to keep America great? Chris, go ahead.
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:31.080]  Owen, thank you. You've really nailed a couple of things today. Unfortunately,
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:36.840]  we're sitting here hoping that Q is real or else all hope is lost.
[1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:39.480]  We're done, man. We're done. The swap wins. It's over.
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:46.440]  Well, it's like I've told so many people over the last two years from the day Trump was elected.
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:56.120]  Either he's with those scum that have either he's with them or else he's a miracle man sent from
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:07.480]  God. But you hear about the deceptions, massive, the multi-pronged attack on American citizens
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:17.240]  and our spirits for years is to demoralize us and everything else is supernatural. But it would
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:23.720]  take a supernatural guy or somebody blessed by God. Well, either way, thank you for the call.
[1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:30.120]  We're doing 60 seconds. But I mean, look, either way, good or bad, Trump was sent by God. So,
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:35.800]  I mean, he was either sent by God to be the final nail of tyranny of deception that we all
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:39.480]  thought was going to be the hero or, or again, Q is real. But I mean, look,
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:44.520]  it's like the same thing. All of these college people, they're all a bunch of liberal Democrats.
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:48.120]  I mean, every damn one of them, man, they're all Clinton donors, literally.
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:58.360]  But there's hope, I guess, because I mean, I don't know. Maybe it's just like hope porn.
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:04.200]  Elite college cheating scandal arrests just the tip of the iceberg, according to Harvard
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:09.160]  law professor Alan Dershowitz. Is he saying that because he knows that more is about to be exposed
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.320]  or is he saying that because he knows how corrupt it really is? Here's what needs to be done. See,
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:20.920]  I'm a man of action. If I was the president, who's a man of Twitter, I'd shut down every state-run
[1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:27.320]  university next semester. I'd shut down the entire Ivy League. I would take all of their
[1:37:27.320 --> 1:37:31.960]  endowment funds. I would relieve the student loan debt and I'd launch an investigation into
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:37.160]  these state-run universities which have been caught cheating, rigging, faking classes,
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:43.320]  lying for athletes, letting athletes die. I mean, literally. Yeah, shut them all down,
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:48.120]  launch an investigation, steal their endowment. Yeah, go and steal their endowment. They steal
[1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:55.640]  for people all day long. Oh, what happened? Oh, I don't know. What happened is they decided they
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:38:00.360]  were going to start all these new student loan programs. So now everybody can go to college
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:05.240]  because that's what you need. And then guess what the universities did? They jacked up their
[1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:14.680]  enrollment costs and their tuition's double triple quadruple. It's all a big racket. It's all a big
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:19.560]  game. So I don't know if Dutchman's just saying, hey, more's coming. Be patient or yeah, the whole
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:26.840]  system is effed. What does President Trump need to do to keep America great? David in New York,
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:32.920]  go ahead. Good afternoon, Owen. This is what he needs to do to follow up on the two points you
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:38.920]  guys just mentioned. First of all, the God factor. We need to make it a fair playing field, Owen,
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:43.640]  with the Christian Judeo culture that we were rooted in versus the Muslims that are coming in
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:48.920]  here with their propaganda, their free speech, make shaming us, shouting us down. President
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:54.200]  Trump needs to break out one of them golden pens and sign, unfortunately, another executive order
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:39:00.440]  saying no more toleration against any speech that comes against the Christian thought or even the
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:05.560]  Muslim. Put us in a fair fighting ring. I'll take the Muslim on verbally. I'll take their ideology
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:10.600]  on. I know where they come from. I know their history. I'll argue with them in a polite but yet
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:17.720]  firm manner. But take our freedom of speech away, Oman, and we lost. We're done. He needs to sign
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:23.800]  that executive order and fine, shut down like you just did, shut down any operations and jail them,
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:29.480]  taking our free speech, jail them, Turkey. Well, I don't think taking, I think that they're
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:33.080]  honest. I believe that a fair investigation was launched into Twitter and Facebook and Google.
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:37.880]  You don't need to jail them for whatever censorship. I bet you there's crimes in there.
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:42.120]  I mean, you know there is. I mean, look what they did to Roger Stone. You don't think they can find
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:46.680]  dirt on Zuckerberg and Dorsey. I mean, give me a break. They'll set up entrapment crimes that
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:51.320]  they have to. Now I'm not calling for that. But look, thanks for the call, David. Look, I'm not
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:58.040]  in, I'm not in some war with Muslims. Okay. We're the ones that got told radical Islam wants to
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:02.760]  kill us all. They were responsible for the biggest terror attack in this country's history. So what
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:11.640]  am I supposed to believe? But it's like, I had somebody send me a video. And again, it's like,
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:15.480]  I don't, is it a problem? Is it not? We're not even having the intellectual debate. Muslims are
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:20.760]  starting to take over our political system. They just did a care ceremony. Somebody just
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:26.760]  sent me. They're like, yeah, well, six years ago, we had, you know, 10 Muslims run for office and
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:33.880]  overall raised $6 million. This last election, we had 270 Muslims running for office. We got
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:39.080]  over a hundred of men. We raised tens of millions of dollars. So I mean, this is a trend, folks.
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:45.080]  And again, okay, we're told radical Islam is responsible for the biggest terror attack
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:50.280]  in this country's history. Never forget, right? Hashtag never forget. Well, are we forgetting?
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:57.320]  Or what the hell's going on here? Jeff in Canada. I normally wouldn't be taking calls from Canada,
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:00.520]  but you snuck in, Jeff. What does Trump need to do to keep America great?
[1:41:01.880 --> 1:41:07.080]  Oh, and there's a great biblical analogy here of David and Goliath. What Trump needs to do
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:13.800]  in light of the scenario, what happened where there's two armies facing off and there's a giant
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:20.600]  that's been mocking and mocking for days. He gets the word of the Lord goes out and he cuts
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:24.920]  the giant's head off. That's what Trump needs to do politically is cut the giant's head off.
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:29.560]  Everybody else turns tail and run and that sparks and motivation. Yeah, but Jeff,
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:35.080]  that means someone has to go to jail. I know. Clinton needs to go to jail. Obama needs to
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:41.720]  go to jail. Comey needs to go to jail. Brennan, Clapper, McCabe, stroke. We have the list.
[1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:47.480]  Took out the champion. And when the champion's taken out, everybody else is filled with fear
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:52.200]  on the other side. He needs to go after the top brass and bank. Do they look like they're filled
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:56.600]  with fear, Jeff? They just put Manafort for seven and a half. They're trying to get stone.
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:42:01.400]  Epstein walks free. Podesta walks free. Clinton walks free. Comey walks free. Do they seem like
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:05.880]  they're in fear? They're not in fear because Trump's not taken off the head. He needs to take
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:12.760]  off the head leadership that is doing the mocking. And to me, there's no hope. If he doesn't do that,
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:17.000]  he's done. Here's another thing, too, to go back to the last caller. Thanks, Jeff. Because you
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:22.360]  have to understand that the enemy of the United States of America, the enemy of humanity, will
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:29.160]  do anything to try to destroy freedom and the free market in the West, and including introducing
[1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:34.600]  Islam into the West. And so that's what they're doing. That's really what it's about. It's about
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:39.640]  introducing Islam into the West, starting all this infighting, starting all this having the whole
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:44.440]  Jew versus Muslim now in the West, too. So we'll have to deal with that. It's all about destroying
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:49.960]  freedom and free markets in the West. That's what it's all about. I'm not anti-Muslim. I'm not anti-Islam.
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:55.560]  I'm pro-freedom in the West. I'm anti-destroy freedom in the West. And that's what they're doing on every front.
[1:42:57.240 --> 1:43:01.000]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners. This was going to
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:04.520]  be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore. It's been a year and a half
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:09.800]  site, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic item in

[1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:04.120]  at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now.
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:09.960]  Now I can be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:13.800]  teach them what I've learned. Not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your word's going
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:17.800]  forever, but now they're using better, getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:24.120]  easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it? But I have
[1:44:24.120 --> 1:44:29.560]  joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long as I realize I've done
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:33.800]  right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you
[1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:39.480]  bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.760]  then takes place that transcends space and time. When you commit the award of mouth or to pray for
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:50.200]  us or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please

[1:47:14.760 --> 1:47:33.320]  I'm the seeker. Seeking a brave president, a man reelected to drain the swamp. We're seeking results.
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:40.600]  We're seeking them now. We're taking your calls. What must President Trump do to keep
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:46.520]  America great? I'm giving you 60 seconds. Let's go to David in Florida. You're on the Alex Jones
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:52.280]  show. Go ahead, David. Thank you so much, Owen. I just wanted to mention Founding Father John Jay
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:57.320]  and how brilliant he actually was. He was the, if I recall correctly, the first Chief Justice of
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:02.920]  the New York Supreme Court while he served as president of the Constitution. For Trump to
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:07.240]  make America great, he can condense the intelligence agencies because there's way too many of them.
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:12.920]  They invite, they suck off the country's money. They lie us into war. They lie us into war. They
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:18.200]  do tons of stuff. So you basically make one intelligence agency and instead of firing all
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:24.120]  the good people that work there, you go back to John Jay. He was originally head of the New
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:30.440]  York committee to detect and defeat conspiracies. The Founding Fathers knew that conspiracies were
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:37.880]  the main step to this country. The department like that go after it, actually put them in jail. Well,
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:43.240]  and he has at least members of Congress that are willing to go with him in this fight. But
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:49.640]  I think that the Justice Department is where he's lacking in soldiers, if you will. Thanks for the
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:54.680]  call, David. Let's go to Ed in Maryland. What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:49:02.360]  Hey, Owen, great to talk to you again, brother. Build the wall, deport them all. Just like a lot
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:09.160]  of you, I was disgusted by the CPAC speech. If our disease is that we're hemorrhaging jobs,
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:14.840]  then we don't need to be importing people here. We don't need them. I'm sorry to say.
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:18.520]  Well, look. We can figure something out for the ones who are still here,
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:26.120]  but this H1B or whatever the heck they're called visas, we don't need them. All I see here in
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:32.920]  Maryland, I see we're importing a bunch of people to work at hotels and to do landscaping and construction.
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:37.160]  Well, illegal immigration
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:45.560]  is the problem here. And it's more than 20 million people are here illegally.
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:53.320]  They suck off our system. They corrupt our system. And it's so bad they won't even allow you to put
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:50:01.560]  on a 2020 census. Are you a citizen or not? I mean, what the hell is that? So look, I actually
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:06.520]  am in agreement with you. I'd shut immigration down for five to 10 years until you can figure this
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:12.120]  out because it is a real problem when you have all these noncitizens here and it's just totally
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:20.280]  jacked the system up entirely. I mean, so even to some extent, I understand amnesty deals and
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:26.040]  HB1 visas and all of this stuff. But we're not even like trying to solve the problem. You've got
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:31.080]  20 million people here illegally. They continue to cross the border illegally every day. And we're
[1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:37.080]  just kind of like spinning our heads like, oh, what are we doing? It's happening. I mean, look
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:43.480]  at these stories I got here today. I mean, I could do a I could do stacks of these every day.
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:47.320]  Man accused of sexual assault is illegal immigrant. I mean, these stories
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:55.480]  literally happen every day. But but how about this? Yuma sector border patrol apprehends nearly
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:51:03.240]  750 illegal aliens over the weekend in one weekend at one stop 750 Rio Grande Valley sector
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:10.680]  apprehends nearly 7000 illegal aliens in one week. Support for Donald Trump dwindles among
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:15.160]  ICE officers. Yeah, because it keeps getting worse. The illegal immigration issue keeps getting
[1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:21.080]  worse under the president that said he would stop it. So yeah, if you come across the border
[1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:26.200]  illegally, we're sorry, we're sorry you're sick. We're sorry your country sucks. We're sorry you're
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:31.240]  pregnant. We sorry you got two kids. We're sorry some Mexican raped one the way up here. It's not
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:38.280]  our problem. Chris in Georgia. What does the president need to do to keep America great?
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:44.680]  What do all these people have in common? They're all satanic. They're all part of the
[1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:50.040]  church of Satan. They need to declare a terrorist organization, but then stop terrorizing us,
[1:51:50.040 --> 1:51:55.400]  killing them. What happened to Trump telling Alex, I'll never let you down. And look what he's
[1:51:55.400 --> 1:52:00.520]  doing now is letting America down, playing free speech down. I mean, that's the core of our values
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:08.440]  right there. Anything else? No, that's it. I thought you made a great point earlier, though,
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:15.240]  about him saying just be good and look at him during the campaign trail, you know, how does
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:19.320]  that work for him? Yeah, exactly. Remember, they told you, President Trump, just be good.
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:23.880]  Just toe the line, President Trump. We won't be so mean to you. Maybe we'll let you win the
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:27.320]  nomination and he didn't do it. And he won. Exactly. Thank you for the call, Chris. And you know,
[1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:33.720]  I got other people sending me messages. President Trump needs to go after big pharma
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:40.840]  at a really root level, go after the vaccine makers, billions of dollars of settled cases
[1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:46.840]  from vaccine damage, go after the eugenics program, go after the population control,
[1:52:46.840 --> 1:52:52.680]  blow that up. That'll wake some people up. All right, let's go to Charlie in New York.
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:59.640]  What must President Trump do to keep America great? Hi, Ellen. Thanks for taking me. I'm just as
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:06.280]  angry and frustrated as you. I'll try and cram this in as fast as I can in 60 seconds.
[1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:10.920]  It's against the money. The first thing you've got to do is get rid of George Soros, throw him
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:16.840]  out of the country without the money. People are going to lose their funding for battle.
[1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:21.720]  The second thing you've got to do is toss out the UN, set them up in Germany or get rid of them.
[1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:27.080]  They're nothing for us. The third thing you've got to do is round up all the obvious criminals
[1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:32.440]  from the Obama administration. We all know who they are. We know all the crimes. We've got all
[1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:38.760]  the evidence. Put them in the military tribunal. Get my words open. The next thing you've got to do
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:44.760]  is go ahead and build that wall and keep all these sick people from coming up here.
[1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:49.720]  That's why we need the vaccines right now is because all these maybe even diseases
[1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:54.040]  are coming back into the United States. But if you cut off the money, that is the head
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:59.080]  of the giant. Without the funding, the Democrats have got no money to put up the opposition.
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:05.400]  And they have no money to fund these radical groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center
[1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:10.040]  and everybody else who's making our lives miserable. Day to day, I see all these things
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:15.560]  happening. And the problem with the universities did not start at the university. During the
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:20.040]  Obama administration, it started in the lower school, common core.
[1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:24.120]  There's hundreds, but hold on, Charlie. First of all, great call. Thank you for the call.
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:29.160]  The Port Soros military tribunals for the criminals build the wall. But on the college issue,
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:35.400]  I mean, yeah, the liberalization, the socialism that they are trying to, the communism that
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:39.000]  they're trying to teach in schools. I mean, yeah, that's one thing. You go look at the
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:45.560]  endowment funds in the Ivy League schools. I mean, it's unbelievable. We're talking about hundreds of
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:53.240]  billions of dollars, shut them all down, put the endowment funds towards the student loan debt crisis.
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:59.720]  So you can relieve some of that, that this scandal, this big college racket stole from
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:03.800]  the future of this country. Because think about it, what are you going to do? You get out of
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:09.320]  college, got a hundred thousand dollars worth of debt, or it would be in 20 years when one every,
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:13.560]  when, when every other kid has autism because of the vaccines. I mean, that's what they want.
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:17.480]  And then it's just game over because no, there are no men, there are no women, there are no
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:21.480]  anything and post-birth abortion is real. I mean, that's where it's all going. Yeah,
[1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:28.360]  there's all your endowment funds right there. Shut them all down, take the endowment money,
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:36.200]  relieve the student loan debt, do an investigation. I just wonder if there's anyone in this country
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:40.200]  that's willing to do it anymore. I mean, it's just pathetic. Let's go to Mike in Michigan.
[1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:42.840]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great? Go ahead, Mike.
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:48.120]  Oh, hey, I've been listening to you guys for about the last year and a half or so. But
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:56.680]  what he needs to do is get cut to the chase. Just take these people and, you know, the ones that
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:03.160]  committed treason and have them put to death. Pure plain and simple. He's got, he's got mountain
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:09.480]  loads of evidence from here to hell and back. Why isn't he doing anything about it? I don't get it.
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:18.120]  The only theory, again, and I'm not, I'm not a, a, a, a cue believer per se. It intrigues me.
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:25.480]  I, I, I mean, I'm not into hope porn, but if you are of that belief, and, and this is a legitimate
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:29.720]  thing, I'm not saying this because Q said, I'm saying it's legitimate to say, well, the country's
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:35.000]  not ready. You want to avoid civil unrest. Now I don't think it matters. I don't think there's,
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.160]  I don't think there's a group of Clinton supporters or Obama supporters. I mean, there's
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:43.560]  definitely not a group of Comey supporters, McCabe supporters, Brennan supporters that are
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:49.560]  taken to the street. I mean, maybe Obama, maybe Obama supporters take to the street if he gets
[1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:55.480]  arrested, but other than that, I don't see these people doing jack crap. But I, I understand where
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:57:00.840]  you could say, okay, at a philosophical level, the timing has to be right. The rollout has to
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:05.400]  be right. We don't want to incite more violence and we don't want to incite a civil war. But
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:09.080]  justice be done, may the heavens fall. If we don't take these people out of power, if we
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:13.480]  don't put these people in jail, it won't even matter. I mean, Trump, he's basically working
[1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:19.320]  alone, it feels like. So it's like, so do everything alone. Thanks for the call, Mike. All right.
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:24.680]  We're going to take your calls for one more segment on the other side of this break. Then
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:28.360]  Caitlin Bennett is going to join me. You won't believe what happened to her. She went to a mall,
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:33.000]  she was stalked, a woman was following her around taking pictures, and then Caitlin Bennett got
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:39.640]  kicked out of the mall for being stalked and harassed. Don't you just love America these days,
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:45.240]  where the radical left will kick you out of a bar, beat you up if you wear a trumpet? Oh,
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:52.280]  it's so loving and tolerant. Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[1:57:53.320 --> 1:57:58.280]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:02.440]  We took on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a nationalist in.
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:06.840]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We are winning.
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:12.440]  But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:18.120]  attack. So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:23.160]  This is about who wants it most, and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors,
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:27.480]  they've taken everything. I am in your hands. You are in my hands. I need financial support,
[1:58:27.480 --> 1:58:32.120]  and I got products you and your family need. It's that simple. Thousands of great products,

[1:58:57.560 --> 1:59:03.880]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world
[1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:10.440]  is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:15.240]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours
[1:59:15.240 --> 1:59:19.560]  and have terrible side effects. We have developed, hands down from our research,
[1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:25.320]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout, and beyond system in the world.
[1:59:26.040 --> 1:59:31.480]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer. It comes in easy
[1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:36.040]  to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though,
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:40.280]  it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half pack at the first time you take it
[1:59:40.280 --> 1:59:45.880]  because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive. TurboForce
[1:59:45.880 --> 2:00:14.600]  and enforcelife.com. Well, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones has boarded a Boeing 737 MAX 8.
[2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:24.600]  Now, I'm no engineering expert, I'm no aviation expert, but I can read
[2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:30.680]  and I have actually been told by people that work at, I'm not allowed to say,
[2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:37.240]  certain airlines where they are now specifically looking at pilots in other such positions just
[2:00:37.240 --> 2:00:42.440]  by the color of their skin. So, you know, when you're up in the air and, you know, your plane is
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:50.200]  going down, you're asking yourself, what color is the pilot's skin? I mean, that's my response.
[2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:54.440]  I want to know what color the pilot's skin is when my plane is about to crash, not, you know,
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:59.880]  how good the pilot is. But President Trump put this out, airplanes are becoming far too complex
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:04.680]  to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:10.120]  time in many products, always seeking to go one unnecessary step further when often old
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:15.240]  and simpler is far better split second decisions and he goes on. But basically, the story is like,
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:20.120]  it's not even a pilot flying the plane anymore, it's computers. And it turns out,
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:27.640]  go figure, several Boeing 737 MAX 8 pilots in the United States complained about suspected
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:35.880]  safety flaw, literally dozens of reports including, quote, inadequate and almost criminally insufficient
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:43.080]  were amongst some of the complaints from pilots, unconscionable that they were allowed to fly these.
[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:49.160]  But see, again, it's all about control. It's all about centralization. It's not about the human
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:52.840]  being in control. It's all about the computer being in control.
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:02:02.600]  We're taking your calls. What must President Trump do to keep America great as Alex boards
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:09.320]  the 737 MAX 8, which has been grounded in many countries and pilots have already said is criminally
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:14.680]  insufficient, almost criminally insufficient. So what's going to happen is another one going to
[2:02:14.680 --> 2:02:20.280]  fall out of the sky as we give the world over to computers and AI and end humanity.
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:26.440]  In the meantime, though, what must President Trump do to keep America great?
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:29.720]  Let's go to Bob in New York City. Go ahead, Bob.
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:33.000]  Hey, how are you?
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:34.520]  Good. Thanks for calling.
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:39.320]  Nice to meet you, man. He's got a slam dunk.
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:46.120]  Open up investigation to the Clinton Foundation, $20 billion, more like it.
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:51.160]  And he's done support the First Amendment. That is it.
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:55.640]  You know, my thing with the Clintons is I think that the swamp
[2:02:55.640 --> 2:03:01.160]  is afraid of the Clinton investigation being investigated because it's so ingrained in all
[2:03:01.160 --> 2:03:07.960]  swamp activity and all these DC establishment terrarisms. It's just like if you've been in DC,
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:12.600]  you probably have some corrupt nonsense in your closet. So you don't want whatever the
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:16.680]  Clintons have been doing to be exposed because ultimately it might blow back on you. But you're
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:22.600]  right. I mean, launch an investigation in the Clinton Foundation like you did Russian collusion
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:27.000]  and you'll have such a swath of criminal behavior. It's unbelievable. Thanks, Bob.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:30.600]  Let's go to Philip in Indiana. What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:37.960]  Well, we're at a point where it's kind of precarious, I believe. The thing I'm
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:45.720]  seeing is that he needs to address Obama for the crimes that they'll find that he's done.
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:53.320]  Yeah. I mean, we got it today right out of Obama's mouth. Let Hillary Clinton go.
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:58.280]  Yeah. But the thing is, is there's somebody else who's saying prior, the mocking head,
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:04.440]  the Goliath. If you take out, I believe that that's what a lot of the leftism that they're
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:10.760]  hedged their bets on is that nobody's going to mess with Obama because if they do, they could
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:16.120]  start a race war. They could start racial tension. Even though Obama is white. Every major city in
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  this country, they had war and civil unrest. And so that's the precarious position I believe
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:28.760]  that the president's in. That he's got that situation where if he decides to go that direction,
[2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:34.120]  he's got that potential. And so it's like, you know, when you're in that kind of a position,
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:46.120]  it's like, okay, when to pull the trigger? Well, I mean, it's all, I mean, it's literally on record.
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:51.560]  Obama said, let Hillary go. And then James Comey lied about it under oath. I mean, it's,
[2:04:52.760 --> 2:04:57.320]  so yeah, what is the president waiting for? I've got some really good news.
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:05.880]  So X2 is back. The original X2 deep breath crystal pure atomic iodine what you want in
[2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:11.800]  four store.com. It'll be here in a week manufactured in the US in four store.com with the best iodine
[2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:15.960]  in the world X2. It's available. I thought X3 is great. We still got another deep breath
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:20.120]  crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine. The scientists said do that.
[2:05:20.120 --> 2:05:25.000]  It's sold a lot that people want original X2. Like I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2,
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:31.160]  but it came through about a month ago. We now have X2 again and in four store.com. So hallelujah,
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:36.200]  it's been sold out for about almost three months. But we have now had the same company,
[2:05:36.200 --> 2:05:43.400]  the original X2 develop it again. And we were able to do the exact same formula.
[2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:48.040]  Want to preorder X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy,
[2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:51.640]  learn about IQ is dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other items are bound.
[2:05:51.640 --> 2:05:55.960]  Get here today at m4warstore.com or m4warslife.com.
[2:06:04.280 --> 2:06:12.520]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:23.000]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. I just remembered a realization I had last night.
[2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:30.280]  Hillary Clinton is one of the most hated people in world history.
[2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:37.640]  And even in America right now, she's one of the most hated people in America.
[2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:47.800]  And you can see this for yourself, folks. The Democrats don't want her.
[2:06:47.800 --> 2:06:54.200]  The Democrat base is sick of her. I mean, she is truly one of the most scorned and hated people
[2:06:54.200 --> 2:06:58.840]  in America today. And imagine she was almost the president. They almost forced her into office,
[2:06:58.840 --> 2:07:04.360]  stole it from Bernie, stole a bunch of votes, had a bunch of illegal votes and almost robbed the
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:15.080]  entire election process. And so there is such an easy slam dunk. The ball is literally floating in
[2:07:15.080 --> 2:07:23.880]  midair, two inches from the rim. There's a trampoline under the net. The whole crowd is cheering
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:28.120]  dunk, dunk, and the president is just sitting there eating popcorn.
[2:07:28.120 --> 2:07:36.600]  Put Hillary Clinton in jail and your approval rating goes up 10 points overnight.
[2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:45.240]  Put Hillary Clinton in jail and the morale in this country skyrockets. And we finally
[2:07:45.240 --> 2:07:51.640]  have hope in something that there may be real justice. President, you're letting your friends,
[2:07:51.640 --> 2:07:58.680]  colleagues and associates go to jail for nothing. And you're going to let Hillary Clinton walk one
[2:07:58.680 --> 2:08:13.000]  of the most treasonous scum in this world's history. Unbelievable. Why President Trump?
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:19.800]  Why President Trump have you not put her in jail? Why is there no one in this country that is willing
[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:28.280]  to put that bitch in jail? Maybe it's from the Clinton body count. It's just a coincidence that
[2:08:28.280 --> 2:08:39.160]  nearly 100 Clinton associates are dead, suicided, Seth Rich, Barrington Wisonant,
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:45.160]  Sean Lucas. Oh, and that was just after she lost the 2016 election. Those were just deaths after
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:50.840]  she lost the 2016 election. That was just a little bloodshed because Hillary lost just in anger.
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:58.120]  Just murder. Oh, but that's just a coincidence. I'm sorry. The Clinton body count is fake news.
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:03.160]  There's nothing to see here. Oh, the Clintons did nothing in Haiti. They're totally innocent.
[2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:07.480]  Laura Sillsby, there's nothing to see here. Hillary didn't laugh at all the bloodshed and
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:12.280]  death and murder and destruction in Libya. Oh, I'm so sorry, Hillary. Oh, you're the best,
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:16.520]  Hillary. Oh, I wish you were the President, Hillary. The Clinton body counts fake news.
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:26.120]  John Ash. This just goes on and on. Clinton, old chefs, like landscapers even. I mean,
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:31.480]  like anybody who had it. How about the young boys in Mina, Arkansas? I mean, it's just unbelievable
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:37.000]  these people. Oh, my President Trump, please just, could you at least just, you know what? I don't
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:40.520]  even care anymore, President Trump. Just, you know what? Just bend us over and screw us on
[2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:46.600]  everything else. Fine. Screw us. Have an open border. Screw us. Let social media censor.
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:50.520]  Screw us. Let the swamp drain you. Just, just screw America, President Trump. Fine. I don't
[2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:54.040]  care. President Trump, just screw America. Do what you gotta do. Just at least put Hillary in
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:10:05.160]  jail, please. Could you at least do that? Oh, we're asking people what does President Trump
[2:10:05.160 --> 2:10:08.360]  need to do to keep America? By the way, Kayla Bennett was supposed to join us. She's gonna
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:14.440]  be unable to join us. She's dealing with a personal matter. So let's go to Patrick in Texas. What
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:21.880]  must President Trump do to keep America great? Hey, Owen. Hey. You know, I, it's, I think people
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:26.280]  are forgetting it's not just what President Trump needs to do. It's what we need to do. We need to
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:31.400]  keep supporting him. He's a modern day King David and he's surrounded, surrounded with deep state.
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:36.200]  Yeah, but Patrick, you gotta understand something here. Patrick, Patrick, now you gotta understand
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:42.920]  something here, my friend. I, I do so much to support this president. I've been banned off of
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:48.600]  Facebook and YouTube. I go out in the streets and face the hate mobs in a Trump hat to stand
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:53.000]  up for President Trump. I go to the Trump protest to destroy all the arguments against
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:57.800]  President Trump. I go on there three hours a day to stand up for President Trump in America. Okay.
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:05.320]  So I understand where you're coming from. Yeah, America needs to act, but I'm sitting here acting
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:09.960]  every damn day. I go to city council. I'm organizing people on behind the scenes, helping
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:15.000]  people organize and work on other projects. And I'm doing all this crap and I'm just waiting for
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:20.760]  the president to have my back, man. That's all. I mean, can I get anything? Okay. The jobs numbers
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:25.800]  are great. Yes. Finally, we have a president that wants to put America first. It's great. That's
[2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:31.320]  one level of things that he needs to do. But it's like, I'm telling you, man, people are going to
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:35.400]  get sick of standing up for this president. If he doesn't start standing up for them, I'm just telling
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:38.600]  it like it is. Thanks for the call, Patrick. Let's go to Brian and Michigan. What must President
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:43.320]  Trump do to keep America great? Go ahead, Brian. Yeah. First, I want to thank you, Owen, for all
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:49.240]  your hard work. It shows. We all see it. The thing that has freaked me out for a long time now is
[2:11:49.240 --> 2:11:56.680]  when I learned of the repealing of the Smith-Mont Act with one of the Redoos of the Patriot Act.
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:01.720]  And to my knowledge, I'm not the most studied up on this stuff, but it's my knowledge that made
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:06.360]  it legal for our government to target the American people for propaganda campaign.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:10.600]  You know, so if you start- Oh, I mean, that's just one thing, Brian. I mean,
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:18.360]  Obama passed legislation in 2016. What was that big omnibus spending bill? I think it was,
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:22.760]  he wrote into it. They're going to be fun. They literally said we're funding propaganda in the
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:26.520]  United States. And they already did. It all came out in the Frank Church hearings. It all came
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:33.640]  out in the declassification of the JFK files, Project Mockingbird. I mean, the CIA has embeds in
[2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:41.000]  all television news, radio news, the Washington Post, New York Times. They're embedded everywhere.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:47.720]  That's all public information. And Obama just made it legal. There it is. Here it is. Obama signs
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:53.640]  the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act right there, 2016. Bam. And it'll be interesting
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:58.120]  to see what happens with this Covington case because you could see this turnaround where
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:02.360]  they don't have to pay anything because what they did, because of this repealing of that act,
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:06.920]  completely legal. You know, that's an interesting point. And then on top of that,
[2:13:07.480 --> 2:13:13.080]  Jesse Smollett's case could be that too. Oh, God. Because his court, his, the lawyers are saying
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:17.800]  there's no case against him. So yeah, maybe it's the same thing. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:24.200]  So what if, what if they investigate Jesse Smollett and they find out that he was actually being
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:29.320]  run by, let's say Kamala Harris or Barack Obama? Oh, and then they say, oh, no, no, Obama says,
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:34.200]  look, I signed this legislation. It's legal for me to do it. So yeah, it's legal for us to stage
[2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:39.080]  hate crimes and blame Trump supporters. Obama signed it into law. Well, look, Democrats are
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:44.680]  signing it into law that you can break a newborn baby's neck. That doesn't make it right. And it
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:48.200]  definitely doesn't make it legal. I'm sorry. You can sign in there. You can sign any bill and claim
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:51.720]  it's legal. This is a republic. You're murdering infants. You're going straight to hell, but you
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:55.960]  ought to maybe, you know, Gavin Newsom says they're ending the death penalty. But anyway,
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:00.280]  let's go to Richard in Minnesota. What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:05.800]  Well, first of all, I just want to tell you that you're focusing too much on old news Hillary
[2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:10.440]  Clinton. The real first lady you got to worry about the real threat to Trump in America is
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:16.280]  Michelle Obama. Because when she announces, she's a shoe-in friend, and she'll take that
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:22.520]  fake Mexican Beto O'Rourke to be your running mate. And then we're in real trouble. But I just want
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:29.480]  to say on my original topic, what makes America great again, all the sanctuary city mayors and
[2:14:29.480 --> 2:14:36.280]  governors and whoever else who are giving a giant middle finger to America saying,
[2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:41.720]  we don't like your immigration laws and we don't like what Trump says. They need to be arrested.
[2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:48.360]  Well, it's literally illegal. I've broken down the U.S. code. They do belong in jail with fines.
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:53.640]  Yes, absolutely. And in the cities, I had a store today, a legal immigrant, charged of,
[2:14:54.840 --> 2:15:01.640]  I don't even know where it was. I put it away. But if you are a politician that helped
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:09.080]  make your city or whatever state a sanctuary city or state, and then a non-citizen murder
[2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:15.560]  someone in your sanctuary city or state, you are now liable to face life in jail. That's the U.S.
[2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:20.520]  code. That's the law. I've broke that down. Absolutely, Richard. Let's go to Kevin. You
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:23.800]  know what? We're out of time here in this segment. We'll come back with Kevin. Folks,
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:27.240]  please go to infowarsstore.com. I've barely even plugged today. We need your support. We're being
[2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:31.080]  censored off all platforms. Eventually, they'll probably erase anybody who ever steps foot in
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:34.680]  this building off social media because the president already said he's not going to do anything about
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:40.520]  it. So that's nice. So the president has now empowered social media to just erase every conservative.
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:44.440]  Thanks, President Trump. It's so great to have your back through all this censorship
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:47.960]  that we get censored for having your back. But we'll still do it because we're the winter

[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:59.480]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[2:16:59.480 --> 2:17:04.760]  mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:08.760]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems

[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:32.680]  book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:39.320]  against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:45.560]  broken. Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:52.600]  fight for? The deep state began with World War One. The United States of Empire by James Dunn

[2:19:52.360 --> 2:20:01.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:33.800]  Yeah, it stays like these where I totally understand why Americans just want to
[2:20:34.600 --> 2:20:41.320]  go to a ball game, drink cold beer, eat a hot dog, hang out at the bar for a drink afterwards,
[2:20:41.320 --> 2:20:46.680]  just go home and just not even think about any of it. But won't be long, you won't even be able
[2:20:46.680 --> 2:20:52.760]  to do that because there'll be no infrastructure, there'll be no economy, there'll be no commerce,
[2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:59.800]  there'll be no commute. But who cares, right? It'll all just magically work itself out. You
[2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:05.320]  just got to be really good. By the way, there's this viral clip going around of Bernie Sanders
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:21.960]  using the N-word. It's almost as racist as you could use it. It's not like he's using it as a
[2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:34.040]  total insult. I don't even know if I want to play it. It's the same thing today where Alex and I are
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:41.320]  on the same wavelength and we're both just really upset at the president right now for cow-toeing
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:50.920]  to social media censorship when he says, you fight it by just being good. Well, President Trump,
[2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:56.440]  that's what they told you when you were running for president. Did you just decide to just be good?
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:22:05.880]  Is that how you won? No, you win by maintaining the fight. Free speech wins, President Trump,
[2:22:05.880 --> 2:22:16.760]  not being good. But you know what? Cold beer in a ballgame sounds a lot more fun than fighting
[2:22:16.760 --> 2:22:22.520]  tyranny, doesn't it? It wants to shove a vaccine in your newborn's arm, that is, if they don't
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:31.240]  snap its neck instead. Because it's all good. Pro-choice kill your kid, but pro-choice to have
[2:22:31.240 --> 2:22:35.880]  a vaccine? No. All right, we're taking your calls. We've been doing it for over an hour now.
[2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:41.800]  What must President Trump do to keep America great? Kevin and San Diego, go ahead.
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:48.200]  Hey, Owen. Yeah, we got to keep the Christian values going in our country, but we need to end
[2:22:48.200 --> 2:22:54.040]  the Fed, reestablish the gold and silver standard, and tell Trump to stay away from Dealey Plaza,
[2:22:54.760 --> 2:22:59.640]  and then also end voter fraud. I think we get these things going. We're going to have some
[2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:04.360]  big changes. Have you seen the president giving you any signs that he's going to do any of that?
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:09.640]  A little bit, actually. I mean, we got things happening actually this month,
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:12.840]  and end of the month, where he's talking about it, but talk is cheap.
[2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:25.400]  Well, exactly. And they did send Steve Munchin to Fort Knox back in February of 2017, and he
[2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:32.760]  claimed, oh, all the gold is still there. Yeah, we got to get these bankers who have
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:38.040]  defrauded us over the last 100 years, and just go ahead and take their gold like they do with
[2:23:38.040 --> 2:23:42.840]  all the other countries, and put them in Fort Knox. It's all in the petrodollar now, thanks for the
[2:23:42.840 --> 2:23:52.520]  call, Kevin. But wasn't it, I believe it was the Texas state government in 2016 or 15, maybe in
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:24:01.480]  15, that requested gold from the Federal Reserve, like, I guess it was like there, the gold or
[2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:05.320]  whatever that they had the rights to, and so they requested it from Fort Knox, and they were just
[2:24:05.320 --> 2:24:10.440]  shut down. They're like, nope, you don't get the gold. And the story was kind of like, oh, is there
[2:24:10.440 --> 2:24:18.440]  any gold even there? But of course, the entire US currency, the Federal Reserve note is all fiat
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:24.120]  currency. The Federal Reserve, excuse me, the fractional reserve banking system is literally
[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:30.600]  printing money out of thin air. I mean, literally, folks, you can read the manifesto. It's like,
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:37.000]  you want to know why we're really in debt, because our currency is debt. Anyway, let's go to Hal in
[2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:42.440]  Florida, who's upset with today's show. Go ahead, Hal, what does President Trump need to do to keep
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:47.560]  America great again, or whatever you're so upset about? No, I'm not upset, but I think there might
[2:24:47.560 --> 2:24:52.120]  be misunderstanding. I don't think you're using the Trump translator correctly, and it's just possible
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:58.040]  that you're not. But think about this. How do you beat Allen, Allen Iverson in one-on-one? You've
[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:05.560]  got to, you've got to be good. You've just got to be really good. And I think what Trump is saying
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:11.960]  is not that you have to be good and bow to the censorship. I'm thinking that he's saying
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:17.240]  you have to be good to be able to beat this censorship. I mean, look at all the things that
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:21.240]  are going on in the background. Okay, okay. So you're saying, okay, hold on, hold on, let's actually
[2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:25.400]  bear down on this. I understand what you're saying. You're saying, President Trump is saying, like,
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:30.840]  oh, you have to be on your best behavior. You have to kind of do and go along with what they're
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:36.520]  demanding. They're saying you just have to be effective. You have to be effective and focused
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:42.360]  in your approach. I'm saying he's got a plan and he's doing stuff, just like what's happening,
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:46.200]  you know, with this college scandal. Things are happening in the background, and he's coming at
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:51.960]  him, but we don't know all the ifs, thens that he's dealing with. So his game might be on. And he's
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:57.160]  saying, you just got to be good. Like, you know, trust, trust, you know, I'm there. But don't you
[2:25:57.160 --> 2:26:04.120]  get the feeling, I get the feeling how that he's more concerned about Washington DC having his back
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:08.200]  and not the American people having his back. Like, for example, arresting Hillary Clinton,
[2:26:08.200 --> 2:26:11.960]  Washington DC wouldn't have his back on him. The American people would have his back.
[2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:17.960]  Absolutely. And that's, I think we need to have his back. You know, like your last car,
[2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:21.880]  one of your last cars, just saying, you know, I think that might have been what he was talking
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:26.440]  about too. Like, if you listen to the way Trump has talked, since he's been running,
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:31.160]  he'll lay those kind of things out there like that, where it's like, wait a minute,
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:35.560]  you know, president, what are you saying there? And it usually comes back. I mean,
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:39.320]  if you wait, you know, and you give it a few days, it usually comes back around.
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:43.160]  Well, I agree with you, Hal. I do agree with you. I do agree with you, Hal. And I've said
[2:26:43.160 --> 2:26:46.920]  60 seconds, I gave you more than that. So I appreciate your call. It was a good call, fair
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:51.880]  points. And I kind of understand what you're saying. It's like, you know, the NFL is rigged,
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:56.600]  you know, the NBA is rigged, the sports are rigged, you know, but you still go out there,
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:00.520]  I guess you do your best or you do good or you do really good and you hope that you can beat the rig
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:06.120]  system. But wouldn't you rather just have a fair fight? You know, I don't know. Let's go to Laurie
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:11.960]  in Alaska. Laurie, what must President Trump do to keep America great?
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:19.480]  Hey, Owen, it pains me to say what I'm about to say, but I believe it to be so. I believe that he's
[2:27:19.480 --> 2:27:25.960]  going to have to declare a hard martial law. And I say that because we lost this republic
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:32.280]  under martial law, under Lincoln. You see Thomas DeLorenzo, Judge Andrew Napolitano,
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:37.960]  and with all these hyenas, nipping it as heels, trying to interfere with everything he's trying
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:43.080]  to do, he's going to be lame duck if he doesn't. So it pains me to say so, but I think he's going
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:47.720]  to have to do that where he can stop this and get done what needs to get done. Well, thanks for
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:53.960]  the call, Laurie. I disagree with you on your, your declare the declaration of martial law,
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:59.880]  but I agree with your sentiment that it has to be extreme action. Yes, extreme action must be
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:03.720]  taken because we're in extreme danger. Absolutely. And that's why we were elected Trump. That's why
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:08.520]  Trump won. I mean, he said it himself said, the only way I'm going to run is I'd look at this
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:13.160]  country and it's an extreme danger. Well, that's where we're at right now. And isn't it funny
[2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:19.160]  where people like Cortez will sit here and say that the president is an authoritarian? Again,
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:29.080]  based on principle, I would never call for that, but in a devil worldly way, I kind of wish he
[2:28:29.080 --> 2:28:33.800]  wasn't authoritarian because that might be the only thing that would actually get this corruption
[2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:39.560]  out of this country, get this big fat monkey off of our back. All right, folks, we're going to
[2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:43.000]  a break. We're going to keep taking your calls. What must President Trump do to keep America great?

[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:05.320]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:10.280]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:15.720]  using prescription drugs. After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened
[2:29:15.720 --> 2:29:21.000]  to take our children away from me. I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:27.080]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested.

[2:32:04.840 --> 2:32:09.000]  cures. I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:13.720]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill? What is the top tumor? It's the best seller
[2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:17.880]  because it's anti-inflammatory. And what's the best lab in the country? Okay, they're the highest
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:22.520]  rated. I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid? Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle,
[2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:27.080]  but that's still incredible, sir. I'm like, what's the hottest you could do a month later?
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:31.880]  90, 95%. No one's ever done it. I said, how much does that cost for a bottle that costs $10?
[2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:37.000]  No one's ever done that, sir. The average competitor is 3 to 5%. The top brand is 50%. I'm
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:41.240]  like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid. I mean, you understand, like, that's like our
[2:32:41.240 --> 2:32:46.200]  information is explosive. Our fish oil, I go out and I get the cleanest, the best. My children
[2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:51.000]  take it. You think I'm going to give you fish oil that didn't the very damn best on my soul?
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:54.440]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers? Never!
[2:33:21.400 --> 2:33:28.840]  There's some developing news happening right now I want to address before I go back to your phone
[2:33:28.840 --> 2:33:35.960]  calls. President Trump has just announced that the United States will ground all Boeing Max 737s
[2:33:36.760 --> 2:33:44.200]  as Alex Jones is on one in air. Does that mean they're going to ground him right out of a flight?
[2:33:44.200 --> 2:33:51.640]  Or does Alex Jones make it back to Austin in perhaps the final flight of a Boeing
[2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:58.520]  Max 8 domestically? Wow. So Trump has just announced that. I'm actually glad to see that
[2:33:59.720 --> 2:34:06.200]  because pilots had been complaining about this aircraft and it's because you can't even be a
[2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:10.840]  pilot and fly it. You have to be a computer expert. That's all the new stuff that they have now. It's
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:15.320]  like you don't even drive your car anymore. You just flip it onto autopilot and take a nap.
[2:34:16.600 --> 2:34:23.880]  So that's developing. But you know, I'll tell you, the dangers of the Boeing Max 8 are nothing
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:31.800]  compared to the dangers of 5G. The story just came to my desk. Does 5G internet really give
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:39.000]  you cancer? Here's what we know and don't know. And basically, yes, it has been declared a potential
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:49.240]  carcinogen to your brain and organs. And it has been linked to cancer and death in rats and birds.
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:55.720]  And you can look where they put the new 5G towers up. If there's trees next to it, the trees die.
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:35:00.440]  So now they're putting fake trees next to 5G cell towers so you don't see the death.
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:10.360]  Oh, oh, and then there was a story in the news. Parents blame elementary school cell tower
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:21.880]  after fourth student designated with cancer. Boy.
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:30.440]  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. Pediatric cancer is just soaring through the roof, but it has nothing
[2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:35.960]  to do with the vaccines. It has nothing to do with the 5G cell towers where now there's a cell
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:42.200]  tower on a school. We've ruined the clip from CBS. Four kids have been diagnosed with cancer
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:57.400]  next to this cell tower. Another developing story is spiraling around Jacob Wool who's
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:03.560]  been on this broadcast. I've interviewed him before. The claim is that he created a Twitter
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:10.440]  account to basically send a message to himself claiming a death threat hate crime,
[2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:16.600]  which was then turned over to Minnesota police. This is all being investigated right now.
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:23.480]  He's denying it. Now, again, if conservatives start faking hate crimes against themselves,
[2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:28.680]  that's not good. I disavow that. We don't need to do that, Jacob. If you want people to create
[2:36:28.680 --> 2:36:32.360]  a hate crime against you, just go out on the street and wear a trump hat. Don't don't fake it,
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:39.640]  but he's denying it. And so, you know, I hope it's not true. Obviously, I don't want to see
[2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:45.800]  fake hate crimes on any side of the aisle, but on a certain level, again, and I don't know Jacob
[2:36:45.800 --> 2:36:53.640]  personally, I mean, I've interviewed him, but if he is telling the truth and Minnesota police do
[2:36:53.640 --> 2:36:56.520]  follow through with the investigation, they find out that he didn't make the account.
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:01.800]  It'll be pretty funny to watch all these lefties. They're saying he did it. Just cry.
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:06.920]  Now, if he did fake it and it was a fake account and he sent the message, then yeah,
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:11.720]  that's bad news. And I mean, we'll report it and I'm not going to avoid it. But I just wanted to
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:14.840]  put that out there because that whole story is going viral right now. He has been a guest on a
[2:37:14.840 --> 2:37:19.080]  show. Jacob, I hope that you're telling the truth, but the investigation and the facts will come out.
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:23.720]  Dude, if you want to have somebody commit a hate crime against you, just walk around the streets
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:28.680]  of New York and a trump hat, bro. A lot easier than faking it if that was the case. Only time
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:35.400]  will tell. There is an investigation going. All right. I'm asking people, what must President
[2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:43.080]  Trump do to keep America great? Let's go to James and Oregon. Go ahead, James.
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:52.920]  Hello. Hi. Hi. Thank you for taking my call. First time caller. I think he needs to keep on
[2:37:52.920 --> 2:38:00.200]  keeping on. The reason I say that we like to point to President Trump and say he didn't do this. He
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:07.480]  didn't build the wall. He doesn't build the wall. He doesn't actually keep the aliens out. We passed
[2:38:07.480 --> 2:38:15.880]  laws. He passes executive orders, signs them, puts them into place, and our judges stop the orders.
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:21.880]  Our Congress people stop the system. So does he need the support from inside the beltway?
[2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:27.400]  He absolutely does, but he needs our support because we're falling down when we accuse him
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:33.400]  of not doing his job because we didn't get what we wanted. James, James, I understand that,
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:38.200]  but you got to understand philosophically, intellectually, I'm running out of gas, man.
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:45.560]  I understand. Me too. I mean, I see you were in a really terrible position, but everything that
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:51.960]  I've heard here with taking the money from so-and-so and giving it to such-and-such and stopping these
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:59.320]  companies and shutting them down, he's not the king. I'm not sure what you're talking about taking
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:04.120]  money. We came by our laws. We can't walk in and shake away his money. But hold on a second. No,
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:10.600]  no, no, but James, now hold on a second. There's actually precedent in the private sector. I mean,
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:15.000]  when companies get away with massive crimes that make all this money, they lose all that money.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:18.840]  They don't get to keep that money. So how come the universities get to keep it when they're involved
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:25.080]  in massive scams? Well, who takes away their money? The IRS? It's not the president.
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:30.520]  Who orders the IRS? Obama used the IRS to target conservatives?
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:36.440]  They have no problems. They have the government behind them.
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:42.600]  It's our president that doesn't have the government behind him.
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:49.880]  So you think the current pace we're on, America will be fine if Trump doesn't win in 2020? No,
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:54.440]  I don't think we're going to be fine. Well, you just said Trump keeps keeping on,
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:58.360]  and that's how we keep a great thing. He has to keep going. It's not just him.
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:05.400]  It's not just the president. He doesn't have the power to do everything that we're demanding
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:10.840]  that he do. He can work on it. He could try to pass laws. He could try to sign bills.
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:18.360]  But if we have judges that we have in our cities standing up to say, no, no, no, he can't do that.
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:23.960]  I'm ruling against it. And we don't do something about standing up against those judges.
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:29.800]  If our representatives in Congress... James, James, you are right. You would, James, you are
[2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:35.800]  definitely right. And I do agree with you. However, the president does have constitutional power to
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:42.520]  do stuff about this. And that's the fact. I mean, he does have constitutional power to do something
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:47.880]  about this, to stop illegal immigration. He could do it. And I know that he needs people's help,
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:52.280]  and I know that it needs us to have his back, but he needs to understand we do have his back
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:57.480]  when he does what's right. When he lets the swamp drain him, that's when we start to lose
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:03.400]  the belief that, hey, he's going to do everything we want him to do. We'll have the president's back.
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:07.160]  He needs to do what's right, even though if it seems it's going beyond his power,
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:12.440]  and the media will say that. He can cite the Constitution, say, this is my presidential duty,
[2:41:13.240 --> 2:41:17.080]  and forget the media that's going to lie about him all day long. They already have.
[2:41:17.080 --> 2:41:21.400]  So forget them. We will have his back just like we did when we went to the polls room.
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:27.560]  Great call, James. Let's go to Cole in California. What do we need to do to keep America great?
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:33.080]  Go ahead, Cole. Well, I think the president needs to regulate these giant social media
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:38.120]  platforms. If he has the power or legislative because they control the narrative, you can
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:43.320]  see the effects on the streets. I live in the bastion of a failed state, a legal immigrant
[2:41:43.320 --> 2:41:49.480]  to everywhere, and it's just a failed class state in California. And look to us as an example of
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:54.920]  liberal politics and what happens when they take power. And because the left controls the narrative,
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:00.040]  you're seeing the effects of it. People are outraged at nothing and bad,
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:04.920]  almond and attacks on anybody with any common sense. By the way, out there in California,
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:08.360]  Governor Newsom just said they're going to get rid of the death penalty.
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:15.720]  Yeah, because he loves life so much. Do abortion next, Governor Newsom. But here's the funny thing,
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:21.080]  I'm not even trying to inject my politics into that. California two years ago voted,
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:28.040]  the people of California voted to keep the death penalty. So Newsom just comes in as a dictate
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:31.560]  and just says we're not going to do that. As far as regulating social media, thanks for the call,
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:37.480]  really, I just say you just launched an investigation into these people and you're
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:41.800]  going to find something. You'll find antitrust violations. I'm sure they're doing something
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:45.240]  with dark money. I mean, they're working with China. I mean, who knows what they're doing,
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:49.000]  launch an investigation into them. That's all you need to do. You'll find something,
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:53.400]  I don't know what it is. Guarantee you find something or you could be like Muller and
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:59.000]  just make something up. It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:04.440]  the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me,
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:09.800]  I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:16.280]  But thanks to Supermail Vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy. There's no way I could
[2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:21.160]  have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:25.720]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:31.560]  to still have the stamina and endurance energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:37.880]  and get exercise that you need for your health. So go to infowarstore.com and get Supermail
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:44.680]  Vitality before it's gone. This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality. So I want you

[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:03.880]  the environment from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers
[2:44:03.880 --> 2:44:09.560]  IQ. It literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:15.720]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed based iodine
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:19.640]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:25.800]  it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and raw UX2 that's been incredible.
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:31.560]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:37.000]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:43.480]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:49.240]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:54.600]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at infowarslife.com.

[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:21.080]  All right, Mike Adams is about to take over the fourth hour. We've been taking your calls,
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:27.800]  but I need to do a news blitz here. By the way, it's being rumored that Twitter
[2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:37.000]  is considering removing the reply numbers from tweets. I think we all know why that is. The
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:44.840]  same reason why Rotten Tomatoes censors its movie reviews. Same reason why YouTube disables comments
[2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:53.000]  and likes. Because the leftists are getting destroyed by the ratio. So it wouldn't be surprised
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  if that happens. And I'm thinking outside the box on this grounding of the Boeing Max 8.
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:05.080]  Most of them are still flying around the world. I understand why President Trump did it. But then
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:10.440]  I started to think outside the box. Because as far as I can tell, they still don't have a cause.
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:18.840]  They still don't know the cause for the Ethiopian airline crash. And so, again, I'm just thinking
[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:22.840]  outside the box and just throwing this out there. I mean, what if there was some sort of sabotage
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:28.360]  involved in that? And that's what this is all about. Boeing is manufactured in America.
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:34.600]  But that's just, I don't know, kind of where my head went outside the box.
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:41.240]  Very important. Alex Jones segment aired in the second hour, folks. Please take that segment
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:44.840]  and upload it to your YouTube channel so we can get that message to President Trump.
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:50.040]  But let me just bear down and do a news blitz here. Representative John Radcliffe,
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:55.480]  Lisa Page confirmed to me under oath that the FBI was ordered by the Obama Department of Justice
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:59.640]  not to consider charging Hillary Clinton for gross negligence in the handling of classified
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:05.480]  information. When will the investigations into that begin? I mean, nobody knew that happened.
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:11.800]  Department of Justice Watchdog refers Andrew McCabe to U.S. Attorney for Criminal Investigation.
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:17.640]  He was involved with trying to keep President Trump out of office and then in the attempts to
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:23.080]  get him removed from office. Watchdog sues for Rod Rosenstein's communications in days leading up
[2:49:23.080 --> 2:49:30.120]  to Mueller's appointment. That, if we get those, that's like game over right there. Representative
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:34.280]  Jim Jordan on Twitter, why did Adam Schiff try to block Congress from learning that the Clinton
[2:49:34.280 --> 2:49:39.080]  campaign paid for the dossier? Well, because Adam Schiff is a corrupt Democrat who had to protect
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:47.560]  the criminals at the top of the Democrat Party to get Trump out of office. So that's why Schiff
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:51.880]  is such a shifty Schiff liar. Also, Jim Jordan on Twitter, why did Adam Schiff say that his
[2:49:51.880 --> 2:49:57.880]  talks with Michael Cohen were limited to inviting him and allying any concerns about threats to
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:03.160]  his family but not mentioning the 14 hours his staff spent prepping Cohen before the hearing?
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:12.600]  Because Adam Schiff is a dirty, dirty liar. Let's just move on here. Cynthia McKinney,
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:18.600]  I believe former Democrat from Georgia. Lindsey Graham on cue comes to the rescue of war and the
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:25.480]  cabal as he visits with BB Netanyahu to steal the Golan Heights from Syria for Genie Energy.
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:33.880]  Cynthia McKinney has always been pointing this out. Here's the story. Lindsey Graham to urge
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:38.920]  President Trump to recognize Golan Heights support Senate resolutions. So yeah, if you want to talk
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:46.600]  about Israel controlling our foreign policy, there's one for you. I'd rather just not get involved.
[2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:52.200]  I'm okay being allies with Israel. I'm okay that Israel exists. I'd like to protect it as a state,
[2:50:52.200 --> 2:50:56.600]  but the expansion and all this military protection and then just
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:06.120]  bolstering more wars off of narratives. I'm not for all of that. Israel accuses PA of trying to
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:11.720]  spark violence, violent religious war on Temple Mount. So the Palestinian Authority is saying,
[2:51:11.720 --> 2:51:17.720]  Israel is doing it framing us. Israel is saying, Palestine is doing it and framing us. Again,
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:20.840]  I just want to keep all that crap out of the West. I just don't want to be involved in it.
[2:51:22.120 --> 2:51:27.160]  Sad story out of Brazil. Two attackers kill eight and themselves at a Brazilian school.
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:34.040]  A shooting happened at a public school in Sao Paulo where eight died. And you know,
[2:51:34.040 --> 2:51:40.280]  Bolsonaro is trying to get a second amendment there for Brazil, which has been written by crime
[2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:48.360]  and drug cartels and the favelas. And so I just have a bad feeling that the bad powers that be in
[2:51:48.360 --> 2:51:54.360]  Brazil are going to start staging attacks and coming after the guns. Oh, but that never happens.
[2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:58.840]  I'm sorry. I forgot that nobody ever stages anything, fakes anything. The media never goes
[2:51:58.840 --> 2:52:05.000]  along with it. How dare I, as they say, they were throwing kids out of incubators, fake news.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  They said, aside, use chemical weapons, fake news. They said that ships were sunk in the
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:16.200]  Gulf of Tonkin. Fake news lies in the war, but you know, don't worry about that. Children among
[2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:21.720]  the 22 killed in Yemen strikes over the 48 hours. Nobody ever reports on this. It's fine.
[2:52:21.720 --> 2:52:29.080]  There's nobody ever reports on the bombings that happen in Yemen almost every day.
[2:52:29.080 --> 2:52:34.200]  Where are people on that? Russia mocks US collusion probe ahead of Mueller's report.
[2:52:34.200 --> 2:52:39.480]  Yeah, the whole Russian collusion probe is a laughing stock around the world. What an embarrassment.
[2:52:40.360 --> 2:52:47.080]  Navy industry partners are under cyber siege by Chinese hackers. Review asserts. Well, let's not
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:54.120]  forget there were those naval ship crashes. Some people blamed the Obama appointee who was running
[2:52:54.120 --> 2:52:59.640]  the Naval Academy, who had never been on a ship before. Others say that Chinese hackers were
[2:52:59.640 --> 2:53:09.080]  involved. Others say the naval crew was negligent. But there you go. Perhaps it was Chinese hackers.
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:18.200]  EU admits giving thousands of prepaid debit cards to migrants. This is from newswars.com.
[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:26.040]  So now the EU is admitting it. Infowars.com told you that was going on last year. They
[2:53:26.040 --> 2:53:31.400]  did the same thing at the southern border here in the United States. Minority students offered
[2:53:31.400 --> 2:53:37.720]  no whites safe space, racial healing circle. San Diego State University is set to host a
[2:53:37.720 --> 2:53:42.680]  racial healing workshop for minority students and faculty later this month that aims to help
[2:53:42.680 --> 2:53:49.320]  students and professors of color get through college and career life. Do you hate white people?
[2:53:50.120 --> 2:53:55.560]  Come to San Diego State University, where your hatred for white people will be celebrated and
[2:53:55.560 --> 2:54:05.160]  discussed. Howard Schultz laments character assassination as he moles 2020 right house run.
[2:54:05.160 --> 2:54:08.760]  Yeah, that's what you get, Howard. Don't you get it? You're an outsider. The Democrats hate you.
[2:54:08.760 --> 2:54:15.800]  You created your business. The Democrats hate you. It's really sad. I mean, again, Howard Schultz,
[2:54:15.800 --> 2:54:20.200]  I mean, I would vote for him. But as far as a Democrat candidate, if you were smart,
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:24.200]  that's the kind of guy that you'd want to compete with Trump. But the Democrats have an IQ
[2:54:24.200 --> 2:54:31.240]  collectively of four. Biden is going to run for president. That's what dem lawmakers are saying.
[2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:35.720]  O'Rourke looks like he's gearing up to run for president as well. It's going to be fun to see
[2:54:35.720 --> 2:54:42.440]  all of these losers run as they cast off people that could actually be powerful Democrat options
[2:54:42.440 --> 2:54:47.000]  like Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang and Howard Schultz. And Bloomberg was smart enough to
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:53.320]  know he's just not even going to deal with them. Hipsters mostly look alike. There's math to prove
[2:54:53.320 --> 2:54:58.600]  it. Yeah, it's funny. All these liberal progressive hipsters think that they're acting unique in all
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:03.240]  of the behavior that they engage in and what they wear and what they consume and where they eat.
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:07.720]  They're literally just carbon copies of one another. Total pawns of the establishment.
[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:13.640]  Dems are racing middle America. Yeah, by trying to load up the east and west coast with a bunch
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:19.240]  of illegal voters and then end at the Electoral College, turn Texas blue, and then the Democrats
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:24.280]  win every election. There's no point of even voting. They win. Ex-New Jersey priest accused
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:32.920]  of sex abuse found shot to death in Nevada home. Scientists were bracing for a butterfly collapse
[2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:38.440]  and now they're everywhere. Yeah, so just like the polar bears are going extinct, penguins are
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:42.520]  going extinct, the ice caps are melting, they're going to flood the world. It's always fake news
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:48.120]  with these Democrats. They wrote all kinds of legislation to pass bills to fund the protection
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:53.640]  of butterflies. Now they're everywhere. So here's the next one. Almost certain extinction, 1200
[2:55:53.640 --> 2:55:57.480]  species under severe threat across the world. Well, yes, there are species that are under threat.
[2:55:57.480 --> 2:56:01.880]  I think the white rhino just died out, but they also discovered like a thousand new species
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:07.000]  every year too. But you watch all these species, they claim are dying. They're probably just making
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:13.960]  it up to claim global warming. Gene edited food quietly arrives in restaurant cooking oil. Yeah,
[2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:19.000]  Gene edited food. I'm sure there'll be no backlash there. Is it okay to tinker with the environment
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:23.240]  to fight climate change? This is the New York Times where they're admitting chemtrails are real.
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:28.360]  So they admit chemtrails are real. They're spraying particles into the sky. We report on it and
[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:32.600]  somehow we're fake news. And then they say, man made global warming. And I say, really,
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:35.800]  you mean like those lines in the sky? Shut up conspiracy theorist.
[2:56:37.400 --> 2:56:41.320]  Man gunned down outside bar after he joked about voting for Trump. That's just the loving,
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:45.720]  tolerant left. You know, they'll shoot, you'll shoot Steve Scalise. These people are so loving
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:50.840]  and tolerant. They'll beat you half to death if you wear a trumpet. CBS staffers in panic over
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:56.440]  call for one million in cuts. Uh oh, mainstream media is dying. Ladies and gentlemen, meanwhile,
[2:56:56.440 --> 2:57:01.960]  alternative press is sprouting up everywhere and having success. Facebook, Amazon and Google
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.480]  have a 2020 problem. Well, that's why they're trying to censor anybody who would call them out
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:15.800]  for their censorship and for supporting President Trump. Smollett team says the case
[2:57:16.680 --> 2:57:21.640]  against him is flimsy. Hmm. Yeah, we just have all the evidence. Wow. Real flimsy. Yeah.
[2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:27.240]  Yeah. Oh, and does not have a keep America grading and hat on. I'm not wearing one. There's no
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:35.560]  evidence of it. Glad to honor JJZ despite his long history of anti gay lyrics. So there you go.
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:40.200]  What do we have to do to keep America great? What must Trump do? We took your calls. Mike Adams
[2:57:40.200 --> 2:57:46.200]  takes over in the fourth hour. This has been the Alex Jones show. I've got some really good news
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:54.680]  though. X two is back. The original X two deep breath crystal pure atomic iodine. What you want
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:59.960]  in four store.com. It'll be here in a week. Manufactured in the US in four store.com with
[2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:04.600]  the best iodine in the world X two. It's available. I thought X three is great. We still got another
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:08.280]  deep breath crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine. The scientists
[2:58:08.280 --> 2:58:13.160]  said do that. It's sold a lot that people want original X two. Like I was resigned. The fact
[2:58:13.160 --> 2:58:17.720]  we didn't have X two, but it came through about a month ago. We now have X two again
[2:58:17.720 --> 2:58:22.280]  and in four store.com. So hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost three months.
[2:58:22.280 --> 2:58:30.760]  But we have now had the same company, the original X two develop it again. And we were able to do
[2:58:30.760 --> 2:58:35.880]  the exact same formula. You want to pre order X to the ultimate iodine out there. Learn about
[2:58:35.880 --> 2:58:39.720]  the iodine conspiracy. Learn about IQ is dropping when you don't have it. Learn about how the other

[2:59:09.880 --> 2:59:14.120]  and spreading the word. You are the info word. And now because of their intensifying
[2:59:14.120 --> 2:59:19.160]  censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to info wars.com forward slash
[2:59:19.160 --> 2:59:24.280]  newsletter and sign up via email. So there's no way the sensors can get between us with critical

[2:59:30.200 --> 2:59:35.000]  to share the info wars.com articles to share the videos to tell people by the local stations

[2:59:49.240 --> 2:59:51.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:56.520 --> 3:00:04.360]  Big brother mainstream media government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[3:00:04.360 --> 3:00:06.360]  It's Mike Adams.
[3:00:11.640 --> 3:00:15.800]  All right, Mike Adams here filling in for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show marks 13
[3:00:16.520 --> 3:00:23.080]  2019 got a lot to cover here for you today. As always, it's a packed fourth hour. Owen,
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:27.240]  I was amazed how how he was able to get through all the news there in that last segment covered a
[3:00:27.240 --> 3:00:31.640]  lot of headlines, but I've got some analysis as usual on some different topics. So first,
[3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:35.640]  we're going to talk about Venezuela, what's actually happening there and what it means about
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:41.480]  the coming collapse for America. We can learn a lot. You know, as much as we we pray for those
[3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:46.200]  people who are victimized and as much as we don't want to see other human beings suffer,
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:51.080]  there are also some very important lessons that we can learn, including lessons of how did the
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:58.520]  Venezuelan voters create this situation unintentionally for themselves? You know, they gave up their
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:03.880]  guns and then they voted for socialism. Now, sadly, many of them are experiencing the
[3:01:03.880 --> 3:01:08.120]  devastating effects, the repercussions of those decisions while dragging along those people
[3:01:08.120 --> 3:01:15.720]  who voted against socialism was a very a very big, excuse me, warning lesson in in this for
[3:01:15.720 --> 3:01:21.480]  Americans and the rise of socialism among America's youth. Also going to cover today,
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:27.960]  forbidden speech and the authoritarian society that is now encroaching upon all of our abilities
[3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:34.280]  to speak or even to think. Now, you can't say the wrong things online, even if they're not
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:39.800]  hate filled, you know, violent advocacy for violence or anything like that. You can be banned
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:46.040]  just because the CEO of Twitter or Facebook or Google doesn't like you and doesn't like what
[3:01:46.040 --> 3:01:51.160]  you're saying or even criticizing those CEOs. That's what got me banned on Twitter. Now, I think
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:56.360]  a couple of weeks ago, just completely banned without any, there were no flags, there were no
[3:01:56.360 --> 3:02:01.160]  warnings, nothing, there was no explanation given just completely banned. We're going to cover that
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:07.560]  today. Also, some action items for you. We have got to get a message to Trump. I know Mike
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:12.280]  Sernovich has been doing this. Oh, a shroy or Alex Jones has been doing this. I'm going to
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:19.160]  double down on that today and say that if Trump doesn't address this fascism, this online censorship
[3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:24.520]  of free speech, then it's over for Trump and it's over for America. I'm going to have some
[3:02:24.520 --> 3:02:29.640]  homework for all of you today, some things that you can do to help us fight back against this
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:36.680]  at time is quickly running out. If we don't jump on this right now, then it's lost. We will not
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:42.680]  be able to have any influence over society because all our voices are being systematically
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:49.240]  silenced. You know that, but I'll give you some new analysis. Also, farmlands and microplastics,
[3:02:49.240 --> 3:02:55.320]  the average American is now eating literally many pounds of plastic every year through food
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:03:01.560]  that's grown on farmlands that are now being inundated with microplastics. This is a real
[3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:07.080]  environmental issue and it stems from bio sludge that I've warned about for many years. I've released
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:12.440]  that film, biosludged.com. You can download it and watch it for free. The problem is there's a
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:18.360]  lot of plastic in the sewage that comes out of the cities. And so this plastic gets ground up and
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:24.120]  it's spread on farms as a form of, quote, fertilizer or nitrogen. Even though the plastic, of course,
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:30.360]  isn't nitrogen, there is nitrogen in the rest of the feces. And so farmlands are now being heavily
[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:35.560]  contaminated. It's going into your food. You are now probably eating more plastic than you are
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:41.880]  minerals in the food supply or at least trace minerals for that matter. Also today, I'm going to
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:47.560]  talk about the fake college admissions scandal, but a little bit of a different take on that because
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:54.520]  the person who ran that singer is his last name was charged with racketeering. Why are the tech
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:59.400]  giants being charged with racketeering? Because what they're doing is meddling in elections. I mean,
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:06.520]  this guy just meddled in school admissions for some rich white chicks, right? And he gets charged
[3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:11.400]  with racketeering, but the tech giants that are meddling with our entire nation, our entire future,
[3:04:11.400 --> 3:04:16.920]  our elections, they're not getting charged with anything. And also today I'll be covering why
[3:04:16.920 --> 3:04:23.160]  our conservatives and Trump supporters always being charged with multiple crimes like Manafort
[3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:29.080]  today charged with yet more crimes. Meanwhile, Democrats are never charged with any crimes,
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:33.800]  it seems, even when they carry out crimes that are far worse, such as obstruction of justice,
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:38.280]  obstruction of evidence, witness tampering, things like that. But all of that straight ahead here on
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:43.080]  the Alex Jones show, Mike Adams filling in on the fourth hour. Stay with us. We'll be back with
[3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:48.680]  more details on all those topics and some other surprises as well. We'll be right back after
[3:04:48.680 --> 3:04:58.280]  this break. InfowarsStore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[3:04:58.280 --> 3:05:04.440]  need, you don't want. The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it
[3:05:04.440 --> 3:05:10.840]  on par with a major city. There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[3:05:10.840 --> 3:05:16.120]  How can I solve that problem? So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure
[3:05:16.120 --> 3:05:25.160]  Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter
[3:05:25.160 --> 3:05:30.200]  technology. And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now. We're basically selling
[3:05:30.200 --> 3:05:36.120]  these at cost because there was a big overhaul. Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews

[3:06:08.040 --> 3:06:16.200]  Jones show with Mike Adams. Mike Adams here. Today we're going to talk about Venezuela and what
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:22.200]  we can learn from that situation. But first, I just want to mention, don't trust the tech giants to
[3:06:22.200 --> 3:06:27.560]  get your information. Obviously, go directly to the independent media websites that you know and
[3:06:27.560 --> 3:06:34.280]  trust. Go directly to Infowars.com. Go directly to MySite, naturalnews.com. Go directly to Zero
[3:06:34.280 --> 3:06:40.040]  Hedge or thegatewaypundit.com or wherever you get your news. Go there directly. If you rely on a
[3:06:40.040 --> 3:06:45.240]  middleman, your sources will be censored. You won't be able to get that information.
[3:06:45.240 --> 3:06:50.360]  And by the way, the tech giants eventually are going to start censoring in the browser. They're
[3:06:50.360 --> 3:06:55.960]  going to block URLs in the browser. But maybe I'll talk about that more later. Getting to Venezuela,
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:07:00.520]  some very important lessons that we can all learn from what's happening there. It's also about to
[3:07:00.520 --> 3:07:07.640]  turn to cannibalism, which is horrifying. It's sad. You know, the humanitarian side of all of us.
[3:07:07.640 --> 3:07:12.200]  We want to pray for those people. We don't want to see the suffering that's happening there.
[3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:19.800]  At the same time, I think it was Thatcher who said that in a democracy, people always get the
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:26.280]  government they deserve. The sad part about that is that in a democracy, and I understand America
[3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:33.880]  is a republic, not a democracy, but Venezuela was a mob rule kind of vote country where the
[3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:39.320]  majority ruled. And there were not constitutional protections for their people, not in the way
[3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:44.680]  we have with the Bill of Rights in the United States. So the mob that is the majority in Venezuela,
[3:07:44.680 --> 3:07:51.560]  which used to be a first world nation, very wealthy, sitting on incredible fossil fuel resources.
[3:07:51.560 --> 3:07:56.040]  It's like, it's almost like digging gold out of the ground. How can you go broke when you can dig
[3:07:56.040 --> 3:08:01.640]  gold out of the ground? I mean, black gold in the case of oil, it's just sitting on free money.
[3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:08.280]  How can you go broke? And the answer is socialism. You can go broke, you can lose your nation, and
[3:08:08.280 --> 3:08:14.920]  you can collapse into despotism and desperation and mass starvation even now about the transition
[3:08:14.920 --> 3:08:21.400]  into cannibalism. How can that happen? The answer is the majority voted for it. They voted for
[3:08:21.400 --> 3:08:25.880]  socialism because they wanted free stuff. They wanted a government to take care of them.
[3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:32.040]  They bought the same thing that Gen Z is buying now in the United States, you know, the AOC
[3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:36.440]  followers. They buy this idea that the government should be your savior, the government should
[3:08:36.440 --> 3:08:41.560]  be your mommy and your daddy and provide everything that you need from food and housing and education
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:46.040]  and that all you have to do is be obedient and, you know, don't criticize the government because
[3:08:46.040 --> 3:08:49.320]  that would be wrong. The government is going to take care of you. The government is your god.
[3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:54.760]  And so back in, I think around 2012, the Venezuelan people also gave up their guns.
[3:08:55.400 --> 3:09:00.840]  It was a nationwide gun confiscation effort that took place with the government literally went door
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:04.920]  to door. And of course, they had the records of who owned the guns because they had a gun
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:10.600]  registration database, which is the whole point of gun registration databases is to know where to
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:15.400]  send the government thugs to confiscate the weapons and shoot people who refused to comply.
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:20.600]  And that's what Venezuela did. So they confiscated hundreds of thousands of firearms over a period
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:27.880]  of about three years from 2012 to about 2015. They imprisoned unknown thousands of people
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:33.720]  and they shot some people who refused to comply. And then the population was disarmed.
[3:09:33.720 --> 3:09:39.160]  But the gun control wackos in Venezuela said, no, that's great. Now we're going to be safe.
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:43.800]  We're not going to have citizens shooting citizens. The government will take care of us.
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:49.720]  Well, guess what you have now? Government shooting citizens, of course. You know where this leads.
[3:09:49.720 --> 3:09:56.280]  And not only that, but the Maduro regime is taking criminal violent felons out of the prison system,
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:10:02.280]  putting police uniforms on them and handing them guns and saying, go shoot the protesters.
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:07.960]  Go shoot the dissidents. So the guns are being put into the hands of the violent criminals,
[3:10:07.960 --> 3:10:12.760]  as long as they're loyal to the government, to murder the citizens who voted against all this
[3:10:12.760 --> 3:10:19.320]  from the start. And what do we need to learn from this? In America, you might think this can never
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:25.080]  happen. It absolutely can happen. And it can happen virtually overnight. I mean, Venezuela went from
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:33.160]  a first world nation to a, you know, a starvation, collapse, cannibalistic hellhole in about 10 to
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:38.280]  15 years. That's all it took, not like half a generation. That's it. From the time your kid
[3:10:38.280 --> 3:10:43.240]  is born to the time they get out of high school, your nation is gone. It's lost. It can happen
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:48.600]  that fast if you turn your nation over to socialism. So the lessons for Americans are number one,
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:58.840]  even if you oppose socialism, you can be dragged into the muck because the masses have been convinced
[3:10:58.840 --> 3:11:04.920]  that this is the only way that they can have any kind of future. If the masses are brainwashed,
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:09.480]  which is exactly what's happening in our education system today, the universities are
[3:11:09.480 --> 3:11:15.400]  indoctrinating these young kids. And this is why they come out of the universities as fascists
[3:11:15.400 --> 3:11:20.760]  and socialists. They oppose free speech. They oppose free thinking. They demand obedience,
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:24.360]  and they all think the same, and they all look the same like these hipsters. They literally
[3:11:24.360 --> 3:11:30.760]  look exactly the same. And they are willing to kill you to take your guns, just like that person
[3:11:30.760 --> 3:11:37.000]  at that, what was it, a legislative meeting. And there was a photo of that anti-gun person's
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  cell phone where they were texting another person to say, yeah, I'm going to shoot these NRA
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:45.640]  people. I'm going to shoot these lawmakers, something like that. They are not afraid to use guns to
[3:11:45.640 --> 3:11:53.480]  murder you. In fact, hear me on this. The only reason the radical left is not committing mass
[3:11:53.480 --> 3:11:59.000]  genocide and a mass slaughter of Christians and conservatives right now is because it's Christians
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  and conservatives that have the guns. If you were disarmed right now, they would already have armies
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:10.520]  of radical leftists sweeping across the country, pulling people out of their homes
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:15.320]  and slaughtering you with the guns that they monopolize. And that's the whole point of gun
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:21.640]  control. And Hawaii lawmakers are now pushing to repeal the Second Amendment. And you've got
[3:12:21.640 --> 3:12:28.440]  conservatives now in Washington DC, conservative lawmakers who are all in favor of these red
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:33.400]  flag laws now, which are unconstitutional. I mean, they violate due process. They violate the Bill
[3:12:33.400 --> 3:12:39.640]  of Rights to take away your guns just by someone reporting that you might be a suspicious person
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:43.800]  or they don't like what you're doing in your garage in the neighborhood because you're cleaning
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:48.680]  a rifle or something, minding your own business and they don't like you. Some neighborhood watch
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:54.440]  Nazi liberal comes along and says, oh, I saw that I saw him with ammo cans. He has ammo cans
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:13:00.280]  as if owning legal ammunition is some kind of a crime. Well, it is now thanks to red flag laws.
[3:13:00.920 --> 3:13:05.880]  You've got Democrats and now an increasing number of conservatives who are pushing to take away your
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:14.040]  guns and to create gun registries. You must oppose this with every fiber of your being. And it's
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:20.680]  happening. We now have the rise of gun sanctuaries, gun sanctuaries. This is the answer to the radical
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:26.520]  left and their illegal immigration sanctuaries. So the left set the precedent. They said that
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:32.840]  we can choose to oppose federal laws in whatever cities or whatever states we want.
[3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:36.600]  And we'll just say that we're not going to abide by the laws that we don't like. Sanctuary
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:41.640]  cities, sanctuary states like California. Well, guess what? You know what? Gun rights people
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:46.600]  can do the same thing and sheriffs in conservative counties in rural Washington and rural Oregon
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:51.640]  and rural California or New Mexico or Arizona for that matter. They can say, look, this is a gun
[3:13:51.640 --> 3:13:57.000]  sanctuary, Texas. There's been a law proposed now to make the entire state of Texas a gun sanctuary
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:03.800]  to nullify all federal laws regarding guns in Texas. Can't wait for that one. I could use
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:09.960]  a couple more suppressors, you know, but I'm joking. I've got plenty. But the thing is,
[3:14:09.960 --> 3:14:15.240]  this is happening. So we have this bifurcation now that where we've got conservatives saying,
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:18.360]  we're going to have a conservative sanctuary. We've got liberals saying we're going to have
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:22.680]  a liberal sanctuary of total lawlessness and total invasion and occupation of America with
[3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:27.160]  illegals who, by the way, are carrying infectious disease. That's why we have measles outbreaks
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:32.600]  across Americas because the illegals are bringing it in. That's an undeniable truth.
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:39.640]  But this is how we end up in a breakup of America, a civil war at both the state level
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:44.760]  and the national level. When the two sides say, we're just not going to abide by the laws that
[3:14:44.760 --> 3:14:51.960]  we don't like, then you get a two-tiered nation. And with the upcoming election in 2020,
[3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:55.320]  it's going to be the same thing. One side is going to say, we don't recognize Trump. The other side
[3:14:55.320 --> 3:14:59.160]  is going to say, we do recognize Trump. And there you can break out into a civil war. But
[3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:06.360]  just to wrap this up about Venezuela, learn the lessons that elections have consequences,
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:12.680]  as Obama said. And if you elect socialists, you will be eating your neighbor in 10 years,
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:17.880]  or maybe not you in particular, but the American masses, the clueless liberals who live in the
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:25.160]  cities, they will be roasting their neighbors over an open fire and slicing off a chunk of thigh
[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:29.720]  so that they don't starve to death. Because that's where socialism leads. That's where the Ocasio
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:35.800]  Cortez Green New Deal leads. Mass starvation, mass collapse. And if you don't oppose this and you
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:41.960]  don't stop it, it will destroy your nation. It will destroy your life. And you will end up begging
[3:15:41.960 --> 3:15:49.400]  for food or literally eating zoo animals, pets and neighbors just to not die. That's where socialism
[3:15:49.400 --> 3:15:59.800]  leads. Much more straight ahead. We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:04.520]  Did you know the official national American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[3:16:04.520 --> 3:16:09.640]  The one that Americans fought and died for. The one symbol that represents our constitution.
[3:16:09.640 --> 3:16:13.960]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before. Together we'll
[3:16:13.960 --> 3:16:23.080]  recapture America. Call 1-877-383-4777 or visit theofficialflag.com, theofficialflag.com.
[3:16:23.080 --> 3:16:29.480]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[3:16:29.480 --> 3:16:35.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:42.120]  World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:47.640]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I,
[3:16:47.640 --> 3:16:52.440]  the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:58.840]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse. Relief for body pain is here with
[3:16:58.840 --> 3:17:03.160]  Sunny Bay heating pads. Well the last thing I want is to take another pill. So what's so good about

[3:19:57.160 --> 3:19:59.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:14.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[3:20:14.520 --> 3:20:22.200]  and the heart of the resistance. It's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:30.920]  You want to know where the tech giant censorship is going? Pay attention here. You're going to be
[3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:35.480]  shocked at the information I've learned about what's next. Now let's backtrack a little bit
[3:20:35.480 --> 3:20:40.760]  and look at the history of this. Of course a Democrat, Rep Adam Schiff, of course he's a Democrat
[3:20:40.760 --> 3:20:48.280]  from California. He no doubt was given instructions by the vaccine deep state. Now that's the name
[3:20:48.280 --> 3:20:56.200]  I give to this. It's the vaccine manufacturers. It's the CDC. It's even corrupt researchers,
[3:20:56.200 --> 3:21:01.240]  people who got bribery money. The vaccine industry even has a guy who's wanted by the U.S. government
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:08.200]  who fled to Europe because he was given millions of dollars in vaccine research grants. He faked
[3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:13.480]  all the research, took the money, and fled the country. His last name is Thorson, by the way,
[3:21:13.480 --> 3:21:20.040]  T-H-O-R-S-E-N. If you want to research that, we've got stories about that up on the vaccines.News.
[3:21:20.040 --> 3:21:26.120]  But the vaccine deep state told Adam Schiff, I have no doubt, to go pressure Facebook and
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:30.680]  Google and Twitter and everybody just start banning all the voices of vaccine skeptics,
[3:21:30.680 --> 3:21:36.840]  whom they call anti-vaxxers. Now according to them, an anti-vaxxer is someone who tells the
[3:21:36.840 --> 3:21:42.840]  truth about ingredients that are in vaccines. It's someone who quotes the CDC's own admissions
[3:21:42.840 --> 3:21:48.040]  that vaccines are dangerous to some children and carry certain risks. It's someone who quotes the
[3:21:48.040 --> 3:21:53.720]  vaccine insert sheets in the vaccines themselves that say there are risks and that these vaccines
[3:21:53.720 --> 3:22:00.920]  can cause seizures, febrile seizures, hospitalization, colmas, paralyzing children, and even in some
[3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:07.640]  cases death. If you quote HHS, that's Health and Human Services Statistics about vaccine damage,
[3:22:08.200 --> 3:22:15.400]  that's released by the VAERS database, VAERS.HHS.gov, then you are called an anti-vaxxer and you are
[3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:21.640]  now censored and banned by Facebook and Google and YouTube and Twitter. Where is this going,
[3:22:21.640 --> 3:22:27.960]  though? Are they going to stop with vaccines? Of course not. Of course not. And what's next
[3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:33.960]  is anti-cancer foods. So there was an article in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks ago,
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:37.640]  I don't recall the title of it, but the Wall Street Journal was saying that, well, Pinterest,
[3:22:37.640 --> 3:22:43.080]  yeah, they banned vaccine searches because what, 80% of the information on Pinterest was warning
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:47.800]  parents about the dangers of vaccines, especially multiple vaccines given to children at a very
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:52.840]  young age. But the Wall Street Journal argued, the article seemed to be arguing that now you should
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:58.680]  ban anti-cancer food information like anti-cancer recipes. And they were saying that, well, there's
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:05.160]  no proof that there's such a thing as an anti-cancer food. Really? Give me a break because, you know,
[3:23:05.160 --> 3:23:11.720]  I'm a food science researcher. We cover anti-cancer foods every day. I mean, there's resveratrol
[3:23:11.720 --> 3:23:17.160]  in red grapes, there's apigenin in celery, there's anti-cancer nutrients in all citrus fruit,
[3:23:17.160 --> 3:23:23.240]  anti-cancer nutrients in turmeric root and ginger root and garlic. In fact, almost every
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:29.160]  fresh fruit or vegetable or nut or seed that you can pick up in the grocery store has at least some
[3:23:29.160 --> 3:23:34.040]  kind of anti-cancer effect, almost without exception. I mean, it's astonishing. Now,
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:37.560]  if you get into the processed foods, yeah, they're not anti-cancer, they're pro-cancer.
[3:23:37.560 --> 3:23:41.720]  But the fresh fruits and vegetables, almost all of them, the cruciferous vegetables,
[3:23:41.720 --> 3:23:47.800]  Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, broccoli, broccoli contains sulforaphane, a potent anti-
[3:23:47.800 --> 3:23:52.600]  anti-cancer nutrient. But you see, the tech giants are now going to say, you're banned if you talk
[3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:58.200]  about anti-cancer nutrients because that's not approved by the, quote, authoritative sources.
[3:23:58.200 --> 3:24:03.240]  And who are the authoritative sources? Well, of course, it's the pharma-corrupted FDA,
[3:24:03.240 --> 3:24:08.520]  the pharma-corrupted World Health Organization, the pharma-corrupted CDC, the pharma-corrupted
[3:24:08.520 --> 3:24:17.080]  cancer industry. So if you then say that cancer can be prevented by a diet and a lifestyle,
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:21.800]  you're going to be banned just like the vaccine skeptics are being banned. Or if you say that
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:27.240]  chemotherapy is toxic, makes your hair fall out, makes you lose muscle mass, it causes chemo
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:31.880]  brain, it damages your kidneys, your liver, your heart, and your brain. If you say that,
[3:24:31.880 --> 3:24:35.480]  even though it's factually true, you're going to be banned because they're going to use the same
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:40.600]  argument that they've used now with vaccines. They're going to say, well, you're causing people to
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:45.800]  avoid medical treatment. They need to have medical treatment. They need to have toxic
[3:24:45.800 --> 3:24:50.200]  chemotherapy dripped into their veins so that the cancer industry can make another couple of million
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:55.320]  dollars off that person while they're wasting away sitting there being poisoned by basically
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:25:00.360]  chemical weapons derived from mustard gas used in World War I. Where do you think chemotherapy
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:07.400]  came from? It was a weapon system in the First World War. They just modified those chemicals
[3:25:07.400 --> 3:25:13.480]  to kill you from the inside instead of from the outside. It's basically the same class of chemicals.
[3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:20.280]  If you say, oh, no, you should take vitamin C or vitamin D or zinc or just eat healthier foods
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:24.200]  or grill your own sprouts. Sprouts have anti-cancer nutrients. If you say any of that, you're going
[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:31.720]  to be banned. But guess what? That's not the end of it. They're going to go after health advice,
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:39.080]  food advice, and nutrition advice because you see the drug giants which control the legislature
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:44.200]  in the United States Congress. Every person there, including Adam Schiff, has taken money
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:48.200]  from the drug giants. I think almost without exception. There might be a couple. Maybe Rand
[3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:53.880]  Paul hasn't. I'm not sure. But by and large, everybody in Washington is owned by the pharmaceutical
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:26:01.880]  giants. Those drug giants, they depend on people getting sick for their revenues. If you avoid
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:09.480]  needing a drug, they lose revenue. If you go to my website or any other website that talks about
[3:26:09.480 --> 3:26:13.720]  anti-cancer foods or that talks about nutrition, talks about preventing disease, talks about
[3:26:13.720 --> 3:26:21.960]  longevity, drink clean water, eat healthy foods, eat anti-cancer foods, learn about the value of
[3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:29.640]  superfoods and certain nutrients. Here's how to make recipes using raw foods that have anti-cancer
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:37.080]  effects and so on. That takes money away from the pharmaceutical giants that depend on sickness
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:44.600]  and disease to continue to profit in this country. Almost one quarter of the United States economy
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:51.560]  now depends on keeping people sick. It's no joke. The GDP, the amount that's spent on
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:58.440]  so-called healthcare is between 20 and 25 percent and it continues to grow. That's because the drug
[3:26:58.440 --> 3:27:02.760]  giants and the health, I'm sorry, the medical device manufacturers and the cancer industry
[3:27:02.760 --> 3:27:08.040]  pushers and the vaccine pushers. The reason all these treatments are toxic is because they need
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:13.800]  you to stay sick. It's called repeat business. It's their revenue model. It's their entire business
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:19.800]  practice. They can't help you get well because they'll lose you as a customer. And when you take
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:26.200]  advantage of healthy products, just think about some of the things that the InfoWars store offers.
[3:27:26.200 --> 3:27:31.560]  I can't make specific claims due to FTC and FDA regulations and I'm not making specific claims,
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:38.680]  but if you do your research on nutrients and you do your research on herbs and powerful potent
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:45.880]  extracts of foods and superfoods and certain minerals, you will find that preventing disease
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:52.200]  is so much more affordable. It costs a fraction of treating disease and you see that destroys
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:56.200]  Big Pharma's business model, but the censorship is going to get much worse. They're going to come
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:28:01.160]  after you for telling people to eat healthy. They're going to come after you for telling people,
[3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:05.800]  filter your water, don't drink tap water. That will get you banned in the future. They're going to
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:12.360]  come after you for everything that you say that helps people stay healthy. Exercise, get off your
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:17.320]  butt. Don't live a sedentary lifestyle. Get some vitamin D and some sunshine. Sprout some foods and
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:21.240]  eat some raw sprouts. All these things will be banned and they've already set the precedent.
[3:28:21.240 --> 3:28:27.080]  They started with banning Alex Jones. They banned me, the health ranger, and now they're going to ban
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:33.240]  everybody who talks about healthy living. It's coming. This is no joke. They cannot stand the
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:37.960]  American people being healthy and having good cognitive function and having working immune
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:45.080]  systems. They have to keep you weak and diseased and paying money that they're corrupt system
[3:28:45.640 --> 3:28:51.080]  that never offers any cures and no solutions for health. That's the truth. Stay with us. Go on the
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:58.680]  break. Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse. Relief for body pain is here

[3:29:52.520 --> 3:30:00.200]  This bar at its regular price is a little over $3. When we have it discounted,
[3:30:00.200 --> 3:30:07.880]  it took about $2.50 a piece. Comfortable bars over between $5 and $7 a piece to add whole foods.
[3:30:07.880 --> 3:30:14.360]  This is high end. When you get one box, you get them at basically $3. You get them for $2.50 or so
[3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:20.280]  when you get it at the current launch discount. This took over a year to get the top manufacturer

[3:32:13.720 --> 3:32:18.600]  Leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[3:32:19.720 --> 3:32:24.440]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[3:32:25.640 --> 3:32:30.040]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[3:32:30.040 --> 3:32:36.120]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty
[3:32:36.120 --> 3:32:41.080]  away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for what you've done,
[3:32:41.080 --> 3:32:45.080]  but I want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially
[3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:49.480]  get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[3:32:49.480 --> 3:33:14.760]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. InfoWarsStore.com. Thank you.
[3:33:19.880 --> 3:33:25.720]  I got a message today for President Trump. I've been talking to a lot of people across the independent
[3:33:25.720 --> 3:33:31.560]  media. As you're aware, InfoWars and my operation Natural News, we have a lot of contacts and we
[3:33:31.560 --> 3:33:38.120]  know basically everybody across the industry. And I've decided to go ahead and share this publicly.
[3:33:39.160 --> 3:33:46.200]  President Trump, the independent media is very, very close to running out of patience,
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:53.480]  very close to turning against you, essentially, if you don't deal with the censorship issue.
[3:33:54.200 --> 3:34:00.840]  You've heard the talk now for over two years. The independent media is being selectively
[3:34:00.840 --> 3:34:07.480]  censored, illegally censored by the tech giants that are violating Section 230 of the Communications
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:13.560]  Decency Act, the CDA. They're acting as editorial publishers and yet they claim to have legal
[3:34:13.560 --> 3:34:20.520]  immunity against all content under Section 230. Well, you can't have both. It's either an open
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:25.800]  and free platform where everybody can speak. That's how you get the legal immunity. Or if
[3:34:25.800 --> 3:34:31.320]  you're going to have selective publishing and editorializing, then you're responsible for
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:37.480]  your content. And it's time, President Trump and all the staffers who have contact with President
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:44.520]  Trump, it's time to order William Barr to criminally prosecute these tech giants for their
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:50.520]  massive widespread violations of law and also violations of basic civil rights of the American
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:55.720]  people. The American people are being stifled. Their voices are being silenced. And it's all
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:35:03.000]  selective based on their politics or even if they talk about vaccine hazards, like I talk about.
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:08.600]  Well, we are being censored. Christian voices are being censored. Pastors are being cut off.
[3:35:09.240 --> 3:35:15.480]  You can't quote Bible scripture now without being silenced by all these tech giants. And then they
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:19.640]  go to before Congress and they lie and they claim, well, we're not censoring anybody based on
[3:35:19.640 --> 3:35:24.200]  politics. And then they censored zero hedge just the other day. And then when there was a big
[3:35:24.200 --> 3:35:28.920]  outcry about that, they saw we made a mistake. Well, they just censor anybody they want. And
[3:35:28.920 --> 3:35:34.520]  occasionally they reverse it when there's a big enough outcry. But what they are doing is illegal.
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:40.440]  And it's time to start prosecuting these companies. This is the thing, President Trump.
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:46.280]  If you do not start prosecuting and start pushing back against these tech giants,
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:50.920]  it's not just Twitter. And you saw the interview on Joe Rogan experience there.
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:58.120]  It's not just Facebook. It's also Pinterest. It's also Google search, by the way. It's Google news.
[3:35:58.120 --> 3:36:03.320]  It's all these tech companies. It's YouTube. If you don't start pushing back, number one,
[3:36:03.320 --> 3:36:08.040]  you're going to lose the election. No question about it. And number two, you're going to lose
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:13.880]  the independent media that got you elected in the first place. And I don't say this is a threat.
[3:36:13.880 --> 3:36:17.880]  I mean, I've been a Trump supporter from day one and we have given President Trump
[3:36:17.880 --> 3:36:24.280]  a lot of leeway and we've had a lot of patience. Even when the president put some very questionable
[3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:30.760]  people in power, such as Jeff Sessions, who turned out to be an absolute traitor, who stood by and
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:39.240]  let the deep state run roughshod over our democracy, our republic. Jeff Sessions was in there because
[3:36:39.240 --> 3:36:43.320]  President Trump nominated him. And there were other people like that who turned out to be
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:53.800]  disasters. We are asserting this right now that President Trump, you are important for this country.
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:37:02.840]  You are, there's almost a divine reason why you were chosen to have this power in this time.
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:09.720]  But if you don't use that power, if you don't express your purpose for being there, then all
[3:37:09.720 --> 3:37:15.640]  is lost. And your purpose for being there is not to get along with the opposition. It's not to
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:22.600]  make friends in Washington. If I dare say your purpose in being there is to tear down that corrupt
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:28.040]  system, to prosecute the deep state criminals. You need to, in my opinion, demand that the
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:33.240]  Department of Justice prosecute these people, demand that William Barr go after these deep state
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:38.760]  criminals. You need to, in my opinion, release the previously classified documents on the FISA
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:45.880]  warrants. Release the documents that show the deep state criminality and even the Obama complicity
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:51.000]  in spying illegally on American citizens who were associated with your campaign,
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:56.680]  President Trump. If you don't do these things, you will lose the election, but we will also lose
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:03.560]  our country. And I fear that if that happens, things will very quickly break down into an
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:09.960]  actual violent civil war scenario following the 2020 election. If Trump loses that election,
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:16.040]  I have a very strong feeling that the Patriots and the Christians and the independent media
[3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:22.760]  journalists are all going to conclude correctly that the Democrats stole the election. And we
[3:38:22.760 --> 3:38:26.760]  are probably going to end up saying that that's an illegitimate election because you have so
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:31.960]  much massive voter fraud, you have the popular vote compact now being pushed by leftists,
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:39.480]  you have illegals voting in California, and you have suppression of speech, of conservatives.
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:44.920]  How can you have fair and free elections in a society where you can't debate ideas in the
[3:38:44.920 --> 3:38:51.160]  online public square? What Twitter is doing in banning me and banning Alex Jones and banning
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:56.040]  all the important voices, what YouTube and Google and Facebook are doing in this selective banning
[3:38:56.040 --> 3:39:01.400]  is they are stealing the election. This is election meddling. This is a crime. These are
[3:39:01.400 --> 3:39:07.560]  criminal offenses. This is conspiracy to commit election fraud. And I find it fascinating that
[3:39:07.560 --> 3:39:13.480]  Robert Mueller charged Russian companies with that exact crime, conspiracy to interfere with
[3:39:13.480 --> 3:39:17.880]  America's elections. Even though there was scant evidence that anything had happened,
[3:39:17.880 --> 3:39:23.640]  maybe $100,000 worth of ads run on Facebook by some Russia-linked companies, that's it.
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:29.160]  I'm talking about billions of dollars worth of election meddling now being carried out by the
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:35.800]  tech giants. When they silence conservative voices and they only allow the pro-Clinton voices, or
[3:39:35.800 --> 3:39:42.120]  the pro-AOC voices, or the liberal Democrat voices to be heard, that is election meddling
[3:39:42.120 --> 3:39:47.720]  on a massive scale. And I'm almost at the point where I might launch a meme on this called,
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:54.360]  no speech, no consent. If you don't give us our speech, we don't consent to you winning the election
[3:39:54.360 --> 3:39:59.400]  because without speech, you can't have debates. And without debates, you don't have a democracy.
[3:40:00.040 --> 3:40:03.400]  You don't have fair and free elections if you don't have the right to speak,
[3:40:03.400 --> 3:40:09.000]  and to have your voices heard. The tech giants are engaged in election meddling at a scale that
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:13.720]  has never been witnessed before in the history of our civilization, in the history of our nation.
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:22.360]  And Trump is, it looks like Trump is doing nothing on this issue. And it's incomprehensible
[3:40:22.360 --> 3:40:27.400]  to those of us in the independent media, even those of us who supported Trump and voted for Trump.
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:33.560]  Why President Trump? Why aren't you ordering executive orders to deal with this? Why aren't
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:39.960]  you ordering the tech giants to respect freedom of speech? Why aren't you invoking the DOJ to go
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:46.040]  after them? Or the FTC, antitrust action to go after them? I mean, the president even has the
[3:40:46.040 --> 3:40:51.000]  power to seize private corporations. I'm not saying that that would be the right tactic here,
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  but you have that power. You could declare that these are public spaces, that this is part of
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:41:03.320]  the modern public infrastructure, which Twitter arguably is. Why does one man, the CEO of Twitter,
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:09.160]  why does he have the power to determine who gets to speak and who gets silenced in America? Why?
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:15.000]  Why are we living in that kind of society? An unelected, someone who has zero transparency,
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:20.200]  their algorithms are all secret. They never answer to the voters. And they're not being
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:26.680]  prosecuted. They need to be broken up. And you know what? Elizabeth Warren, as much as she
[3:41:27.640 --> 3:41:32.360]  should be condemned for declaring herself to be an Indian when she really wasn't,
[3:41:32.360 --> 3:41:37.320]  she's right about this point, that the tech giants need to be broken up. And a big question that I
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:43.720]  have today is, why is Elizabeth Warren the only prominent voice out there saying, break up these
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:49.320]  tech giants? Where are the conservatives on this issue? Where is President Trump? Where are the
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:55.720]  conservative senators on this issue? Elizabeth Warren is correct on this. And by the way, just
[3:41:55.720 --> 3:42:03.080]  as a side note, Ilhan Omar is also correct in saying that Obama was a pretty face for
[3:42:03.080 --> 3:42:06.920]  murdering people that he wanted to murder around the world. She was actually correct
[3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:12.680]  in saying that. You know, not everything that these Democrats say is wrong. Their core principles
[3:42:12.680 --> 3:42:17.960]  are wrong. Socialism is wrong. But every once in a while, they're something that is just spot on
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:23.080]  absolutely true. And of course, the Democrat party, you know, trying to put her back in her
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:27.960]  place. Don't talk about Obama like that because she happened to utter the truth for a moment.
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:32.520]  We got a glimpse of the truth out of the mouth of Omar. We got a glimpse of truth out of the
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:39.240]  mouth of Warren. The tech giants need to be broken up. If they don't, this country is gone. They
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:44.840]  will destroy America with online fascism. All speech that they don't like will be wiped out,
[3:42:44.840 --> 3:42:48.600]  silenced forever, and we will lose the future of our country. President Trump,
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:43:16.600]  get on this. We're with you to take action.
[3:43:16.600 --> 3:43:35.800]  Let's get ahead of ourselves.
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:40.000]  it again and we were able to do the exact same formula.

[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:07.800]  and get fired up.

[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:15.680]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:20.200]  and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it, and that's really where this goes.
[3:45:20.200 --> 3:45:24.680]  God's got a big war for you ready, and so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary
[3:45:24.680 --> 3:45:28.840]  Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the
[3:45:28.840 --> 3:45:33.480]  other stuff, because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:34.560]  are also ready to fight.
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:37.440]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[3:45:37.440 --> 3:45:39.440]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[3:45:39.440 --> 3:45:44.280]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built, I want to go to the next level,
[3:45:44.280 --> 3:45:49.440]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers, they're cold
[3:45:49.440 --> 3:45:51.520]  and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:46:03.440]  I want life, I want Jesus.
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:09.880]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[3:46:09.880 --> 3:46:16.160]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:20.240]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a
[3:46:20.240 --> 3:46:22.480]  few hours and have terrible side effects.
[3:46:22.480 --> 3:46:29.080]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[3:46:29.080 --> 3:46:31.920]  and beyond system in the world.
[3:46:31.920 --> 3:46:34.360]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[3:46:34.360 --> 3:46:38.920]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:41.560]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[3:46:41.560 --> 3:46:45.240]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[3:46:45.240 --> 3:46:49.040]  first time you take it, because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take
[3:46:49.040 --> 3:46:56.920]  you into overdrive, turbo force and enforce live.com.
[3:46:56.920 --> 3:47:13.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:13.840 --> 3:47:22.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones and now your host, Mike Adams.
[3:47:22.440 --> 3:47:29.840]  The real goal of the Democrats is to take all elections but create the impression that
[3:47:29.840 --> 3:47:30.840]  they weren't fake.
[3:47:30.840 --> 3:47:36.240]  So to steal your democracy or your republic and then to convince you that they didn't
[3:47:36.240 --> 3:47:40.520]  steal it so that they have this air of authority.
[3:47:40.520 --> 3:47:45.400]  This is really the way they operate, but so much of what's being unveiled now in society
[3:47:45.400 --> 3:47:50.760]  is fake, so much of it is fraud, there's no surprise to all of us when we saw this college
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:54.960]  admissions scam, which was run by Democrats by the way, you won't even see that reported
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:47:59.800]  in the media, they just say they were white people, they got to blame white people, but
[3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:05.240]  they were white rich Democrats and of course they had to fake everything, they had to fake
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:09.280]  their way into college just like they fake elections and they fake the news, they're
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:13.120]  faking everything, they're faking the science about climate change, of course they're faking
[3:48:13.120 --> 3:48:19.240]  everything and everything's becoming so fake and the fake hate crime hoax is all that.
[3:48:19.240 --> 3:48:22.280]  What if we just mix and match some of these, just combine them.
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:27.720]  What if Jesse Smollett hired white chicks to beat them up, white chicks that are on
[3:48:27.720 --> 3:48:33.160]  their way to college to beat them up, put a make America great again hat on him, I mean
[3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:37.080]  if he's going to hire somebody to beat him up, he could have at least found some white
[3:48:37.080 --> 3:48:42.160]  chicks and then he could have made a donation to that non-profit fraud scam thing so that
[3:48:42.160 --> 3:48:47.720]  they could get into college by faking like they're rowing team champions.
[3:48:47.720 --> 3:48:53.000]  With enough Photoshop, I guess you could turn anybody into an athlete, I think we should
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:59.200]  take like a UFC fighter, like what's his name, a Gregor and Photoshop some white chicks
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:05.280]  face on his body and just say, ah this is the, she's on the transgender college wrestling
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:09.920]  team, yeah how about that, get her into the college that way and if you criticize that
[3:49:09.920 --> 3:49:15.080]  you're full of hate, you see, if you criticize that then you're going to be banned because
[3:49:15.080 --> 3:49:20.960]  Photoshop is now the new reality according to leftists, it's all insane.
[3:49:20.960 --> 3:49:25.840]  But getting to some more serious issues here, a couple things I want to add to this censorship
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:32.320]  question, when you have Facebook now turning over censorship of all vaccine content to
[3:49:32.320 --> 3:49:38.920]  the vaccine industry, please understand, this is corporate fascism because Facebook really
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:43.520]  functions as an extension of government, it's a government surveillance front end, they
[3:49:43.520 --> 3:49:48.280]  work with the government, it's a spy machine and then the corporations control the content.
[3:49:48.280 --> 3:49:54.800]  Well let me ask you this question, what if Facebook turned over policing of all content
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:49:58.840]  about smoking and cigarettes to big tobacco?
[3:49:58.840 --> 3:50:03.880]  Yeah seriously, what if Facebook said, hey RJ Reynolds, come on in, we're going to let
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:10.080]  you decide what is authoritative speech on the cigarettes and smoking and tobacco, that's
[3:50:10.080 --> 3:50:15.440]  exactly what they did with the vaccine industry, I mean and that would be insane, if Facebook
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:20.280]  says, well who knows more about cigarettes than the tobacco companies, yes they're authoritative.
[3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:24.000]  Well tobacco companies covered up the science on smoking for decades, you can go back to
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:29.040]  the Journal of the American Medical Association in the 1950s, they were bribed and paid off
[3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:33.960]  by the tobacco companies to run full page ads that said, hey doctors recommend camels
[3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:38.640]  more than any other cigarette, doctors smiling and smoking and saying, hey this is good for
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:45.160]  your heart, good for your lungs, it's good, that's what the vaccine industry is today,
[3:50:45.160 --> 3:50:50.120]  it's all good, the science, don't worry about it they say, there are no risks, vaccines
[3:50:50.120 --> 3:50:54.720]  work all the time and then Facebook says, yeah you control the speech about vaccines,
[3:50:54.720 --> 3:51:00.360]  it's insane, similar thing, like what about from the point of view of liberals, what if
[3:51:00.360 --> 3:51:07.040]  the big oil companies were put in charge of policing all online speech about global warming,
[3:51:07.040 --> 3:51:12.920]  how insane would left us go, like literally if you post a comment that says, earning fossil
[3:51:12.920 --> 3:51:19.360]  fuels causes climate change, then you're banned for life because the oil companies are working
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:23.720]  with Facebook in this imaginary world and they're banning you for that, that's what
[3:51:23.720 --> 3:51:28.760]  it would be like, or big pharma, what if all health information were turned over to big
[3:51:28.760 --> 3:51:34.880]  pharma, that's essentially what's happening, the vaccine issue is the entryway, the doorway
[3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:40.160]  for them to establish that, to where you won't be able to talk about anything without big
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:48.280]  pharma's complicity or permission would be a better way to say it, and these attacks
[3:51:48.280 --> 3:51:52.960]  on ideas and speech are so dangerous to our society, and I want to give a shout out to
[3:51:52.960 --> 3:52:00.120]  Tucker Carlson, his very powerful video monologue just I think it was yesterday or the day before
[3:52:00.120 --> 3:52:05.520]  where he went after media matters and the SPLC and he exposed that how do they have this
[3:52:05.520 --> 3:52:11.400]  nonprofit status when they are clearly a front for the Democrats, they are clearly political
[3:52:11.400 --> 3:52:16.680]  operatives, and then they put out targets of who they want to silence, and then that's
[3:52:16.680 --> 3:52:22.400]  used by sometimes attorneys general in different states or used by the tech giants to decide
[3:52:22.400 --> 3:52:27.600]  who to silence, and they go after Christian groups and Bible groups, and just people
[3:52:27.600 --> 3:52:34.280]  who talk about gender fluidity in a critical way, for example, people who say that biology
[3:52:34.280 --> 3:52:40.840]  counts, that there are only two genders, they get targeted, and so Tucker Carlson nailed
[3:52:40.840 --> 3:52:46.520]  it, and Tucker Carlson refused to bow down and he refused to apologize for something
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:54.000]  that he said 10 years ago on some comedy podcast, something that maybe he wouldn't say today,
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:59.160]  and he's right about this, and we need more people like Tucker Carlson to stand up and
[3:52:59.160 --> 3:53:04.960]  to say, no, we're not apologizing to your fake hysteria campaign, we're not going to
[3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:10.080]  be silenced, because I guarantee you, if you go through and you scrutinize every word that
[3:53:10.080 --> 3:53:14.760]  every person has ever said for the last 20 years, everybody has said something that they
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:19.520]  maybe wish they could rephrase, everybody has said something if taken out of context
[3:53:19.520 --> 3:53:24.960]  sounds a little crazy, everybody has said something that maybe on second thought they
[3:53:24.960 --> 3:53:30.640]  wouldn't have stated it the same way, everybody, it's just that they selectively prosecute
[3:53:30.640 --> 3:53:37.000]  the people that they want to silence, and that's their form of online tyranny and control,
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:40.200]  and that's what's so dangerous about this, because when you have Facebook listening to
[3:53:40.200 --> 3:53:46.840]  these organizations, it's horrific. All right, last thought, because this is the final segment
[3:53:46.840 --> 3:53:54.440]  of today's show, last thought, the collapse, it looks like it's coming, just to be upfront
[3:53:54.440 --> 3:54:02.280]  and honest here, I don't think that the tyranny of the tech giants is going to be stopped
[3:54:02.280 --> 3:54:06.520]  anytime soon, I don't think that the fraud of elections pushed by Democrats is going
[3:54:06.520 --> 3:54:11.720]  to be stopped, and I don't think that the illegal immigration is going to be stopped either.
[3:54:11.720 --> 3:54:18.120]  I think that America is being overrun by demonic satanic forces, by radical communist
[3:54:18.120 --> 3:54:26.120]  forces, and by people who are brainwashed with so much hatred for America and for Trump
[3:54:26.120 --> 3:54:30.120]  and for the Constitution that they can no longer be reasoned with, and I want to put
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:37.640]  out a warning to everybody here, and I save this for the very end, a warning that don't
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:44.640]  rely on Trump to save you. He may still do some good, we're calling for him to go after
[3:54:44.640 --> 3:54:49.360]  the tech giants, but don't rely on him to save you, don't rely on anybody in central
[3:54:49.360 --> 3:54:55.840]  authority to save you. It looks like we, the people, are going to have to save ourselves,
[3:54:55.840 --> 3:54:59.800]  we're going to have to save our own country, and although I'm not recommending any specific
[3:54:59.800 --> 3:55:05.320]  action items right now, my most important piece of advice to you is to be prepared,
[3:55:05.320 --> 3:55:11.080]  be ready to take action, because the future of our country belongs to those who are willing
[3:55:11.080 --> 3:55:16.720]  to take action. You've got Obama from his command bunker organizing, what they call
[3:55:16.720 --> 3:55:21.720]  it, community organizing all across the country, they're going to be ready with teams of violent
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:27.920]  anti-fateras, they're planning a mass uprising, they're planning violence. If we sit back
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:31.440]  and do nothing, we will be overrun, we will lose our country.
[3:55:31.440 --> 3:55:36.040]  And although I never espouse violence, and I say don't be the one who fires the first
[3:55:36.040 --> 3:55:40.720]  shot, nothing like that, we all do have the right to defend our communities, and to defend
[3:55:40.720 --> 3:55:45.000]  our lives, to defend our families, to defend our nation, and especially defend our borders,
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:50.680]  and even defend our president. I have a feeling that the 2020 election is not going to be
[3:55:50.680 --> 3:55:59.600]  decided. I think it's going to be contested. And I think that the future belongs to those
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:04.680]  who are willing to defend their nation, and defend their president, and defend themselves
[3:56:04.680 --> 3:56:13.320]  against the zombie infestation of mindless, hate-filled leftists who are planning to try
[3:56:13.320 --> 3:56:17.080]  to do a communist type of takeover, a communist revolt.
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:23.860]  In the spirit of Mao, of China, the communist revolution, this is what they're planning.
[3:56:23.860 --> 3:56:28.120]  And if you let them get away with it, they will gladly do it. They will take your country
[3:56:28.120 --> 3:56:32.280]  from you, they will take your life. The only thing that's stopping them right now, believe
[3:56:32.280 --> 3:56:37.680]  me, is the fact that there are, according to current estimates now, 500 million guns
[3:56:37.680 --> 3:56:43.120]  in the hands of Americans. Not the 300 million you've heard, but half a billion firearms
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:48.040]  in the hands of the American people. This is why they're pushing gun control so aggressively.
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:52.080]  They have to take away the guns first before they can succeed in their mission to sweep
[3:56:52.080 --> 3:56:59.360]  across America and install a communist regime in power. And when they try that, we need
[3:56:59.360 --> 3:57:04.160]  to be ready to defend our nation. We need to be ready, mentally ready. You need to have
[3:57:04.160 --> 3:57:10.320]  the skill set. You need to have the equipment. You need to have the personal resolve. You
[3:57:10.320 --> 3:57:15.880]  need to pray for guidance from God. Do not put your faith in any one person, not even
[3:57:15.880 --> 3:57:21.200]  the president. Put your faith in God and put your actions in the hands of your fellow neighbors
[3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:26.280]  and fellow patriots and fellow Americans. Be ready. You will be called upon, I believe,
[3:57:26.280 --> 3:57:32.600]  to defend your nation in the next few years. I think it's coming. Stay tuned. Stay informed.
[3:57:32.600 --> 3:57:38.840]  Read infowars.com. Want to read my website? It's naturalnews.com. It's a lot coming. We'll
[3:57:38.840 --> 3:57:43.240]  stay online as long as we can. Thank you for listening.
[3:57:43.240 --> 3:57:47.320]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't
[3:57:47.320 --> 3:57:51.080]  be there for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can
[3:57:51.080 --> 3:57:56.200]  be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can
[3:57:56.200 --> 3:57:59.560]  teach them what I've learned. But not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age,
[3:57:59.560 --> 3:58:02.560]  your words gone forever, but now they're even better, getting rid of what you said they
[3:58:02.560 --> 3:58:07.780]  were before. It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high
[3:58:07.780 --> 3:58:13.520]  tech book burning, isn't it? But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed
[3:58:13.520 --> 3:58:17.840]  now. As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth,
[3:58:17.840 --> 3:58:22.640]  and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind yourself to something and commit
[3:58:22.640 --> 3:58:27.320]  to it, and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place, that prints
[3:58:27.320 --> 3:58:31.800]  in space and time. When you commit, be a word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread
[3:58:31.800 --> 3:58:37.160]  our articles and videos. That overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please now, commit to
[3:58:37.160 --> 3:58:44.880]  support M4 Wars, however you can, and realize your provision to M4 Wars is your own provision.
