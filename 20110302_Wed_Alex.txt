[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:30.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.480 --> 00:35.760]  welcome my friends it is Wednesday the second day of March 2011 we're gonna be
[00:35.760 --> 00:40.560]  live here for at least the next three hours Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.440]  of policy at the US Treasury is going to be joining us to talk about government
[00:44.440 --> 00:49.880]  shutdown what's happening with the Union rebellions around the country what's
[00:49.880 --> 00:55.200]  unfolding in the overall bond market and he's also going to give us his take on
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.520]  the Middle East uprising spreading into North Africa and open talk of a US
[01:00.520 --> 01:05.600]  invasion of Libya Russian military is reporting that airstrikes in Libya did
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.200]  not take place against protesting crowds and not that I'm a fan of Qaddafi but
[01:10.200 --> 01:14.600]  the media told us two weeks ago that he'd fled to Venezuela I mean they may
[01:14.600 --> 01:21.240]  tell us tomorrow that he's escaped to Neverland in a hot-air balloon so we're
[01:21.240 --> 01:25.960]  gonna be going over that we're also gonna get into Ben Bernanke's plan worked
[01:25.960 --> 01:34.920]  what happens next the Associated Press Act said so what happens next what is
[01:34.920 --> 01:40.400]  the next act in this play number one Bernanke's plan worked for the bankers
[01:40.400 --> 01:44.880]  it didn't work for the people so we're gonna be going over that and what's
[01:44.880 --> 01:52.280]  unfolding with the economy today as well I barely had time to read it this
[01:52.280 --> 01:59.600]  morning and I tend to not really cover news items that I'm in but this really
[01:59.600 --> 02:02.760]  signifies that the establishment realizes that we can't be ignored any
[02:02.760 --> 02:09.840]  longer coming out on Friday one of the biggest stories in this month's Rolling
[02:09.840 --> 02:14.160]  Stone and it comes out this Friday the article is now out though I'm told it's
[02:14.160 --> 02:18.680]  even longer with some sidebars another information in the physical magazine
[02:18.680 --> 02:25.000]  talk radios Alex Jones the most paranoid man in America I talked to the
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.320]  author he's not happy with that headline he his headline was Alex Jones
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.720]  versus the New World Order Hal Jones is trying to overthrow the global Stasi
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.560]  Borg state one conspiracy theory at a time and it's one of the fairest pieces
[02:38.560 --> 02:45.480]  that I've ever seen in mainstream news so the writer did keep his word on the
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.040]  piece though he did a few deceptive straw men over simplifications dealing
[02:50.040 --> 02:56.120]  with world population reduction and things along those lines very interesting
[02:56.120 --> 03:00.160]  article out of Rolling Stone talk radios Alex Jones the most paranoid man in
[03:00.160 --> 03:08.600]  America and it is a powerful long eight page article it's about 4,500 words the
[03:08.600 --> 03:14.920]  author wasn't happy to a certain degree because a lot of the context he said was
[03:14.920 --> 03:22.280]  taken out it was 7,000 plus words long but that's routine for magazines to cut
[03:22.280 --> 03:28.560]  things Rolling Stone doesn't run 7,000 word articles the longest are about 6,000
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.680]  but it is he's not sure yet but he believes it's gonna be the longest
[03:32.680 --> 03:39.600]  article in this issue that has some pop person on the cover riding a rocket but
[03:39.600 --> 03:43.520]  it'll certainly wake a lot of folks up and point them towards this radio
[03:43.520 --> 03:50.640]  broadcast I didn't get any sleep really a couple hours on Sunday night didn't get
[03:50.640 --> 03:53.640]  any sleep really when I got back if I stay up too late then I can't go to
[03:53.640 --> 03:57.360]  sleep so I was a little bit out of it yesterday people probably couldn't tell
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.760]  but I did get about nine hours sleep last night and it's almost like once you
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.600]  get sleep you're a little bit dingy but I'm here on the air today after that
[04:07.600 --> 04:14.360]  blitz in New York City turning the lemons of the whole Charlie Sheen
[04:14.360 --> 04:21.440]  situation into lemonade and we'll probably a little bit more on that today

[09:09.720 --> 09:21.040]  1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 here out of the gates I want to make an
[09:21.040 --> 09:26.600]  announcement we had said that Monday was the deadline to have your the answer to
[09:26.600 --> 09:33.320]  1984 is 1776 video contest entries exposing the TSA globalist takeover the
[09:33.320 --> 09:38.440]  new world order you could do fiction you can do nonfiction video of activism the
[09:38.440 --> 09:44.080]  sky's the limit and I have to say there is no doubt of the six or seven contest
[09:44.080 --> 09:48.480]  I've done in the last few years this is the biggest the biggest response the
[09:48.480 --> 09:54.080]  biggest effect and the largest amount of entries there is no doubt we're
[09:54.080 --> 10:03.360]  estimating around 1500 video entries 1500 and normally we get a couple hundred
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.720]  and it is more than we can chew and normally it takes me a week or two
[10:07.720 --> 10:11.400]  longer to judge them and then announce the winner and that's undoubtedly gonna
[10:11.400 --> 10:15.280]  happen this time I mean it you want me to be able to watch these you want me to
[10:15.280 --> 10:20.920]  be able to post them all at least and go over them and a lot of people's emails
[10:20.920 --> 10:26.040]  bounce sometimes as long as your upload date is by Monday at midnight as long as
[10:26.040 --> 10:32.920]  we get it by midnight tonight you can send them to the contest entry email
[10:32.920 --> 10:36.720]  address that's on the different page entries where we've posted all the
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.320]  different videos and things that people produced and we will do our very best to
[10:42.320 --> 10:48.280]  post all the entries that basically follow the rules and the only rule is
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.720]  you got to have info wars dot com on it somewhere in the video a lot of people
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.600]  submit videos that were made a year ago two years ago and they just don't even
[10:55.600 --> 10:59.200]  follow that basic rule but we're gonna be posting everything and more big
[10:59.200 --> 11:05.440]  rollouts every day we're posting scores of videos and flyers and and activist
[11:05.440 --> 11:11.040]  materials that folks have produced but it is a daunting task but a very
[11:11.040 --> 11:16.000]  exciting task and nevertheless to get all of these entries posted on info
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.040]  wars comm and prison planet comm and then to be able to judge them but I will
[11:23.040 --> 11:28.520]  announce not this Friday but next Friday the winter because it'll take days and
[11:28.520 --> 11:33.720]  days just to make sure we have all the videos and then to go back over the
[11:33.720 --> 11:39.160]  different videos that have been turned into us obviously that gives me a headache
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.520]  just imagining it but it's such a exciting activist tool I mean when you
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.400]  get 1500 or more videos in and I'd say the average video's got about 5,000
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.520]  views right now those will grow into the tens of thousands over time can you
[11:54.520 --> 11:59.120]  imagine the millions of people that are going to see these videos over the next
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.160]  few years that you have successfully flooded YouTube and other video sites
[12:05.160 --> 12:12.280]  with I mean it is just having a massive unmeasurable activist effect on the web
[12:12.280 --> 12:18.560]  so I salute all of you you all win regardless if you don't win the $7,000
[12:18.560 --> 12:25.680]  for first place $2,000 for second place and $1,000 for third place now the
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.600]  V for victory campaign continues that is a add-on as Paul Watson had the idea of
[12:30.600 --> 12:35.600]  the answer in 1984 1776 contest you won't be precluded from the contest if
[12:35.600 --> 12:41.040]  you have V for victory symbols in your video in fact I think that's a added
[12:41.040 --> 12:48.560]  attribute but it's not needed for you to be able to be the winner so again that
[12:48.560 --> 12:52.400]  is coming up but you've got until midnight tonight to get those into us if
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.840]  you haven't seen yours posted or haven't had a chance to get it into us yet and
[12:56.840 --> 13:00.160]  us we're extended that a few days for you as long as the upload date is this
[13:00.160 --> 13:06.320]  Monday two days ago or a day and a half ago so that's the latest developments
[13:06.320 --> 13:18.240]  for you on that front okay the news the news talk radios Alex Jones the most
[13:18.240 --> 13:22.640]  paranoid man in America Hal Jones is trying to overthrow the global Stasi
[13:22.640 --> 13:27.800]  Borg state one conspiracy theory at a time this went out this morning I
[13:27.800 --> 13:34.240]  started getting emails and messages concerning it and it is one of the big
[13:34.240 --> 13:45.200]  featured stories in the it's comes out twice a month so this month's first
[13:45.200 --> 13:51.880]  issue the first March issue of Rolling Stone hits newsstands Friday but the
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.720]  article that is overall one of the fairer ones I've seen it still got some
[13:55.720 --> 14:00.320]  straw man disinformation in it is now out there for everyone talk radios Alex
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.800]  Jones the most paranoid man in America really I'm paranoid I don't like the TSA
[14:05.800 --> 14:08.920]  now rolling out on the streets of America putting their hands down our
[14:08.920 --> 14:15.760]  pants TSAs looking at full body x-rays in the airports now so is the Australian
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.920]  equivalent of the TSA we talked about global financial meltdowns caused by
[14:20.920 --> 14:25.680]  derivatives more than 11 years ago now it's happened we talked about the
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.280]  danger of military intervention in Libya now they're openly pushing for it
[14:30.280 --> 14:36.960]  people in the media has this cliche that I'm paranoid I mean when I read the UN
[14:36.960 --> 14:41.680]  openly saying they want to establish a authoritarian world government or I read
[14:41.680 --> 14:45.080]  the Financial Times of London pushing a authoritarian world government and
[14:45.080 --> 14:49.440]  telling us how authoritarianism is good or countless globalists saying we want
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.680]  green fascism that's their word not mine and how great authoritarianism is and
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.240]  they're putting telescreens up in 9,000 locations saying watch your neighbors
[14:59.240 --> 15:04.480]  and the federal government's openly calling for an internet kill switch the
[15:04.480 --> 15:12.960]  reason this radio broadcast and my videos and the other media systems we use
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.480]  are rising so fast is because we've got our finger on the pulse of the world and
[15:18.480 --> 15:23.680]  we know the globalist inside now and we understand their program and yes it's
[15:23.680 --> 15:30.920]  shocking it's frightening to know all of this is happening but it's better to be
[15:30.920 --> 15:37.520]  able to know the threat is coming and meet it and face it down let me just
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.560]  run through some of the news headlines here for you today Russian military
[15:42.560 --> 15:50.320]  reports airstrikes in Libya did not take place editors note the corporate
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.120]  media faithfully reads from the script provided by the government the Pentagon
[15:56.120 --> 16:01.880]  remember Saddam's aluminum tubes WMD's and babies throughout of incubators
[16:01.880 --> 16:08.320]  remember the Gulf of Tonkin war invariably begins with lies as the Nazi
[16:08.320 --> 16:12.840]  Gurring knew he said the people can always be brought to the bidding of the
[16:12.840 --> 16:17.640]  leaders either through lies fear or both the reports of Libya mobilizing its
[16:17.640 --> 16:23.520]  air force against its own people quickly spread around the world kind of like
[16:23.520 --> 16:27.400]  they said he ran to Venezuela however Russia's military chiefs said they have
[16:27.400 --> 16:31.000]  been monitoring from space and the pitchers tell a different story according
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  to Al Jazeera and BBC on February 21st Libyan government inflicted airstrikes on
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.120]  Benghazi the country's largest city on the capital of Tripoli however the Russian
[16:39.120 --> 16:42.160]  military monitoring the unrest via satellite from the very beginning says
[16:42.160 --> 16:46.000]  nothing of the sword was going on on the ground at this point the Russian
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.800]  military is saying that as far as their concern the attacks some media were
[16:49.800 --> 16:53.840]  reporting never occurred these same sources in Russian military establishment
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.120]  say they are also monitoring the situation around Libya's oil pumping
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.880]  facilities and here is a quote the Libyan government has shut down the
[17:02.880 --> 17:06.320]  internet and phone lines and the information war is underway although
[17:06.320 --> 17:10.320]  one of the most professional networks in the world it has been cautioned that
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.240]  Al Jazeera is not a neutral actor the Russian government said it is subordinate
[17:14.240 --> 17:19.000]  to the emir of Qatar and the Qatar government which is also an autocracy
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.040]  by picking and choosing what to report Al Jazeera's coverage of Libya is biased
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.240]  this is evident with one studies Al Jazeera coverage of Bahrain which has
[17:28.240 --> 17:34.120]  been restrained due to political ties with the leaders of Bahrain and Qatar
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.440]  reports by Al Jazeera and Libya jets firing on protesters in Tripoli and the
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.120]  major cities are unverified and questionable here to the reports that
[17:42.120 --> 17:45.960]  Libya jets have been attacking people in the streets have not been verified no
[17:45.960 --> 17:49.800]  visual evidence of the jet attacks has been shown all visual confirmation about
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.880]  other events have been coming out of Libya and it just goes on from there now
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.040]  you did have paramilitary groups attacking military bases and what do you

[18:08.160 --> 18:12.520]  Venezuela like we were told that was the British government saying that who
[18:12.520 --> 18:15.520]  previously controlled Libya before Gaddafi took over they controlled through
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.400]  the puppet king there they think they own those oil fields just like they think

[18:46.480 --> 18:49.800]  week did not happen suggesting they were a key event seized upon by the global
[18:49.800 --> 18:53.600]  media to justify a humanitarian military intervention was a contrived hoax

[19:04.400 --> 19:07.920]  they are getting specifically the supposed airstrikes it took place
[19:07.920 --> 19:11.720]  February 22 over Benghazi and Tripoli which were widely reported by the BBC
[19:11.720 --> 19:15.200]  down to zero and not registered by the Russian military chief studying the
[19:15.200 --> 19:20.600]  images coming in from the satellites and then has the quotes here the pictures
[19:20.600 --> 19:24.200]  show that quote nothing of that sort has been going on the ground states the
[19:24.200 --> 19:27.360]  reporter who talked to the joint chiefs adding that there is also no evidence
[19:27.360 --> 19:30.440]  from footage shot by television cameras which would suggest that airborne

[24:07.400 --> 24:11.280]  there's a war on for your mind
[24:16.880 --> 24:20.720]  you know I thought I've done pretty good it's been about two years since I've
[24:20.720 --> 24:25.640]  had a stomach virus and my oldest daughter is at home sick today and
[24:25.640 --> 24:29.400]  throwing up all night and I felt really bad when I went on air I thought I was
[24:29.400 --> 24:33.080]  just tired but I definitely got a stomach virus I was just in there
[24:33.080 --> 24:42.000]  tossing up my cookies as they say but I'm going to try to stay here on air but
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.480]  I'm definitely getting sicker by the minute we're lining up Watson Paul Watson
[24:45.480 --> 24:49.800]  to come in and then try to move dr. Paul Craig Roberts to earlier because there's
[24:49.800 --> 24:57.160]  all this news and information that really really needs to be covered but I'm
[24:57.160 --> 25:02.080]  probably gonna have to pull the ejection seat here pretty soon so please stay
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.520]  with us ladies and gentlemen and my daughter was only a 24-hour deal she was
[25:05.520 --> 25:07.720]  sick yesterday afternoon she's a lot better this morning so hopefully it's
[25:07.720 --> 25:15.680]  24-hour deal I'll be back tomorrow here live with you there's so much that I
[25:15.680 --> 25:21.680]  need to cover let me just continue here with the news
[25:21.680 --> 25:31.400]  Libyan rebels are marching west as front's firm so they're saying that in
[25:31.400 --> 25:34.880]  the last two days Gaddafi's forces launch out of Tripoli and several other
[25:34.880 --> 25:41.400]  cities have tried to retake areas and have been repulsed the rebels have also
[25:41.400 --> 25:45.120]  tried to take new territory and they've been repulsed so that's what they mean
[25:45.120 --> 25:51.200]  using a world war one type term of the front's firming that both sides are
[25:51.200 --> 25:57.760]  basically now going into a stagnant protracted position and the globalist
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.040]  have always said that that's their plan they want to break Libya into three
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.100]  parts at least two parts Iraq into four to six parts Saudi Arabia into two to
[26:07.100 --> 26:13.120]  three parts Egypt into two parts that way a country never gets strong and then
[26:13.120 --> 26:16.040]  you can have different rebel groups that you can demonize as terrorists and
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.280]  have a place to drop bombs and make money whenever you want and it looks
[26:20.280 --> 26:23.400]  like that's where they're this is going we've been hearing a lot of talk it's
[26:23.400 --> 26:28.760]  confirmed US aircraft carriers have now entered the waters in the area they've
[26:28.760 --> 26:37.000]  now gone through the major Suez canal area and so the forces are massing there
[26:37.000 --> 26:50.000]  and there's this continual drumbeat that is going on at nauseam for US forces UN
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.580]  slash NATO forces to invade the eastern area of Libya that borders the already
[26:57.580 --> 27:02.000]  globalist controlled Egypt and continue the domino effect in other areas the
[27:02.000 --> 27:08.960]  Middle East on the economic front oil jumps above $100 a barrel in futures
[27:08.960 --> 27:21.320]  it's trading as high as $115.97 so we have those developments as well but
[27:21.320 --> 27:26.680]  think about it they're going to now try to an invasion of Libya in the name of
[27:26.680 --> 27:32.440]  punishing Muammar Gaddafi for strafing crowds it's probably not even true and
[27:32.440 --> 27:36.440]  our supposed government has over a thousand drones in Pakistan and
[27:36.440 --> 27:41.120]  Afghanistan bombing anyone and everyone and saying they can kill several
[27:41.120 --> 27:43.840]  hundred people who are innocent and that it's a good thing because it's
[27:43.840 --> 27:48.440]  collateral damage and what is this overall triggering it's an accelerating
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.320]  the increase in oil prices the underpinning is a dollar devaluation
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.240]  but now the big driver is destabilization almost no oil or gas coming out of
[27:57.240 --> 28:04.120]  Libya Saudi Arabians on Sunday promised a massively increased output as a way to
[28:04.120 --> 28:09.600]  stave off increases and try to keep stability but now they're not able to
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.160]  produce up the levels they said they would Libyan supply disruption could
[28:13.160 --> 28:21.200]  push oil to $130 a barrel official says Libya's troubles created the
[28:21.200 --> 28:25.280]  country's worst energy crisis in decades and supply disruption to world
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.920]  markets could push oil above 130 a barrel in next month of troubles persist
[28:29.920 --> 28:36.160]  chairman of Libya's national oil corporation told Reuters he did not
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.920]  specify whether he was referring to Brent or US sweet crude and it goes on
[28:40.920 --> 28:46.760]  from there as I mentioned earlier I want to continue along this line Cameron
[28:46.760 --> 28:55.120]  backtracks on Libya no fly zone plan as US distance itself David Cameron
[28:55.120 --> 29:00.600]  suggestion of establishing no fly zone over Libya and arming rebels rejected by
[29:00.600 --> 29:06.880]  US forces in France Watson is going to come back in the next segment joining us
[29:06.880 --> 29:11.440]  via video Skype from England he'll continue to break down more than 140
[29:11.440 --> 29:15.200]  thousand people flee Libya trying to go into Egypt trying to go into Tunisia
[29:15.200 --> 29:21.440]  trying to go into Italy where they're already having riots over how many third
[29:21.440 --> 29:27.400]  world people are pouring into the country again Libyan rebels March West as
[29:27.400 --> 29:35.120]  France firm they try to mass forces for a big push towards Tripoli Chavez says
[29:35.120 --> 29:40.160]  US distorting situation Libya to justify invasion well that's true he'll be
[29:40.160 --> 29:44.360]  right back Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up Paul Watson coming up and a lot
[29:44.360 --> 29:49.880]  more and if I can get a little bit better I'll be back with you as well
[29:49.880 --> 29:56.800]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[30:11.880 --> 30:15.920]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.920 --> 30:19.840]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.120]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.280 --> 30:32.600]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.600 --> 30:36.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[34:53.600 --> 34:59.880]  March the second edition I'm Paul Joseph Watson the editor of prisonplanet.com
[34:59.880 --> 35:05.080]  and I'll be filling in for Alex for the foreseeable future for the rest of the
[35:05.080 --> 35:10.960]  hour at least because obviously as Alex explained before the break he's very ill
[35:10.960 --> 35:16.720]  at the moment with a stomach bug so what's happening regarding the news well
[35:16.720 --> 35:23.160]  of course the top story this morning on prisonplanet.com was Russian military
[35:23.160 --> 35:29.680]  claims Libya airstrikes did not happen images from space suggest attack was
[35:29.680 --> 35:35.880]  contrived to create pretext for humanitarian military intervention and
[35:35.880 --> 35:42.400]  in fact if you if the board can cue up that clip from Russia today and let me
[35:42.400 --> 35:47.200]  know when it's ready then we'll we'll go ahead and play that in a minute or so
[35:47.200 --> 35:55.280]  basically top Russian military chiefs of staff have told Russia today that the
[35:55.280 --> 36:01.600]  February 22nd supposed airstrike conducted by Colonel Momar Gaddafi's
[36:01.600 --> 36:09.320]  forces over Benghazi and Tripoli which of course were aggressively hyped by
[36:09.320 --> 36:15.720]  the likes of BBC News and Al Jazeera as a perfect pretext for a military
[36:15.720 --> 36:23.040]  intervention on quote humanitarian grounds never in fact took place they've
[36:23.040 --> 36:30.280]  got satellite imagery from space focused on Libya and it's at the level
[36:30.280 --> 36:35.960]  supposedly where they can tell whether there's been an airborne attack and the
[36:35.960 --> 36:41.080]  Russian military chiefs of staff are saying that no such attack took place
[36:41.080 --> 36:48.400]  that's not to say that Gaddafi's regime is not using military airstrikes at the
[36:48.400 --> 36:52.960]  moment and certainly over the last few days because of course the fighting in
[36:52.960 --> 36:58.080]  the eastern region of the country has been fierce between the rebels and
[36:58.080 --> 37:05.440]  Gaddafi's forces but of course we were sold on the humanitarian into the on the
[37:05.440 --> 37:11.800]  basis that Gaddafi had airstrike had launched airstrikes against protesters
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.680]  on February 22nd last week so they're saying that now there's no evidence that
[37:16.680 --> 37:22.360]  that actually happened and you you can argue that well it's Russia obviously
[37:22.360 --> 37:28.000]  they're gonna disagree with the official narrative because obviously you had the
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.880]  Russian premier Medvedev come out and say that the the Middle East wave of
[37:35.880 --> 37:40.080]  revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa is basically just gonna cause a
[37:40.080 --> 37:47.480]  complete dislocation and he's obviously taking an opposing view to the mass of
[37:47.480 --> 37:53.040]  the Western media who were of course glorifying it all as a great organic
[37:53.040 --> 38:00.160]  expression of democracy but as I pointed out in the article even with a so-called
[38:00.160 --> 38:07.080]  humanitarian-led war not to mention pre-emptive attacks there's always a
[38:07.080 --> 38:14.080]  manipulation to justify it look back to the Iraqi incubator babies hoax where
[38:14.080 --> 38:21.640]  Saddam Hussein's forces before the first Gulf War were accused of removing babies
[38:21.640 --> 38:26.120]  from their incubators in QA and throwing them on the hospital floors leaving
[38:26.120 --> 38:31.600]  them for dead it turned out that that was a completely contrived manufactured
[38:31.600 --> 38:40.320]  hoax cooked up by the American PR firm Hill and Nolton in league with the Q80
[38:40.320 --> 38:47.920]  government in exile turned out to be a complete hoax in fact led by George HW
[38:47.920 --> 38:53.600]  Bush's former staffer Craig Fuller who was at the time tasked to quote devise a
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.480]  campaign to win American support for the war so they cooked up this fake
[38:58.480 --> 39:05.200]  humanitarian crisis manipulated the global population into feeling empathy
[39:05.200 --> 39:09.200]  for the supposed suffering that was taking place it was all completely
[39:09.200 --> 39:17.880]  contrived again Bill Clinton's attack on Serbia in the 90s was launched on
[39:17.880 --> 39:24.240]  this complete fabrication of the quote Serbian concentration camps and if you
[39:24.240 --> 39:30.120]  go to view the video at the bottom of the article and in fact that's another
[39:30.120 --> 39:33.960]  good video clip to play on the show if the guys can queue that up and tell me
[39:33.960 --> 39:40.280]  when it's ready basically a British TV film crew I believe it was from ITN
[39:40.280 --> 39:48.480]  went to this Serbian relief camp where Bosnian refugees were housed and they
[39:48.480 --> 39:54.240]  filmed them from inside a barbed wire pen now it wasn't the refugees that were
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.400]  inside the barbed wire pen it was the film crew but they filmed through the
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.960]  barbed wire through to the outside where all the refugees are gathered but then
[40:03.960 --> 40:10.240]  when they played the footage in later TV news reports they gave the commentary
[40:10.240 --> 40:17.400]  that the Bosnian refugees were actually inside the barbed wire pen
[40:17.400 --> 40:22.600]  so they made it appear as if they were incarcerated imprisoned against their
[40:22.600 --> 40:26.560]  will when in fact they were they were basically in a refugee camp they were
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.240]  getting food and water they were being treated completely humanely as in the
[40:31.240 --> 40:36.320]  clip that we've got in the article a Fox News and CNN correspondent who was
[40:36.320 --> 40:45.160]  there at the time testifies to and we're going to go to that video right now
[40:46.160 --> 40:52.440]  in 1990 an age-old conflict in the Balkans erupted into civil war a
[40:52.440 --> 40:57.520]  multi-sided and complicated overseas struggle was packaged by the mainstream
[40:57.520 --> 41:02.680]  media as a tidy milligram the predominantly Christians serves were
[41:02.680 --> 41:07.800]  cast as the villains a key maneuver employed to demonize them involved a
[41:07.800 --> 41:13.000]  photo shoot the news has always been used to stampede our reason with a
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.800]  perception and emotion when you're trying about war you get those hard
[41:17.800 --> 41:22.720]  tugging appeals to pity in particular and we've seen that again using images
[41:22.720 --> 41:27.960]  Benjamin works president of the strategic issues research Institute is a
[41:27.960 --> 41:34.040]  military affairs analyst for Fox News and CNN he recalls the emergency
[41:34.040 --> 41:39.320]  shelters set up by the Serbs to accommodate Bosnian refugees I remember
[41:39.320 --> 41:43.800]  very vividly seeing tours by the camp commander showing the mess all showing
[41:43.800 --> 41:48.280]  food that you know I wouldn't pay money for but I'd be gladly eat if it were
[41:48.280 --> 41:53.360]  free and yet this was turned into a sensational story about a concentration
[41:53.360 --> 41:59.360]  camps and the propaganda twist on that came out of both the electronic media
[41:59.360 --> 42:05.000]  and the newspapers and very glaring covers on Time magazine and such judgment
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.520]  and independent expose reveals how a British film crew photographed a Bosnian
[42:10.520 --> 42:16.560]  emergency shelter to look like a Nazi concentration camp the film crew
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.560]  positioned themselves inside a barbed wire enclosure to shoot out at
[42:21.560 --> 42:29.800]  refugees who were free to come and go as they pleased the cameras zeroed in on a
[42:29.800 --> 42:36.600]  refugee whose emaciated appearance was the result of a birth defect we found
[42:36.600 --> 42:42.440]  that all of these allegations of a concentration camp were really frauds
[42:42.440 --> 42:47.360]  perpetrated by the reporters and in fact at least one Roy Gutman won a Pulitzer
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.920]  Prize for this kind of fabrication and the image that helped motivate American
[42:51.920 --> 42:59.680]  involvement in an overseas entanglement was a total fake so they have it the
[42:59.680 --> 43:06.280]  pretext for the bombing of Serbia based on a total fabrication a total fake a
[43:06.280 --> 43:12.360]  manipulation of basically people's emotion and people's empathy with human
[43:12.360 --> 43:17.600]  suffering which is precisely what we see now with Libya and of course in that
[43:17.600 --> 43:22.280]  example they filmed an emaciated guy who had a birth defects and tried to claim
[43:22.280 --> 43:26.400]  that his physical condition was a result of his mistreatment in this quote
[43:26.400 --> 43:32.760]  concentration count which was actually a refugee relief center now we're going to
[43:32.760 --> 43:38.600]  go to the Russia today video which talks about how the so-called airstrike on
[43:38.600 --> 43:44.600]  protest protest is launched by Gaddafi last week did not take place so we go to
[43:44.600 --> 43:50.080]  this clip now well the reports of Libya mobilizing its air force against its own
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.320]  people spread quickly around the world but Russia's military chief says that
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.640]  they've been monitoring from space and the pictures tell a different story
[43:58.640 --> 44:01.720]  well artists that in a gluesco can tell us more on this now
[44:01.720 --> 44:07.960]  what are they saying well Alice at this point we have information from Russia's
[44:07.960 --> 44:11.680]  joint staff who are saying that they have been not monitoring the situation in
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.880]  Libya from space via satellites since the beginning of the unrest in the
[44:15.880 --> 44:19.840]  country and according to them some of the reports why they've made by the
[44:19.840 --> 44:23.360]  Western media are not entirely corresponding to the pictures that they
[44:23.360 --> 44:29.520]  are getting to be more precise according to Al Jazeera and to BBC on the 22nd of
[44:29.520 --> 44:34.040]  February of Libyan government has inflicted airstrikes on Benghazi the
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.200]  biggest city in the country and on Tripoli and according to Russia's
[44:38.200 --> 44:42.640]  military they have not registered any of those airstrikes according to them the
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.720]  pictures show that nothing of that sort has been going on the ground now if we
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.160]  also focus on the pictures that on the footage that we've been getting from the
[44:52.160 --> 44:57.240]  country we may be able to notice that there are absolutely no signs of any
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.600]  destruction inflicted by attacks from air or by living air force in those
[45:02.600 --> 45:07.200]  pictures so at this point Russia's military saying that as far as they're
[45:07.200 --> 45:12.200]  concerned they have not seen any attacks so they they can pretty much
[45:12.200 --> 45:15.880]  make a judgment that those attacks which the Western media has been
[45:15.880 --> 45:20.760]  reporting on have not been made also Russian military is also working in
[45:20.760 --> 45:25.040]  very close cooperation with Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they're
[45:25.040 --> 45:29.120]  monitoring not just the military situation not just Tripoli and other
[45:29.120 --> 45:33.560]  cities in Libya they're also paying a very close attention to the oil
[45:33.560 --> 45:37.920]  extraction facilities and they are keeping us up to date as to what is
[45:37.920 --> 45:42.360]  happening on the ground from space okay I mean many thanks for the update that
[45:42.360 --> 45:45.720]  was our team to the make a lose could they're reporting from you have Russia
[45:45.720 --> 45:51.080]  today reporting on the fact that the top US military chiefs of staff say that
[45:51.080 --> 45:56.920]  the supposed airstrikes that launch this whole mass concern for humanitarian
[45:56.920 --> 46:01.120]  suffering from the same people who gave you predator drone airstrikes that kill
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.280]  hundreds of people every month did in fact never take place can we believe
[46:06.280 --> 46:10.520]  the Russians well we can certainly believe the fact that almost every one
[46:10.520 --> 46:16.680]  of these quote humanitarian wars has been contrived on fabricated purposes
[46:16.680 --> 46:23.360]  tricked up shocks and outrageous many of which are manufactured by PR firms and
[46:23.360 --> 46:30.680]  in fact TV news crews as we saw with the Serbian example latest news from Libya
[46:30.680 --> 46:37.760]  more than 140,000 people flee Libya voice of America's reporting the United
[46:37.760 --> 46:43.640]  Nations refugee agency says over the past 10 days more than 140,000 people have
[46:43.640 --> 46:49.840]  fled to Egypt and Tunisia from Libya the UNHCR says tens of thousands of people
[46:49.840 --> 46:56.160]  are stuck at the borders and are in urgent need of help so you've got the
[46:56.160 --> 47:02.880]  refugee crisis spiking of course you've got oil shooting up close again I believe
[47:02.880 --> 47:09.240]  to a hundred dollars a barrel and now we've got Governor Haley Barber coming
[47:09.240 --> 47:14.360]  out and accusing the Obama administration of deliberately hiking
[47:14.360 --> 47:21.400]  energy costs for their green economy CNN reporting Barber Obama's policies to
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.360]  drive up energy prices CNN with price of gasoline rising for the eighth
[47:27.360 --> 47:31.480]  consecutive day Mississippi Governor Haley Barber accused the Obama
[47:31.480 --> 47:37.520]  administration of hiking energy costs in an effort to promote alternative fuels
[47:37.520 --> 47:43.880]  and of course it's not really about alternative fuels it's about Obama's
[47:43.880 --> 47:52.600]  new green surf economy the fact is that alternative fuels like biofuels do
[47:52.600 --> 47:58.880]  very little to bridge the gap that any withdrawal of fossil fuels will create
[47:58.880 --> 48:03.600]  and indeed you know a lot of environmentalists support these biofuels
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.480]  and in fact they're replacing endangered flora and fauna in many areas of the
[48:09.480 --> 48:15.800]  world and also thereby directly impacting animal species which has
[48:15.800 --> 48:20.160]  threatened with extinction so the very process that's supposed to save the
[48:20.160 --> 48:25.680]  planet is in fact killing the planet in many areas because huge areas of forests
[48:25.680 --> 48:31.800]  are being cleared for the plantation of these biofuels which are doing very
[48:31.800 --> 48:36.640]  little to fill the gap as quote an alternative fuel well here Barber's
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.200]  saying quote in 2008 four dollar gasoline brought my state to its knees
[48:41.200 --> 48:45.400]  before Wall Street melted down and we have blown through three dollars a
[48:45.400 --> 48:50.160]  gallon on our way to four Barber a Republican who is seriously considering
[48:50.160 --> 48:55.440]  a White House bid said Wednesday in a speech to the US Chamber of Commerce we
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.560]  don't need that where I am but this administration's policies have been
[49:00.560 --> 49:04.640]  designed to drive up the cost of energy in the name of reducing pollution in the
[49:04.640 --> 49:08.760]  name of making very expensive alternative fuels more economically
[49:08.760 --> 49:16.600]  competitive now you also have to I mean Barber's accusing Obama of deliberately
[49:16.600 --> 49:21.720]  driving up energy prices we've been through the evidence over the past
[49:21.720 --> 49:27.480]  couple of weeks where these rolling blackouts which were caused prompted by
[49:27.480 --> 49:33.120]  the cold weather but which would not have been a problem unless the Obama
[49:33.120 --> 49:38.960]  administration and the EPA through their enforcement of carbon tax emission
[49:38.960 --> 49:44.600]  rulings have not completely almost completely bankrupted the coal industry
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.960]  and prevented dozens of new coal fired plants from being built specifically in
[49:50.960 --> 49:57.000]  the Texas area so we've enunciated at length the fact that Obama's energy
[49:57.000 --> 50:04.240]  policy is causing blackouts and energy shortages and now Haley Barber's pointing
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.840]  out that the Obama administration wants to hike costs of energy in an effort to
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.320]  promote alternative fuels they're not concerned about promoting alternative
[50:14.320 --> 50:19.440]  fuels they're only concerned about being the water carriers for the post
[50:19.440 --> 50:23.600]  industrial revolution that the globalists want to ram through and of
[50:23.600 --> 50:29.120]  course the major tenant of that is this so-called green economy which has
[50:29.120 --> 50:32.920]  nothing to do with saving the environment and everything to do with
[50:32.920 --> 50:38.440]  lowering living standards the green economy in Spain has brought absolute
[50:38.440 --> 50:45.920]  devastation on their economy 20% unemployment and the Obama administration
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.720]  is overseeing a similar process here over there in the United States we'll be
[50:50.720 --> 50:54.800]  back with your calls on the Alex Jones show stay tuned to watch the live
[50:54.800 --> 51:03.200]  stream of prison this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[51:03.200 --> 51:07.480]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[51:07.480 --> 51:11.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[51:11.720 --> 51:15.600]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[51:15.600 --> 51:20.120]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[51:20.120 --> 51:24.400]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[51:24.400 --> 51:28.560]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[51:28.560 --> 51:32.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[51:32.840 --> 51:36.560]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.760]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[51:40.760 --> 51:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[51:43.760 --> 51:47.760]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[54:42.400 --> 54:45.280]  Manchester Regional Airport doesn't have any of those controversial body
[54:45.280 --> 54:50.000]  scanners but the legislation is clear if it's past pat downs or use of
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.840]  technology to view certain body parts during random security screenings
[54:53.840 --> 55:00.640]  couldn't put TSA agents in violation of New Hampshire law call it what it is it's
[55:00.640 --> 55:05.040]  sexual assault with the backers of the bill TSA pat downs and body scans amount
[55:05.040 --> 55:09.560]  to a crime and the agents who conduct the search are criminals let's put their
[55:09.560 --> 55:14.400]  name on our sex if I'm to registry and maybe that will tell them look New
[55:14.400 --> 55:18.200]  Hampshire means business that is a crime in this state and we should charge them
[55:18.200 --> 55:22.480]  every single time it wasn't a large crowd in support of the bill to
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.200]  criminalize random pat downs and body scans in New Hampshire but the support
[55:26.200 --> 55:29.600]  was passionate just tear the Constitution up and throw it away
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.620]  Concord's Darren Tapp says security procedures cost him a trip home for the
[55:33.620 --> 55:38.720]  holidays in December this time the news is talking about enhanced pat downs I
[55:38.720 --> 55:41.960]  cried on the phone with my mother explained that I did not wish to submit
[55:41.960 --> 55:49.720]  to enhance pat down there are people in Libya right now I am in the United
[55:49.720 --> 55:53.760]  States his frustration bubbled over after the hearing when he confronted a
[55:53.760 --> 56:02.560]  member of the criminal justice committee as for the TSA officials won't comment
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.280]  on pending legislation except to say that security checkpoints and airports
[56:06.280 --> 56:09.880]  are federal jurisdiction and for some members of the criminal justice committee
[56:09.880 --> 56:14.320]  that's where the question should lie we have to understand that if things need
[56:14.320 --> 56:19.040]  to be changed they have to be done at the federal level and not at the state
[56:19.040 --> 56:23.720]  level I know some backers of the bill say that TSA needs to do away with
[56:23.720 --> 56:27.280]  random screenings all together and instead search only those passengers who
[56:27.280 --> 56:32.040]  look or act suspicious of course I could open up a whole new can of words and
[56:32.040 --> 56:36.200]  some might say that is exactly definition of profiling reporting live
[56:36.200 --> 56:42.320]  Josh McKelvin WR so there we have it and then we had one of the protesters
[56:42.320 --> 56:45.920]  being told well you don't have to get on an airplane you don't have to fly oh
[56:45.920 --> 56:51.320]  really well how about walking down the street how about getting in your car and
[56:51.320 --> 56:57.280]  going down the highway how about taking a ride on the train just as the members
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.960]  of a tourist group did in when they were arriving in Savannah a few weeks ago and
[57:02.960 --> 57:09.240]  of course we had the story out of AOL travel news and the footage which went
[57:09.240 --> 57:15.480]  viral on YouTube which shows the TSA harassing and searching passengers who
[57:15.480 --> 57:20.660]  were disembarking from their train they weren't even getting on the train they
[57:20.660 --> 57:25.280]  were trying to leave the train station they were ordered to go through a TSA
[57:25.280 --> 57:31.720]  grope down procedure including two nine-year-old children and after the
[57:31.720 --> 57:38.000]  fact when the story went viral when it got big TSA blogger Bob this individual
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.080]  who they routinely wheel out to explain away TSA abuses came out and said that
[57:43.080 --> 57:47.600]  the individuals involved in the incident had a choice they didn't have to enter the
[57:47.600 --> 57:53.520]  train station and that they could have avoided the Viper checkpoint pat down
[57:53.520 --> 58:00.080]  grope down which in fact as we learned was a complete lie a fabrication the
[58:00.080 --> 58:04.480]  firefighter who was leading the tourist group said that as soon as they got off
[58:04.480 --> 58:10.440]  the train they were swarmed by TSA thugs who ordered them to enter the train
[58:10.440 --> 58:14.560]  station to quote collect their luggage even though their luggage was out on
[58:14.560 --> 58:21.240]  the platform of the train so again TSA court complete fabrications to cover up
[58:21.240 --> 58:27.960]  their abusive agenda and the fact that this Viper checkpoint was an unreasonable
[58:27.960 --> 58:32.520]  search and the violated the Fourth Amendment will be back to talk about it

[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.200]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:31.000]  welcome back Paul Watson filling in for Alex Jones on this March 2nd 2011
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.040]  edition of the Alex Jones show now before the break we were talking about the TSA
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:40.320]  now a new Hampshire they're introducing a bill which would basically make the
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.720]  grope down procedures an act of sexual harassment which is exactly what it is
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.120]  and of course we had the incident in Savannah where the group of it was a
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.600]  firefighter leading a group of 30 or 40 people in a tourist group they
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.160]  disembarked from the train they'd finished their journey they were wanting
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.440]  to leave the station their luggage was out on the platform but as soon as they
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.200]  stepped off the train they were sworn by TSA thugs who told them to enter the
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.520]  train station and subject themselves to a pat down grope down search which
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:23.600]  included these TSA thugs doing the pat down on two nine-year-old boys the TSA
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.880]  later tried to cover up what was blatantly a clear violation of the
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:34.600]  Fourth Amendment therefore illegal and unreasonable search by claiming that the
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.440]  individuals on the train had the choice to leave the station that they didn't
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:43.960]  have to go through the pat down when in fact the firefighter who was involved in
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.560]  the incident said the exact opposite and here's what he said quote when we got
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:54.320]  off in Savannah there were TSA agents out on the platform that told us to go
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.200]  inside to get our luggage bearing in mind their luggage was actually on the
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.760]  platform they didn't need to go and collect it so we were part of about 20
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.760]  people that wandered inside as soon as we went inside the door there were about
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:13.840]  14 TSA agents waiting and they ushered us into a roped off holding area they
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.720]  stated we were all being searched as well as our luggage that is their hand
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.640]  luggage we told them we just got off the train they said they didn't care that if
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.000]  we entered the building we were subject to search we told them we didn't want to
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.400]  enter the building that they told us to and he writes that their luggage was
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:40.080]  never inside it was waiting for them on the train platform so again TSA on their
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.200]  own website has been caught in a clear lie saying that these people had the
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.560]  choice to leave the station when in fact they were told to enter the station by
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.520]  TSA goons so they could conduct this grope down of the nine-year-old boys
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.360]  very important of course for basically a completely empty train station they'd
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.480]  finished their journey so again you can't avoid it by not flying it's
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.840]  everywhere it's in the train stations it's on the highways it's on the street
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:15.600]  corners the mobile radiation scanners are coming to your neighborhood you can't
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.040]  avoid it by burying your head in the sand and saying oh I'll just not fly when
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.640]  it's all coming to your doorstep which is why we need to support the actions of
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:29.640]  those in New Hampshire to make the grope down procedure itself an act of
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:35.400]  sexual harassment and of course we need to lobby and support the airports to
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:42.520]  kick out the TSA all together and replace them with private screeners
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:51.120]  let's go to a call now and it's Stacey in California you're on the air go ahead
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.320]  Stacey Ben in Indiana you're on the air go ahead
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.800]  hello thanks for taking my call Paul and a huge info war supporter I'm a prison
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.600]  plaintiff TV member and I just want to say thanks for all the work you guys do
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:13.080]  and you guys really inspired me to take action against the globalist I wanted
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:21.520]  to bring up a point the Fox Nation media I video of the Alstones appearing on the
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.080]  view seems to be edited where he says building seven they cut out the seven
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.920]  it sounds like he's just saying buildings which is more obscure but I
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.000]  just got to check that out and see if I'm correct about that yeah I received
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.880]  an email about that didn't get a chance to look at the video today but we'll
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.080]  definitely do so because of course if they edited out seven in the words
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.280]  building seven then that's another cover-up just as they edited in the wrong
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:54.720]  footage when Ron Paul won the CPAC Paul very devious on behalf of Fox News so
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.400]  we'll definitely check into that we'll be back with more of your calls after
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.240]  break on the Alex Jones hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.240]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.040]  finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.600]  Americans at home turn members influence on our president in Congress and they
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:23.760]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.080]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.360]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.640]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.160]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:46.400]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.400]  have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy a fall of the Republic on DVD at

[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:17.400]  radio network
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:26.560]  oil has jumped to 101 dollars a barrel over 101 in fact on the back of news
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.440]  that an airstrike near an oil term terminal was launched by Gaddafi's
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.640]  forces of course we were talking about last week's airstrike in the previous
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.520]  segment there's no doubt that Gaddafi is now employing airstrikes against these
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.200]  rebels in the east of the country Reuters oil rose on Wednesday as
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.840]  escalating violence in Libya threatened the OPEC nations oil infrastructure and
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:56.720]  markets braced for a potential prolonged disruption prices jumped to close in on
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.480]  a to close in on a fresh two and a half year high on news that fresh airstrikes
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:07.040]  hit Braga about two kilometers from a Libyan oil terminal after MoMA
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:11.480]  Gaddafi launched a land and air offensive to re take territory in
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:16.520]  Libya's east quote it looks like an attack fairly close to what is one of
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:22.360]  Libya's largest storage and export terminal said Andy Labau trader at MF
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:29.520]  global in New York also Royce's reporting rebels in east Libya want a UN
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:37.040]  backed airstrike oh now we see that the pretext for humanitarian intervention is
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.600]  them coming to the fore which is interesting because Curt Nimel wrote an
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.440]  article a couple of days ago in which one of the rebel leaders said that they
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:52.040]  were not interested in air in any foreign military intervention so now
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:57.680]  Reuters is reporting a rebel national Libyan council leader in east Libya called
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.960]  for a UN backed airstrike on foreign mercenaries used by leader MoMA Gaddafi
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.280]  against his own people spokesman for the council said on Wednesday Hafiz
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.400]  Golger a spokesman for the council based in the rebel held city of Benghazi
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.480]  told a news conference Gaddafi was using quote African mercenaries in Libyan
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.480]  cities which amounted to an invasion of the oil producing north African region
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.080]  so because Gaddafi's using African mercenaries now the the rebel leader
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:32.160]  which is the same individual who only two days ago said he didn't want foreign
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:39.000]  intervention is now calling for UN and NATO mercenaries to invade the country of
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.880]  Libya very interesting development indeed of course all this is completely
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:52.040]  based on humanitarian concerns as the mass media will obediently tell you and
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.800]  it has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that Libya holds the largest
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.120]  amount of oil reserves on the entire African continent complete coincidence
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.480]  go back to sleep watch dancing on ice John in Kansas you're on the air go
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.560]  ahead hello hello you're on the edge on go ahead yeah okay I want you to go to
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:24.360]  Google if you can and there's a PDF of unclassified document it's called it's
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:32.640]  basically con Edison's involvement in 911 in World Trade Center just type in
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:44.880]  cryptome.org space con c o n space Edison e d i s o n and in that article it talks
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:53.280]  about how this employee for con Edison named Fred Sims thought World Trade 7
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:59.920]  would collapse at 4 15 p.m. when it collapsed at 5 20 p.m. in reality and so
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.560]  he knew an hour and five of minutes ahead of time that World Trade 7 would
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:13.480]  collapse even though it was not hit and also keep in mind con Edison was also
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:20.920]  bombed in the 50s by the guy named George the mad bomber Metzky so that was a
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:26.760]  former employee he they were bombed and they were involved in bombings in the
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:37.360]  past also con Edison was contracted with the energy grid for bowling green
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.320]  district in New York City and what's interesting about the bowling green
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.560]  district in New York City is that it held many architectural firms in the
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:54.160]  bowling deep green district it also held firms dealing with intellectual
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.280]  property maybe setting more secure you know dealing with the you know I this
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.760]  cyber security a lot of it has to do with intellectual property on the
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:12.120]  Internet another thing there's the South Court district I mean court district
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:22.120]  dealing and the courts deal with let's see what is it called with the
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:30.920]  businesses going out of business basically it dealt with securities fraud at
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:40.120]  South Court district is within I mean South Court also dealt with it let's see
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:46.000]  well basically it did dealt with bad cases dealing with securities fraud as
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:54.440]  well and let's see what else is interesting but on the point of coin
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:00.120]  Edison I mean just like mr. pull it Larry Silverstein they were in on the
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:07.680]  post 9-11 bounty with their attempt to get 200 million dollars in rebuilding
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:13.720]  money after 9-11 they failed in that so certainly a conflict of interest there
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:20.920]  in attempting to exploit the post 9-11 bounty and as we know BBC CNN were both
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.520]  reporting that building 7 had collapsed an hour before it actually did so the
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.200]  word was out ahead of time on that as we've reported thanks for the call we're
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:37.240]  going to go to Shay in Washington you're on the air Shay go ahead yeah hi Paul
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:41.040]  this is first-time caller but I've been listening to you guys every day for
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.000]  months and wanted to thank all of you for what you're doing and all the hard
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.640]  work you guys are putting in we're you know I'm mobilizing locally and it's
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.560]  just like more and more people are doing the same and one question that I
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:01.520]  haven't heard asked by anybody that I feel like is an important question for
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:10.320]  for all of us to keep in mind is say today is the new V day say today is
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.680]  victory day we beat the globalists we've retaken our government what what does
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.880]  life look like to us I mean like is are we talking a really fundamental change
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:28.400]  of the social political economic order or are we just talking it all just boils
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.320]  is simply down to is there's a lot more accountability and transparency or
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:40.240]  government I mean how do you guys see that well first of all you don't have
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.320]  a revolution like we've seen in Egypt where there's nothing in the aftermath
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:49.360]  to replace it and take replace the corrupt system and take the reins of
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.640]  power because in Egypt there's a complete vacuum the so-called revolutionaries
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.360]  the ones who you know haven't been rallied and provocative by the US
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.200]  embassy as was reported three years in advance they had nothing to replace
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:10.160]  mubarak which is why the corrupt military dictatorship was behind mubarak
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:16.080]  in the first place simply took the reins of power and he's now doing deals with
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:22.600]  the same personalities that put mubarak in in the first place so of course the
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.880]  beginning of any restoration of the republic is to work out you know what's
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:33.520]  gonna what's gonna replace the corrupt system afterwards and of course we've
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:39.400]  got very few politicians in Congress and in the Senate that can be tasked with
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.400]  doing that Rand Paul and Ron Paul are two of them certainly every one of their
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:51.520]  proposals for how a post call it a post corrupt system will look like you know
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.640]  their proposals will form the framework of that key central to which is the
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:01.920]  abolition of the Federal Reserve but I don't think we're close any time soon to
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.120]  restore in the American Republic I mean it probably won't even happen in our
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.520]  lifetime so we're not even at the point of deciding what happens afterwards we've
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:17.160]  got to alert millions more people to the fact that it is corrupt in the first
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:22.760]  place because you know the vast majority of Americans still got their head in the
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.680]  sand and they're still watching you know dancing on ice with Bristol Pailin or
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:34.400]  whatever so you've got a long way to go before we get to that stage thanks to the
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:40.600]  call Rowlingstone magazine has done a profile of Alex Jones which has been
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:46.920]  released today and it's going to be in the next hard copy issue and Alex told
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.400]  me about this I believe two or three months ago that they were doing this
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:56.160]  piece because obviously the Rowlingstone journalist who wrote the article was in
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:02.640]  and around Alex in his office preparing material for the piece it's a four page
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:10.000]  article on their website it's mainly positive the overall impact of it is
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  positive certainly when it talks about Alex's personal motivations and is you
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.760]  know the history of how he came to be in the role that he's in today how he was
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.120]  a you know a quote hellraiser when he went went up against cops in Dallas and
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:33.600]  how that led him to voraciously consume history books and work out how elites
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.200]  throughout history have dominated their populations through the same control
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:45.320]  methods so personally speaking in terms of Alex it's quite a positive
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:55.440]  profile it talks about how Alex doesn't get into the kind of stuff that you know
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:02.880]  is an obsessive habit amongst a lot of a lot of Alex's critics and how this is a
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:09.080]  you know only benefits his message in the long run but it does raise certain
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:16.000]  political issues in an attempt to denigrate Alex's political stance as I
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.120]  wrote in my blurb today population control the writer sites national security
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:28.760]  memorandum 200 and this is the infamous Kissinger memo in which they openly
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.440]  state that they're going to use food as a weapon as a means of thinning third
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:39.640]  world populations the writer kind of brushes over in an effort to portray
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.360]  Alex's exaggerating the issue but we'll go over it more in the next segment and
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:50.680]  we'll be taking your calls as well on the Alex Jones show live at prison

[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:28.200]  Rolling Stone magazine today is calling Alex Jones the most paranoid man in
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.960]  America and despite the headline it's actually quite a positive encouraging
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.200]  article one of the things we were talking about before the break is where
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:45.240]  the writer kind of dismisses Alex's entire stance on population reduction by
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:51.840]  having his own personal interpretation of Kissinger's national security memorandum
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:59.520]  200 in which the globalists openly talk about the need to curb the numbers of L
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:06.240]  D C people lesser developed countries and in doing so they talk about using
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:12.000]  food as a weapon but the writer of the Rolling Stone article defines it as
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.240]  quote little more than government officials beginning to grapple with the
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:22.160]  strategic implications of runaway population growth and of course as we've deeply
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:29.320]  and exhaustively documented in a series of articles and indeed in Alex's own
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:36.320]  documentary film Endgame the whole eugenics movement cannot be boiled down
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:42.360]  to one Henry Kissinger memo of course the history of it betrays its nefarious
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:51.840]  nature of course eugenics grew amongst the aristocracy 19th century Britain and
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:58.320]  it was then exported it manifested itself under Hitler's third Reich because
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:04.640]  of course John D Rockefeller's father exported Germany through his bank
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.520]  rolling of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute which led to Mengele and the
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.680]  super race and all this other Nazi ideology and that's the reason why you
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.960]  know the pseudo science of eugenics became so unpopular after that and it
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:29.040]  was had to be rebranded in the 1950s in America and in the West generally as
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:36.120]  family planning and now of course we see Marie Stopes who in fact wrote love
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:45.880]  letters to Hitler was at the Nuremberg Population Congress being lauded by the
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:53.000]  Western media as some great female human rights campaigner when in fact she
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:01.240]  was aggressively for the sterilization of the so-called inferior races you know
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.680]  black people so they were all virulently racist individuals pushing eugenics
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:12.880]  and then of course family planning as a mean to thin races of people who they
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:20.800]  deemed inferior to the aristocracy so the population reduction agenda for
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:26.400]  dummies is the preeminent article where we boil down all this information and
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:32.120]  cite numerous examples of where the eugenics agenda is now morphed into the
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.600]  family planning abortion agenda and of course it goes a whole lot deeper than
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:44.240]  the Henry Kissinger memo but in saying that I mean the impression I got on the
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:50.440]  whole from reading this Rolling Stone magazine profile was positive I mean
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.760]  the writer spent a lot of time obviously in Alex's company and that is
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.600]  reflected in the way in which he talks about how Alex is personally motivated
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:07.360]  to do what he does and how it affects his personal life a lot of the time of
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:14.480]  course these mainstream media quote profiles will not only denigrate us
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.440]  politically but they'll go after Alex personally as well we've had some of the
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:24.880]  most vicious smears and hit pieces ever witnessed certainly over the past few
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:30.280]  years but on those terms I mean the the Rolling Stone magazine profile is
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:36.080]  relatively positive so I encourage you to read it for yourself we've got excerpts
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.680]  of it linked up on prisonplanet.com and you can click through and read the full
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:48.000]  article at Rolling Stone magazine and it's entitled talk radio's Alex Jones
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.160]  the most paranoid man in America paranoid about the fact that you know
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:00.360]  they're putting sterilence in the water supply which is precisely what White
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.880]  House science are John P. Holdren said they should do in his 1977 book
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.800]  Ecoscience but again to even discuss it is to be paranoid the most paranoid man
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:16.480]  in America back to the callers Scott in Massachusetts you're on the air go ahead

[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.840]  that a whole Middle Eastern North Africa is melting before our very eyes
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.840]  there's a new iPad 2 and it's exactly the same as the previous one except it's a
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:07.840]  little bit thinner and has a camera on it just hand over your six hundred dollars

[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.840]  good day to you mate how you doing today
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:28.840]  good good to speak to you what's on your mind today
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  I'm kind of new to this and I've talked to on Alex's show here on phone a couple
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.840]  of times but I found something kind of interesting here that maybe you could
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.840]  elaborate on or help me with I'm reading here that the federal
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:48.840]  government was basically filed for like a chapter 11 so to speak bankruptcy
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:54.840]  under the Emergency Banking Act of March 9th 1933 and it was declared by
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.840]  President Roosevelt as being bankrupt and insolvent according to the House
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:05.840]  Joint Resolution 192 I'm understanding now that we are bankrupt so we're
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.840]  basically the stooges for these international bankers so our fight here
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:15.840]  is basically trying to free ourselves of our independence of these
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.840]  knuckleheaded international bankers United Nations and the World Bank
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:26.840]  well that's precisely the point and now they're preparing with glee their
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.840]  banker world currency and of course they can't roll that out without
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.840]  there being this debt crisis and this dollar crisis in the United States
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  total U.S. debt hits 14.195 trillion 99 billion away from debt ceiling
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:48.840]  we have on prismplanet.com today from zero hedge and Tyler Durden
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:52.840]  and the article says now that all auctions from last week have settled the
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:36:00.840]  real debt picture has emerged as of February 28th total U.S. debt is 14.194
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:07.840]  trillion a settlement charge of 57 billion on the day alone as a reminder
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.840]  the total debt limit is 14.24 trillion or 100 billion away so we're about to
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.840]  reach that tipping point of the debt ceiling which traditionally in
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:24.840]  historical terms is the point which marks the collapse of any country when
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:31.840]  we can't anymore fund its military foreign adventures or sufficiently take
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.840]  care of its own population at home so we're reaching that tipping point as
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.840]  we speak thanks for the call Alex in South Korea you're on the air go ahead
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:49.840]  Alex. Hello Paul I'm going to get right into this everybody heard about how
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:55.840]  one of the Google workers turned up in Egypt and it's really strange and one
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:01.840]  thing that people don't realize is that the Google CEO Eric Schmidt is
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.840]  actually a CFR member just to remind everybody and so weird like three
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:12.840]  months ago I was reading a foreign affairs which is the CFR journal and
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:21.840]  Eric Schmidt wrote an article stating like how in the future revolutions
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:26.840]  will be started using the internet and the power of social media and this was
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:34.840]  written like I guess October and it's so weird because everything that he
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:40.840]  wrote in that article is pretty much happening today and what's interesting
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.840]  is one of the sub headlines he has in the article is the revolution will be
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:52.840]  podcast and that's basically what happened and now we got this Google
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.840]  worker turning up in Egypt and people are thinking he's helping start the
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:02.840]  revolution so the people are saying he's not and after reading that article
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.840]  three months ago before all this happened I tend to agree that all this is
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:12.840]  happening with Google's help and help of the CFR which Eric Schmidt is the
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.840]  member of so it's really weird.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.840]  That was amazing.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:23.840]  Yeah I mean there was a report out of I believe it was Reuters and it said
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:29.840]  Russia blames Google for stirring Egypt unrest forget Russia Eric Schmidt
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  himself during a public event praised this Google cyber activist his name was
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:43.840]  Whale Gownim a young executive at the company and in fact Schmidt said
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:48.840]  directly that he played a very significant role in stoking up and
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:54.840]  organizing the protest via Facebook and Twitter so Google CEO admits that
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.840]  this Google exec played a direct and pivotal role in stirring up the
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.840]  Facebook revolution in Egypt and then you've got the media saying it's all
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:09.840]  a conspiracy theory invented by Russia and questioning it when it's admitted
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:15.840]  fact and Schmidt himself says that the company's proud of this executive
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.840]  for playing a role in the in the full revolution in Egypt which as we've
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:26.840]  documented was known ahead of time by the US Embassy who sent in sent in
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:31.840]  their operatives to stir it up not that the Egyptians didn't have legitimate
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.840]  grievances but the US knew ahead of time and basically hijacked the
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.840]  revolution as they've now done in Libya and you know preparing to go in
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:47.840]  militarily with US special forces having already landed according to sources
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:53.840]  but yeah Schmidt is a regular Bilderberg attendee in fact we did an article on
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.840]  this couple of weeks ago by Steve Watson ten ways in which Google runs the
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.840]  world and the evidence is all there Google is an integral part of the
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  Big Brother Panopticon it's hooked in by the CIA and the NSA that's all
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:14.840]  admitted it's not a conspiracy theory and now we have you know the search
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:20.840]  engine being involved in overthrows of foreign governments so Schmidt's a
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:25.840]  pivotal player in the New World Order just like Bill Gates and just like
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:32.840]  Bill Gates attended the last Bilderberg meeting in Spain Schmidt himself
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:37.840]  is a regular attendee of the globalist confab and that's why he comes out
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.840]  with these statements about you know privacy is dead why do people care
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:46.840]  about privacy of course because his company is directly violating privacy
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:52.840]  in a myriad of different ways not least of which now forget Google Street
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:58.840]  View they've got Google cameras mounted on what look like segues and they're
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.840]  going through parks taking pictures of everything so basically mapping out
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:09.840]  the entire world Street View of course was the first incarnation of that
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.840]  Google's an intimate player in this Big Brother system that's going to get us
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:22.840]  all in the databases and basically to collapse any faith we had in you know
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.840]  holding on to the last remaining strands of our privacy Schmidt says
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.840]  privacy doesn't matter and he goes right ahead and destroys it and now
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.840]  they're involved in these revolutions as well Stacy and San Diego you're on
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:41.840]  the air go ahead good morning I'd like to catch back on that subject you brought
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.840]  up about Rolling Stone accusing Alex Jones of being overly paranoid and
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:51.840]  let's talk about a paranoid conspiracy theory if you will Alex has been
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.840]  very good about reporting on FEMA's activities and the things that FEMA
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.840]  does on behalf of the government and there's a story that I don't believe
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:05.840]  I've seen Alex report on yet and that is the FEMA NLE exercise for 2011 and
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:10.840]  this is for May of this year and it surrounds the new Madrid fault zone in
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:15.840]  the United States which is in the Midwest and it surrounds an earthquake
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:21.840]  disaster scenario and this happens to be the 200 year anniversary of the new
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.840]  Madrid fault earthquake which happened in 1811 it was a series of two or three
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.840]  earthquakes that were all of a magnitude 8 or greater that occurred in 1811 in
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:35.840]  February and they were you know devastating at the time and they would be
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.840]  incredibly devastating today and would cause a massive loss of life well it
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:44.840]  seems that FEMA has been putting out requisition orders on the Internet to
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:48.840]  the public sector starting in January of this year they put out
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:55.840]  requisition orders to public entities to fill things like MRE's blankets
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.840]  underwater body bags gasoline bottled water in liters and they're asking for
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.840]  massive massive amounts 140 million MRE's they want 7 million MRE's for a
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:13.840]  10-day period two meals a day that's 140 million meals so that seems odd to me
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.840]  that if you're running an exercise why would you need to actually go and
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:21.840]  purchase these items so I just wanted to hear your comment on that and know if
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.840]  you guys have researched this story and are going to report on this story
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.840]  well we're reporting on it right now national level exercise 2011 private
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:38.840]  sector participation this is a press release by FEMA.gov NLE 2011 will
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:42.840]  simulate the catastrophic nature of a major earthquake in the central United
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:49.840]  States region of new Madrid seismic zone and as you say the new the year 2011
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:55.840]  is the bicentennial anniversary of the 1811 new Madrid earthquake and of
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:00.840]  course we've carried articles on prismplanet.com about how a lot of people
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:06.840]  expect that this earthquake could be set to repeat itself so FEMA is basically
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.840]  going to simulate a catastrophic aftermath of that earthquake and as you
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.840]  said they're going to set up command post emergency operation centers to
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:22.840]  include federal facilities in the Washington DC area and of course don't
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:28.840]  forget the story we reported last week on prismplanet.com FEMA which of course
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:35.840]  is supposed to be based in America was at ground zero last week when the New
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.840]  Zealand earthquake struck so they were conveniently in position there of
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.840]  course you look back to Hurricane Katrina and it was FEMA that was cut in the
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.840]  communication lines and sabotaging the relief efforts there and why would they
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.840]  do that because every time such a catastrophe occurs and the response is
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:00.840]  not swift enough is not good enough if people die then the only result that
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:05.840]  ever happens is that FEMA goes and complains to Congress and gets more
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:12.840]  power and more funding so you know it's like it's like a business that goes out
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:17.840]  and fixes windscreens if there were no broken windscreens they won't make any
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.840]  money they'd be out of business FEMA fixes catastrophes and the aftermath of
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:27.840]  catastrophes and so if none occurred then there'd be no call for them to
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.840]  exist as a federal agency so they're always conveniently on the ground when
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:37.840]  these disasters happen and they often are caught as in the case of Katrina
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:43.840]  sabotaging the relief efforts and escalating the crisis which eventually
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.840]  leads to them getting more power and funding we've covered these NLE
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:52.840]  exercises in the past and so we'll have all eyes on that one especially as it
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:57.840]  relates to the New Madrid fault line which we've posted numerous articles on
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.840]  PrisonPlanet.com about that being a very sensitive and potential area for an
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:09.840]  earthquake thanks to the call Matt in Oklahoma you're on the air go ahead
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:16.840]  do we have Matt? Yeah I'm here. Yeah go ahead Matt. Yeah first time caller
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:21.840]  PrisonPlanet member and I just actually had two questions instead of reiterating
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.840]  what you're already conveying to me it seems like all this information you
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:31.840]  guys are doing very well and putting out is so overwhelming you have all your
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:36.840]  floor rise at the local level all the way up to the IMB and international
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.840]  banking is there anything that's put together such as a structure or a
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:47.840]  hierarchy that somebody could kind of get a I'm a visual guy I look at and say
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:54.840]  okay I can assist in this region at this particular project something that
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:59.840]  actionable that can actually do something instead of saying yeah I'm passing
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.840]  the information everybody acknowledges it's going on but what can we truly do
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:10.840]  about it? I think what you have to do as a listener is not necessarily try and
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:15.840]  ape what we're doing we're basically a news organization so we are tasked with
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.840]  covering every single issue which is why it feels overwhelming when there's all
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.840]  these different issues taking place and you feel like you're being bombarded
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:30.840]  with all this information which is what we feel like because that's our job to
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:35.840]  cover it every day but the thing that you as listeners need to do I believe is
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:40.840]  to like Alex says pick one individual issue for example floor ride in the
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:47.840]  water in Canada in the UK and parts of the US recently we've seen local
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:51.840]  authorities getting together and saying that they're going to remove floor ride
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:55.840]  from the water supply that is artificially added floor ride and that's
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.840]  because of pressure from local groups and the pressure that has been put on them
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:07.840]  so you need to get local and you need to pick one particular issue it's no good
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.840]  running around like a headless chicken trying to you know take the world on
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.840]  your back because one person could never change everything but if you pick
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:21.840]  one individual and then get together with like-minded people in your local area
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:29.840]  then you can create the pressure groups that lead to genuine change in your local
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:34.840]  region for example with getting the floor ride out of the water so I know
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:37.840]  exactly where you're coming from when you say it's overwhelming that's because I
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:43.840]  think too many people are trying to fight on too many different fronts when the
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:50.840]  most successful approach would be to spread our info warrior battalions
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.840]  locally and into individual issues on which they can campaign lobby and fight
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:01.840]  so I think that's the way to do it rather than to try and take on everything
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:08.840]  and everyone at once thanks for the call Fred in Ohio you're on the air go ahead
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:15.840]  rather but anyway since this knowledge is out there that all the Arab countries
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:21.840]  are going to be double-crossed doesn't there are kyder and the revolutionaries
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.840]  over there know that they will also be double-crossed as all a lot of nations
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:32.840]  already have and so will we be double-crossed the American people
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:38.840]  well it's a good point you got to realize that these so-called revolutionaries
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:43.840]  do have genuine grievances both in Egypt and in Libya
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.840]  they want to see the corrupt government kicked out I mean most of the people in
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.840]  Iraq you know weren't fans of Saddam Hussein but what was to come
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.840]  I'm sure they'd have preferred to stick with Hussein
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:02.840]  well as regards al-Qaeda I mean al-Qaeda is the base the leaders of al-Qaeda are
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.840]  all in the pocket of the US military industrial complex that's why the
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:11.840]  spiritual leader of the hijackers was meeting there at the Pentagon
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:16.840]  and while al-Aki just months after 9 11 so regarding the the leaders of al-Qaeda
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.840]  they're totally in the pocket the revolutionaries themselves they're just
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.840]  following their own grievances and as I talked about earlier in the show first
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:32.840]  we had the rebel leader in Libya saying that he didn't want foreign intervention
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.840]  and now the news today is saying that he's calling for the UN to help
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.840]  oust Gaddafi with a strike so they're trying to get a piece of the pie for
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.840]  themselves and in in that process opening up their country to complete
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:52.840]  globalist domination which is exactly why the globalists are hijacking the
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:51:18.840]  revolution will be right back at the break stay tuned prisonplanet.tv

[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:33.840]  stay tuned for that BBC News Frankfurt Airport shooting two US servicemen
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:38.840]  dead two US servicemen have died after a gunman opened fire on a bus carrying
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:43.840]  American military personnel at Frankfurt Airport police say at the moment it
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:50.840]  is that the gunman hasn't been identified so we wait to see if that will be tied
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:57.840]  into the unfolding situation in Libya and general opposition to US military
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:03.840]  intervention which of course as a recent Rasmussen poll showed is shared by the
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:09.840]  majority of the American people John in Michigan go ahead you're on the air
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.840]  hi Paul how are you doing good what's on your mind today I was wondering since
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.840]  it's essentially emitted that the anthrax attacks or a false flag attack and
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.840]  the case against Bruce Ivan's was complete garbage I was hoping that you could
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.840]  bring us up to date and summarize the attacks as to what we know today and
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:33.840]  specifically I'd be interested in hearing your take on Dr. Phil Zach yeah
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:39.840]  well we know that the the case against Ivan's is completely concocted of
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.840]  course the anthrax attacks came in the aftermath of 9-eleven in the very days
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:49.840]  after 9-eleven and it emerged later that the entire White House Cabinet
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:55.840]  Bush and all these advisors were on Cipro the anthrax fighting antibiotic so
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.840]  when it appeared clear that the government had prior knowledge of the anthrax
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:05.840]  attack which of course was used to continue the fear mongering surrounding
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:09.840]  the threat of terrorists against America while they prepared the Patriot Act and
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.840]  the police state rollout that was immediately to follow they had to keep
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:20.840]  the paranoia running high and they did so with the anthrax attacks and it came out
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:26.840]  that the case against this individual was completely concocted because the
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:32.840]  attack was a false flag I believe Steve Watson wrote a story on that recently
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:37.840]  with all the latest developments and it'll be in the featured news archive
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:43.840]  of prismplanet.com so all the latest developments on Irvine and Bruce Irving
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:49.840]  sorry and that anthrax attack false flag is contained in that article.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:56.840]  Duke Box in North Carolina you're on the air go ahead. Hello can you hear me okay?
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:00.840]  Yes what's on your mind today? Okay you'll have to forget my ignorance is this

[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:11.840]  interview uh had it up on YouTube a few months ago?
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.840]  I'm not sure what you're talking about thanks to the cold Richard in Vermont go
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:22.840]  ahead you're on the air. Yeah my name is Richard. Yeah go ahead Richard what's
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:27.840]  on your mind? Oh okay I got on there I want to say hi to Jim and Kathy down in
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.840]  North Carolina but I got a question directly what's a good search engine
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:37.840]  this isn't like an advertisement or anything I'm just looking for good
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:44.840]  information what's a good search engine besides Google because I've totally lost
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:52.840]  trust in them. The best one that we found which we use on info wars.com is
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:58:00.840]  startpage.com and they're all about privacy and not submitting your searches
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:05.840]  to the government which Google enjoys doing so I mean that's the one that we
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:13.840]  recommend people use startpage.com thanks for the call and we have run out of
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:17.840]  time for this segment but coming up is Aaron Dykes and he's going to be
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:22.840]  interviewing the father of Reaganomics Paul Craig Roberts about myriad of issues
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:27.840]  I've been Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones you can continue to watch
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:33.840]  a live stream at prisonplanet.tv stay tuned for Aaron Dykes and Paul Craig
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:49.840]  Roberts don't go away thank you for listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.840]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:57.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:01.840]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:05.840]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.840]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:13.840]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:17.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:21.840]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:29.840]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:32.840]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:36.840]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:41.840]  for Alex as you know if you've been listening to the show he left sick
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:45.840]  earlier but he called me into the break talking about the Rolling Stone
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:51.840]  article again their headline is talk radios Alex Jones the most paranoid
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:56.840]  man in America how Jones is trying to overthrow the global Stasi Borg
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:02.840]  state one conspiracy theory at a time and it's not entirely an unfair article
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:07.840]  they did spend a lot of time speaking with Alex trying to get to know who he
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:12.840]  is researching his past getting becoming familiar with his personal stories
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:18.840]  and it's accurate in a lot of ways along those lines but at the same time it is
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:23.840]  a little silly because they're still they're still denying reality out there
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:27.840]  not talking about what's really going on in the world trying to make us look
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:31.840]  kind of like little people here when Alex has been so much on the cutting
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.840]  edge on the threshold of knowing what's really going on he's been proven right
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:40.840]  over and over but it is kind of a positive progression overall there's been a
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:44.840]  lot of hip pieces only a few years ago you would see most of these articles
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:48.840]  completely attacking Alex and just trying to discredit everything he's doing
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:55.840]  now it's more in between the lines kind of subtle just trying to belittle the man
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:00.840]  because they seem to know they can't stop Alex and he's just going to get bigger
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:04.840]  and bigger especially as he continues to be right about so many of these issues
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:10.840]  but mainly we want to talk about the Middle East today and of course coming up
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.840]  at the bottom of the hour we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:18.840]  expert on the economy from the Reagan administration we're going to talk to him
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.840]  all about oil what's going on in the Middle East and what it means for the
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.840]  economy along with anything else he wants to talk about
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:32.840]  his latest headline from today the perfidity of government evidence
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:38.840]  versus denial basically about how our government has been treasonous disloyal
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:44.840]  has gone against us by allowing Wall Street to completely hijack the bailout
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:49.840]  for its own purposes and take over the wider economy at the expense of the
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:54.840]  middle class and ordinary Americans everywhere of course gold is hitting a
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:59.840]  new high as tensions mount in the Middle East that's Kurt Nemo's headline from
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.840]  yesterday I don't have gold prices today can y'all pull that up
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.840]  but he writes once again gold serves as a solid refuge for jittery investors
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:16.840]  as the US and its globalist partners prepared to unleash the fury of NATO
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:20.840]  and the prowess of the US military on Libya and thus begin a new round of
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:25.840]  expansion in the oil rich Middle East gold futures closed at a new record high
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:30.840]  and of course that's what we expect to see particularly when new pressures put
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:37.840]  on oil due to Libya Gaddafi the man his son came out on the press
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.840]  and announced declared that they were a very humble family very humble means
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.840]  that they had very kind of respectful means but now they have in the daily mail
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:52.840]  the dictators dough the astonishing wealth of Gaddafi and his family revealed
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:57.840]  they're estimating that he has at least 30 billion of assets and investments
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.840]  that have been seized through various parts of the Western world and that
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:07.840]  that may only be the tip of the iceberg no one is yet sure exactly how much the
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:13.840]  family owns that's very interesting and of course we have oil surging in Libya
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:21.840]  as an airstrike occurred very near to the oil terminal this was breaking as
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:27.840]  only an hour ago there was an earlier report regarding the rebels fighting
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:33.840]  Gaddafi forces over a Libyan oil port excuse me and we're going to get more
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.840]  into that in detail after the break I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in for Alex Alex

[02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:20.840]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:25.840]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:30.840]  attention to the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:35.840]  short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing

[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.840]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:49.840]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:05.840]  the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:10.840]  of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:14.840]  a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:18.840]  us things seem to be getting worse golden silver haven't heard the news either
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:22.840]  they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to converting

[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:18.840]  Michael talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:25.840]  okay we are back on March 2nd 2011 I am Aaron Dyke sitting in for Alex
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:30.840]  hopefully he'll be back tomorrow and feeling better but that remains to be
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:37.840]  seen right now we want to get more into oil and Libya but first I just want to
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.840]  mention on GCN live you will see Rolling Stone on Alex Jones the most
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:48.840]  paranoid man in America you'll also see on GCN live the perfidity of government
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:53.840]  evidence versus denial a thorough document from Paul Craig Roberts we're
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:58.840]  going to talk to him about that coming up there's also New Hampshire moves to
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.840]  analyze TSA grope down procedures you heard Paul Watson talking about that
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:10.840]  earlier in the program that's Curt Nimmo also at GCN live and so much more
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:17.840]  but now we'll mention how there's been an airstrike near the oil terminal and
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:23.840]  from what this report indicates they did not actually hit any terminals but
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.840]  they're certainly concerned about the infrastructure as the fights go on in
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:35.840]  the eastern part of Libya from Reuters oil prices jumped to near two and a half
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:40.840]  year highs on Wednesday after an airstrike near Libya's oil infrastructure kept
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:44.840]  the market braced for a prolonged disruption from the OPEC nation and
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:49.840]  worried unrest might spread to other regional procedures it's hard to say
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:53.840]  if the Libyan government is trying to target oil infrastructure in the east
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:58.840]  or whether they're just targeting rebel held areas but the markets reacting to
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:04.840]  this threat either way Gaddafi pledged in a fiery speech before hundreds of
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:08.840]  supporters he would crush the revolt against his rule I don't know if it's
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:14.840]  just me but it seems a little reminiscent of when the elder Bush told Saddam
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:19.840]  Hussein don't you go after those oil wells don't you set them on fire just
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.840]  kind of reminding us that it has very little to do with true humanitarian
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:32.840]  concerns a lot more to do with oil and the dollar and world politics we see
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:37.840]  rebel rebels have been fighting Gaddafi forces over Libyan oil port that's the
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:42.840]  earlier report from this morning the opposition fighters fled and regime war
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:48.840]  planes hit an ammunition depot on the outskirts of the nearby rebel held city
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:55.840]  of Ajabaya that's just a guess I'm sure people familiar with Libya would know
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:00.840]  better than me the forces seize the port airstrip and the oil facilities where
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:05.840]  about 4,000 personnel work those reports may not be completely up to date but
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:09.840]  we do know that they're concerned about infrastructure and its effect on the
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:15.840]  price of oil even as more than 140,000 people flee Libya and we wait to see if
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:22.840]  NATO United Nations or US will enter Libya under any kind of free text military
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:29.840]  humanitarian or otherwise already oil has jumped above $100 per barrel that's
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:35.840]  in the AP from today of course oil prices again topped $100 per barrel Wednesday
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:40.840]  is fighting escalated in Libya and petroleum demand grew in the US
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:45.840]  well Libya is a major oil exporter to Europe and has been embroiled in civil
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:50.840]  war that shut down oil production in many parts of the country Libya's supply
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:56.840]  disruption could push oil to $130 a barrel that's from a quote official
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:01.840]  and Reuters again today Libya's troubles created the country's worst energy
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:07.840]  crisis in decades and supply disruptions to world markets could push oil above
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:12.840]  $130 a barrel of course you heard Lindsay Williams on the program in the last
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:17.840]  days and weeks saying that number will probably go to 200 according to his
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:24.840]  sources we have Chavez from Benz Wailers saying that the US is distorting the
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:29.840]  situation in Libya to justify an invasion basically dismissing the
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:34.840]  humanitarian crisis concerns and the rest of it there's a Venezuelan president
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.840]  Hugo Chavez claims US criticism of Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi has a clear
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:45.840]  aim military invasion let's not get carried away by the drums of war
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:49.840]  because the US I am sure they are exaggerating and distorting things to
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:54.840]  justify an invasion Chavez said Monday according to Venezuelan state media
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:13:00.840]  the Human Rights Council in Geneva Switzerland US Secretary of State
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:05.840]  Hillary Clinton spoke there saying the US was exploring all possible options
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:09.840]  and nothing is off the table so long as Libyan government countries continue to
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:15.840]  threaten and kill Libyan citizens I don't know if it is distorted but we do
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:20.840]  expect the US would want to be in the region and that parallels with what
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:25.840]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about today the military the Russian
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.840]  military rather claims the Libya air strikes against the protesters did not
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:37.840]  happen they at least are saying that the claims that Libya that Gaddafi
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.840]  launched air strikes against protesters did not happen saying that it was a
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:47.840]  key event seized upon by the global media as a justification for a
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.840]  humanitarian military intervention and that it was a hoax that's very
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:56.840]  interesting we'll see how the facts play out but it's not I wouldn't put
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.840]  anything past them and of course it would be within their interest to
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:05.840]  further enter the region even though Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:09.840]  warned that we're already too overstretched in the Middle East and then
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:16.840]  another country might be very difficult that does tie in with Cameron
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:22.840]  backtracking on Libya's no fly zone as the US distances itself stating that
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.840]  Obama has publicly distanced himself from Cameron's suggestion NATO should
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:30.840]  establish a no fly zone over the country and their rebel forces should be
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:36.840]  armed but of course nothing is said and done yet I believe we have some
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:48.840]  callers on the line if we could go to those do we have that anyone okay Dave
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:54.840]  in the Ukraine let's hear what you have to say yeah hi there I just wanted to
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:01.840]  say that I think the whole thing with Google and the info wars is coming to
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:07.840]  help they've seem to be blackmailing emails to info wars.com I've wrote
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:14.840]  several emails over Gmail and as a result on a brand new email account
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:18.840]  they asked me for my cell phone number and wrote the reason was because they
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:22.840]  had noticed suspicious activity in all reality I'd only written a couple
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:28.840]  emails from the account one of them was to contest at info wars.com the other
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:37.840]  is I got someone at the site there to check the last video entries I sent a
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.840]  video that I worked on for two weeks and it didn't seem to make it in there but
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:46.840]  it seems very real that that Google's waging war on info wars you might test
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:50.840]  it out yourself as far as people that are worried about Google in their
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:54.840]  privacy there's quite a few services out there that offer proxies and they'll
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:59.840]  take care of that for you so yeah thanks for the call I'm not sure of course
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:03.840]  what's going on with the email itself of course info wars has been
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:09.840]  attacked in the past and been sort of targeted by Google's later policies
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:15.840]  latest policies I'm not sure on that but we will try to double check that
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:21.840]  everyone's been entered into the contest of course the answer to 1984 1776
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.840]  contest wrapped up last night and I know Phil has been working hard on making
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.840]  sure everyone's in there we're gonna double back and try to make sure we
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:34.840]  didn't skip anyone over so maybe you want to send us just a follow-up
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:39.840]  email on that but Google of course is becoming more ever-present in our
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:44.840]  lives all the time and the info wars mission is probably going to clash with
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:49.840]  some of Google's policies already they're delisting so-called content farming
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:54.840]  sites I'm sure info wars could be targeted by that and then of course
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:59.840]  Google is involved in the foreign policy the politics of foreign policy we see
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:04.840]  a caller mentioned earlier with Watson that he saw Eric Schmidt had been
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:09.840]  speaking at the CFR I've also come across that Google is a corporate member
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:14.840]  of the CFR so we know they're they're intervening and all kinds of things in
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:19.840]  our lives and we will try to do the best we can to stay independent of that and
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:23.840]  we'll see what happens from there do we have another caller I don't have the
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:32.840]  list Bill in Minnesota thanks for calling okay hey I just called to try to
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:38.840]  see if I could get Alex's proper address I just sent him a package of material
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:43.840]  via certified mail and I just got it back today that's undeliverable so could
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:49.840]  you give me his address I could get this time because I have criminal charges
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:54.840]  filed against some people in the IRS and a federal magistrate judge here in
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:18:01.840]  Minnesota okay guys so it is the PO box number yes sir our mailing address is
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:14.840]  PO box 19549 Austin Texas 78760 and that is a USPS address so if you didn't send
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:20.840]  it that way but it sounds like you did Bill evidently I had 10549 so but anyway
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:23.840]  it's a criminal action I because they've been stealing money out of my social
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.840]  security benefit and I wrote and told him I showed him the law and if you don't
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.840]  answer what in 30 days according to law you acquiesced everything that I stated
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:36.840]  what they just ignore you like they always do so I filed criminal charges in
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:41.840]  the courts of the United States at common law in Fargo, North Dakota since I
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:45.840]  couldn't file here in Minnesota because one of the magistrate judges here in
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:51.840]  Minnesota is that defendant and and plus I demand a federal grand jury
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:55.840]  investigation of the United States Congress and their criminal conduct for
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:00.840]  allowing these gangsters to operate within the United States of America and I
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:04.840]  asked that the federal grand jury investigation not be limited to issues
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:11.840]  of the internal revenue service and I'm sending out copies of this stuff so that
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:17.840]  he'll understand all right well certainly the IRS is criminal in so many ways and
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:22.840]  we wish you well with that yeah send us your stuff and we'll take a look but
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:28.840]  mainly that's between you and the courts do we have another caller Mike go

[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:25.840]  end but it is pretty good music to come in with at the bottom of the hour
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:29.840]  coming up in the next segment we're gonna have doctor Paul Craig Roberts to
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:35.840]  give us his breakdown on the economy the implications in the Middle East oil
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:40.840]  and a lot more we just had a caller I'm not sure if it was his connection or if
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.840]  he just wasn't too articulate I know he was mentioning the US as a
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:49.840]  corporation certainly we've been taken over by corporations and I know a lot
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:53.840]  of the fine print there's a difference between the United States of
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:57.840]  America and the United States and the use of the commercial code the
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:02.840]  Admiralty stuff I'm not really an expert on that I know a lot of you are
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:06.840]  somewhat familiar with that send me some information if you want certainly
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:09.840]  that's going on and there's a lot of deception that's been standing for a
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:13.840]  long time we're gonna go to another caller I just wanted to mention this
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:19.840]  odd-end item the American Eagle silver uncirculated coin the production of
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.840]  the US meant American Eagle silver uncirculated coins continues to be
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:29.840]  temporarily suspended because of unprecedented demand for Eagle silver
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:34.840]  bullion coins so just another indicator of the pressures on the commodities
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:39.840]  market on the pressures deriving from the collapse of the US dollar and all
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:44.840]  the things going on with oil due to foreign policy in the Middle East but
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:48.840]  right now let's take another caller I believe it's Jason and Virginia is that
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:54.840]  who's on the line yes how you doing I'm doing well how are you oh great to talk
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:26:00.840]  to you all love the work that you all do thank you follow it as follow it as much
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:07.840]  as I can my question is can you still hear me I can hear you go ahead with
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:14.840]  your question okay in Alice's movies and other articles you see you have your
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:20.840]  European Union in there after the North American Union African Union and Asian
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:26.840]  Union yeah is the uprising and what we're seeing now in the Middle East is
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:32.840]  that will that eventually implement the African Union as a globalist continue
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:37.840]  to try to take over the world that's interesting of course the African
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:43.840]  Union is already underway and they have a body and a military force that does
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:47.840]  things in the region from time to time I forget the exact name of it but there's
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:53.840]  also been kind of a Mediterranean Union proposed as kind of a secondary
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:59.840]  Union between for instance France and other European countries along with
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:04.840]  at least some of the lesser Middle Eastern countries and we don't know
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:07.840]  exactly what's going to happen with the Arab League body in the future either
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.840]  but yes there are about 10 regions across the globe who will be kind of
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:18.840]  unified according to the areas but it's all leading to global government down
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:24.840]  the line I'm not 100% up to date on which Union exactly is going to be brought
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:28.840]  into the Middle East but I would expect to see possibly something like that
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:37.840]  what do you think Jason yeah I think the exact same way all right well thanks
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:43.840]  for your call and let's take one more here from Ron in Seattle I believe hi
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:51.840]  how are you doing I can hear you come through please okay my question is this
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:59.840]  I'm being I feel like I am a target for I'm not sure but it has to be a
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:06.840]  government something conspiracy or whatever you want to call it but I
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:12.840]  have a question about how would one get their house debugged or to prove to
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:24.840]  anybody that like in my control is a real situation and that I am a victim I've
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:30.840]  called the FBI I've called my Congress my Senate yeah I don't know if I'm going
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.840]  to be able to help you a whole lot more I would imagine that's a little
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:37.840]  difficult to prove I'm not saying it's not going on certainly those kinds of
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:40.840]  things are going on is there some particular reason you believe you're
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:46.840]  being targeted my particular reason well I I was in the hospital about three
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:56.840]  months ago and it all started after that I was in ICU for three days and my the
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:04.840]  reason why I believe it's social security is because they wanted me to call my
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:08.840]  lawyer to cancel my social security claim that is the go on for two and a half
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:13.840]  years I could have cared less about it until this all came about and the
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:18.840]  problem that I have is proven it to people that this is where you can't go
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:23.840]  to your family yeah I've already had the police out here once and I don't know
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:26.840]  what to do I don't know where to turn I'd be you know I need some help with this

[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:21.840]  okay we are back
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:41.840]  on info wars dot com the Alex Jones show I'm Aaron Dykes filling in on this March 2nd 2011 and I'm honored to be joined by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts he is the father of Reaganomics and a former head of policy at the Department of Treasury during the Reagan years he's a columnist
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:34:01.840]  former editor for the Wall Street Journal he's testified on numerous occasions to congressional committees he's written or co-written over eight books and his latest how the economy was lost the war of the world details why America is disintegrating Dr. Roberts thanks for joining us
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.840]  glad to be with you
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:12.840]  hi yeah you you may not remember me but I was out there interviewing you I believe just over a year ago very much nice to talk to you again
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:24.840]  well if we could break down the oil price tensions in the Middle East and what do you think is going on with Libya or whatever else you'd like to get into first there
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:37.840]  well you know Libya if the revolution continues to succeed we'll probably have a more complete revolution than Egypt
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:58.840]  in Egypt it was peaceful in the sense that the protesters or the revolutionaries did not bring violence to bear and nothing really changed except one two people at the top the entire ruling class is intact the
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:12.840]  bureaucracy is intact the American embassies still there and so it remains to be seen where Egypt is is going to be much different than before
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:35.840]  in Libya thanks to the Gaddafi's mistake he's forced violence upon the protesters and parts of the military have gone over to the revolutionaries and many of the members of the Gaddafi government
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:36:04.840]  including apparently one of his sons have defected and so if this war which is now going on succeeds the clearing out of the up across the Libya will be more complete and there'd be more chance for real change rather than just another representative of the existing power
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:28.840]  so that's my take on Libya the oil price is being attributed to the discontent which is widespread in the Middle East and no doubt this is part of it but it could well be another part
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:46.840]  or the new investment devices that Goldman Sachs came up with in 2008 that has introduced massive speculation into commodity markets until just a few years ago
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:37:03.840]  speculators in commodity markets had position limits imposed on them by regulation so that speculation could never determine the outcome of the markets it was only a relatively small part of the participants
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:22.840]  the market consisted largely of growers in the case of grains and producers in the case of oil and in the years of the serial companies that wanted the grains and the refineries and companies that wanted the oil
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:43.840]  so speculators were just like a middle man to be sure that supply and demand stayed in balance but with changes that Goldman Sachs got passed the regulators it then became possible for speculators to dominate the markets
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:58.840]  and you may remember in 2008 when the oil price ran way up it went up from something like $30 up to $140 something dollars and there was no supply shortage there was no increase in demand
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:18.840]  it was all the result of this new financial speculative instrument that Goldman Sachs had got the regulators that it controls to approve so now you have this new reason for prices to rise
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:32.840]  in fact that's what's happening to world food prices is why now there's so many people are starving due to the push up in the grain price a lot of people say always all because of ethanol and that's part of it
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:45.840]  but the main part is that the investment banks in Wall Street got the laws changed so that speculation can now dominate the commodities markets
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:53.840]  so it's another contribution that Wall Street has made to our welfare and the welfare of the world
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:39:05.840]  and it's amazing how the monster that created the true economic crisis just continues to thrive and take more victims but we know there's oils obviously going to go up in the short term
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:16.840]  and we know it's tied to the dollar as reserve currency of course that's been one of the biggest issues in the past two years where do you see the current stuff going on in the Middle East
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:26.840]  what do you see that affecting the long term issue of whether or not the dollar can or will remain the reserve currency and what else might come in its place
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:45.840]  well you know Aaron it's ironic but if these rebellions revolutions succeed in the Middle East and these Arab countries actually get governments that are not American puppet governments
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:40:01.840]  and that are not part of the American empire and don't serve American hegemy in the Middle East it could actually result in saving the dollar because we might have to withdraw
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:11.840]  and give up the unaffordable effort that we are making to achieve military hegemy over the world
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:21.840]  that's what's bankrupting us that's what's bankrupting us and that's what's driving the dollar down from all the money creation
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:33.840]  that's part of funding a one and a half trillion dollar budget deficit of which 1.1 trillion is the military security complex
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:45.840]  so if these lands succeed and they actually do get independent governments that are responsive to their own people rather than to Washington
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:41:04.840]  it will make the American effort to dominate the Middle East redundant it will be finished we won't be able to dominate it without the puppets and therefore that could actually help us save the dollar
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:14.840]  and change our whole approach to the world and scale back the military security complex and get the budget deficit under control
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:16.840]  that would be a very good thing
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:28.840]  well that's certainly been the elephant in the room but I would imagine we're still a long way off from scaling back that empire but I was very encouraged that Ron Paul was not the only voice during the CPAC conference
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:40.840]  which was around the time the Egypt stuff was unfolding to call for scaling back the troops and suggest that maybe we shouldn't be subsidizing dictators only to replace other bad governments in the region
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:51.840]  but to try to impose our will what do you think about the calls that are at least on the agenda is something about cutting back this empire if only for the debt and deficit sake
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:42:03.840]  yes well you know Ron Paul I think is a sincere person and he's making the point from the standpoint of liberty and freedom
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:15.840]  but I don't know how many of the people who might line up with him will have that same motive there are other motives that are causing people to become less tolerant of all the wars
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:25.840]  and that is what's happening to the dollar because some of them are beginning to realize that the power of the United States really rests on the dollar has reserved currency
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:38.840]  and if they lose that role we can no longer exercise the kind of influence and power we have we would lose control over the international financial system
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:59.840]  some of them are also beginning to realize the implications of 1.1 trillion dollar military security annual budgets when you have one and a half trillion dollar deficits and the implication is if you're going to continue to have that kind of a military security budget
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:22.840]  you're going to have to act Social Security and Medicare and some people are already calling for that so when they are presented with the notion that they're going to have to renege on benefits that the American workforce has paid 15% of their payroll for their entire working lives
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:38.840]  they're going to take this away why so they can pay for wars so that's producing others who come to Ron Paul's side of it but that motive is different from Ron Paul's motive
[02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:54.840]  he I think has the motive that it's just purely liberty and freedom so we have others coming to him who are beginning to see that the cost of the wars may be paid by decimating Social Security and Medicare
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:44:19.840]  and others who see that the war is threatening the dollar as reserve currency so yes a coalition could build and but it would be up against the very powerful military security complex which can finance opponents
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:34.840]  and political campaigns of those people trying to reduce the war and it's hard to say who would prevail in that type of a struggle and also I think the CIA is committed to the wars
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:56.840]  and it's committed to the puppet governments because its influence is over it penetrates everything and so who knows we may have other false flag events that make it impossible to curtail the wars because people get all enraged again
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:15.840]  and we could have false flag events that make the politicians around Ron Paul trying to begin thinking about how to wind these wars down to make them look like they're not patriotic or they're not aware of the real threat
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:34.840]  they're not going to support the troops and the war on terror so the game is far from over you know the problem Aaron is that those forces in the government that have these hidden agendas have gotten away with so much
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:51.840]  they're very audacious now and there's no end to their ability to pull off false flag events that would further their goal of continuing the wars and continuing the effort to acquire a hedge enemy
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:46:06.840]  it's outrageous but I totally agree we would expect to see more false flag action as you say in the region to keep our troops overseas it's just sickening I feel like we should shift gears to get into your most recent article from today
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:32.840]  the profidity of government evidence versus denial and if you could get into that sir but along with the Pentagon who's tried to blame parts of the 2008 financial crisis on supposed terrorist on supposed hostile foreign nations as if we don't know who's running the derivatives from Wall Street from the city of London and the other financial centers could you get into that sir
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:40.840]  well well of course you know it's been a lot of running the derivative market out okay I guess
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:56.840]  I don't even know how they can make that claim it's yeah yes I'll be glad to do that first let me say that I think the most exploited part of the American population is the military families
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:15.840]  they're the ones who were being used for hidden agendas to fight wars in behalf of mega rich armaments industries and in behalf of the Neoconservatives ideology of
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:32.840]  agenomy and then no one is as brutally exploited in the United States today than the armed services in the military families they're the ones who are suffering the most from the property of their own government
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:57.840]  now the column you two spoke about is simply just a book report on three books I'm simply reporting the nature of three books which I think would wake up any American as to what is happening in in front of their eyes
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:20.840]  one book was is by Matt Tavi is called Griffitopia it was published in 2010 that is just a couple of months ago and it shows the inside story of the financial crisis how it all came out of the
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:43.840]  deregulation of the financial market driven by driven by the Wall Street itself the investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and by the idiocy of top policymakers such as Alan Greenspan the Fed chairman
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:49:01.840]  the head of the SEC off 11 and the various sectors of the Treasury from from Ruben all the way through the current one through Paulson to Geithner and the policies of Greenspan are being continued by Bernanke so
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:22.840]  what we what the story that Tavi tells us how our top policymakers and the powerful investment banks deregulated the financial markets so they could rip off everybody and they succeeded massive fraud massive
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:34.840]  criminality not just on the part of the investment banks but also on the part of the public policy makers and no one's been held accountable take away with it
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:58.840]  the next book that that that I take up is by Charlie Savage it's called Takeover by Charlie Savage is a summer cum laude graduate of Harvard with a master's degree in law from Yale Law School and he documents the destruction of the of American civil liberties
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:17.840]  and of the constitutional separation powers by the Bush Cheney regime he goes through it and gives every inch of the of the story shows who the couple parties are such as John you and Biceby
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:38.840]  Biceby is now a federal judge Don you holds a tenured position at the Bolts School of Law University California Berkeley and so we we are now rewarding with prestigious positions of people who absolutely inimical to American civil liberties
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:53.840]  and to the Constitution okay Dr. Roberts we are hitting a break we'll be right back on the other side and certainly we're gonna hear more about how government has hijacked for the interest of a narrow band of people at the expense of assault
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:51:14.840]  the collapse of the dollar is imminent you can protect your wealth by buying gold silver and strong foreign currencies but what if the government confiscates your precious metals implements exchange controls or nationalizes your retirement
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:26.840]  and the bank up plan that's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure go to collapse proof dot com to get your free special report and discover how to store your gold and silver in the world's safest vaults

[02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:25.840]  the new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their control the United Nations would take over America the trilateral commission would control the world
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:33.840]  invisible empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:41.840]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20

[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:17.840]  Okay, we are back in the last segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:25.840]  Anyway, you look at it, everything to do with the economic crisis was bending the rules for the benefit of a few elites.
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:32.840]  And now we're, you know, closing down on pensions, taking back things as you point out.
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:38.840]  People put money into for decades, but they don't hesitate to give money to Wall Street.
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:42.840]  And that's just part of your article on the profidity of government.
[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:51.840]  But switching back to Libya, I forgot to ask you, do you expect to see a U.S.-backed intervention in the region, sir?
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:57.840]  I don't know. I think that we'd probably like to do that so we can leave them with the puppet government.
[02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:20.840]  But unless, you know, Gaddafi can stall his own fall long enough for us to create all this concern about humanitarian lives and stuff that we would use as a cover, it would take a longer period of rebellion for us to be able to get in there, in my opinion.
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:30.840]  You know, let me use our last few minutes to get to the third book in profidity of government.
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:38.840]  And that is the most remarkable book of all. It's by James Douglas. It came out, I think, two years ago, maybe three.
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:53.840]  It's called JFK and the Unspeakable. Of course, JFK is President John F. Kennedy. And what Douglas does is to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that Kennedy was murdered by the CIA.
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:56:19.840]  He proves this several times over. He proves it first with declassified top secret documents that have been coming out in over the years. He proves it by the testimony of eyewitnesses who were excluded, whose testimony was excluded from the Warren Commission report,
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:33.840]  and who were silenced with threats all of their lives until old age when they had nothing else to live. And they came up and started talking and there's so many of them and the story is always the same.
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:45.840]  And he then proves it by overwhelming circumstantial evidence. And so we have a situation and it happened in this way.
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:57:00.840]  Kennedy was brought face to face with reality by the Cuban Missile Crisis because he saw that he and Khrushchev were on the verge of pushing a button that would have annihilated the world, certainly the United States and the Soviet Union.
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:15.840]  And he was being pushed in that direction by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And he resisted and he found he was isolated in his own government and he had to turn to Khrushchev through back channels for help.
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:31.840]  And Khrushchev was feeling the same pressures and having the same reactions and realized sincerity in Kennedy and made the public announcement he would withdraw the missiles. And Kennedy made the public announcement the United States would not invade Cuba.
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:47.840]  Well, this incensed the military security complex, the CIA and the secret service that was supposed to be protecting Kennedy because he had already pulled the plug on the Bay of Pigs and not sent in the Air Force.
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:58:14.840]  He was trying to open connections to Castro. He had the neutral test ban treaty with Khrushchev and Kennedy was seen from within his government as soft on communism, a security risk, somebody who was selling out the country to Soviet deceptive.
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:28.840]  Dr. Roberts, we're running out of time. We really appreciate you joining us. And I totally agree. There's so many hundreds of data points connecting the CIA to the JFK thing, including how they had a team on the ground during the missile crisis.
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:39.840]  We'll have to get into that some other time. The rebroadcast is starting right after the end of my voice. Alex Jones is on the show. Paul Watson and we break down the Middle East.
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:50.840]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:59:10.840 --> 02:59:18.840]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:18.840 --> 02:59:25.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:35.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
