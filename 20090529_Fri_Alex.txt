[00:00.000 --> 00:11.500]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.500 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:39.480]  Texas Alex Jones all right folks we are live I just got off the line with Alex
[00:39.480 --> 00:43.720]  Alex is gonna be joining us around 2 p.m. to really talk about the big news if
[00:43.720 --> 00:49.400]  you missed it just about an hour ago in front of the world Lord Obama our
[00:49.400 --> 00:53.080]  savior our personal Jesus Cristo that's right
[00:53.080 --> 00:59.840]  Obama announced a new uh well what is it a new department we knew this was
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.840]  coming in fact did you guys Google that story yeah yeah print that out for me
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.520]  someone bring it in I did over here cybersecurity chief resigns amid turf
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.480]  battle in a blunt letter Rod Beckstrom cited clash with national security
[01:14.480 --> 01:18.760]  agency now this is before the announcement today that this position is
[01:18.760 --> 01:25.760]  now going to be renamed and retooled into the cybersecurity coordinator oh
[01:25.760 --> 01:29.720]  oh well there's a new department oh everybody's going to have to have
[01:29.720 --> 01:35.400]  digitized medical records oh the smart grid is real mr. Obama you mean this PR
[01:35.400 --> 01:40.760]  campaign with Miley Cyrus and the cyber bullying act see that's a concerted
[01:40.760 --> 01:44.360]  effort don't you understand let's talk about predictive programming for a
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.240]  minute we've been talking by we I'm talking about the info wars crew here
[01:49.240 --> 01:54.480]  and really Alex Jones you know what I'm really looking for back in 2004 Alex
[01:54.480 --> 01:58.680]  Jones went to SeaWorld and really did just an excellent piece on biometrics on
[01:58.680 --> 02:01.480]  what you were going to be doing you're going to be in front of a computer
[02:01.480 --> 02:04.920]  working for the government there are no more jobs folks I'm watching a
[02:04.920 --> 02:09.240]  news at four in the morning and I'm seeing stories about single mothers who
[02:09.240 --> 02:13.440]  are real estate agents in streets where there are no sold homes she has to get
[02:13.440 --> 02:17.520]  rid of her medical insurance her two daughters get sick what do they do oh
[02:17.520 --> 02:22.040]  it's the mobile van the mobile medical van where they'll give you your nice
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.680]  little vaccinations and your nice little drugs oh maybe your kid needs a
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.320]  little bit of riddle and we'll be happy to medicate them meanwhile they're
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.120]  talking about a literal smart grid where everything you do is tracked traced and
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.920]  database do you understand and then Obama at the very end of the speech after
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.120]  he rolls the whole thing out he actually talks about web 2.0 this is a new world
[02:45.120 --> 02:49.120]  we're moving into this is the digital age and in some ways you know it sounds
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.880]  really good that the writers are excellent but when you hear about a new
[02:52.880 --> 02:59.600]  agency you know hackers terrorists cyber security threats all over we have to
[02:59.600 --> 03:02.920]  keep our information safe and at the end he says don't worry we're not going to
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.560]  be surveilling the American people this doesn't mean we're going to track trace
[03:06.560 --> 03:10.440]  and database everything that goes on on the internet internet traffic they're
[03:10.440 --> 03:13.760]  already doing it and coming up in the next segment we're going to play that
[03:13.760 --> 03:19.160]  clip and it's it's I mean of course the controlled mainstream media does not
[03:19.160 --> 03:22.400]  want to talk about the fact that the Obama administration quote-unquote has
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.280]  quietly expanded Bush Bush's legal defense of warrantless wiretapping and
[03:27.280 --> 03:32.800]  it's beyond wiretapping wiretapping is really almost I mean it's a last
[03:32.800 --> 03:40.480]  century term at this point it's not just phones first of all your cell phone can
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.760]  easily pick up this conversation right now got my cell phone in my pocket they
[03:45.760 --> 03:48.760]  could be listening to me not through the radio but if they wanted to hack through
[03:48.760 --> 03:53.760]  I don't have my battery out there's now been dozens of local news stations and
[03:53.760 --> 03:56.880]  national news networks that have done that story that have shown you how
[03:56.880 --> 04:02.120]  easy it is to get into somebody's cell phone and literally not only track the
[04:02.120 --> 04:06.800]  conversations they have via a telephone number but track the conversations that
[04:06.800 --> 04:14.120]  they have walking around and we have a whistleblower outside of AT&T talking
[04:14.120 --> 04:20.800]  about a secret room in which every single thing you do on the internet
[04:20.800 --> 04:29.080]  whether it be an IM an email a Google search a web page visit is is thrown
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.600]  into a dummy room now this doesn't mean that there's all sorts of workers sitting
[04:33.600 --> 04:37.440]  there mulling through this it goes through things like promise and carnivore but
[04:37.440 --> 04:41.680]  now they're building the infrastructure so that people can go through this so
[04:41.680 --> 04:47.080]  that they can have human beings literally invade the privacy of everybody's life
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.400]  through this quote-unquote smart grid it's really a devil grid we'll be back
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.760]  after this it's the Alex Jones show I'm Jason Verma sitting in info wars calm
[04:55.760 --> 05:03.160]  prism planet TV hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long

[06:08.760 --> 06:13.320]  creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see the
[06:13.320 --> 06:17.960]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[06:17.960 --> 06:22.200]  interest of the American people well Obama's already fudging yeah fudged

[06:26.400 --> 06:31.040]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of
[06:31.040 --> 06:38.320]  extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left or

[07:07.040 --> 07:10.520]  this means most people don't really believe a disaster will hit them until
[07:10.520 --> 07:14.480]  it does the ones who truly understand self-reliance are those who've
[07:14.480 --> 07:18.880]  experienced the devastation of a midwest ice storm tornadoes floods or the
[07:18.880 --> 07:22.720]  southeast hurricane season no matter where you live in our great country

[08:00.120 --> 08:08.280]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:15.680 --> 08:21.160]  all right we are back it's the Alex Jones show so we're gonna show this clip
[08:21.160 --> 08:29.760]  in a moment of MSNBC's Keith Overman doing a very good job back in the day
[08:29.760 --> 08:33.640]  when the Bush administration was in office of exposing the fact that the NSA
[08:33.640 --> 08:38.240]  does really again track trace and database everything you do on the
[08:38.240 --> 08:44.440]  internet and outside of that your phone calls your text messages yes they you
[08:44.440 --> 08:47.720]  understand when there is just another dummy line another in other words a
[08:47.720 --> 08:52.160]  double line it doesn't have any kind of discernment it's just tracking tracing
[08:52.160 --> 08:57.280]  and copying every single thing and they said it was upwards around 99% of the
[08:57.280 --> 09:01.560]  phone company so it's not just AT&T that's doing it so you don't think that
[09:01.560 --> 09:09.040]  the NSA and the CIA and the FBI are deeply embedded in the information
[09:09.040 --> 09:13.480]  technology that's out there in things like Time Warner and things like AOL
[09:13.480 --> 09:19.600]  and things like Google give me a break the head of the US Cybersecurity Center
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.200]  has resigned amid persistent battles over areas of responsibility and
[09:23.200 --> 09:27.280]  confusion over the control and protection of the country's vast computer
[09:27.280 --> 09:30.800]  networks and systems Rod Beckstrom's decisions a step down as director of the
[09:30.800 --> 09:35.160]  National Cybersecurity Center comes as the White House is conducting a broad
[09:35.160 --> 09:40.000]  60-day review of how well the government is using technology to protect
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.080]  everything from classified national security data to vital financial
[09:43.080 --> 09:47.320]  systems and air traffic control that's right they're really also talking about
[09:47.320 --> 09:51.760]  this grid where air traffic control is going to be completely computerized and
[09:51.760 --> 09:54.720]  to a certain extent that's a good thing but when you look at something that
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.040]  happens like 9-11 when air traffic control really becomes powerless all of
[10:00.040 --> 10:04.320]  the sudden while these hijacked planes you know make these maneuvers that are
[10:04.320 --> 10:07.680]  out of control and we do have the technology even then global hawk type
[10:07.680 --> 10:11.800]  technology where we could have overridden the plane of by remote control well it
[10:11.800 --> 10:15.160]  seems like everything is going to be outfitted like that they want to have a
[10:15.160 --> 10:20.480]  failsafe on everything that's why it's appealing to have a chip in people's
[10:20.480 --> 10:25.640]  arms I mean indeed we talk about this and people laugh ha ha chipping arm the
[10:25.640 --> 10:29.920]  Saudi Arabians through a company in Germany just tried to patent just try
[10:29.920 --> 10:35.160]  to patent a death chip that's right they said we want to be able to remotely
[10:35.160 --> 10:41.080]  access this chip via GPS so if they get out of line we'll just release a little
[10:41.080 --> 10:44.360]  cyanide into their blood and poof you're done and that sounds horrific that
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.000]  sounds crazy that sounds like the twilight zone in the 50s unfortunately
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.360]  that's also reality so let's play this MSNBC clip and then let's really get
[10:55.360 --> 10:58.920]  into the smart grid you know we're gonna play this clip of Alex Jones we did
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.600]  find it where he was at SeaWorld really breaking down what the next generation
[11:03.600 --> 11:09.320]  of society is going to be like and just the slave the slave-like mentality of
[11:09.320 --> 11:15.240]  the people the slave-like entrapment of the grid he talks about DHS and people
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.960]  sitting there mindlessly just typing away and you're spying on somebody and so
[11:18.960 --> 11:21.720]  not a big deal because it's part of your everyday life and hey you've got
[11:21.720 --> 11:25.080]  computers and or not computers you've got cameras in your home too it's out of
[11:25.080 --> 11:28.720]  control all right let's play this MSNBC clip because people won't believe me that
[11:28.720 --> 11:33.640]  they're already tracking tracing and databaseing every single thing you do
[11:33.640 --> 11:41.400]  let me repeat it every single thing you do on the internet go ahead we got
[11:41.400 --> 11:48.320]  audio guys no audio corporate executives from the legal consequences of having
[11:48.320 --> 11:53.120]  spied on the rest of us in this country on our third story tonight an AT&T
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.080]  whistleblower today told members of Congress much more than that is at stake
[11:57.080 --> 12:03.280]  with the secret crimes that took place at room 641a of AT&T's Folsom Street
[12:03.280 --> 12:06.600]  facility in San Francisco and potentially at others across the country
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.440]  specifically retired 22-year AT&T technician Mark Klein says that despite
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.080]  Mr. Bush's claims the US government used AT&T's cooperation to spy not only on
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.120]  overseas communications but to vacuum up virtually all of America's use of the
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.400]  internet for years email googling web surfing you name it thanks to AT&T
[12:26.400 --> 12:32.040]  secure rooms like 641a in San Francisco Cisco accessible only to those cleared
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.480]  by the NSA client obtaining AT&T schematics showing how the company used
[12:36.480 --> 12:42.000]  splitters to send secure room 641a a duplicate of every fiber optic signal
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.080]  routed through its facilities and involved not just AT&T customers but
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.320]  virtually every internet and telecommunications company and virtually
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.280]  all email and web traffic in the country without a warrant without any
[12:53.280 --> 12:57.520]  mechanism for separating domestic from overseas without separating suspect from
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.840]  citizen we welcome now former AT&T technician Mark Klein whose documentation
[13:01.840 --> 13:06.960]  and claims now part of a class action lawsuit against AT&T one of 38 telecom
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.960]  spy lawsuits AT&T so far declining to comment on the specifics of these
[13:10.960 --> 13:14.320]  allegations Mr. Klein great thanks for speaking out tonight thanks for writing
[13:14.320 --> 13:19.200]  me the Senate is considering granting the telecom executives immunity you lobbied
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.600]  Congress today not to do so how come well if they give them immunity it would
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.000]  probably shut down the lawsuit that I'm a witness for and then the American
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.440]  people find out what's really going on and so that's why I'm here to stop I'm
[13:34.440 --> 13:39.600]  here the Congress should let the judicial process go forward to parter
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.120]  here first can you explain to those of us who can use the internet that would
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.000]  not be able to tell the difference between its physical form and you know a
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.320]  box full of guitar strings exactly what happened in that that's secure room or
[13:51.320 --> 13:55.480]  secret room 641a I don't know what goes on in the secret room because I didn't
[13:55.480 --> 14:01.520]  have security clearance but I know what went on outside because my job I worked
[14:01.520 --> 14:05.880]  in the internet room my job was to connect circuits into the splitter
[14:05.880 --> 14:11.600]  device which was hard-wired to the secret room and effectively the splitter
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.520]  copied the entire data stream of those internet cables into the secret room and
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.000]  we're talking about phone conversations yeah let's pull it for a second pull it
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.240]  for a second all right did you hear that did you hear that he's about to talk
[14:25.240 --> 14:31.240]  about phone conversations email everything gets split into the secret room
[14:31.240 --> 14:36.520]  let's say it again everything gets split into the secret room now obviously if
[14:36.520 --> 14:41.240]  they're you know databaseing everybody's conversations everybody's emails it would
[14:41.240 --> 14:44.600]  be impossible for them to go through everything with a person they don't have
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.680]  the manpower however with software again and this software is public it's
[14:49.680 --> 14:55.360]  there's hearings about it go check it out promise PROMIS and carnivore go
[14:55.360 --> 14:58.920]  check out just those two I'm sure it's gone way beyond that I'm pretty sure
[14:58.920 --> 15:05.400]  that crawl developed those two I may be wrong I'm not perfect folks anyway this
[15:05.400 --> 15:10.960]  software then enables them to pick out keywords phrases trends if you will and
[15:10.960 --> 15:15.040]  it only gets better and then that goes to people that stuff then goes to people
[15:15.040 --> 15:18.080]  then you're put on a list then you're starting to be surveilled then all of
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.320]  a sudden you're a domestic terrorist according to these DHS documents
[15:21.320 --> 15:25.880]  remember DHS being swallowed up by the NSA really was an agency of the NSA
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.960]  this whole intelligence apparatus really stems from executive powers and
[15:30.960 --> 15:37.200]  tyrannical control you know dictatorial means that's what this is and what
[15:37.200 --> 15:40.720]  they're doing now is training the populace that this is okay oh look we
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.840]  need cybersecurity everybody's medical records do need to be in a database
[15:44.840 --> 15:50.200]  that's what you want we want everybody's medical records in a giant smart grid
[15:50.200 --> 15:54.720]  oh we're gonna save lives no you're gonna room lives you're gonna take lives
[15:54.720 --> 15:59.360]  you're gonna enslave lives pull it back about 20 seconds guys and then we're
[15:59.360 --> 16:02.400]  gonna play more of this clip all right hit it right there
[16:02.400 --> 16:07.400]  a box full of guitar strings exactly what happened in that that's secure room
[16:07.400 --> 16:11.440]  or secret room 641 a I don't know what goes on in the secret room because I
[16:11.440 --> 16:16.560]  didn't have security clearance but I know what went on outside because my job
[16:16.560 --> 16:22.120]  I worked in the internet room my job was to connect circuits into the splitter
[16:22.120 --> 16:27.840]  device which was hardwired to the secret room and effectively the splitter
[16:27.840 --> 16:33.760]  copied the entire data stream of those internet cables into the secret room and
[16:33.760 --> 16:39.320]  we're talking about phone conversations email web browsing everything that goes
[16:39.320 --> 16:44.040]  across the internet and that device the splitters is a dumb device it doesn't do
[16:44.040 --> 16:48.480]  any selection at all and the follow-up to that as you mentioned you didn't have
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.440]  the security the NSA clearance so give us an idea how you know all this in
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.960]  addition obviously to your expertise as a technician I had the engineering
[16:55.960 --> 17:01.040]  wiring doctorate documents which told me how the splitter was wired to the
[17:01.040 --> 17:07.600]  secret room and so I I had to know that in order to do my job and so I know that
[17:07.600 --> 17:14.560]  the whatever went across those cables was copied in the entire data stream was
[17:14.560 --> 17:19.880]  copied into the secret room the splitter device has no selective of
[17:19.880 --> 17:24.680]  capability just copies everything we're talking about domestic traffic as well
[17:24.680 --> 17:28.760]  as international traffic and that's what got me upset to begin with yeah I was
[17:28.760 --> 17:31.600]  just going to say Mr. Klein this huge distinction the White House made when
[17:31.600 --> 17:34.720]  all this was first revealed what its defenders still say oh we're just an
[17:34.720 --> 17:38.280]  intercepting international communications no domestic communications
[17:38.280 --> 17:41.920]  were affected I'm taking you don't buy that the slightest no I know that wasn't
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.000]  true and that's what got me going in December 05 when the New York Times
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.200]  revealed this and then the administration came back the president
[17:51.200 --> 17:57.360]  himself and his various cabinet people trying to argue and they still do that
[17:57.360 --> 18:02.000]  is just international communications it just affects a handful of people who
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.040]  look who are making phone calls to the Middle East and I know the physical
[18:06.040 --> 18:10.000]  equipment and I know that's not statement is not true it involves
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.440]  millions of communications a lot of it domestic communications that they're
[18:14.440 --> 18:19.160]  copying wholesale sleeping up into that secret room when you saw this I realized
[18:19.160 --> 18:23.320]  what was going on I mean folks what more needs to be said the Obama
[18:23.320 --> 18:30.600]  administration expanded expanded on the Bush administration's ability to wire
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.880]  tap warrantlessly we have Wisconsin judges and courts ruling that it's okay
[18:35.880 --> 18:43.320]  for police without a warrant or probable cause to fit a suspect with a GPS
[18:43.320 --> 18:47.680]  device and track and trace them I mean that's that's they said that's not a
[18:47.680 --> 18:52.000]  violation of the Fourth Amendment by the way how insane is that somebody else
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.240]  does it in the state guess what they get convicted of oh stalking because that's
[18:55.240 --> 18:59.160]  what it is it's stalking but these jackboot thugs don't care they pull over
[18:59.160 --> 19:04.400]  ambulances and choke people that are trying to save lives I mean that's
[19:04.400 --> 19:09.000]  where we are right now and meanwhile they wrap it in this slick package of
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.240]  Hannah Montana the number one pop star reaching out to your children along with
[19:13.240 --> 19:17.200]  the green movement and everything else and it's gonna be great when the cyber
[19:17.200 --> 19:20.920]  bullying act is passed and free speech is just a memory on the internet

[19:37.760 --> 19:43.680]  regulate that speech what's next I mean seriously are we are we that far gone

[24:25.000 --> 24:30.120]  in July 2006 the United States District Court for the Northern District of
[24:30.120 --> 24:34.240]  California in which the suit was filed rejected a federal government motion to
[24:34.240 --> 24:39.800]  dismiss the case the motion to dismiss which invoke the state secrets privilege
[24:39.800 --> 24:44.560]  see it's all about national security it's all about you don't get to know it's
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.560]  all about we're better than you you're our slave bow down it's all about
[24:50.560 --> 24:54.640]  double-speak Obama gets right up there talks about a smart grid we know they're
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.680]  GPSing everybody's homes for the census right now we know they're heavily
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.800]  intertwined with the private sector already a lot of these things are
[25:02.800 --> 25:09.760]  intelligence fronts for the international intelligence cartel that's what it is the
[25:09.760 --> 25:15.000]  CIA you know has an arm in Britain that's MI5 they all work together do you
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.840]  get it the massage the ISI it's international baby we live in a global
[25:20.840 --> 25:27.480]  world anyway states secrets privilege had argued that any court review of the
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.920]  alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&T would harm national
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.360]  security AT&T is the tip tip-a-tip tip of the ice iceberg I mean this thing is
[25:37.360 --> 25:43.120]  huge you think AT&T is the only one in on it yeah AT&T is it it's just it's just

[25:51.440 --> 25:54.640]  blow my mind because I see how controlled the media is why wasn't this on
[25:54.640 --> 25:58.560]  the front page of every newspaper if the media isn't controlled why wasn't this
[25:58.560 --> 26:04.480]  on the nightly news why isn't this still being talked about okay the case was
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.040]  immediately appealed to the ninth circuit where it has been argued and still
[26:09.040 --> 26:15.200]  awaits a decision started in July 2006 guess what we're almost in July 2009 and
[26:15.200 --> 26:20.640]  it's still going on the you think you think the federalese pulled back the
[26:20.640 --> 26:26.240]  intelligentsia they said oh no we got caught they never do they repackage it I
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.480]  mean it's it's out of control all right I want to thank one of my sponsors right

[27:11.440 --> 27:16.320]  just don't want to be paying a carbon tax to a cartel that is exploiting the fact
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.040]  that the sun is getting hotter that's the reality again when I was a kid they
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.520]  were saying chlorofluorocarbons are the enemy chlorofluorocarbons and the
[27:25.520 --> 27:31.360]  enemy stop using aerosol cans don't use hairspray and you know being from
[27:31.360 --> 27:35.520]  new york there there were plenty of new york and new jersey people with the uh
[27:35.520 --> 27:40.880]  the hairspray and you're like wow this is really hurting the earth oh no
[27:40.880 --> 27:44.400]  we're all going to be it's going to be 10 degrees hotter and we're not going to
[27:44.400 --> 27:47.600]  have crops growing and Ted Turner says that we're going to become cannibals
[27:47.600 --> 27:50.160]  and then the rest of the people are going to be living in a failed state like
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.480]  Somalia and then he really lets the cat out of the bag when he says we need a
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.720]  more sustainable society global warming is because there's too many people now
[27:58.720 --> 28:02.560]  too many people doing too many things in fact let's pull up
[28:02.560 --> 28:08.720]  you know Johnny Nonsense aka Ted Turner on Charlie Rose just propagating the
[28:08.720 --> 28:13.280]  myth that there's too many people on the earth we have to have one child policies
[28:13.280 --> 28:18.560]  that's why Pelosi is over in China talking about quote unquote climate change
[28:18.560 --> 28:23.840]  yeah right climate change and then she says yeah everything we do has to be
[28:23.840 --> 28:27.760]  uh subject to data we we just got to track everything
[28:27.760 --> 28:31.040]  we do in fact here's the here's the actual quote right here
[28:31.040 --> 28:34.720]  headline is Pelosi appeals for China's help on climate change we have so much
[28:34.720 --> 28:38.240]  room for improvement she said every aspect of our lives must be subjected
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.360]  to an inventory of how we are taking responsibility
[28:43.360 --> 28:46.560]  everything you do is already really in an inventory
[28:46.560 --> 28:52.320]  the thing is it's not properly database it's not properly categorized
[28:52.320 --> 28:55.200]  and people go Jason you're paranoid they're not tracking and tracing
[28:55.200 --> 28:58.320]  everything you do well on one level they're really not it's not like
[28:58.320 --> 29:02.000]  somebody is watching you and they're watching all these other people no
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.680]  again it goes through software they pick targets
[29:05.680 --> 29:08.800]  they want to know what organizations you're a part of do you think you think
[29:08.800 --> 29:14.240]  there's no reason that UK and US police are out at war protests
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.560]  and other movement type events copying down license plates what do you think
[29:18.560 --> 29:22.640]  that's for did you read the Virginia fusion center document
[29:22.640 --> 29:25.600]  where they went after just about every group you can imagine
[29:25.600 --> 29:30.640]  Christians anti-abortionists constitutionalists

[32:23.280 --> 32:26.800]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[32:26.800 --> 32:30.880]  an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the
[32:30.880 --> 32:32.960]  best part these seeds have not been genetically
[32:32.960 --> 32:36.800]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[32:36.800 --> 32:41.360]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com
[32:41.360 --> 32:48.160]  that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[32:48.160 --> 32:54.720]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis
[32:54.720 --> 32:58.880]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival
[32:58.880 --> 33:10.640]  seed bank dot com
[33:11.840 --> 33:15.680]  you want to see the bigger picture you want to understand the end game
[33:15.680 --> 33:19.600]  well then you need to go to info wars dot com right now and get the movie by
[33:19.600 --> 33:22.640]  the same name this one's a you know i think
[33:22.640 --> 33:26.480]  almost three years old now but really shows you a broader outlook of the
[33:26.480 --> 33:29.040]  entire agenda the north american union agenda
[33:29.040 --> 33:34.480]  i mean we got sonia sotomayor on deck to bring that in
[33:34.480 --> 33:38.960]  she makes racist comments she's part of loraz and it's not reverse racism
[33:38.960 --> 33:42.240]  and i heard some people trying to justify that i kind of admire on talk
[33:42.240 --> 33:45.120]  radio and they need to be set straight now when you say
[33:45.120 --> 33:49.760]  that a wise latina woman can make a better decision than a white man
[33:49.760 --> 33:53.600]  that's absolutely ridiculous and whether or not he's got a silver spoon in his
[33:53.600 --> 33:55.920]  mouth or he doesn't have the life experiences you
[33:55.920 --> 34:00.160]  you base you base your uh your thoughts on somebody your opinion
[34:00.160 --> 34:03.840]  on the content of their character that's how it's supposed to work not the
[34:03.840 --> 34:08.240]  color of their skin not their ethnic background
[34:08.240 --> 34:11.040]  and really this is supposed to be an interpretation of the constitution and
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.840]  bill of rights of individuals personal freedoms
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.160]  our god-given rights our god-given freedoms that's what these are they're
[34:20.160 --> 34:22.880]  inherent they're not given to us by government
[34:22.880 --> 34:26.720]  we take them as human beings all right i want to play this clip of ted turner
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.240]  talking about population sustainability and and the whole nine
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.400]  just another part of the agenda and then i'm gonna take your calls
[34:34.400 --> 34:39.200]  it's the alex joneshow hit the clip we have to fully mobilize everything we
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.480]  have and put it into changing the energy system over
[34:42.480 --> 34:45.280]  and not just here in the united states but all over the world
[34:45.280 --> 34:48.800]  it's going to be the business business biggest business project in the history
[34:48.800 --> 34:52.560]  of the world fortunes billions of dollars are going to be made
[34:52.560 --> 34:55.520]  hundreds of thousands of people were going to be employed
[34:55.520 --> 34:58.480]  we're going to have clean air we're going to have so many benefits from it
[34:58.480 --> 35:02.640]  it's not going to cost us anything once we get going with it it's not going to
[35:02.640 --> 35:05.680]  cost us anything only the people that don't don't
[35:05.680 --> 35:09.920]  understand it think it's going to wait not doing it will be catastrophic
[35:09.920 --> 35:13.040]  we'll have eight degrees will be eight degrees hotter
[35:13.040 --> 35:18.400]  in 10 not 10 but in 30 or 40 years and basically none of the crops will grow
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.160]  most of people will die and the rest of us will be cannibals civilization will
[35:22.160 --> 35:25.520]  have broken down what the few people that left will be
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.760]  living in a in a failed state like samalia or sudan
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.280]  and living conditions will be intolerable the droughts will be so bad
[35:33.280 --> 35:36.960]  there'll be no more corn growing it will
[35:36.960 --> 35:41.680]  not doing it is suicide just like dropping bombs on each other nuclear
[35:41.680 --> 35:44.720]  weapons is suicide so we've got to stop doing the two
[35:44.720 --> 35:49.200]  suicidal things which are nuclear and on our nuclear weapons and global
[35:49.200 --> 35:52.080]  and then after that we've got that we've got to
[35:52.080 --> 35:55.920]  stabilize the population when i was born so what's wrong with the population i
[35:55.920 --> 35:59.920]  mean with too many people that's what that's why we have global warming
[35:59.920 --> 36:03.200]  we have global warming because too many people are using too much stuff
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.640]  but if there were less people they'd be using less stuff we don't get global
[36:06.640 --> 36:10.480]  warming and all right let's stop it right there do you understand what he just
[36:10.480 --> 36:14.560]  said too many people so then you wonder why people in the
[36:14.560 --> 36:18.320]  ukraine when they start getting vaccinations through ted turner in the
[36:18.320 --> 36:22.400]  united nations don't want to take them let me read you a quote out of msnbc
[36:22.400 --> 36:27.040]  ukrainian media spread rumor of plot by ted turner see it's a rumor
[36:27.040 --> 36:30.720]  and the guy just said right there there's too many people in the world
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.320]  we need less people do you think he's going to be the one to take his own
[36:34.320 --> 36:36.320]  life huh do you think he's going to be the one to
[36:36.320 --> 36:39.680]  sacrifice his family and his friends and his elitist buddies
[36:39.680 --> 36:43.360]  give me a break that means you slave that means you
[36:43.360 --> 36:46.800]  johnny thirty thousand dollars a year ninety thousand dollars a year five
[36:46.800 --> 36:50.000]  hundred thousand dollars a year maybe a maybe a million
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.600]  you're not special if you've got a little scratch in the neighborhood and you
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.480]  think you're upper echelon yuppie ukrainian media outlets are
[36:58.480 --> 37:02.480]  numerous and uncensored but do not widely follow western standards of
[37:02.480 --> 37:06.560]  fairness and accuracy what do you mean uh control and censorship
[37:06.560 --> 37:10.800]  fairness and accuracy once again if there was fairness and accuracy in the
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.120]  media that story about uh atnt in the secret room in nsa
[37:15.120 --> 37:18.960]  wiretapping of everything you do tracked and traced and database would be all
[37:18.960 --> 37:22.960]  over the place so don't don't cry to me argentina this
[37:22.960 --> 37:26.720]  is ridiculous some print and online reports alleged after a
[37:26.720 --> 37:30.640]  a boy's death that the indian made measles and rubella vaccine
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.240]  would sterilize men as part of a plot by ted turner
[37:34.240 --> 37:37.840]  who's washington-based united nations foundation charity paid for the
[37:37.840 --> 37:40.400]  vaccines meanwhile we have all these elitists
[37:40.400 --> 37:43.920]  just meeting in new york city uh people like uh who was there
[37:43.920 --> 37:49.120]  gates buffett uh oprah was there kit was kissing you there no i think it was
[37:49.120 --> 37:52.080]  rockefeller was there again oh rockefeller just appears everywhere
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.400]  magically out of nowhere and what were they talking about oh over population
[37:56.400 --> 37:59.600]  i want how we're going to help the population we're going to help everybody
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.520]  all right let's take some calls because with the cyber security advisor or i'm
[38:03.520 --> 38:07.280]  sorry coordinator and this new department
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.200]  and then really gearing up for internet too and all sorts of censorship
[38:11.200 --> 38:14.000]  the cyber bullying act the cyber security act which
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.560]  you know i have in front of me it's 51 pages really have to go through this
[38:18.560 --> 38:23.120]  it's just too much to to grasp if you're just coming into this and then uh
[38:23.120 --> 38:25.200]  at the top of the hour we're going to have bob Chapman on we're going to be
[38:25.200 --> 38:28.480]  talking about this as well and then when we go live on prisonplanet.tv we are
[38:28.480 --> 38:33.040]  going to play that clip from 2004 where alex jones talks about this smart
[38:33.040 --> 38:35.360]  grid that they were setting up back then building the
[38:35.360 --> 38:39.360]  infrastructure back then trading us and our children for back then when they
[38:39.360 --> 38:41.600]  said oh it's time to thumb scan at disney world
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.520]  oh it's time to thumb scan it at sea world
[38:45.520 --> 38:49.520]  thumb scanning i mean are we out of our mind it's in our schools
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.200]  it's at our theme parks they want our biometric information
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.720]  what what state secrets are at sea world please tell me
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.000]  are there state secrets there i'm missing it's it's it's it's ludicrous

[40:42.480 --> 40:47.200]  the armed forces and i can't tell you what branch or what i do or anything but
[40:47.200 --> 40:48.080]  uh...
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.560]  i'll just let you know uh... that cyber command thing is already been in place
[40:52.560 --> 40:57.680]  for uh... some time uh... that they're not just rolling it out i mean let's
[40:57.680 --> 41:01.040]  talk about that for a minute because again they had a cyber security chief
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.800]  who just resigned on march six two thousand and nine and this is
[41:04.800 --> 41:08.000]  when they're about to have their sixty day oversight so it seems what's what's
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.160]  the day today today is the twenty ninth it's just under that two month marker
[41:12.160 --> 41:15.040]  and now they're just rolling it out for the public they always build the
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.560]  infrastructure first they always have it behind the scenes and then they
[41:18.560 --> 41:21.840]  introduce it with you know mainstream media figures
[41:21.840 --> 41:24.720]  like hannah montana and the cyber bullying act and then
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.000]  oh jay rockefeller is going to save us with the cyber security bill tell us
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.360]  what you know about what's already in place
[41:31.360 --> 41:35.120]  already in place is that they have the air force already has a cyber command
[41:35.120 --> 41:40.480]  set up uh... totally uh... different uh... command you know how they have uh...
[41:40.480 --> 41:41.440]  uh...
[41:41.440 --> 41:44.960]  you know the aircraft command like all like norad
[41:44.960 --> 41:49.040]  yet norad and have the pacific command and uh... european command
[41:49.040 --> 41:53.600]  well they have a whole not another thing called uh... called a cyber command
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.120]  which it has its own general has own uh... rank structure
[41:57.120 --> 42:00.800]  already in place and it's already going through you can you know there's already
[42:00.800 --> 42:02.240]  jobs for it
[42:02.240 --> 42:05.440]  and uh... so that's already been set up and what what do you think their role is
[42:05.440 --> 42:08.720]  right now in intelligence gathering the i mean with that clip we just played
[42:08.720 --> 42:12.240]  from m msnbc obviously they are again
[42:12.240 --> 42:16.240]  uh... human being can't go through all of this information but it does seem like
[42:16.240 --> 42:20.160]  they're databases all intelligence they possibly can not only through your
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.760]  computer but your cell phone all technology in general
[42:23.760 --> 42:28.400]  or no no no human being can it is purely a database and i'm sure he would be
[42:28.400 --> 42:32.960]  through what is important but uh... what i was going to say was that uh...
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.880]  everything that goes the goes uh... to the civilian sector
[42:36.880 --> 42:40.480]  gets passed through the uh... the military
[42:40.480 --> 42:43.120]  just like this the cyber command thing that i mean
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.440]  when whenever you log on to a military computer you have your your id card
[42:47.440 --> 42:50.240]  they track everything you can't even get on youtube
[42:50.240 --> 42:54.320]  uh... you can't get on to anything you know you're a beta test you're a beta test
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.400]  for internet to uh... let's talk about like the latest ibm thinkpads from two
[42:58.400 --> 43:01.520]  or three years ago when they started being all check it out we're going to put
[43:01.520 --> 43:04.800]  a biometric thumb scanner on here nobody can get on your computer and what
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.560]  that's for to train you
[43:06.560 --> 43:09.680]  in the future internet when you want to log on to the internet the first thing
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.200]  you're going to have to do is give up your biometric identification
[43:13.200 --> 43:15.760]  and that's going to be a way that they're actually going to build the
[43:15.760 --> 43:18.960]  database of everybody's medical records and biometric information if you want
[43:18.960 --> 43:20.800]  to get on the net you're going to have to give it up
[43:20.800 --> 43:23.680]  and then you will be logged in and everything you will do
[43:23.680 --> 43:27.440]  won't even be tracked by an ip address you know the family computer it'll
[43:27.440 --> 43:30.240]  actually be tracked to you correct
[43:30.240 --> 43:33.760]  uh... well the in the in the current military thing you you put in your uh...
[43:33.760 --> 43:36.720]  your id card which has all that information already on it
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.640]  your your blood type your you know it all that stuff is already on
[43:40.640 --> 43:43.040]  on your card i mean they put all that information
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.640]  whenever you go get blood taken from the from the
[43:46.640 --> 43:51.760]  from the hospital on base uh... you know they put all that information they put
[43:51.760 --> 43:55.440]  their card and then you put they put your card in the thing and they type in
[43:55.440 --> 43:57.200]  all the information to give your card back
[43:57.200 --> 44:00.800]  so all that information is already on your card so every time you get
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.600]  on uh... a base computer uh... you put your card in uh...
[44:05.600 --> 44:09.200]  your id card is what i'm talking about yeah there's that now for the civilian
[44:09.200 --> 44:11.680]  sector you know the the united states
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.000]  uh... civilian card you know uh... that all that information is given up
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.600]  so let me ask you something do you think the people on the inside are starting
[44:19.600 --> 44:22.400]  to wake up obviously you're calling in you're a military guy
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.760]  are people starting to see this control grid do they really get how bad it's
[44:25.760 --> 44:28.880]  getting do they see the civilian national security force that's being
[44:28.880 --> 44:32.080]  built in this country do they understand that the boyscouts are now being
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.520]  trained for when you guys come home i mean that literally they talk about
[44:35.520 --> 44:39.840]  a disgruntled iraqi war veteran who's picking people off
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.760]  with a uh... with a sniper scope and they've got you know these little 14 to
[44:43.760 --> 44:48.000]  16-year-old kids with mock shotguns and assault weapons training to take you
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.320]  out in the future i mean it's insanity
[44:50.320 --> 44:55.600]  yeah i saw that and uh... i don't know what to say about that but uh... i can
[44:55.600 --> 44:59.200]  tell you the obama deception is uh... is pretty as a real big kick
[44:59.200 --> 45:03.360]  uh... over here there's uh... in fact another buddy of mine
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.200]  turned me on to it that's all you i mean i've already been listening
[45:07.200 --> 45:10.480]  i was a text martyrs uh... i used to read his uh...
[45:10.480 --> 45:13.040]  his stuff all the time because my grandma was into him
[45:13.040 --> 45:16.160]  and uh... he turned me on to obama deception that's all i got into alice
[45:16.160 --> 45:19.200]  jones and stuff no excellent so have you seen some of the other films about
[45:19.200 --> 45:22.880]  nine eleven because i'd encourage you that's all i saw in game i saw loose
[45:22.880 --> 45:25.920]  change i just saw the one recently uh...
[45:25.920 --> 45:29.760]  it was kind of a combination of everything called wake-up call it took
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.920]  took so from from david ike i think his name uh... alice jones they took
[45:33.920 --> 45:37.040]  they took it up yeah i think i've seen i think i've seen wake-up called great
[45:37.040 --> 45:40.560]  caller dustin thank you so much let's jump to uh... jeff in canada jeff
[45:40.560 --> 45:46.240]  you're on the air yes jeff yes
[45:46.240 --> 45:50.000]  and a few things i was going to mention uh... first of all uh...
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  like you you've been talking about all day i know of the for canada
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.360]  we have bell mm-hmm that's our communications uh...
[45:57.360 --> 46:00.960]  the big leader yeah bell pacific right yeah
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.480]  something like that mm-hmm but i know for a fact that uh...
[46:04.480 --> 46:07.520]  they openly state that they do record every call every
[46:07.520 --> 46:11.360]  any phone call made through them has been recorded for a lot
[46:11.360 --> 46:16.240]  how many years for a while it's not a surprise yeah no i know but people can
[46:16.240 --> 46:18.960]  accept it in this country they they still think that
[46:18.960 --> 46:22.480]  all these are only foreign phone calls and he is only for the terrorists and
[46:22.480 --> 46:25.040]  then when you tell them this is the reality you show them a clip like that
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.240]  well they say well if you're not doing anything you don't have anything to
[46:28.240 --> 46:29.040]  worry about
[46:29.040 --> 46:32.720]  meanwhile throughout history you don't have to be committing a crime
[46:32.720 --> 46:36.240]  you can just have a dissentful viewpoint and you will be targeted
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.200]  that's what they do they go after dissenters they go against
[46:39.200 --> 46:43.760]  opposition they don't want the mindset that's going to oppose their ideals
[46:43.760 --> 46:47.280]  their agenda it's absolute insanity jeff i thank you for the call
[46:47.280 --> 46:50.240]  alex in virginia you're on the line
[46:50.240 --> 46:55.120]  yes i'll say how i did and i have a couple questions on i don't know if you know anything
[46:55.120 --> 46:57.200]  about uh... intelligence here
[46:57.200 --> 47:02.320]  i've done some research it i'm talking about the collective intelligence
[47:02.320 --> 47:06.080]  and the other comment i had was out it's kind of funny and out
[47:06.080 --> 47:09.360]  for nancy polosi to talk about uh...
[47:09.360 --> 47:13.280]  having inventory for everything while they have no
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.960]  uh... disclosure of financial reserve i mean
[47:16.960 --> 47:20.960]  uh... you know but let's go polosi's a globalist number one and she's a
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.400]  cover-up artist for them again she was in the initial congressional
[47:24.400 --> 47:28.000]  uh... investigation into nine eleven she knows damn well
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.280]  that that was an intelligence operation but let's talk about the
[47:31.280 --> 47:34.240]  international intelligence cartel i thank you for the call
[47:34.240 --> 47:38.480]  let's use iran contra as an example of how this works
[47:38.480 --> 47:39.280]  okay
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.680]  all right so you have private investors and the cia
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.520]  investing in the contras in south america all their freedom fighters
[47:47.520 --> 47:50.800]  meanwhile they've got death squads were training dictators were working with
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.480]  people like uh... uh... noriega who turns out to be a cia
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.040]  asset for the longest time now in order to smuggle them weapons and then get the
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.400]  drugs to smuggle into the united states they use third parties
[48:02.400 --> 48:05.600]  in other words they use contractors pre-blackwater guys
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.080]  just mercenaries pilots that sort of thing now how would they get the weapons
[48:10.080 --> 48:13.680]  well they would use the massad the massad would go over into the Czech Republic
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.640]  the ukraine these other nations and front the money for the weapons
[48:18.640 --> 48:21.920]  and later on through backdoor channels u.s intelligence would then pay
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.960]  back the mess up and israel so i mean this is a whole
[48:26.960 --> 48:30.560]  network now they would take the weapons fly them down
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.320]  through third parties these uh... these private contractors that i spoke of
[48:34.320 --> 48:39.280]  into south america they would in turn get marijuana and cocaine to load up on
[48:39.280 --> 48:44.400]  their planes then they would fly these out into
[48:44.400 --> 48:47.440]  military bases and they would get payments
[48:47.440 --> 48:50.720]  and then black ops military people would then dispense
[48:50.720 --> 48:53.840]  the drugs they would be the drug dealers that then
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.400]  these drug cartels are kind of backed by the cia operatives the bigwigs
[48:58.400 --> 49:04.000]  and as long as the cartels will work with the cia fronts the fb i guys the
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.520]  informants the provocateurs the intelligentsia that is funneling in this
[49:07.520 --> 49:11.600]  black uh... black market money black ops cash
[49:11.600 --> 49:15.040]  well then they don't bust anybody but on lower levels as soon as you kind of go
[49:15.040 --> 49:17.040]  outside of them and you don't play ball
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.520]  you can either end up dead or uh... in jail
[49:21.520 --> 49:24.640]  and again it's compartmentalized so you know it's not like they approach them
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.400]  oh i work for the cia this is how this is how it needs to be
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.160]  that's obviously not how it works whatsoever
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.240]  they approach them as a drug dealer so again it is an international
[49:36.240 --> 49:39.840]  intelligence network and meanwhile the guys at the top in the us are part of
[49:39.840 --> 49:42.960]  the c o g program continuity of government the actual shadow
[49:42.960 --> 49:46.880]  government that does exist you know oliver north was exposed
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.720]  their casper weinberger and i think thirteen others were actually convicted
[49:50.720 --> 49:53.600]  many of them pardon later including weinberger
[49:53.600 --> 49:57.840]  i mean it's unbelievable to me that this thing
[49:57.840 --> 50:01.280]  they never gotten trouble they never got caught that that network never went
[50:01.280 --> 50:04.320]  away and there are always parts of these different little
[50:04.320 --> 50:07.440]  think tank groups you know they morph into the project from a new american
[50:07.440 --> 50:11.600]  century you know from the cfr you know and the very
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.000]  upper echelon in my mind are always at the builder bird group
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.040]  you know royalty queen betricks is always there
[50:19.040 --> 50:23.760]  think tank guys like kissinger uh you know big movers and shakers globalists
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.680]  like david rockefeller big idea men if you will
[50:27.680 --> 50:30.720]  and through that i mean there there's almost an endless amount of these little
[50:30.720 --> 50:34.160]  organizations that they pick from we're going to continue to go to your
[50:34.160 --> 50:38.640]  calls on the other side i think we're at uh michael dustin laura gary

[55:36.960 --> 55:39.680]  something to say about the constitution but first i wanted a comment on a
[55:39.680 --> 55:43.040]  article i saw on info wars dot com boston to arm
[55:43.040 --> 55:47.280]  patrol cops a semi-automatic assault rifles i uh i take the commuter rail to
[55:47.280 --> 55:52.400]  work every single day and uh since i don't know at least a year ago they've
[55:52.400 --> 55:56.320]  been doing this but uh starting back in october i don't know if it coincides
[55:56.320 --> 55:59.280]  coincides with the army times report or not but
[55:59.280 --> 56:03.200]  back in october they really ramped it up but uh if
[56:03.200 --> 56:06.480]  if i can i'd like to just say something real quick about the constitution
[56:06.480 --> 56:10.560]  um listen to the air show and there's a guy that keeps on hounding you about
[56:10.560 --> 56:13.760]  you know the constitution and how you know we don't have a second amendment
[56:13.760 --> 56:18.160]  right because of the constitution the constitution protects that right from
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.000]  the government and i just kind of want to help you understand what this guy's
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.400]  trying to say if you look at the language um congress shall make no
[56:26.400 --> 56:30.640]  law uh in you know amendment one amendment two
[56:30.640 --> 56:34.720]  uh the right of people to keep your arm shall not be infringed by the government
[56:34.720 --> 56:38.720]  um no soldier shall meaning the government's not gonna you know
[56:38.720 --> 56:42.160]  quarter a soldier the right of the people to be scared in their persons
[56:42.160 --> 56:47.760]  you know uh no unreasonable searches you know what it's saying is is and if you
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.120]  read thomas jefferson you already have these rights
[56:51.120 --> 56:56.560]  but the bill of rights says the government can't do this because you already
[56:56.560 --> 56:58.640]  have those rights that's all he's saying
[56:58.640 --> 57:01.440]  yeah well no i said they're inherent rights they're god-given rights they're
[57:01.440 --> 57:05.440]  human rights they're individual freedoms and you know sodomyre coming in

[57:25.120 --> 57:28.640]  actually afford individual citizens the right to bear arms
[57:28.640 --> 57:32.000]  but only duly conferred organizations like the military
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.440]  instead of making guns illegal she argues they have been illegal for
[57:35.440 --> 57:38.640]  individuals to own since the passing of the bill of rights talk
[57:38.640 --> 57:42.400]  about orwellian speak talk about bad news brown for this country

[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:58.320]  uh the price of gold really shooting up lately and this new
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:02.720]  speech by obama just this morning announcing the new cyber security
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:06.960]  coordinator and this new department where they are literally going to
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:11.200]  regulate everything on the internet further try to pass this cyber security
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:16.160]  act the cyber bullying act and much much more how are you today bob
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:20.800]  i'm pretty good and uh what the president is doing is ominous
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:24.800]  and it's just an extension of what we got with the last
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:29.680]  administrations and um it's very very frightening because
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:33.600]  it's obvious that there after total control of the internet
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:38.080]  and probably the airwaves as well you know absolutely in fact they're trying
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:42.160]  to already say uh i believe the FCC is saying well we can already
[1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:47.360]  go in warrantlessly if you have a rogue wi-fi connection in other words if your
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:50.720]  wi-fi signal isn't regulated in some way they can already come into your home
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:53.360]  and check that out and they were able to do that through some some kind of
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:57.840]  passage of a cable act back in the 70s with cable boxes and people using the
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:01.280]  black boxes to get the free premium channels or whatever it would
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:04.720]  emerge omit a certain wavelength and they would be able to go in
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  warrantlessly and they they just keep expanding and expanding on their powers
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:12.640]  now we already knew they were doing this uh behind closed doors because of uh
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:18.800]  cases like hepting versus atnt where atnt is openly just copying every
[1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:23.200]  single thing you do on the internet every single thing you do on your phone
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:25.600]  we already know they're tracking what we're watching
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.800]  i mean it's admitted how do you think they figured out
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:33.280]  that the most watched television moment in history was janet jackson's you know
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:37.440]  uh you know bosom popping out over at the super bowl
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:40.080]  so you know this is just a long time coming now they're just
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:44.160]  announcing it but as they announce it bob obama always pulls back and say oh
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.520]  we're not going to infringe on your civil liberties oh we're not going to be
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:50.480]  spying on you we're just creating a smart grid
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:54.320]  where all your medical information will be database and electronic
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:57.920]  and we'll have a gps of your home and oh yeah we're going to
[1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:01.360]  you know figure out how much carbon you're using so we can start this new
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:06.240]  carbon credit system of ours i mean it's complete insanity
[1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:09.840]  you know with the carbon credits they're trying to um
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:13.600]  they're trying to fast track that
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:17.920]  well i mean polosi right now was just over at china talking about how they
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:21.840]  need to help us in this climate change and meanwhile she's there she can't help
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:25.840]  but make this quote we have so much room for improvement she said every aspect
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:29.440]  of our lives must be subjected to an inventory
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:33.120]  right there coming out and saying every aspect of everybody's lives
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:37.440]  must be inventoryed i mean we are really turning into
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:41.600]  this is fast track stuff with sodomy are coming in for instance uh bob
[1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:44.640]  this woman looks like she's going to bring in the north american union she's
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:48.400]  a council member of la raza she's openly made racist statements
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:52.560]  and she's openly a gun grabber i mean again she wrote the book deadly
[1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:55.680]  obsession american gun culture where she argues that the second
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:59.840]  amendment actually ensures that most citizens cannot have guns it says only
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:02.720]  military let me read the quote in this text the student sotomayor
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:06.240]  explained that the second amendment to the constitution did not actually afford
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:09.920]  individual citizens the right to bear arms but only duly confirmed
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:13.760]  organizations like the military instead of making guns illegal she argues
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.360]  they have been illegal for individuals to own since the passing of the bill of
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:20.640]  rights i mean talk about a nightmare
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:23.680]  and that's an aggressive channel challenge
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.720]  and um that's one of the things that are used
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.600]  in cy war this woman's been trained in cy war you know if somebody else wrote
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:36.800]  the statement well she wrote a whole book on it i mean this is
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:41.760]  psychological warfare on on the american populace really the world populace
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.320]  and the orwellian doublespeak that is taking place
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:48.080]  just in the past few months has been incredible we now have army generals
[1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:51.120]  saying oh we may need to be in iraq for another 10 years well if anybody's been
[1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:53.200]  paying attention of course they're gonna say that
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:56.000]  more with bob Chapman on the other side it's the alex jones show i'm jason

[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:34.480]  cracking this quote unquote smart grid and the only one it's smart for
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:37.600]  is for the elites who are trying to enslave us
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:40.880]  i mean so much to go over just in the past week bob i want to get your take
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:44.560]  on so many things i mean what did you think about this private meeting of
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:49.600]  rockefeller and oprah and bill gates and i believe ted turner was there as well
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:52.960]  and then they said oh we had to deal with some population issues
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:57.600]  i mean outside of the builder group i mean it's getting pretty creepy
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:04.560]  well i think that they was telling some of these people is the doll is going
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.560]  down the economy is in serious trouble and this
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:11.280]  thing's going to go upside down tomorrow's issue of the international
[1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:17.280]  forecaster my first paragraph reflects in that i think
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:21.680]  something tremendous is coming down in the next four months maybe five
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:25.920]  but uh it's it's hard to do timing on this kind of thing
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:29.040]  because you know we're not on the inside we're backing in
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:32.480]  the back door trying to find out what they're doing all the time
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:36.240]  and so you know we just don't have access to the
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:40.480]  the halls of power so to speak but there's something big coming
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.560]  you know i notice uh a number of police agencies getting
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:52.160]  200 or 300 or 500 ar 15 i got a piece out of the boston globe this morning
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:57.040]  um you know this is this is uh boston and the surrounding area
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:05.440]  is heavily populated unless there was a a um a riot or a
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:10.880]  a uh bank robbery or something like that there's no no there's no need
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:15.200]  to have a penetrating weapon like that inside the city and usually
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:21.120]  cities all cities today has swatines so there's no reason for these guys
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.280]  two thousand or 200 or whatever it is to be running around the streets of boston
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:29.680]  or any other city where they are 15 it's as simple as that
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:33.360]  well i have to agree with you and it's it's syndrome well it's step by step you
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:36.880]  know they first do it in new york city subways to protect us from terror after
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:39.440]  9 11 now the terrorists are us and they're
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:42.400]  saying oh look at these guys these four you know
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:47.440]  illiterate literal retard criminals who couldn't even get guns let alone make
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:50.320]  bombs or have any connections to any jihadist movement
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:54.640]  outside of the fbi agent who provoked toward the whole thing oh they were
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:57.280]  going to blow up synagogues terrorism in america

[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.280]  uh economic social political issues all over the world
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:17.600]  and um and i think it's very very important particularly to get
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:22.240]  the copy of the one that's coming out tomorrow because they explain to people
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:26.640]  where we're headed here and believe me unfortunately
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:31.680]  i've been right about 98 percent of the time
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:35.120]  for for 20 years and and even more so for the last 10 years
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:38.160]  and what's coming is going to be bad we're talking about it
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:43.360]  here in the program right now this is what these people are preparing for
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:48.080]  this is what this Rockefeller Gates meeting was all about
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:52.880]  uh as far as the visible visible members of the Illuminati
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:56.320]  the Rockefeller family is right up there
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:13:00.240]  in in the top and uh at least in the united states
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:03.520]  and when he has a meeting at 93 years old
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:06.800]  you know it's important he was over at the Bilderberger meeting
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:10.800]  and that meeting took place right afterwards so he was filling them in
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:15.520]  what went on over in Greece is my assumption
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:18.560]  yeah that's that's probably what's going down totally totally
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:22.160]  evil i'm with you but why don't we talk about
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:25.120]  you know the precious metals market because gold has shot up in the last
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:28.640]  couple of weeks silver's gone up uh basically it seems like people are
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:32.640]  getting hip to the fact that this is a way to sustain your wealth and
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:34.960]  actually have money after this big collapse i mean
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:37.920]  how much more do you need to explain people that when i was listening to
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:41.520]  alex jones back in 2003 gold was going from somewhere between
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:46.560]  275 and 330 an ounce and now you can't get it for you know less than 880 to
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:51.840]  1100 an ounce if you were to buy it on you know ebay or just one piece i mean
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:55.360]  that's an amazing investment and it's not really that gold is tripled in price
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:58.800]  it's that the dollar has really fallen through you know
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:03.760]  by 60 plus percent now that's correct and you know
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:08.480]  it is very difficult to get coins whether silver or gold
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:13.280]  outside the united states uh there's been a big increase in europe and the
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:18.560]  purchases that they are available but there are waiting times
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:22.800]  and they're going to get even more difficult to get in the future
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:27.760]  and uh i know that the central and south america mexico it's almost impossible
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:32.720]  to get coins i mean that that is a true statement believe me
[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:36.480]  and um the chinese have picked up on their buying
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:40.160]  uh the indians have dropped off but they usually buy
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:46.480]  jewelry that's their method of accumulating gold which is usually 24
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:49.920]  carat and so what they really do is buying
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:53.360]  bullion i guess they really want to wear it around but i wouldn't
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:57.040]  want to wear that much bullion around the streets but anyway
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:00.640]  i'm sure that there are people in india who are dishonest
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:07.840]  uh or criminals but anyway um uh we're looking at as we were here last friday
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:15.200]  and i said uh the hui which is an index of non-hedged
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:21.920]  stocks and gold and silver and the silver and the gold
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:26.480]  charts showed reverse head and shoulders and not to go in and explain what that
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:29.600]  is to you it means once the right hand
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:34.960]  shoulder of a reverse head and shoulders is completed
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:38.800]  whatever is on the right hand shoulder whether it be gold
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:42.720]  silver the h ui whatever it takes off like a
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:46.320]  a scared rabbit and we're on the verge of that right now
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:50.080]  a break over a thousand thirty five and today
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:53.520]  will take gold to new highs and silver will go with it in fact silver has been
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:57.840]  leading the pack and uh they're strong again today
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:00.880]  the gold and silver stocks have been very strong
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:07.040]  and uh we have an awful lot of very very happy subscribers i'm happy to say
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:10.240]  but well it is unfortunate that they're that they're being coming happy
[1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:13.760]  because the economy is only worsening and worsening and now you know gm is
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:17.520]  going to be bankrupt and i mean the economy in the
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:20.240]  united states is just on such a downward spiral
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:23.280]  meanwhile they're saying oh it's getting better i've actually seen reports
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:26.720]  that the recession is going to end in the next six to uh twelve months
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:30.320]  meanwhile it's only going to get worse it's continually gotten worse
[1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:33.600]  over the past eight years bob
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.440]  yeah the june month is trading at eight uh nine seventy seven
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:42.000]  and we've got about a nine fifty five excuse me a fifteen fifty five on silver
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.920]  right now in the outside months which are june and july
[1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:49.840]  and um and those are the more active months
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:54.400]  and uh there's a whole bunch of things i could tell you about this
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:57.360]  number one the fundamentals go stronger every day
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:01.840]  in both metals and then there's the shortages in coins
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:07.280]  uh also uh we're looking at a collapsing dollar the dollars down like
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:14.320]  1.40 on the usdx today at around 7940 and we call the top
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:23.200]  on that at 85 oh is it 80 all these numbers um
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:26.880]  it was uh 85 50 we called the top
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:30.240]  about two months ago the dollars headed down
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:34.400]  we called the breakdown in the bond market
[1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.960]  uh at the beginning of the year we thought it would happen at the end of
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:41.200]  this year it happened already and the bond the market is broken down
[1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:46.480]  in the long end which is the 10-year notes and the 30-year bonds
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:50.480]  and incidentally the government's raising a trillion dollars this week
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:56.000]  and uh i can i can assure you the Fed is in there buying
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.680]  which is monetization which is very inflationary
[1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:05.520]  and the yield uh when we made the prediction was 2.35 percent
[1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:09.840]  the yield has now gone up to 3.74 percent
[1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:16.080]  headed to four percent and higher and that means that mortgages
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:20.720]  that have been able to be procured between four and a half and four and
[1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:25.600]  seven eighths are now at five and will probably go
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:28.560]  somewhere in the five and three eighths five and a half area
[1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:32.480]  disqualifying the whole slew of buyers and
[1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:35.120]  what's going on in the bond market is devastating
[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:38.720]  it's ten times bigger than the stock market and the only reason the stock
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:43.520]  market hasn't come down to 6600 and the Dow again from 84
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.040]  with a high of 8600 the only reason it's not down
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:50.080]  is the United States government is keeping it up
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:54.320]  and manipulating it so so what do you think is what do you think i've been
[1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:58.320]  doing listen to this i've been doing 35 programs a week
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:01.760]  wow getting the word out on this especially on the federal reserve and

[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.600]  come by and tell the people as long as they didn't have to do it you know what
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:28.000]  i mean yeah no exactly well you know what they're
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.720]  they're cowering they don't want to lose their job they want to
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:33.600]  you know feel like they're towing the party line because they're afraid that
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:36.560]  if they speak out too much they're going to be the next ones on the
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:40.640]  unemployment line i want to get into the federal reserve would serve as risk
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:44.480]  regulator under the obama plan let's abolish the sec and let

[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:25.680]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election

[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:03.920]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve
[1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:06.560]  note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:10.400]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:13.600]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:16.240]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:20.160]  only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:23.760]  deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to
[1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:27.360]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:31.120]  a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:34.720]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:38.080]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:41.760]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:46.000]  portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.200]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:52.560]  gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years

[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:05.120]  chairman coming up in the next segment but i want to get bob's take
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:08.960]  on you know them giving further powers to the federal reserve the obama
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:11.360]  administration is proposing that the u.s federal reserve
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:15.520]  serve as an all-seeing regulator to detect activities that could pose risks
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:19.840]  to the entire financial system so our lord bankers are going to regulate
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:25.200]  themselves meanwhile they're the ones that are bringing this crisis in bob
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:31.200]  well that's a true statement and uh they've been looting america since 1913
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:34.240]  they're all criminals they all should be in jail
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:37.680]  they're all working on inside information and
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:42.960]  they have been a disaster as far as eliminating panics recessions and
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:48.880]  depressions uh warren paul's bill 1207 179
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:53.600]  uh cosponsors incredible i think we can get it passed but you
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:58.560]  got to do your part you got to get on and contact every congressman those who
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:02.640]  have approved it as cosponsors you thank them the others who
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:06.640]  haven't tell them you want them to tell you what about all of them you want out
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:09.600]  of committee you want to vote it on and passed
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:13.600]  so we can go over to the senate with it it's the most important piece of
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:18.720]  legislation in the past 96 years very important
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:23.040]  if we can get that passed we can stop them at the pass
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:27.840]  the next thing after that we want is legislation on trade
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:33.040]  we want tariffs on goods and services and the chinese think they got problems
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:35.360]  now they're going to have even bigger problems
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:39.360]  if we can get those two pieces of legislation passed
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:43.280]  and if we can do that we can survive if we don't
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:47.520]  you're going to see it in the streets you were talking about gold before
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:50.800]  and i'm cutting back on a way because i want to read you something
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:54.480]  this is the first paragraph in tomorrow's issue of the international
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:58.000]  forecaster what we are about to tell you maybe the most
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:02.640]  important information that we have imparted in almost 50 years
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.200]  something very bad is looming we don't know the exact configuration yet
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:10.720]  but we think the key is the collapse of the dollar which will send gold and
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:14.880]  silver to considerably higher prices these events could unfold over the
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:18.080]  next two to four months there could be devaluation
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:21.760]  and default of the u.s dollar and american debt
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:26.000]  you must have at least six months supply of freeze dry dehydrated foods
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:30.320]  a water filter for brackish water and assault weapons with plenty of ammo and
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:33.600]  clips you should put as much of your wealth as you can
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:37.760]  in golden silver coins and shares you should not own any stocks in the stock
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:41.680]  market except golden silver shares you should not own bonds
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:45.920]  the exception being canadian securities you should not own cds
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.840]  cash life cash value life insurance policies
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:53.600]  and annuities and needless to say except for your home you should be totally
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:57.440]  out of real estate residential and commercial because it will remain
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:01.920]  illiquid for many years to come continue to pay your normal debts down because
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:05.360]  you do not know how they will be treated when we arrive at the
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:08.880]  valuation and default we certainly do not want to have to
[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:13.280]  tell you this but the way things are shaping up it doesn't look good
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:17.760]  as we write this the dollar is breaking 80 on the usdx
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.120]  interest rates are climbing and are broken out to the upside
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:24.240]  gold and silver are poised to break into new high territory
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:28.720]  and the stock market is preparing to retest 6600 on a dow
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:33.360]  you have been warned act accordingly
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.920]  bob i mean it is just out of control when nations are openly now
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:40.800]  dumping the dollar let's talk about that for a little bit
[1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:44.400]  apparently russia has now dropped the dollar as its world reserve currency
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:48.000]  they're using i think rubles uh brazil has talked about doing so
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.600]  china has talked about doing so i mean when are when when is the dollar
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:54.800]  going to be completely dumped you talked about an event possibly in the
[1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:58.480]  next four to five months which will be horrific for this country
[1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:03.360]  uh... but it is something that really does seem imminent
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:07.280]  well that's true uh... you could get all the signs are there
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:10.640]  i was uh... looking at the Naomi of wolf stuff
[1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:16.640]  and uh... course she's a writer and uh... and you know she's generally
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:19.760]  speaking from the left side of the perspective but it doesn't make any
[1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:23.200]  difference what she's saying is true
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:25.840]  you know the ninety-year-old that she quotes
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:30.560]  in one of her deliveries said that the same thing happened in the in germany
[1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:34.160]  in the thirties and get the message everybody because that's where we had it
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:37.360]  yeah her film is called the end of america she's been on this program in my
[1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:39.680]  program as well i really like Naomi will stuff

[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:20.960] .com 1-800-691-6043 so so about what happens when
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:25.120]  just nations just lock steps start dropping the dollar i mean are we going
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:28.160]  to see wheelbarrow money are we going to see a restructuring
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:31.520]  of our currencies is this the birth of the amaro or whatever they want to call
[1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:35.280]  it is this the birth of the north american union
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:39.920]  well i think they've got too much trouble to try to implement a north american
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:43.760]  union at this time i don't think they'll go to an
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:49.760]  amaro at this time either it just doesn't figure
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:53.920]  what they would do is devalue the dollar and
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:58.080]  and i think if they did that everybody else would devalue at the same time
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:00.960]  because everybody else has got the same problems
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:05.760]  i mean they've all been we're talking the g20 especially
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:08.960]  they've all been doing the same thing the fed has been doing
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.040]  to varying degrees increasing money supply and
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:19.680]  and monetizing england even switzerland and the european central bank they're
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:24.640]  all doing it and so i think with a devaluation
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:28.800]  it would be simultaneous and i believe that
[1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:33.520]  they would figure out a default system and uh and try to
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:38.160]  do away with the problem that they've got but in the process of doing that
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:42.000]  um i would think that they would continue to hold the dollar
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.120]  and then go to a international currency i think it's too difficult
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:53.280]  for them to try to go directly from all currencies
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:56.960]  to one currency or even three currencies
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:01.440]  and they would have to have gold backing or some kind of a commodity backing
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:05.200]  and and probably a gold backing because nobody's going to accept it they're
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:08.560]  going to barter whether it's goods or whether it's
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:12.560]  gold for something else or whatever and um
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:17.440]  you know if you look at what went on last week
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:21.760]  at the bill de berger meeting they said it's getting out of control
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:25.920]  we got to bring this thing to a halt we're going to lose control completely
[1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:30.240]  oh i get news for them they already lost control completely
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:34.480]  you know we're only a step away from getting that legislation
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:38.160]  1207 passed in the house of representatives
[1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:41.600]  to do well to audit the fed with the first move
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:44.960]  and that audit would be completed next year and
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:49.120]  uh also there's a companion bill to do away with the fed and
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:52.720]  as soon as the people found out what they were doing which would happen during
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:55.440]  next year they say no we don't want that anymore
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:37:00.480]  we want the treasury to handle it at least there's transparency
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:04.160]  and uh and that's where i think that's headed but
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.400]  uh as far as currencies are concerned it's a hard one to call but
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:12.400]  my guess is that it would be an international effort and everybody
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:15.280]  would do it together and i think that the us
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:19.920]  might do a one for ten one new dollar for for ten old ones
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:24.080]  and that's what i see coming well that alone will really
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:27.120]  hurt this economy in ways that are unimaginable let's jump to the phone
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:30.960]  lines uh laura in michigan you're on the air
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:34.880]  hi jason about this is laura from michigan i wanted to talk to you just a
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:38.640]  little bit about how these things are encroaching upon
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:43.040]  our freedoms and it's quite systematic um however i see a great
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:46.480]  positive that a tipping point is going to come in the
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:49.520]  awareness of the american people we see the tea parties
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:53.600]  rising in response to pretty much aggressive economic
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:58.320]  action and we really do see the surveillance state rising
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:01.920]  and seeking to encroach upon our freedoms there and i really let me
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:05.120]  let me just stop you i really feel like the tea parties themselves were totally
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:08.080]  and completely co-opted by the mainstream media and especially
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:11.760]  fox news with their glenn beck worship and their son hands be worship and i
[1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:14.960]  went to them this year and although there were more people there and yeah
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:18.720]  there were some people that were into the real issues there were other people
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:22.400]  the majority of people there to worship glenn beck deny
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:24.880]  fema camps and not see the bigger picture and say
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:28.720]  obama's bringing in socialism obama's bringing in socialism obama's not
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:32.720]  bringing in anything but an elitist agenda this guy is a puppet that reads
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:36.720]  a teleprompter and he's a good orator he's a good mind don't get me wrong
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:40.640]  he's a great think tanker but he doesn't set the policy he reads off a script
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:44.640]  continue free with you jason i i think you're right on and i think it's a
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:47.600]  beginning of awareness but it is literally the people
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:51.040]  stepping up to the plate saying we're not going to take this anymore
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:55.200]  and so to see that kind of activity as the surveillance state
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:38:58.720]  then they see the surveillance state beginning to encroach upon them and its
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:03.520]  infrastructure the dhs is literally in nsa fema they're
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:07.120]  literally building the infrastructure of a police state
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:10.720]  if we took the control grid of what they're building
[1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:14.640]  and we compared it to china or north vietnam
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:18.240]  it is the same grid they are the same power structures they're a little bit
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:22.080]  beyond our perception they have not surfaced completely
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.800]  but i believe that they are going to obviously continue encroaching and
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:29.360]  they're they're going to reach a tipping point
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:32.960]  well today was a big day let me say that i mean if they if they
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:36.480]  passed the cyber bullying act or the cyber security act and i thank you for
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:39.680]  the call maybe that will be the tipping point but i think that this
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:43.600]  announcement this speech which we're finalizing right now
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:47.920]  and we're going to play in the next hour along with this alex jones clip coming
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:50.960]  up and we're going to analyze what obama had to say
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:54.640]  i mean this should be the tipping point they're announcing a smart grid they're
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:57.760]  announcing that your digital records are going to your
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:00.720]  medical records are going to be digitized and database
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.960]  they are announcing internet 2.0 they're announcing a cyber security
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:08.560]  coordinator they're announcing that they're going after quote a quote
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:11.520]  hacktivists and people who are anti-technology
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:17.360]  i mean this is it bob absolutely this is it this is the
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:22.480]  the move of the the beginning of the of the brown shirt type which is from the
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:26.800]  1930s which today unfortunately is a local
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:32.080]  law enforcement that's being co-opted into a federalization process
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:38.160]  and i have a a letter to myself that came by email this week
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.000]  from someone who was in applying for police work
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.720]  and he was in a room and in the next room there were three people
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:51.360]  two of whom were from uh homeland security who were discussing with the
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:56.160]  chief of police and that particular city and i don't even know what city it was
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:41:01.920]  that uh the police force should be federalized
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:05.600]  and so this this is aggressively going out there
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:08.720]  and so we're going to have that sort of thing running around
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:14.160]  we're going to have the uh the obama version of hitley yung are running
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:17.360]  around and uh and then we're going to be
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:22.640]  beset by tremendous propaganda and so this is the path they're taking
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:27.680]  and of course as you said people like you and i are going to be taken off the
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:31.920]  airways if if they can possibly do that
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:35.280]  yeah and that's really what it seems like they're gunning for let's go to bill
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.760]  in canada kid bill you're on the line
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:41.360]  hey bud all right hey um
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:45.040]  in any case i'm sitting here listening to this thing on cnbc
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:48.640]  hey you know i thought it was very interesting um when obama announced that
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:52.400]  earlier today because you know his sister says you know is
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:56.480]  i look at things two-sided and his sister says we're not
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:00.160]  he said literally that we are not issuing a dictatorship
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:03.760]  well it's like yes you are when you talk about the cyber security thing
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:07.600]  yeah okay and no we're not going to be spying on you
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:11.520]  we're not going to be you know usurping your first amendment rights
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:15.440]  and obviously going he's saying no we aren't but on the other hand it's like
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:19.360]  yes we are yeah well i mean again when he says that they're not going to be
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:22.560]  yeah it's absolute double speak listen he gives out the whole agenda and then
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:25.680]  of the very end let me be clear about what we're not doing
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:29.120]  we're not going to be spying on the american people meanwhile
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:33.520]  i play the clip that this has already been embedded before his administration
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:39.040]  um what was it uh it's the atnt clacy hepting versus atnt we play the clip
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:43.440]  where they already have the secret room where they're already databaseing 99.9
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:47.760]  percent of your communications through atnt whether you use them as a service
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:50.960]  or not this is just one small incident one small case
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:55.120]  and the media doesn't even touch it and and like i said the cyber security chief
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:42:59.040]  because they had a precursor to this organization that they're now restructuring
[1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:01.760]  to take even more control away from the american people
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:06.400]  and the private sector he resigned because of concerns about uh
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:10.080]  what is it civil liberty groups and opposing given control
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:15.680]  uh to the us spying agencies i mean privacy issues and this is off of msnbc
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:19.440]  dot com this isn't going to be in any headlines this is in the back of the
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:24.080]  paper if that and it's in one obscure article off of msnbc.com
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:28.400]  where is the fair and accurate press that the government portrays oh
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:33.280]  the liberal media oh the conservative media it's all wwe politics and it makes
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:37.280]  me sick disgusting hey um i just want to ask you one other
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:41.520]  thing there was a i sent out a i sent you guys an article to rob d
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:44.480]  um that was in this last week's issue of the economist
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:47.680]  it's pretty interesting um it was pertaining to
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:51.920]  the fact that the saudis and the chinese what they're doing is they're out
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:55.200]  there buying up all the farmland or buying up land
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:59.040]  you know across the world and with the intent of sitting or saying
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:03.120]  that they're gonna do it for farming purposes but what i thought was very
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:05.120]  interesting was one of the groups that was in there with the
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:08.000]  bin laden group i thought that was interesting
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.160]  well i have to check it out i don't really know about that have you heard
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:13.040]  about that bob and i thank you for the call
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:16.160]  no i haven't heard about that but it's natural
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:21.440]  and the bin laden group is uh has been partnered with the bushes for many many
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:26.480]  years and uh and they finance some of the companies in texas as well
[1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:33.520]  and um that's why osmo was chosen uh by the cia is one of the chief operatives
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:38.160]  back in the 70s i was writing about him in the early 80s
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:45.360]  and nobody knew about him until uh uh uh uh um
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:49.600]  uh the mainstream media jumped on in the 90s i forget what his name is uh
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:54.400]  but he was an mbc reporter he had his last in public in public the first one
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:45:01.520]  who mentioned him uh was all the north okay gotcha and at the at the senate
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:07.760]  hearings on why he did what he did but uh to flip back there for sec
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:11.280]  and uh comment on what obama had to say
[1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:18.480]  what obama was doing and this is a a method of selling
[1:45:18.480 --> 1:45:22.480]  what obama was doing was answering the objections
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:29.360]  before they come he was pre answering the objections of the public we're not
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:32.640]  going to do this so this is what we're doing this for another reason
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:38.240]  those terrible terrorists etc etc and so this is not directed at you
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:41.600]  so don't think that it is he's answering the objection
[1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:44.800]  before it happens yeah kind of like preemptive
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:49.040]  detention that he keeps talking about it's incredible yeah it's incredible to
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:52.720]  me now what what's your uh take on the supreme court ruling that just happened
[1:45:52.720 --> 1:45:56.160]  on tuesday where they're saying well we can interrogate people without a
[1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:59.920]  lawyer but we're not overturning the fact that you can have a lawyer when we
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:02.800]  interrogate you it's complete doublespeak number one
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:07.520]  number two it was you know five to four it's never six to three or seven to two
[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:11.920]  or nine to zero they they really make it out to be all your civil liberties just
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:15.680]  they you lost them by a hair and really this is a debatable issue but
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:18.880]  in certain circumstances now they're going to be able to interrogate people
[1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:21.440]  without a lawyer while certain circumstances mean
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:24.320]  any circumstances that the police or the authorities
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:29.200]  want to present to a judge bob well what happens when you say
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:32.720]  no you can interrogate me i won't answer any questions
[1:46:32.720 --> 1:46:36.640]  well then i guess i guess they can have more aggressive interrogations you know
[1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:40.400]  what can happen in a closed room you might slip you might hurt yourself
[1:46:40.400 --> 1:46:43.200]  and you know they might be able to get a confession out of you and then you can
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:46.320]  later say well i didn't have my lawyer present and apparently they can just
[1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:50.080]  throw that out now uh you go check out the decision yourself it's
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:53.760]  it is littered with doublespeak if they start that
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:58.480]  i wouldn't give two cents for anybody in law enforcement in the united states
[1:46:58.480 --> 1:47:02.320]  because what's going to happen is they're going to beat somebody
[1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:06.960]  and throw them to the ground and break their collarbone or something like that
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:10.320]  and the cops that did it people are going to come up to be behind them in the
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:12.560]  middle of the night and shoot them in the back of the head
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:17.600]  that's what that's going to happen excuse me uh let me let me just read you
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:21.280]  what it says supreme court rules police can initiate suspects questioning
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:24.880]  the u.s supreme court ruled on tuesday that police under certain circumstances
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:28.240]  can initiate an interrogation of a suspect without the defendants lawyer
[1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:32.320]  being present by a five to four vote the conservative majority overruled a 23
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:35.360]  year old gov supreme court decision that barred the police
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:39.520]  from initiating questioning after he defended asserted the right to an
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:42.080]  attorney at an arraignment or similar proceeding
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:45.440]  so here it's really just saying right there even if he asks for a lawyer we
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:48.880]  can still interrogate him uh the 1986 decision held that once
[1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:52.400]  a defendant invoked the right to counsel only a suspect and not the police
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:56.640]  can initiate the contact uh now here's where the doublespeak kicks in
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:00.160]  the ruling was the latest in a recent string by conservative justices
[1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:04.160]  expanding the power of police to question suspects but it does not
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:07.360]  change the landmark 1966 ruling barring the police
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:11.120]  from questioning a suspect who invokes the right to remain silent or have a
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:15.760]  lawyer present so again total or whatever you know and they beat you
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:18.800]  yeah that's pretty much how i read it bob maybe i'm off
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:21.840]  maybe i'm delusional a lot of people are going to get beaten
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:26.320]  men and women both well it's already happening for our do you live that you
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:29.120]  know the nazis did the same thing
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:34.480]  that was a democracy they don't have what was elected his party was they want
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:38.720]  82 percent of the vote that is correct a lot of people don't see that
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:41.600]  don't know what they're getting themselves into here and i i'll tell you
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.400]  law enforcement and i know you're listening don't do it
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:50.560]  i gotta agree with you the website is the international forecaster dot com
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:53.760]  uh let's go to gary in new york gary online
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:59.040]  yeah how you doing jason all right good um well you know one thing that
[1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:03.200]  that worries me about uh what you and alex does
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:07.040]  is that uh you know like with the obama
[1:49:07.040 --> 1:49:12.160]  deception i mean how many uh movies did you guys make about bush

[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:19.440]  what are you kidding me is that a joke how many movies did we make about bush i
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:23.840]  mean really is that is that some kind of a sick and do you have one movie

[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:51.600]  uh the 9 11 chronicles is very critical of the bush administration bush was so
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:55.280]  outwardly evil and they didn't promote him as a character
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:58.480]  with a halo over his head to become the world president
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:03.280]  they didn't say that he was change okay he was a party line politician that
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:06.880]  in 2000 uh wait a minute i think it was in 99
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:10.960]  uh you know uh alex jones confronted him when he was the governor of texas

[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:34.560]  of alex jones and it is money from start to finish
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:36.800]  hit it
[2:09:41.040 --> 2:09:48.160]  seaworld in san antonio texas owned by anheiser bush biometrically scanning
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:52.000]  those that enter the park for absolutely no reason
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:57.840]  it was a photo id but now you've got to scan biometrically
[2:09:57.840 --> 2:10:01.760]  and big corporations have lined up to sell biometrics
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:07.920]  and rfid for the population in preparation of the new national sales tax
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:12.640]  new international taxes and to track and trace everything we buy sell and do
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:16.480]  which they publicly admitted in the total information awareness network
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:20.480]  that by the way was not canceled when they fired admiral poindexter
[2:10:20.480 --> 2:10:24.560]  they just changed the name so again you can't even go to seaworld without
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:31.440]  biometrically scanning now it's disgusting from grocery stores
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:35.920]  to your banks to atms it's going in everywhere
[2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:38.720]  schoolchildren have to thumb scan to get their school lunches
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:41.760]  have to thumb scan to get on school buses in many school districts
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:47.120]  around the country and i was just curious curious about these
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:52.880]  scanners what's going on with those there well just tell me that
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:56.080]  they scan is to fit season pass voters they scan their hands
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:59.200]  they're a 3d dealer's picture but why wouldn't they just look at the picture
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:02.960]  of the person why would you know the new cars don't happen yeah
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:05.680]  oh so you're going away from somebody just looking at your picture just scanning
[2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:09.120]  your scanning and if you don't and if you don't want to do that you have to
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:12.800]  show us your id to who that is it's you yeah
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:15.840]  and plus you biometrically scan to do that you know the grocery stores are
[2:11:15.840 --> 2:11:20.720]  putting these in what do you think all this
[2:11:21.920 --> 2:11:29.360]  i'm a retard so you're taking your pictures off the car
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:32.880]  and taking a 3d picture of your hand and putting a hand scanner on there yes
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:36.480]  doesn't that kind of spread germs to do that we have hands and hands if anybody
[2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:41.680]  wants to ah it's all been thought of very interesting system
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:50.320]  so it's biometric what do they tell you about it

[2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:57.600]  and they personally do it twice the first time you come in
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:01.920]  and then once every the time after that to validate them and then it
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:06.880]  and then it instantly identifies them yes uh it's normally hooked up and
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:09.920]  working though yes why isn't it on today
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:15.360]  it is on today it's working today oh really it's working right now

[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:29.520]  through they said oh it's raining you don't have to do it
[2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:36.320]  oh they told you to cover them at first but now they tell us to let them open
[2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:40.720]  let them open uh how long have you been using these

[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:34.480]  all right sir do you like the system the new system yes there i do
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:38.560]  you know they're gonna make you do that to to go to the grocery store i've read
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:41.520]  the federal plans oh yeah did you notice that you scan when you got a
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:44.560]  driver's license no when you got a driver's license they
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:47.200]  need to scan you remember putting your finger on the red light
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:50.880]  remember that yeah they've been doing that for 10 years this is part of a total
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:54.640]  grid and i know you love your son here you need to research biometrics this is
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:58.560]  bad news all right if you want to complain about it yeah
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:02.640]  but what what bad news about biometrics they're gonna install a new
[2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:06.240]  national sales tax using this big corporations have lined up
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:10.160]  under homeland security funding to put the biometrics in
[2:15:10.160 --> 2:15:14.880]  to get us to accept it and so then when you scan your hand
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:19.120]  when that happens when you put your hand on the scanner
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:23.200]  you then are being conditioned to be part of the system so research
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:27.680]  good talking to you all right let's uh let's hit the clip how much
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:32.400]  longer was left in that guy's about about a minute left or not even
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:35.520]  maybe we'll play more of it later i want to take some more calls and then at the
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:40.080]  30 after we're actually going to have the writer of this uh
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:44.240]  i think it's of uh this latest article it had about two three minutes left
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:48.480]  well we might play more of that later this article on the uh
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:53.360]  emt driver and associate the other emt worker who was tending to the uh
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:56.080]  sick later we're gonna get the whole story from the reporter who was on the
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:15:59.360]  scene we've been trying to get the people actually involved they don't seem to be
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:02.640]  wanting to come on the radio program i don't know if they're actually aware of
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:05.840]  who we are or they're scared of the media or they're scared of the repercussions
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:09.120]  in their town but we're gonna get start to finish what did happen there
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:13.280]  outside of what you saw in the video you know this outrageous out of control cop
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:17.920]  putting his hands on an emt worker who's trying to help somebody i mean
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:21.840]  they tried to arrest him and people he resisted arrested had he not resisted
[2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:25.520]  he would have gone to jail he didn't go to jail there's a state law you know we
[2:16:25.520 --> 2:16:30.000]  didn't read that i don't think on air but he goes it's a state law and that's
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  because there is a state law that uh actually protects paramedics in
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:37.600]  oklahoma a new law in oklahoma makes it a felony to attack or injure emergency
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:41.920]  medical technicians which it should be uh but the will the law really protect
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:45.920]  them in oklahoma last year 14 emsa paramedics were attacked while on the
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:49.360]  job eight of those were in tulsa and six in oklahoma city
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:53.920]  so he immediately says there's a state law and uh like i said he he really did
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:57.840]  keep his cool those cops were way way out of line you can go see the video over
[2:16:57.840 --> 2:17:02.800]  at info wars dot com or my blog the info warrior dot com dp in california you're
[2:17:02.800 --> 2:17:09.520]  on the air yes dp well it's jason for taking my call i uh was really
[2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:13.440]  interested in the clip you showed there at the sea world
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:16.640]  uh i was not aware that that was in control
[2:17:16.640 --> 2:17:20.240]  i kind of i hate to kind of digress but i need some help
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:28.640]  on hr 1207 the only thing i have is off of government track dot us
[2:17:28.640 --> 2:17:34.400]  and in the summary it says that uh this act repeals the authority of a
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:39.680]  comptroller general to carry on an onsite examination of an open
[2:17:39.680 --> 2:17:44.080]  insured bank or bank holding company only if the appropriate federal
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:47.840]  regular regulatory agency has consented in writing
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:51.280]  it retains the authority of the comptroller general to audit a federal
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:56.640]  agency when my friends see this is they say i don't want no part of that if it
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:00.320]  repeals the authority of the comptroller general to
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:05.200]  carry out these onsite uh i pretty well understand this but is there a
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:09.040]  place that we can go to to find a better explanation of
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:13.840]  and the way you're talking about is the um is the audit the fed bill right
[2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:18.800]  yes or the 12 07 i would go to campaign for liberty dot com or

[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:29.040]  and how it's going to enact i think we've done some stories over at info wars
[2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:32.640]  dot com as well i know there are a ton of stories going up every day and it's
[2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:35.520]  very hard to go through all these things go check campaign for liberty i'm sure
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:37.920]  that there's a link that explains the entire bill
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:41.440]  over there i thank you for the call let's go to john in florida john you're on

[2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:55.200]  when governor uh was he was a governor texas george bush
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:18:59.280]  that uh... he he executed like a hundred fifty people
[2:18:59.280 --> 2:19:04.400]  yeah he executed and he only he only huh yeah he executed a bunch of people
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:07.440]  you know the one he only commuted one sentence
[2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:10.640]  yeah what's that the the matta morris murders is that where we're going to
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:14.480]  get into right here no is uh henry lee lucas
[2:19:14.480 --> 2:19:17.520]  yeah henry lee lucas the matta morris murders he was a killer

[2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:24.640]  uh... little also going to say about that is that there are scattershot reports
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:27.680]  all over the place and implicating that uh you know
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:31.920]  bush apparently uh pardon henry lee lucas this multiple murderers somebody

[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:42.960]  for me to really get into uh there's a quote from 2000 which i don't even want
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:44.880]  to say because it's from one new source and
[2:19:44.880 --> 2:19:48.560]  i'd like to get the video clip before i actually speak about it but it is

[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:16.480]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:19.680]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[2:21:19.680 --> 2:21:24.160]  well obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election

[2:21:37.280 --> 2:21:40.880]  it's not about left to right it's about a one world government

[2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:14.320]  it makes me wonder if the u.s citizen will ever again have the right to life

[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:29.440]  i've got so much more to think about
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:38.880]  deadlines and commitments what to leave in what to leave out
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:44.240]  against the wind we were running against the wind
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:47.680]  and that's what we need to be doing because right now the wind is blowing
[2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:50.880]  in a very dangerous direction folks and we're going to play more of that
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:54.640]  biometric clip because he does switch it up from being outside and goes
[2:24:54.640 --> 2:24:58.480]  internally and you really see even more of the biometric equipment they have
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:02.800]  inside a sea world it's actually just pretty crazy
[2:25:02.800 --> 2:25:07.200]  but we're also going to really outline this whole obama speech i think i started
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:10.320]  recording maybe two or three minutes into it we're going to break it down
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:14.240]  all in the next hour alex jones coming up at the top of the hour
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:17.760]  and in about five minutes we're going to have the person that wrote this
[2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:22.160]  article on the emt being jack booted if you will
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:26.080]  by the police oh don't try to save that old woman's life
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:31.440]  get in the car you are under arrest all right let's uh let's go to who we are
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:34.160]  on i believe chris in maryland you're on the air
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:38.880]  chris what's going on jason how you doing sir
[2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:43.120]  not too bad for teacher maryland i'm here at frederick maryland
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:46.640]  uh just wanted to touch on a couple subjects uh
[2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:50.480]  i think about 10 years ago i was driving to dc
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:54.480]  i was driving down the main uh the interstate the uh 495
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:59.680]  uh to come from frederick to dc there's a road called 270 another interstate
[2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:03.760]  and i was observing these boxes on the side of the roads
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:07.040]  it looked like uh readers to read at license plates
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:11.200]  possibly i don't know what other identification it was for
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:16.000]  but this was you know 10 plus years ago and me being you know the
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:20.080]  paranoid guy that i am i started to research and look into it and i haven't
[2:26:20.080 --> 2:26:22.640]  got much out of it uh i've actually contacted the state
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:26.240]  of mid highway administration and looked into that
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:29.440]  but i haven't i haven't got much out of it and then you guys talked about the
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:33.040]  grid i just felt that it probably being around the national
[2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:36.720]  the nation's capital that perhaps they have these
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:39.920]  on i-70 which goes from the east to the west
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:44.400]  already and it's been there for maybe much longer than we thought
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:48.000]  well i mean if you go to a place like virginia where there is a lot of
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.600]  national security infrastructure and underground bunkers i mean there's
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:55.200]  cameras everywhere on the road all over the place i mean i'd talk about a
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:58.240]  grid that's built there you go to new york city that same grid is almost in
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:00.320]  place you go to the uk that grid is in place
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:03.760]  and now they're militarizing those grids all over and you don't see that grid for
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:06.960]  instance as heavy in a boston massachusetts area
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:10.960]  but now they're upping the police force i mean those are just precursors to what
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:13.920]  they want to do to not only the entire nation but eventually
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:19.120]  the entire world and uh they almost can get around that with the spy satellite
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:21.760]  technology that they have now that i mean just look
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:26.320]  at you know google earth and google street view i mean you can get pretty
[2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:29.920]  nitty gritty with just that technology that's open source
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:33.360]  so i mean this has been you know they've been building the infrastructure for
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:36.880]  some time this is just a big coming out party with the obama
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:40.080]  administration and his speech today and again we're going to analyze that
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:42.720]  speech in the next hour i thank you for the call
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:46.320]  let's go to steven and texas steven online
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:49.440]  yes steven uh hey good afternoon jason
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:53.680]  hey uh first of all i wanted to say man with uh
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:27:57.280]  some of the calls you've been getting today i kind of i think i figured out
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:02.240]  what's going on here see you know you're from up north just like i am and so
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:05.840]  you know santa claus in the you know the myth
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:09.600]  about him he's at the north pole so you know obviously
[2:28:09.600 --> 2:28:13.360]  you know santa claus you know that because he's a mythological character
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:17.440]  and you're from up north too well that proves that you're promoting myth
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:20.640]  see and you just don't know what you're talking about you're just living in a
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:24.400]  fantasy land man you know and actually what i'm doing is i'm trying to use
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:27.680]  absurdity to point out absurdity because what i'm saying makes a whole lot more
[2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:31.680]  sense than these people that are calling in you like this guy earlier
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:35.360]  making a big deal about the fact that the name bush
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:39.760]  isn't in any of alex's movies now i want to say this dude
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:43.840]  you need to wake up and get real to me are you blind or just stupid
[2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:47.600]  i've seen just about every one of alex's movies and yours
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:51.840]  yours as well jason and i mean for crying out loud
[2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:57.920]  9 11 the road to tyranny that whole thing exposes the fact that the bush
[2:28:57.920 --> 2:29:02.880]  administration was intimately tied in with 9 11 and carrying out that whole
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:07.040]  thing so for you to go into stuff like that here's the bottom line
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:10.960]  okay obama deception and i've called in and mentioned this before jason
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:15.840]  and you agreed with me the thrust of that that name what it means is that the
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:20.480]  obama deception is getting caught up in this left versus right thing you know
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:24.080]  focusing on the fact that he's a so-called liberal and a leftist and all
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:28.160]  other stuff instead of the fact that the agenda he's pushing which is he
[2:29:28.160 --> 2:29:32.800]  works for the same people that bush works for and the bottom line is this
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:36.480]  you need to wake up because regardless of what's going on

[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:56.800]  i'm sorry i'm not sure what the affiliate is here
[2:33:56.800 --> 2:34:00.240]  yeah well why don't you just for starters
[2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:03.360]  describe what happened outside of this video in other words what have you been
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:06.720]  been able to surmise is the case i mean why was this woman going to the
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:10.160]  hospital why were these people pulled over in the first place what happens
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:13.600]  before we get to see i guess the sun take his cell phone
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:16.880]  camera and start documenting the event okay well before i say anything i have to
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:20.400]  say that i'm with the cbs affiliate in oklahoma city kwtv
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:24.960]  so let's get that out there all right um we got a call on
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:29.120]  memorial day this past monday uh from the gentleman who shot that video kenyatta
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:33.200]  davis he told me that his mother had suffered heat stroke
[2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:37.680]  his mother lives in the town of boli which is in another area of oklahoma and
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:40.560]  every weekend they every year they have to
[2:34:40.560 --> 2:34:44.240]  rodeo that goes on and he was with his mom and they attended the rodeo
[2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:47.280]  and he actually lives in oklahoma city but he was visiting with his mother and
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:50.960]  he stayed the weekend well his mom was doing some work outside of the house
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:55.600]  and suffered from an heat exhaustion he told him so they called an ambulance
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:59.200]  which was run by the they called 911 as you would expect and
[2:34:59.200 --> 2:35:02.880]  the ambulance picked him up from the creek nation it's the creek nation of the
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:07.200]  indian tribe which runs the ambulance service of that area
[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:11.600]  well they picked him up and they picked up his mother and they were riding to
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:16.000]  the emergency room in a nearby town called pray to the hospital
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:19.760]  and what happens but what happens after that is a matter of
[2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:23.840]  debate between the oklahoma highway patrol and
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:27.440]  the davis family but judging from what the davis family told me that's all i
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:30.480]  can pretty much tell you what they told me and what i so so from the
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:34.320]  perspective of the davis family how does this all occur i mean we do we have
[2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:38.240]  any other eyewitnesses outside of the davis family has anybody else we did
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:40.480]  hear from we did hear from some other eyewitnesses
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:45.040]  yesterday who pretty much confirmed the davis family's version of events
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:48.000]  okay um and i'll tell you what those events are
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:53.920]  they were riding down highway 62 through a town called payton
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:59.040]  and they were not running hot uh as they say they did not have on their siren
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:02.560]  they did not have on their light their their light
[2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:05.920]  they were just driving down the road which did not have a lot of traffic and
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:10.720]  was a winding road as you would expect on a holiday weekend in a small town
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:15.840]  and they said within a matter of seconds they saw an ohp trooper pull up next to
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:19.920]  them just out of nowhere the ohp trooper according to the davis family
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:23.040]  was not running his uh it hot either they had
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:26.880]  that they had the lights on they didn't have the sirens on so this trooper just
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:29.760]  got in his car according to the davis who then
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:33.920]  drove up to the ambulance and on their way to a separate call they were
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:38.960]  responding to a call of a i believe so in car okay then they called for backup
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:43.680]  and another ambulance came over another i'm sorry ohp trooper car came over
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:48.320]  and they got into an argument because the troopers believed
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:53.680]  that the ambulance did not yield to them so that they can respond to the call
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:57.920]  okay the ambulance maintained the paramedic maintained paul franc was the
[2:36:57.920 --> 2:37:00.800]  one driving and he said in a written statement
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:04.480]  that he did not hear them and because of the trajectory of the road and how it
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:08.080]  was winding he could not see them he didn't know that they were
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:11.680]  driving up that quickly until after they had passed him or when they
[2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:14.960]  approached him so had he known that he would have yielded
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:18.160]  okay well the troopers went and dealt with their official business and once
[2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:21.760]  that was concluded they turned or they stayed where they were and when the
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:25.760]  ambulance was passing they stopped them and pulled them over
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.000]  to ticket them for not yielding the paramedics
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:33.600]  the first one they dealt with was paul and he pretty much said
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:37.440]  well you know something let's deal with this at the hospital i have a patient
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:40.880]  in the back that's being treated we need to go to the hospital
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:45.440]  mm-hmm he he maintains that the trooper in question
[2:37:45.440 --> 2:37:50.160]  his name i believe it's daniel martin she started yelling and said you know get
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:52.800]  your blanket might be a call i'm writing you a ticket now
[2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:55.920]  this is ridiculous you should know let's stop for a second this is the
[2:37:55.920 --> 2:37:58.880]  this is the driver this is the older white gentleman with the glasses
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:02.640]  correct right okay okay right that's what he's saying
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:06.240]  if that is what happened now kenyatta davis
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:11.520]  was writing in the passenger side of the ambulance and saw all of this happened
[2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:17.040]  saw them yelling and screaming so he just stayed inside well apparently
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:20.240]  the other paramedic that would be the black gentleman
[2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:24.800]  his name is morris white he came out of the car and said listen we have to go
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:28.240]  and get this patient treated to the hospital and
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:32.240]  there was a mini scuffle that occurred according to
[2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:36.400]  oh hb and according to him where they tried to arrest him and he said no you're
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:39.680]  not arresting me if you if you if you want to take this up
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:43.440]  let's go to the hospital and once we get this patient admitted then you can do
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:46.000]  whatever you want to do and now this is before
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:50.160]  um the uh passenger the sun starts filming it all there's a scuffle before
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:53.120]  the couple before the filming that we have not seen
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:56.720]  that that apparently was recorded by dash cam video which i'll talk about in
[2:38:56.720 --> 2:39:01.440]  a few minutes okay the the driver um is still outside
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:04.160]  the vehicle mr. white goes back in and begins
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:08.240]  working on kenyatta's mother you know trying to get her up to speed
[2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:12.080]  and at that point kenyatta comes out of the ambulance to see what's going on
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:15.360]  out of the passenger side of the ambulance he was going on and they told
[2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:18.800]  him yet again you know we are stopped this is what's happening this is what's
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:21.840]  going on at that point he pulls out his phone and
[2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:26.160]  he starts to record everything he does a little introduction on the on the raw
[2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:28.640]  video which you could probably see and he said
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:32.480]  you know this is me ohp just pulled over my mother's ambulance
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:35.360]  this is what she this is because they said that we didn't pull over
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:38.480]  whereas we were trying to get her to the hospital so i'm just going to record
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:42.960]  some video of what's going on so once he recorded the video
[2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:47.360]  that that's all the video that you see from that point that's what we reported
[2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:50.800]  that's what he said to us and that's what we reported on
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:55.680]  and then the ambulance the ohp trooper tried to arrest mr. white again for the
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:39:59.840]  second time and that's when the couple ensued and you know in the video you
[2:39:59.840 --> 2:40:03.040]  see mr. white actually telling uh... mr. davis
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:06.320]  uh... not to get involved yeah not to get involved it seems like he's waiting
[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:10.560]  for cooler heads to prevail just to go now before we get into you know what
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:15.040]  may or may not be on that tape apparently from the uh... the police cam
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:18.640]  isn't there an apparatus out there where these police instead of pulling over
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:22.800]  this ambulance could have contacted uh... the the ambulance service or the
[2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:26.480]  hospital and asked if they were on call or you know if they were on an
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:28.240]  emergency call isn't there something there
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:31.440]  couldn't they have done something else other than pull these guys over in a
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:34.720]  failure to yield when they didn't apparently even have their sirens on
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:36.240]  well anytime
[2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:40.000]  there is a situation where an ambulance is responding to something or
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:40.640]  uh...
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:44.560]  police officers responding to something you can always verify whether there is a
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:46.000]  call in progress
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:50.160]  you know we may not in the media have that ability but nine one one and
[2:40:50.160 --> 2:40:52.960]  other emergency managers can always verify with each other whether the
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:54.160]  call in progress
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:40:55.680]  and you know
[2:40:55.680 --> 2:41:00.560]  the failure to yield issue was never disputed by the paramedic
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:04.800]  the paramedic said you know maybe we did fail to yield but we did not see him
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:07.360]  had we seen him we would have yielded
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:09.040]  you know and they were not
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:12.800]  denying anything happened they were not denying that they were
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:15.120]  trying not to yield which
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:17.200]  all both parties would probably doubt
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:20.480]  they just wanted the issue handled after the patient was admitted to the
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:22.000]  hospital
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:26.080]  well i mean it seems like the guy is very frustrated even in the you know
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:29.440]  twenty or so seconds that he he's talking to the officer before the
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:30.960]  physical altercation
[2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:32.400]  actually ensues
[2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:35.440]  and he does try to arrest him i mean he literally does say
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:39.040]  you're under arrest two or three different times and it's when he tries
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:40.000]  to cuff him
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:43.440]  you know the guy again mentions the state law which we have in front of us
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:47.680]  uh... will mt law protect paramedics a new law in oklahoma makes it a felony
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:50.400]  to attack or injure emergency medical technicians
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:52.400]  uh... but will the law really protect them
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:55.280]  i mean it just seems ludicrous to me that we can't handle this
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:41:58.720]  i mean if there's anything to handle at the hospital especially since
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:02.080]  that's the only e m t in the back with the patient
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:04.160]  well i can tell you that
[2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:06.560]  well when we heard about this in the newsroom
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:09.120]  you know we got a call on on monday
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:12.560]  and if any of you guys have ever worked in news you can call so many people
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:13.920]  alleging different things
[2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:17.440]  and when you start looking into the story it's not always that thing
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:18.640]  and i was
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:22.000]  one of the reporters who drew the short straw and was working that monday on
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:23.360]  memorial day
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:26.320]  and got the phone call from mr davis who
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:29.280]  explained his position and talked about what was going on and talked about
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:30.160]  what happened
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:33.040]  and i told him well i'm not going to do the story today because i want to give
[2:42:33.040 --> 2:42:35.520]  ohhp a chance to respond to them
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:39.840]  and he said oh that's fine just you know i'm just going to email you some video
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:43.360]  and he did and i looked at it and i looked at it again the next day and i
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:44.640]  called him and his
[2:42:44.640 --> 2:42:48.800]  version of events did not change now i contacted ohhp
[2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:51.200]  and ohhp said that
[2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:52.080]  you know
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:56.080]  they referred us to they well the beat well let me just say the pio that i
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:56.880]  spoke with
[2:42:56.880 --> 2:43:01.040]  the public information officer told me that there was some dash cam video that
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:02.720]  had been turned over
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:03.520]  to
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:04.400]  the
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:08.480]  district attorney in the in the area where this all transpired in opaloski
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:12.480]  county the assistant district attorney her name is maxie riley i've been
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:14.800]  speaking with her for the past couple of days
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:18.880]  and the first version that she told me what she did tell me initially was that
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:28.080]  the dash cam video shows mr white attacking the trooper
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:31.200]  and you know and it recorded everything soup to nut
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:34.640]  and mr white could be facing charges and those charges could come down as
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:36.720]  earliest this week and i just checked
[2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:38.000]  about
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:41.360]  six minutes ago and she told me there were no charges
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:44.640]  that were coming down yet they have not filed they have not made a decision
[2:43:44.640 --> 2:43:45.920]  whether to file
[2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:49.280]  what was going on and are we going to be able to see this video i mean are we
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:50.240]  i mean is it going to
[2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:53.600]  be to the point where you have to ask for an foya request are they going to
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:56.960]  voluntarily let the the public see this i mean well they said that they are not
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:01.040]  going to release the video until after it goes to trial or presumably
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:04.720]  after charges are handed down so we've been talking back and forth
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:07.040]  um i was told that
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:09.840]  you know that's a decision that will come later on
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:13.280]  but you know if there's dash cam video that supports
[2:44:13.280 --> 2:44:17.120]  the troopers version of event then clearly that could
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:20.880]  go a long way towards being what actually transpired well it really seems
[2:44:20.880 --> 2:44:24.320]  to me that if that were the case we would have seen this trooper video by now
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:28.000]  but i'll be shocked if that is the case but again let's give them the benefit
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:31.280]  of the doubt although i'm not sure that the way that they acted again pulling
[2:44:31.280 --> 2:44:32.320]  over an ambulance
[2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:35.920]  enables that let's talk about the troopers in general do any of these guys
[2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:40.080]  have any kind of a past history of complaints such as this i mean is this
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:43.520]  supposedly an isolated incident well it has this happened before
[2:44:43.520 --> 2:44:47.200]  i've gotten a couple of calls that would suggest well before i even go into that
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:50.640]  i just want to say that mr davis made it perfectly clear or plain
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:54.880]  plainly clear to me that there was only one trooper that was involved in this
[2:44:54.880 --> 2:44:58.720]  in terms of trying to arrest the paramedic he said the other troopers who
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:02.400]  are on the scene were just trying to diffuse the situation
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:06.480]  you know he said it was one trooper that i called by name daniel martin who was
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:10.800]  the responding trooper um as of now when i spoke with ohp
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:13.440]  he's now the subject of an internal investigation
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:18.480]  okay and daniel martin has not been put on paid administrative leave which is
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:23.360]  routine in most cases or suspended you know usually when an officer is is
[2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:27.360]  under investigation for something whether the charges are valid or not
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:30.960]  they're still an investigation pending they would usually put that officer on
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:34.640]  paid administrative leave while that investigation goes on
[2:45:34.640 --> 2:45:37.440]  and or they would suspend him outright
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:40.960]  paid administrative leave is seen as a procedural type of thing
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:44.800]  suspension is seen more as a punishment or a reprimand well what can you tell
[2:45:44.800 --> 2:45:47.840]  us about anything what what can you tell us about this
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:50.320]  internal investigation are they at least telling you what he's being
[2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:53.520]  investigated for what are some of these previous complaints
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:57.600]  well the previous complaints i haven't got any word back from ohp on the
[2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:01.440]  previous complaints i asked about that and they said that
[2:46:01.440 --> 2:46:03.920]  they're still looking into it and i don't i don't know whether there's a
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:06.560]  procedural thing that goes on unless someone is
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:10.320]  you know charged with the crime or you know
[2:46:10.320 --> 2:46:13.680]  formally you know being investigated whether they release that information to
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:17.200]  the public but i i will tell you that i've gotten at
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:20.800]  least one other call from a paramedic for the same
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:24.800]  organization who alleges that someone stopped her
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:28.320]  that thing super stopped her vehicle while she was trying to transport a
[2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:30.720]  pregnant woman so wait a minute this this guy has a
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:33.920]  past of actually this isn't the first time he's pulled over an ambulance and
[2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:36.400]  the other incident was with a pregnant woman
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:40.400]  well i that is what i'm that is one of the allegations of being made
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:43.920]  from a paramedic who worked for the same in the same group
[2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:47.520]  now from that allegation i mean what was she ticketed was she detained was she
[2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:51.920]  stopped did she find this difficult i mean well what's the story i'm still
[2:46:51.920 --> 2:46:54.880]  working the story and trying to get all angled
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:58.240]  as far as what happened i'm you know she called and left me a message and i
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:00.400]  spoke with her husband about this because he was
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:04.160]  actually he was the one called so i'm still trying to confirm that and i'm
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:07.600]  still trying to talk to you know the paramedics in question but the
[2:47:07.600 --> 2:47:11.280]  paramedics were not um mr white and mr frank
[2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:13.600]  have not been suspended either according to the
[2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:17.360]  pre-nation they're still on duty they're still paramedics they're still
[2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:22.880]  working working on on their ship now now it does this guy have any kind of like
[2:47:22.880 --> 2:47:27.040]  relations is is there a good old boy network out there i mean if this guy's
[2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:30.560]  under investigation he's not on paid ministry to leave it all
[2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:34.480]  he's not on leave while he's being investigated that seems to be i mean
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:37.760]  this seems like maybe it's a smaller community people are afraid to speak up
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:41.920]  is that because there is this you know back backwards network out there i mean
[2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:45.360]  does this guy have relatives friends and in the uh
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:49.120]  in the upper echelons the city council i mean what's the deal here does he have
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:52.160]  any of those kind of connections well from some of the viewers i heard from
[2:47:52.160 --> 2:47:55.360]  there seems to be that perception that he's being protected
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:59.920]  um i don't know if i can't say for certain whether the ohhp is protecting
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:03.920]  them but there is a there is a judge in the county
[2:48:03.920 --> 2:48:07.920]  where this all happened to happen to have the last name of the bank trooper
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:11.520]  and i'm trying to make the connection there i just spoke with the da i asked
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:14.480]  that they were related and she told me she didn't believe that they were but i
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:18.720]  still i haven't been able to confirm that um because you know again we're still
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:21.840]  working the story with joe trying to find out some stuff i still would like to
[2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:25.840]  see the entire dash cam video of what transpired
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:28.800]  which yeah i think that's utterly necessary i mean we need to know what
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:33.040]  happened before especially because you know the way that the video that i've
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:37.040]  seen the gentleman in the back is trying to keep the coolest of heads and it's
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:41.520]  not until again they try to arrest him and he is the only
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:46.080]  ems worker in the back with this woman that he he tends to get a little high
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:49.440]  he doesn't even really get hot there it's when they put his hands on him and
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:52.800]  say he's under arrest and you know my point is i've had callers come in and
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:57.360]  say no he's the bad guy he resisted arrest had he not resisted they would
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:01.120]  have taken him into custody he would have been processed and this woman would
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:04.320]  have been taken to the hospital without an ems worker in the back
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:08.400]  to me that's crazy well and they said that's the reason they didn't arrest him
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:12.480]  because there was a patient back there but you know and they said that he could
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:15.120]  be arrested later on and when i asked well
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:18.880]  why wasn't he arrested at the scene they didn't want to arrest the paramedic
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:21.600]  because they said they didn't want to leave that area which is a relatively
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:25.120]  small area without it without a paramedic on duty
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:27.680]  but if that's kind of double speak because then they would have arrested
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:30.480]  him after he got to the hospital or charged him like you said there have
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:33.360]  been no charges yet and he hasn't been arrested yet
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:36.720]  yeah and he hasn't been arrested yet so it really to me seems like they're
[2:49:36.720 --> 2:49:40.400]  really trying to cover their own you know back sides if you will
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:44.160]  and this is just to me it was a really disgusting incident these people are
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:47.440]  out there to save lives uh this could have been dealt with with just a call
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:51.040]  like you said to the 911 operator to see if there was an emergency call there
[2:49:51.040 --> 2:49:55.120]  was no reason to set up what you said was basically a roadblock after they had
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:59.680]  taken care of their call to have this incident ensue and again we only get to
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:03.520]  see part of the picture and i would think that you know there are i think two or
[2:50:03.520 --> 2:50:07.920]  three cop cars on the scene there should be more than one dash cam
[2:50:07.920 --> 2:50:12.480]  right so you know i i hope that you continue uh to pursue this story you
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:15.760]  uh hit us up with any updates i really thank you for your time sir
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:19.440]  and like i said if you get anything more if the dash cam is released please give
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:22.320]  us an email please give us a call we'd love to have you back on well thank you
[2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:25.520]  so much and i you know i can tell you that this story is
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:29.280]  is has gone viral and we've gotten tons of calls
[2:50:29.280 --> 2:50:32.480]  from across the country you know it's been all over the cable news
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:36.240]  network i think it made it an at least one story on the network level so it's
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:40.160]  definitely an issue people are going to be keeping a close eye on myself included
[2:50:40.160 --> 2:50:44.880]  all right thank you so much dave jordan everybody and uh the latest on that emt
[2:50:44.880 --> 2:50:48.480]  versus oklahoma pd incident really a disgusting
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:52.400]  incident in my opinion and a blight on the police force
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:55.280]  and really the police state that is encroaching on it since the alex jones
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:51:01.520]  show back with your calls after this alex on the other side of the hour
[2:51:01.520 --> 2:51:05.280]  less than a century ago half of the american public grew much of their own
[2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:08.320]  food today it's been estimated that only one percent of
[2:51:08.320 --> 2:51:12.400]  americans still grow their own food during a great depression over 18
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:16.400]  million people suffered from starvation and as america continues down its
[2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:20.080]  current path for many the reality of another depression is a very
[2:51:20.080 --> 2:51:23.680]  serious concern with massive layoffs and unemployment at
[2:51:23.680 --> 2:51:27.440]  record levels growing your own food will help you save money that you'd

[2:59:09.120 --> 2:59:12.320]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[2:59:12.320 --> 2:59:15.760]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:18.000]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:21.520]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again

[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:34.240]  cyber security guard and obama speech but the latest news on this cop
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:39.120]  attacking an ems worker you know he's under internal investigation right now
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:44.080]  he does seem to be part of this back alley good old boys network and we know
[3:08:44.080 --> 3:08:47.680]  that there are at least two cameras that caught this two of the police officer
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:50.560]  dash cams that they're not releasing and they're saying
[3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:53.760]  oh we're waiting for this to go to trial or charges to be filed
[3:08:53.760 --> 3:08:57.120]  yet they didn't arrest this guy there aren't any charges to be filed
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:09:02.560]  because he didn't do anything alex absolutely that's what's so atrocious
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:06.960]  about this story is that witnesses are all over the news
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:10.320]  saying that the ambulance couldn't get traffic to move out of the way the
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:14.480]  police wanted to go somewhere as well so the police began violently
[3:09:14.480 --> 3:09:18.160]  getting right on the tail of the ambulance and then shot around
[3:09:18.160 --> 3:09:23.280]  the ambulance on the shoulder and then later when they were done
[3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:26.240]  with whatever business it was that they never said so must not have been very
[3:09:26.240 --> 3:09:30.160]  important they didn't chase the ambulance back down
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:33.680]  jump out get the driver's face scream and yell at him
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:38.480]  uh... he submits and then they go and open up the back
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:42.240]  acting like mad dogs because he wants they do wrong they have to legitimize it
[3:09:42.240 --> 3:09:45.680]  by saying you're bad beating you up falsely charging you
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:48.480]  doing something it's it's it's like when they beat you up after they shoot you
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:49.280]  in the back
[3:09:49.280 --> 3:09:52.800]  i see this time it or after they break pro-lifers arms they didn't beat them up
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:09:56.400]  and they're all they it's not enough to savagely compound fracture them
[3:09:56.400 --> 3:09:59.760]  it's got to continue and i have footage of all of this
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:02.880]  and people peacefully sitting on the side of the sidewalk and this is
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:06.560]  happening and and i know most police and i've seen them commenting on info
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:09.760]  wars dot com prison plot dot com and the in the articles that steve watson wrote
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:12.160]  in the current memo posted
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:15.120]  i've seen him saying well yes we're not trained to choke people and we're not
[3:10:15.120 --> 3:10:17.840]  trained act like that you know that guy should probably get in trouble but
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:21.360]  don't think this is all of us you know the issue is every time stuff like this
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:24.080]  happens the police defend
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:29.120]  the police defend the bad cops to do this so that makes the entire system
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:31.920]  bad and look oklahoma is legendary
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:35.760]  i don't vacation in oklahoma they have great people up there but
[3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:40.240]  i don't vacation in oklahoma because of how many friends and family i've had
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:43.120]  shaken down by the police beat up by the police
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:46.400]  i mean if you're going one mile over the speed limit oklahoma
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:50.080]  many of these rural state police and others will it's almost like mexican
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:53.120]  police in mexico and see i mean everybody knows they're corrupt down
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:56.560]  there we're beginning to be known like this here
[3:10:56.560 --> 3:11:00.880]  and so the incredible thing is they told local news stations that i read on your
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:04.720]  show last night in the midnight so there's no sense in and you know going
[3:11:04.720 --> 3:11:06.880]  back over the day but we posted links to them
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:10.800]  uh... yesterday that all there was a fight
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:13.440]  all the paramedic in the police and got the fight
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:17.040]  well why was the car pulled over why is it being called a fight he does nothing
[3:11:17.040 --> 3:11:20.320]  the cop is attacking him shoving him pushing him
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:24.080]  grabbed him by the arms are twisting him behind his back for no reason
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:28.640]  they got pulled his arm away that is the assault of the god creature
[3:11:28.640 --> 3:11:33.920]  okay so so this is the mental illness so he was the guy in the back of the
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:36.640]  uh... of the ambulance he was the attending
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:40.480]  emergency medical person and so it
[3:11:40.480 --> 3:11:43.600]  then the police go to the news and say well they've been in a fight before
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:48.480]  that before the cameras were turned on
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:51.840]  so i mean just insane but now i would understand no everything you see on the
[3:11:51.840 --> 3:11:55.520]  tape is basically what happened and that's why the police
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:12:00.080]  realize in their moment of guilt
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:02.880]  which is shows their mad dog out of control they're not even really evil
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:05.680]  they're just out of their minds in the end on a power trip
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:08.960]  that's why they finally after they choke the guy and he
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:12.000]  sits there and controls himself and lets him torture him literally that's what
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:13.600]  torture is
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:16.400]  they then kind of shake themselves out of it and leave
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:18.960]  but then they come back and say well we're probably going to charge you later
[3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:21.600]  get ready for an indictment get ready for a warrant
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:25.920]  you know don't leave town it's time to admit you're not god
[3:12:25.920 --> 3:12:30.960]  i'm not a god i put my pants on one leg at a time i make mistakes i'm wrong
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:35.280]  i've been young and hotheaded you know i've been i've i don't go around road
[3:12:35.280 --> 3:12:38.480]  raging but when i was younger when people road rage me i jump
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:43.520]  out of the car and say let's go and a few times it did you got bloody
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:47.040]  well now i just know how to say yep you're tough that's right and if they
[3:12:47.040 --> 3:12:51.840]  you know i'll even run from somebody because i've got work to do
[3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:54.960]  i'd love to jump out of the car and start kicking their teeth and because i'm a
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:58.400]  human being i got red blood it it's actually fun at a certain level at an
[3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:01.200]  animal level but i have a wife and children to take care of
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:05.440]  i have a mission to complete and i will only open a can of whoopas if i have
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:09.280]  to protect myself or protect somebody else and i'm a hundred percent the right
[3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:12.800]  i'm not looking for a fight and the and and and old-fashioned
[3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:19.440]  lawmen or peace officers weren't looking for fights but i'll tell you this
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:23.520]  when they had to charge up the ut tower they didn't tower for
[3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:26.720]  three or four hours like they always do now waiting for federal orders and
[3:13:26.720 --> 3:13:30.640]  backup they didn't need a bunch of fancy gear because they had testicles and i'm
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:33.520]  sorry to use that term but that's what it comes down to
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:36.480]  you know the more gear the more crud the more
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:40.640]  you know supposed tactical training all of this stuff is a joke
[3:13:40.640 --> 3:13:43.440]  i've talked to a lot of old police a lot of old retired police about the
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:47.040]  stories about the things they did without all this gear without all this
[3:13:47.040 --> 3:13:51.200]  crud and the truth is they've made the police be against the people they have
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:54.560]  turned them against us they have trained them
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:57.920]  that they're all under incredible danger where i've seen cops approaching
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:14:01.600]  women old women and convertibles on a 360
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:05.120]  you know highway like they're approaching al-qaeda
[3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:08.400]  and they are scared to death of everything they think we're the enemy
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:12.720]  they think we're out to kill them and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:16.080]  as they get more and more abusive we're going to start getting more and more
[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:19.840]  abusive and the trust is gone and everything goes to hell in a hand
[3:14:19.840 --> 3:14:23.280]  basket we are all americans we live in the same country
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:26.800]  this country is going down the tubes in a police state
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:30.720]  and the sick part is that the media would come out and try to call this a
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:34.240]  fight and try to spend it and let the police sit there with no evidence
[3:14:34.240 --> 3:14:36.640]  you better believe they were released this dash video
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:40.640]  if they had proof uh... and and you know it's all there
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:44.400]  the the uh... e mt is in the back trying to attend the lady they're telling
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:46.960]  him stop stop what you're doing he's got boxes of
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:50.640]  of equipment and he's he and he just says what's your problem i'm doing my job
[3:14:50.640 --> 3:14:53.840]  get out of my way and it's about a power trip at some of the cop get the
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:57.200]  control of his ego and going my god i've got an ambulance pulled over
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:00.080]  because they didn't get out of my way i'm on an ego trip
[3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:04.000]  if these guys are professionals that they've had to pass state laws
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.640]  and federal laws to leave ambulances alone
[3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:10.720]  i've been reading email in the comments we've had scores of the mt's i mean
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:12.240]  probably more than fifty
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:15.360]  go yeah cops are pulling us over in denver cops are pulling us over in
[3:15:15.360 --> 3:15:18.080]  dallas cops are pulling us over in new york
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:21.040]  and telling us we couldn't speed them and
[3:15:21.040 --> 3:15:24.880]  so there's no even law saying yeah well actually we're going to feel crazy
[3:15:24.880 --> 3:15:28.720]  yeah as revealed by dav jordan uh... the cop that you know was the main guy in
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:31.360]  this incident that now is being internally investigated
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:35.200]  also had uh... pulled over an ambulance that contained a pregnant woman so this
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:38.800]  is his m o this isn't the first time he's even pulled over an ambulance alex
[3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:42.320]  that he's obviously some kind of lunatic and see instead of in the past they
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:45.360]  would just kick lunatics out of the police force
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:48.640]  listen i know a fellow manager of a home depot
[3:15:48.640 --> 3:15:52.880]  he's been on the show before nice clean cut you know no criminal record
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:58.960]  paralyzed from the chest down and the cop pulls him over
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:02.480]  and says what is this and he goes to these are my hand controls
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:07.040]  he should get out of the car and he said officer uh... okay my wife's going to
[3:16:07.040 --> 3:16:10.080]  get my wheelchair out of the back and he said you lie or nothing wrong with you
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:13.600]  he said i should get out now so the guy starts trying to get out he grabs him
[3:16:13.600 --> 3:16:14.320]  out
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:18.400]  beats him up this guy tried to sue him and the cop got promoted
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:23.600]  to a supervisor commander level in austin he's a huge right head
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:26.720]  and that's who they want they go oh you beat up a guy
[3:16:26.720 --> 3:16:31.200]  who's paralyzed you're the guy we want you're the guy that'll follow orders
[3:16:31.200 --> 3:16:35.280]  you're the guy i mean this is who they want this is who they
[3:16:35.280 --> 3:16:38.240]  want i mean and and look people may think it's cool to beat up somebody who's
[3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:41.120]  paralyzed because they don't walk when you order them to
[3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:44.560]  and and and the mental illnesses you didn't learn to
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:48.960]  you know be healed like jesus healed you or something you didn't
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:51.920]  you know connect those nerves in your spine to your legs
[3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:54.960]  and so the in their sick thing is he didn't follow my order he didn't follow
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:16:58.080]  my word i've got to escalate the i've got to escalate if
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:02.400]  they're trained to kill you if you don't move
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:05.520]  and so that's why we're seeing every day i see an article about
[3:17:05.520 --> 3:17:09.040]  a paralyzed person a retarded person an autistic person
[3:17:09.040 --> 3:17:12.880]  beat up or killed by the police because there'll be some you over 16 year old
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:16.800]  retarded kid wandering around in canada or england or the u.s. you know i see
[3:17:16.800 --> 3:17:20.080]  the story every few days and the cops walk up and say
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:24.080]  who are you going to some tattletale nazi neighbor calls him as a weird person
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:28.240]  and they can't talk and they go go go go the cop goes all right pal get on the
[3:17:28.240 --> 3:17:30.880]  ground they don't do it they taser him the person
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:34.640]  gets up scared starts running the cop draws down guns him down
[3:17:34.640 --> 3:17:38.240]  you know the his associates these are real stories folks
[3:17:38.240 --> 3:17:41.440]  the associates show up say well the officer felt threatened
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:44.880]  you know this is mental illness that they can't
[3:17:44.880 --> 3:17:48.720]  you know have more control of themselves being a man
[3:17:48.720 --> 3:17:52.320]  means that you're in control of yourself and don't care about your ego
[3:17:52.320 --> 3:17:56.720]  and and you know that's why cops have such problem with alcoholism drug abuse
[3:17:56.720 --> 3:17:59.600]  the highest rate of divorce the highest rate of suicide
[3:17:59.600 --> 3:18:04.160]  because in their own personal lives this attitude i mean my god
[3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:09.120]  i've got natural testosterone and i have to control myself looking for a fight
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:11.520]  all the time i mean i want to attack people all the time
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:15.200]  because i'm a man but the point is i mean i want to get in fights i hope some
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:17.760]  big guys start to fight with me at a subconscious level
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:21.520]  because i am a killer ape as they say but the issue is
[3:18:21.520 --> 3:18:24.720]  i've got too much testosterone that's why i'm almost scared to be getting in
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:26.480]  shape right now because i get more aggressive
[3:18:26.480 --> 3:18:30.720]  can you imagine that 30 plus percent of police they admit federal statistics
[3:18:30.720 --> 3:18:34.400]  are on hardcore steroids can you imagine wanting more
[3:18:34.400 --> 3:18:37.920]  artificial steroids in you than what you have naturally
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:41.280]  in you as if cops need this to be tough
[3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:45.440]  look if you think you need steroids to be a tough guy you shouldn't be a cop
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:18:49.600]  okay if you were really a tough guy you'd be scared of what you do to somebody
[3:18:49.600 --> 3:18:52.560]  and i speak from experience i don't claim to be some tough guy because i've had
[3:18:52.560 --> 3:18:55.840]  my butt kicked plenty of times there's a lot of tough guys out there
[3:18:55.840 --> 3:19:00.960]  but you know i look like all i'm saying is you can kill people punch them once
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:04.400]  and people need to understand out there that the police are mentally ill out of
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:08.240]  control but bermas i'm ranting i want to get into the cyber
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:12.160]  security federal takeover when we get back i want to cover some economic news

[3:24:37.440 --> 3:24:41.120]  through hannah montana and of course the cyber security act which is being
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:44.480]  promoted by jay rockefeller jay rockefeller and others
[3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:47.600]  and now the obama administration just coming out saying you know what we're
[3:24:47.600 --> 3:24:50.640]  going to have a new bureaucracy we're going to have all this control over you
[3:24:50.640 --> 3:24:54.480]  we are building a smart grid your medical records will be digitized
[3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:57.600]  and earlier today at alex we played up bits and segments
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:02.480]  of you going to see world and explaining this smart grid this biometric control
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:07.200]  system yeah that was like seven years ago but
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:10.960]  none of this is i don't deserve the credit for knowing about this has been
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:14.720]  all on record mit the cia the defense department
[3:25:14.720 --> 3:25:19.120]  we're writing 20 years ago you'll be digital face scan the thumb printed to
[3:25:19.120 --> 3:25:23.040]  buy and sell there'll be a global sales tax there'll be a global
[3:25:23.040 --> 3:25:27.120]  carbon credit tax and that it's designed to
[3:25:27.120 --> 3:25:30.240]  categorize everything we do everywhere we go to create a
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:33.520]  psychological algorithm when you eat too much beef you'll be given a
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:36.240]  special tax because it's all going to be on your record
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:40.240]  uh when you uh you know drink it'll be on your record but then when you weigh
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:43.600]  too much already in japan i saw the article last week
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:47.680]  bureaucrats come around social services all adults must be weighed
[3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:51.440]  by the government and then they find and feed you and make you go to these
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:56.080]  prison workout centers to uh to to be exercised
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:25:59.680]  this is the nanny state but it's to carry out eugenics
[3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:04.400]  that's why they want social welfare system with the socialized health care
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:07.120]  so when you have a heart attack they give you an aspirin or when you have a
[3:26:07.120 --> 3:26:10.640]  brain tumor you weight 18 months when it would have been operable in two
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:13.520]  months and you die 100 percent of the time well let's talk about that for
[3:26:13.520 --> 3:26:16.640]  just a second alex because you know last night i'm up really late it's like
[3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:19.760]  3am but i'm watching the cbs national news feed and
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:22.800]  lo and behold there's a story out of austin and they're talking to this you
[3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:26.800]  know realtor this woman who's a single mother of two and she's saying oh it's
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:30.480]  so hard we had to give up our medical insurance but don't worry
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:34.720]  the new medical vans are coming around town and that's where i take my children
[3:26:34.720 --> 3:26:38.480]  now it used to be just for lower income families but since we all have to
[3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:41.200]  sacrifice we're going to have to use these mobile
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:43.760]  medical vans where they're basically going to give you the
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:48.560]  delicious vaccinations and drugs that just dumb you down let me leave you
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:51.760]  let me break that down i you know i i kept telling people
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:55.440]  the fema camps are going to be a place you've got to go
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:26:58.400]  they're not going to be oh here's the deadly fema camp if you read the fema
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:01.120]  camp bill everything in it is already built
[3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:06.000]  it's just codifying it into law you'll have over a hundred small camps
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:11.120]  six big regional camps every city has it robert mehler has part of it built
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:14.560]  uh... the highland mall has part of the fema center in it now
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:17.760]  and poor austin i can't even go look at it for themselves i just say no it's not
[3:27:17.760 --> 3:27:20.960]  true but the point is they're going to have it as you said this was on
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:25.360]  national news but with the austin the local the mobile vans
[3:27:25.360 --> 3:27:29.440]  and they already have this for head start where they come and say all your
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:32.640]  kids are abused they drill out the wrong teeth
[3:27:32.640 --> 3:27:35.680]  because they get more federal money for the more medical stuff they do
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:39.360]  and they're going to have medical centers on these fema centers
[3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:44.480]  and trailers and tents and people are going to want to live in them
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:47.280]  but even if you want to live under a bridge or in the woods they're going to
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:50.480]  make you go to them this is all i see i i know what's going to happen
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:54.240]  but it's all stated and that's why it started in hawaii and california we
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:27:57.840]  sent a camera crew there a month ago it's going to be in the new obama film
[3:27:57.840 --> 3:28:01.760]  so that's why when i get on the air and i say ladies and gentlemen i cannot
[3:28:01.760 --> 3:28:05.440]  articulate to you how fast it's moving how serious it is i mean here's one
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:09.200]  right here obama demands right to recruit miners for military
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:12.560]  because people don't want their five six seven year olds having recruiters
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:15.920]  in the schools federally in all school districts
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:20.320]  brainwashing the kids to join the military and having them sign agreements
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:23.360]  to join they tell them you'll be arrested if you don't
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:27.040]  this is when it's not the law but see they say you'll be arrested if you don't
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:30.080]  take vaccines they say you'll be arrested if you yell at your
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:33.920]  kids now when it's not even the law this is the system
[3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:37.440]  this is a scientific tyranny and yes the cyber
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:41.120]  security command and yes now that i'm down here
[3:28:41.120 --> 3:28:44.400]  you know taking a few days off i'm watching more tv hannah montana
[3:28:44.400 --> 3:28:49.200]  that cyrus demon and her father they are
[3:28:49.200 --> 3:28:54.080]  everywhere saying turn your guns in we need to ban the first amendment
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:58.800]  because it makes kids commit suicide cyber bullying which openly bans all
[3:28:58.800 --> 3:29:02.480]  free speech i mean openly bans at all federal felonies for any free speech
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:06.000]  that hurt someone's feelings we've got to pass the cyber
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:10.240]  security command this is a operation i did do the research by the way it is
[3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:13.200]  confirmed uh... his whole family are in military
[3:29:13.200 --> 3:29:16.800]  intelligence and black ops so this is definitely a giant
[3:29:16.800 --> 3:29:20.000]  scion and and how do you argue with that
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:23.120]  you know your ten-year-old girl is allowed to watch tv she watches the
[3:29:23.120 --> 3:29:26.720]  brainwashing she wants to do what hannah montana is saying
[3:29:26.720 --> 3:29:30.320]  and it's all about how she's going to be a movie star if she just believes in

[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:31.120]  it isn't our military anymore that's how hitler got the germans
[3:34:31.120 --> 3:34:34.240]  to stand down and do whatever they were told is he'd say oh support the
[3:34:34.240 --> 3:34:36.800]  military memorial day they had one of those in germany
[3:34:36.800 --> 3:34:40.400]  you know you're not against the troops are you they pin everything they do on
[3:34:40.400 --> 3:34:44.720]  the red white blue of the spree decor our history our liberties our freedoms
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:47.680]  george washington this is the opposite of george
[3:34:47.680 --> 3:34:51.520]  washington and thomas jefferson uh... and sam adams
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:56.320]  and john adams this is high treason and there's no doubt this is tyranny
[3:34:56.320 --> 3:34:58.560]  there's no doubt it's used against the general public
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:01.920]  it's no doubt they're harassing citizens it's no doubt they're using army
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:04.800]  intelligence to spy on mainline citizens groups
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:07.920]  there's no doubt the government staging terror attacks
[3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:11.440]  there is no doubt that they are setting up they've already set it up
[3:35:11.440 --> 3:35:17.040]  look there isn't wiretapping the phone companies under the 1996 telecommunications
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:20.800]  acts are set up to intercept everything
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:26.000]  by federal law everything is read by federal law they tear open your mail
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:29.600]  by federal law they urinate and i'm sorry to use that term all over the
[3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:30.720]  constitution
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:34.720]  and bill of rights this is about full spectrum dominance is what the pentagon
[3:35:34.720 --> 3:35:38.640]  calls it and the pentagon brags thomas barnett and others their top
[3:35:38.640 --> 3:35:41.600]  futurist that they openly work for offshore banks
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:45.520]  they have conquered us it is a big sickening joke but they can only
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:50.720]  continue their occupation if we're not aware that our government is illegitimate
[3:35:50.720 --> 3:35:52.320]  and criminal now
[3:35:52.320 --> 3:35:56.240]  i'm gonna get out of here as you play the disgusting clips of the president
[3:35:56.240 --> 3:35:59.760]  i'm telling us about the new 2.0 internet which they you read the
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:04.480]  internet to documents they brag just type in internet to the internet is dead
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:06.640]  and that's how they always start their conferences
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:09.920]  with the government corporations saying they're gonna shut the web down have
[3:36:09.920 --> 3:36:13.120]  chinese style censorship now happening in england
[3:36:13.120 --> 3:36:16.800]  prison planet band and most government web systems and wireless systems
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:20.880]  in australia and england it's already happening here in the u.s
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:24.080]  ladies and gentlemen it's over the joking around is over
[3:36:24.080 --> 3:36:27.280]  it's been moving incrementally but now it's moving at warp
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:32.240]  speed and i know i'm ranting because we're supposed to rant about these
[3:36:32.240 --> 3:36:35.040]  issues and not about our favorite football team
[3:36:35.040 --> 3:36:38.160]  winning or losing now that said i want to get out of here
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:41.440]  and let you get to calls and play some of those clips but i wanted to bring
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:45.680]  jim newcomer up because it was just a month ago
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:50.480]  the gold was at 880 880 and i said ladies and gentlemen according to bob
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:54.320]  chappen and others he believes it's gonna roll a rally back up
[3:36:54.320 --> 3:36:57.840]  probably by the fall it's going to be $1,200 an ounce now
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:01.920]  we don't have crystal balls we're not perfect but we are able to
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:05.680]  you know really gauge the new orders activities and we're right about 95% of
[3:37:05.680 --> 3:37:09.360]  the time regardless the the dollar is openly being
[3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:12.320]  destroyed for the new world order to be born for the north american union to be
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:15.280]  brought in right now golden silver the way to go now
[3:37:15.280 --> 3:37:19.760]  listen they have month old prices on silver when silver was three dollars
[3:37:19.760 --> 3:37:24.000]  less than ounce in one coin that the the the franklin
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:29.120]  silver half dollars they are almost gone they had to go up on the Lakota's
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:34.800]  from 17 to 20 dollars that's still five bucks cheaper you'll find them
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:38.960]  anywhere else that i've seen but they still have
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:43.680]  at the original month old price some of those half dollars but they are almost
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:46.160]  gone and i was just talking to jim newcomer who were about to bring up
[3:37:46.160 --> 3:37:49.360]  just a minute or two because i'm so excited about this
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:52.880]  it supports the network supports mitis but it also supports those that are
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:55.360]  getting it and and helps our entire operation
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:37:58.240]  so it's just win win win win win win for everybody
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:03.040]  and uh... it gets people to to remember what real money is not the fiat paper
[3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:07.120]  that they're now replacing with fiat cashless for total control
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:10.560]  and the greatest crime in the new world order is going to be black market as
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:14.240]  they call it underground economy operating outside their grid
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:17.840]  we need to fight the hold on the cash and fight the hold on more importantly
[3:38:17.840 --> 3:38:22.560]  to gold and silver now they have gold they were selling it at the 880 level
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:25.760]  they bought it at the 920 level was the next big buy
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:30.400]  they're almost sold out of that at 920 if you waited you shouldn't have
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:33.600]  they almost sold out now the whole to the weekend i was just talking to jim
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:36.080]  newcomer that they sold out of the 880 level

[3:38:52.080 --> 3:38:55.840]  dollars from a month ago ladies and gentlemen and even if gold was to go
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:38:58.640]  down next week but then rock it back up the next week it doesn't matter
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:02.640]  because you're getting it at the 920 level and yes ladies and gentlemen
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:07.200]  i'm selling this hard because this is what i believe in this is the surest
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:11.360]  safest bet is it is it 100 sure is it a silver bullet pun intended
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:14.560]  it's as close to a silver bullet as you're going to get
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:18.800]  to slay this werewolf of hyperinflation that is staring down
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:22.640]  uh... our next right now jim newcomer tell folks about some of the specials

[3:39:55.520 --> 3:39:59.600]  silver's up over 20 percent in the last month this is normally our quiet time of
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:03.840]  the year and the phones have just been ringing off the hook people are in
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:07.440]  a panic trying to get they understand what's going on out there in the
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:10.720]  economy and they recognize that they have to convert the paper
[3:40:10.720 --> 3:40:13.680]  into real money and the only way they're going to do it is to put it into
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:17.440]  precious metals so i would urge you all to call us here in the numbers
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:24.640]  800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237 we'll have brokers here

[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:36.080]  he'll know the date and time that you call in and he'll get back to you

[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:46.480]  800-686-2237 and ladies and gentlemen
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:49.360]  a lot of people think this is the financial earthquake
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:53.600]  this is only a tremor before the big one there is no doubt we have the
[3:40:53.600 --> 3:40:56.080]  billerberg group documents we have the club of realm documents
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:01.280]  trilateral commission cfr i watched public european union hearings
[3:41:01.280 --> 3:41:05.200]  in their parliament they plan on completely gutting the world economy
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:09.840]  and bring us into a long dark depression and now i pray we avert this
[3:41:09.840 --> 3:41:12.560]  but i doesn't look like we probably are
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:17.200]  and it but again you think people are panicking now to buy gold and silver
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:20.400]  when the yuppies quit sucking their thumbs and acting cool and
[3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:24.240]  being in pompous self-delusions with their collars popped up walking around
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:26.480]  talking about what great intellectuals they are
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:29.280]  when they figure out cnbc's been lying to them
[3:41:29.280 --> 3:41:32.240]  they are going to raise the gold and silver and you're not going to get your
[3:41:32.240 --> 3:41:36.000]  hands on it ted is already killing himself to find
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:39.120]  gold and silver at good prices most people been sold out
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:43.920]  off and off the last 12 to 14 months we're very competitive because we've
[3:41:43.920 --> 3:41:47.520]  been so aggressive in pricing i'm just telling you ladies and gentlemen
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:51.440]  that this is not the time to sit there idly by
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:54.560]  you need to check out and investigate gold and silver
[3:41:54.560 --> 3:41:57.760]  as a hedge against all of this uncertainty that's taking place
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:42:02.000]  because these are precious industrial metals these things have always been
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:06.240]  what currency real currency real wealth is all about here is the number eight
[3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:10.240]  hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:14.160]  six eight six two two three seven and there will be brokers it might as
[3:42:14.160 --> 3:42:17.280]  throughout the weekend correct jim that's correct we will be here saturday
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:21.920]  and sunday jim this is scary because by the end of last summer we saw the
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:25.920]  unseasonal race up and then it continued on through
[3:42:25.920 --> 3:42:30.400]  the fall and now the economic news is even
[3:42:30.400 --> 3:42:34.400]  more in favor of gold and silver it is dire and even
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:37.440]  even with the recession with people losing their jobs and things they don't
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:40.080]  care they're getting what money they have left they're putting it into the
[3:42:40.080 --> 3:42:43.360]  precious metals well i've been telling people
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:48.720]  and and and this is what a lot of other financial experts have incurred on
[3:42:48.720 --> 3:42:53.040]  i remember six months ago whenever bob Chapman said watch it's going to race
[3:42:53.040 --> 3:42:56.160]  back up they're going to pump the market back up to ten eleven thousand
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:42:59.600]  and then the next time they drop it it's going to go you know below six
[3:42:59.600 --> 3:43:02.240]  and he called two years ago that it would be a
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:07.600]  you know six thousand and change uh... you know in the winter slash
[3:43:07.600 --> 3:43:11.040]  spring of two thousand and nine i don't know how he does it
[3:43:11.040 --> 3:43:15.200]  but he's saying this is your chance uh... whatever folks
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:18.400]  you know uh... don't believe me now believe me later

[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:25.840]  find this is gold sixty dollars price in the market under

[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:54.560]  but every day we see waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive
[3:45:54.560 --> 3:45:58.400]  information the disgruntled employee on the inside
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:02.640]  the lone hacker a thousand miles away organized crime
[3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:06.800]  the industrial spy and increasingly foreign intelligence services
[3:46:06.800 --> 3:46:10.480]  it was an act last you know you know notice how he
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:16.160]  uh demonizes the disgruntled worker aka the whistleblower that blows the whistle
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:21.280]  on anron that blows the whistle on the fbi we can't have whistleblowers
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:25.440]  you know and when he says you know hackers loan hackers a thousand miles away
[3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:29.440]  yeah let's demonize most hackers are people that are just trying to go with
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:34.000]  open uh open share software open share information it's not what you think
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:36.720]  folks if you're if you're a little older you're not with the lingo you're not
[3:46:36.720 --> 3:46:41.440]  with the kids again this is demonizing a broad spectrum of people and ideals
[3:46:41.440 --> 3:46:45.120]  go ahead jaren hit the clip here thieves used stolen credit card information to
[3:46:45.120 --> 3:46:48.800]  steal millions of dollars from 130 atm's
[3:46:48.800 --> 3:46:53.920]  the machines in 49 cities around the world and they did it in just 30 minutes
[3:46:53.920 --> 3:46:58.240]  a single employee of an american company was convicted of stealing intellectual
[3:46:58.240 --> 3:47:02.000]  property reportedly worth 400 million dollars
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:05.440]  it's been estimated that last year alone cyber criminals stole
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:09.920]  intellectual property from businesses worldwide worth up to one trillion
[3:47:09.920 --> 3:47:13.840]  dollars in short america's economic prosperity in
[3:47:13.840 --> 3:47:17.760]  the 21st century will depend on cyber security
[3:47:17.760 --> 3:47:21.680]  and this is also a matter of public safety and national security
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:26.880]  see that it's public safety and national security do you understand
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:31.840]  we rely on them for public transportation and air traffic control
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:35.600]  yet we know that cyber intruders have probed our electrical grid
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:39.760]  and that in other countries cyber attacks have plunged entire cities into
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:44.080]  darkness our technological advantage is a key to america's
[3:47:44.080 --> 3:47:47.040]  military dominance but our defense and military
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:51.760]  networks are under constant attack al qaeda and other terrorist groups have
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:47:54.960]  spoken of their desire to unleash a cyber attack on our country
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:47:59.280]  all right pause that right there al qaeda is going to release a cyber
[3:47:59.280 --> 3:48:06.960]  attack on this country give me a break al qaeda doesn't exist without the u.s
[3:48:06.960 --> 3:48:11.920]  intelligentsia system we created it and but then he throws in other terrorist
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:15.360]  networks remember those domestic extremism lexicon
[3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:19.200]  make people who are anti technology quote-unquote alternative media and
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:23.840]  hacktivists terrorists so again it broadening the spectrum
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:26.800]  oh you're a hacktivist you're al qaeda we're coming to get you this is a
[3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:30.720]  matter of national security we're setting up the
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:34.400]  cyber security agency we're going to try to pass this
[3:48:34.400 --> 3:48:37.360]  cyber security act this cyber bullying act
[3:48:37.360 --> 3:48:40.640]  we're taking away the internet i mean i'm not good it's a 20 minute speech
[3:48:40.640 --> 3:48:43.200]  folks it's a 20 minute speech we can't play it all
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:46.160]  we're almost in the final segment let's take a couple callers we have a lot of
[3:48:46.160 --> 3:48:50.160]  people holding ingrid in nevada you're on the air
[3:48:50.160 --> 3:48:56.480]  yes yes hi chasen i would like to tell you that i grew up in germany
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:49:00.240]  and my mother she was in hitlers youth brigade
[3:49:00.240 --> 3:49:03.360]  and a lot of these things that are unfolding here
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:08.800]  is exactly what she told me and she told me how much she hated it
[3:49:08.800 --> 3:49:14.000]  and she had a spy on her parents spy on her neighbors spy on everybody
[3:49:14.000 --> 3:49:18.080]  and nothing made her more happy than when the american soldiers
[3:49:18.080 --> 3:49:22.160]  marched into germany and rescued her and the german people
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:28.160]  from thailand yeah now unfortunately and ironically we seem to be morphing into
[3:49:28.160 --> 3:49:32.560]  this nazi gestapo type of police state only where
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:35.840]  you know 60 plus years into the future so this
[3:49:35.840 --> 3:49:40.480]  technocracy is really it's a slicker form of propaganda
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:44.080]  it's a slicker form of technology it's a slicker form of control
[3:49:44.080 --> 3:49:47.760]  and we really are being viewed in the world and rightfully so
[3:49:47.760 --> 3:49:51.440]  as the next nazi regime and it's only getting worse here domestically
[3:49:51.440 --> 3:49:54.800]  ingrid i thank you for the call i'm going to try to hit up john tim joseph

[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:42.160]  yeah i agree with uh what you and alex jones are saying about all the
[3:53:42.160 --> 3:53:45.200]  conspiracies and everything but i just noticed you guys are real shy about
[3:53:45.200 --> 3:53:48.000]  talking about the bible when somebody gets on the air and tries to talk about
[3:53:48.000 --> 3:53:50.960]  scripture you are gently give them the brush off
[3:53:50.960 --> 3:53:54.800]  well you know alex is holding on alex uh alex talks a lot more about the bible
[3:53:54.800 --> 3:53:59.200]  than i do and i mean if you look at the clip we just played from a sea world he
[3:53:59.200 --> 3:54:02.160]  talks about revelations and the mark of the b system and
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:05.760]  you know i've had john uh not john connor he used to go by john connor
[3:54:05.760 --> 3:54:10.800]  mark dice on my program in this program dozens of times on top of that
[3:54:10.800 --> 3:54:14.000]  you know we had the america secret beginnings people on we have reverends
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:18.240]  and pastors on all the time i mean my myself i feel like this is a secular
[3:54:18.240 --> 3:54:22.160]  program and i'm really trying to cover the news however if i am covering secret
[3:54:22.160 --> 3:54:26.240]  societies or the illuminati or if we're talking about the vatican that day
[3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:30.720]  i am more apt to take that viewpoint but really this is a news show sir and
[3:54:30.720 --> 3:54:34.320]  you know i i mean for instance we had somebody you know me and alex were doing
[3:54:34.320 --> 3:54:37.680]  a show together i'm not sure if it was minor his but we you know we set a
[3:54:37.680 --> 3:54:41.440]  prayer on the air i mean i'm not opposed to this and i don't oppose christianity
[3:54:41.440 --> 3:54:45.360]  or any religion in general you know it's just that i i try to keep it a news
[3:54:45.360 --> 3:54:48.240]  program and the secular one attack ahead john
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:52.160]  well i we're talking about him in our bible study in austin
[3:54:52.160 --> 3:54:55.440]  and uh... we were wondering though we've never heard his
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:54:59.760]  uh... testimony of salvation when he became a christian or if he's a christian
[3:54:59.760 --> 3:55:03.520]  i know he believes in god but i don't know he's a Christian outright i mean i
