[01:11.360 --> 01:16.040]  the Gaza Strip injuring thousands killing more than 500 people and they're

[02:00.000 --> 02:08.480]  news today economic military social I also had a little run-in with the police
[02:08.480 --> 02:15.120]  last night leaving work at about 1115 you know that's the only reason I may
[02:15.120 --> 02:18.160]  leave this country is because I don't want my children around these type
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.280]  people but everywhere else is run by third world police so God help us I'm
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.720]  gonna tell that story later in the hour Oregon is admittedly about to put
[02:29.720 --> 02:34.560]  transponders and satellite tracker boxes in all cars to tax you by the mile this
[02:34.560 --> 02:38.840]  is also going in nationwide I would tell people about this 10 years ago when
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.080]  I would read about it in industry publications and when Toyota and others
[02:43.080 --> 02:47.280]  would say they were getting ready to follow us and in British and German
[02:47.280 --> 02:52.640]  directives to do this and people would call me a conspiracy theorist it's now
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.560]  all over the Oregon newspapers conditioning the slaves to get ready for
[02:56.560 --> 03:03.320]  it so we'll get into that on the situation with the Gaza Strip McKinney
[03:03.320 --> 03:09.720]  relief boat hit by Israeli ship this is out of the Atlanta Journal Constitution
[03:09.720 --> 03:15.640]  and the former congresswoman's ship was heavily damaged when it was rammed by
[03:15.640 --> 03:24.920]  Israeli ship trying to bring in aid supplies to the invadal Gaza strip see
[03:24.920 --> 03:32.040]  the most ancient form of total war is siege and Gaza has been under economic
[03:32.040 --> 03:37.960]  and military siege for years they are starving to death in many areas Egypt
[03:37.960 --> 03:43.120]  will not let them out so they're they're they're being bad as well of course
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.360]  they're on globalist payroll and so the the Gazans a million and a half of them
[03:48.360 --> 03:52.240]  plus are between a rock and a hard place what is it one million five hundred
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.600]  fifty something thousand in there and so it's shooting fish in a barrel and so
[03:57.600 --> 04:00.800]  they've been saying open the embargo for the last year we're gonna shoot
[04:00.800 --> 04:05.320]  Katoosha rockets at you again we're gonna shoot glorified estus rockets at you
[04:05.320 --> 04:11.200]  and so Israel didn't so they started firing the toothpicks again and so now
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.960]  Israel's dropping 1000 2000 pound bombs on and I mean just decimating what's
[04:15.960 --> 04:22.720]  left of the country leveling whole city blocks and Cynthia McKinney tried to
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.400]  bring some medicine in there and are you kidding I mean if Israel run over
[04:27.400 --> 04:32.320]  American college students with bulldozers and laugh they'll kill her I mean if
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.800]  Israel attacked the U.S. is liberty to blame on Egypt you know don't get up any
[04:36.800 --> 04:40.800]  there sent to Cynthia McKinney they'll they'll kill you and say it bumps your
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.800]  head I mean they'll shoot you on TV and say you you bumps your head like
[04:44.800 --> 04:50.680]  Benazir Buddha because they know they got a thumbs suckin brain dead population
[04:50.680 --> 04:54.320]  that doesn't know what's going on we're gonna come back in all the news ladies
[04:54.320 --> 04:58.320]  and gentlemen and more on what happened to Cynthia McKinney today when we'd
[04:58.320 --> 05:02.920]  return that lady has got a lot of will hello friends this is Alex Jones I've
[05:02.920 --> 05:06.440]  told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's
[05:06.440 --> 05:10.320]  more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key
[05:10.320 --> 05:13.720]  you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.440]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.400]  any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.600]  old boy bailout special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[05:25.600 --> 05:29.120]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.040]  billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.240]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:37.240 --> 05:41.200]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.920]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[05:45.920 --> 05:49.920]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[05:49.920 --> 05:54.280]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[05:54.280 --> 05:58.000]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.600]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.600 --> 06:05.760]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:05.760 --> 06:09.800]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[06:09.800 --> 06:13.480]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[06:13.480 --> 06:17.640]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[06:17.640 --> 06:20.560]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[06:20.560 --> 06:24.160]  supply of storable food the government the new-old order has a lot less control
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.360]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[06:28.360 --> 06:31.520]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[06:31.520 --> 06:35.520]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from
[06:35.520 --> 06:39.640]  E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost

[07:16.400 --> 07:22.120]  your mind welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for
[07:22.120 --> 07:29.480]  joining us today it is the 30th of December 2008 we have three hours and
[07:29.480 --> 07:35.080]  51 minutes spanning out before us wide open funds for the full four hours
[07:35.080 --> 07:40.960]  McKinney's relief boat hit by Israeli ship a boat carrying international peace
[07:40.960 --> 07:45.200]  activists including former Georgia Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and medical
[07:45.200 --> 07:50.640]  supplies to the embattled Gaza Strip sailed back into Lebanese port on Tuesday
[07:50.640 --> 07:55.800]  after being turned back and damaged by an Israeli Navy ship organizers of the
[07:55.800 --> 08:01.880]  trip said the crowds on the docks in Lebanese port city of Tyre were jubilant
[08:01.880 --> 08:06.120]  and cheering as they welcomed the vessel the boat which set off from
[08:06.120 --> 08:10.440]  Cyprus Monday wanted to make a statement and deliver medical supplies to
[08:10.440 --> 08:14.600]  embattled Gaza the trips organizers of the boat was clearly international
[08:14.600 --> 08:19.200]  waters 90 miles off the coast of Gaza at the time of its close encounter with
[08:19.200 --> 08:23.840]  the Israeli Navy our boat was rammed three times twice in the front and one
[08:23.840 --> 08:29.040]  on the side McKinney told CNN Tuesday morning our mission was a peaceful mission
[08:29.040 --> 08:33.200]  our mission was thwarted by the aggressiveness of the Israeli military
[08:33.200 --> 08:39.640]  Eagle Palmer a spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry denied that there had
[08:39.640 --> 08:46.840]  been any shooting although the two ships had made physical contact and it goes
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.760]  on from there Israel singers no intention on any part for the Israeli Navy to
[08:51.760 --> 09:00.400]  ram anybody so basically denying it come on Israel warns Gaza blitz could last
[09:00.400 --> 09:06.480]  weeks the side of the French news agency Israel bombed Gaza for the fourth
[09:06.480 --> 09:11.600]  day on Tuesday started Saturday warning that the blitz that has killed at least
[09:11.600 --> 09:18.680]  360 people that last for weeks as Hamas fired back with deadly rockets landing
[09:18.680 --> 09:24.720]  deep inside the Jewish state as anger I mean listen how that little headline is
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.880]  twisted right there and I'm trying not to get involved in all this and take
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.040]  sides it's all tribal warfare but clearly Israel's the bully and clearly it's
[09:33.040 --> 09:36.320]  for political gain with all the corruption scandals going on Israel it's
[09:36.320 --> 09:41.920]  meant as a diversion and distraction clearly they've had that's the area of
[09:41.920 --> 09:46.640]  Gaza locked down for years people starving no medicine that is an act of
[09:46.640 --> 09:54.360]  war siege is is again a total form of war and so they fire back these homemade
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.720]  rockets and notice they call it deadly rockets they don't call it two thousand
[09:59.720 --> 10:03.640]  pound bombs and hellfire missiles deadly that Israel's raining down blowing up
[10:03.640 --> 10:10.320]  whole city blocks I mean leveling entire blocks as anger over the devastating
[10:10.320 --> 10:17.200]  offensive spiraled in the Muslim world and elsewhere UN chief Bon Kai moon
[10:17.200 --> 10:22.080]  implored world leaders to work urgently to end the unacceptable violence the UN
[10:22.080 --> 10:28.480]  will save us I guess continuing Israeli troops mass along the border Arab
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.680]  anger is rising New York Times reports and they've been mashing Israeli troops
[10:32.680 --> 10:41.280]  since Sunday hundreds of tanks mobile guns artillery field pieces bulldozers
[10:41.280 --> 10:46.400]  Israeli troops and tanks mass along the Gaza border and the government said it
[10:46.400 --> 10:50.640]  had called up reserves for impossible ground operation as the death toll
[10:50.640 --> 10:58.160]  increased to more than 300 after Israeli aircraft pounded Gaza report here out of
[10:58.160 --> 11:03.560]  press TV world protest Israeli massacre in Gaza Israel keeps pounding Gaza on the
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.520]  third day of its aerial campaign as the world continues to protest the deadly
[11:08.520 --> 11:12.960]  blitz that has killed over 310 people and that numbers from yesterday it's
[11:12.960 --> 11:19.720]  more like 400 now some estimates are 500 there's protest in Turkey protest in
[11:19.720 --> 11:29.560]  Europe protest in France protest all over the world but Barack the head of the
[11:29.560 --> 11:37.840]  Israeli military says they're in an all-out war with Hamas and the Jerusalem
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.320]  Post is reporting that the IDF has launched their own YouTube channel IDF
[11:43.320 --> 11:50.080]  launches YouTube Gaza channel in the midst of the Gaza operations the IDF is
[11:50.080 --> 11:54.000]  entering at another conflict zone the internet the Israeli armies announced
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.920]  yesterday the creation of its own YouTube channel now notice that what just
[11:58.920 --> 12:04.480]  happened with this simultaneously suddenly the ADL announces that they are
[12:04.480 --> 12:10.040]  basically on the board of YouTube advising what can be on the site what
[12:10.040 --> 12:17.400]  can't six months ago we have Lieberman he comes out and he says we need to
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.840]  restrict what's going on YouTube if the government says it's offensive or
[12:20.840 --> 12:25.240]  dangerous or pro-terrorist he's to come down and what comes down Marines
[12:25.240 --> 12:31.240]  killing puppies US troops and contractors shooting people innocence
[12:31.240 --> 12:35.560]  that's all taken down I mean it can even be on the nightly news YouTube takes it
[12:35.560 --> 12:42.640]  down Google's taking these videos down and now mainline humanitarian mainline
[12:42.640 --> 12:47.360]  liberal videos that are saying let's have peace let's stop let's stop the
[12:47.360 --> 12:54.880]  killing you know that shows images of crying and bloody children that is being
[12:54.880 --> 12:59.360]  taken down by YouTube I mean I saw hundreds of accounts the last two days
[12:59.360 --> 13:03.120]  that are being taken down but meanwhile you better believe that Israel's
[13:03.120 --> 13:08.760]  military they're gonna put out whatever side they want they're gonna show you
[13:08.760 --> 13:14.200]  know dead Israelis from these rockets and they should show it but you're not
[13:14.200 --> 13:20.880]  gonna be allowed to show the dead Palestinians so when it walks like a
[13:20.880 --> 13:28.400]  duck when it quacks like a duck I mean to to have people like Lieberman and of
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.640]  course Rahman manual just resigned from his house seat yesterday to go work at
[13:32.640 --> 13:38.200]  the White House when you have all these folks who clearly you know serve Israel
[13:38.200 --> 13:47.240]  first it's terrible thing to our nation's sovereignty and it it's terrible
[13:47.240 --> 13:53.040]  because our country is is is is is hated our country is demonized worldwide and
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.680]  and associated with the bullying activities that are going on right now
[13:56.680 --> 14:06.520]  in Israel and then that is all signed on to our name and you know I I understand
[14:06.520 --> 14:10.720]  this is tribal warfare I understand the globalist need this as a distraction as
[14:10.720 --> 14:18.040]  as a diversion that Israel itself is a set piece set up by the Rothschilds by
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.120]  the British as part of the great game kind of a giant aircraft carrier in the
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.800]  Middle East is basically what it is and I understand that upwards of 50% of
[14:28.800 --> 14:32.200]  folks in Israel are also against what's happening but they live in a police
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.840]  state Israel is not really a democracy in the true sense of the word neither is
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.480]  Russia and neither is the United States I mean we have 90% of the American
[14:42.480 --> 14:48.320]  people against open borders but they stay open or 80% against the war but the
[14:48.320 --> 14:54.440]  war continues or 98% against naftan gap but it continues that's not freedom the
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.200]  elite goes and selects and promotes the candidates they want but but look I'm
[14:59.200 --> 15:05.640]  already digressing the point here is that in our name a million and a half
[15:05.640 --> 15:09.160]  Iraqis have been killed in five and a half years and a million and a half
[15:09.160 --> 15:16.840]  before that in the first 13 years of the siege and and rolling bombardments of
[15:16.840 --> 15:24.920]  Iraq's water treatment plants power facilities and Iraq is now being
[15:24.920 --> 15:28.960]  euthanized they're being the whole eugenics program is being run against
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.240]  them they're only allowed by law and you're arrested if you're caught saving
[15:33.240 --> 15:42.320]  your seeds the old heirlooms seeds thousands you know thousand-year-old
[15:42.320 --> 15:47.600]  two thousand-year-old varieties the U.S. Army and Marines this has been on the
[15:47.600 --> 15:59.560]  news they go in and they cut down the date orchards the fig orchards the olive
[15:59.560 --> 16:07.720]  orchards the tangerine orchards they are all cut down huge construction teams
[16:07.720 --> 16:10.920]  engineer teams go in and they cut everything down now now why do they say
[16:10.920 --> 16:15.840]  that all along with Tiger Street Freddy's for 800 miles why do they do it
[16:15.840 --> 16:21.440]  they say terrorists can hide in the vegetation now imagine and especially in
[16:21.440 --> 16:25.320]  the Middle East where things are very arid very dry especially in Iraq where
[16:25.320 --> 16:30.920]  they only have greenery along those rivers the United States went in with
[16:30.920 --> 16:36.120]  contractors and giant engineering bulldozers and destroyed it all and then
[16:36.120 --> 16:40.880]  they came in and said here is seed you have to buy from one company Monsanto
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.160]  and the law says it's the law this is on record this is this is you know
[16:46.160 --> 16:51.920]  Associated Press Google it Iraqi law only GMO crops can be planted which then
[16:51.920 --> 16:55.280]  don't produce seeds that can grow again you got to buy it from them total
[16:55.280 --> 16:59.600]  military domination where they can't even have their own plants again it goes
[16:59.600 --> 17:03.320]  back to the Bob Dylan song someday growing your own garden it's gonna be
[17:03.320 --> 17:10.640]  against the law yeah they're gonna grow their corn on the moon and eat it raw
[17:10.640 --> 17:17.280]  so now a million and a half are dead they have typhus they have cholera they
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.160]  have all the stuff coming back they're forcing inoculations the people are on
[17:21.160 --> 17:28.040]  starvation level if they want to get a stipend of Iraqi money to be able to
[17:28.040 --> 17:32.880]  buy food to live that's overpriced so even though the globalists give them
[17:32.880 --> 17:37.040]  money that money goes right back in the globalist hands they have to take
[17:37.040 --> 17:40.640]  inoculations because you have to get a national ID card that has your thumb
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.240]  print your face scan I mean those people are what we're going to be living under

[31:14.800 --> 31:19.080]  you know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of

[31:36.240 --> 31:40.440]  are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline
[31:40.440 --> 31:44.160]  environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular

[32:41.920 --> 32:47.780]  amazing and dynamic as humanity can be we can be just as bad and a lot of it
[32:47.780 --> 32:56.520]  goes with people losing their moral compass you know you take the black
[32:56.520 --> 33:02.720]  messiah movement it basically claims there was no slavery in Africa until
[33:02.720 --> 33:11.640]  whites invented it which is absolute bold it you really want to get technical
[33:11.640 --> 33:20.280]  it was actually folks out of Africa in Egypt who invented slavery then they
[33:20.280 --> 33:23.160]  try to argue well it's a different type of slavery well you can call it whatever
[33:23.160 --> 33:30.520]  you want the point is humans and slave humans Asians and slave human Asians
[33:30.520 --> 33:34.880]  Germanic groups when all they had around them was your other Germans they would
[33:34.880 --> 33:41.320]  enslave each other the Romans enslaved black white they didn't care now about
[33:41.320 --> 33:48.920]  600 years ago Christianity was used misinterpreted as an excuse to claim for
[33:48.920 --> 33:53.600]  the first time that only certain people were of good houses and others were of
[33:53.600 --> 34:02.600]  bad houses bad families and so blacks they said weren't really human they were
[34:02.600 --> 34:08.360]  of the devil seed you know the seed of cane and that they deserved to be
[34:08.360 --> 34:13.320]  enslaved because of the mark that was put on which is supposedly their black
[34:13.320 --> 34:18.400]  skin and so now black folks some of them it's very popular have picked up kind of
[34:18.400 --> 34:22.800]  the reverse of that and I just don't have time for it I mean I really don't
[34:22.800 --> 34:27.880]  have time for it I'm not going to descend into you know I have anti-Catholic
[34:27.880 --> 34:34.160]  groups getting mad at me because I won't take on their anti-Catholic crusade so
[34:34.160 --> 34:38.200]  they then claim I'm a Catholic agent I'm not Catholic folks my whole family's
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.520]  Protestant both sides going back forever in fact famous Protestants you know on
[34:41.520 --> 34:47.800]  the Mayflower founding Texas I mean the list goes on and on but I don't get into
[34:47.800 --> 34:53.240]  hating on Catholics I do criticize the Pope calling for world government so
[34:53.240 --> 34:57.680]  people get mad at me I criticize Israel and I do it in a measured professional
[34:57.680 --> 35:03.280]  way that actually exposes what's happening instead of just mindless
[35:03.280 --> 35:11.880]  frothing a caricature stereotype racism which only feeds into and gives
[35:11.880 --> 35:16.880]  comfort to what Israel's doing a lot of Zionist documents even show that they
[35:16.880 --> 35:23.600]  love the wild-eyed white supremacist and the rest of it and the same thing goes
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.120]  for all the black supremacists in the rest of it I mean I grew up in Dallas
[35:28.120 --> 35:33.160]  Texas folks in the 70s and 80s so I've been called white devil probably about
[35:33.160 --> 35:39.920]  300 times to my face but am I a primitive bad person you know
[35:39.920 --> 35:45.080]  spiritually psychologically just because growing up in Dallas there were a
[35:45.080 --> 35:53.480]  lot of racist blacks and many times I was attacked by blacks in Dallas and
[35:53.480 --> 35:58.560]  the armor I'm a lot tougher because of it you know I've been put in the hospital
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.240]  by blacks and I've put blacks in the hospital
[36:02.240 --> 36:14.840]  repeatedly I probably put 10 10 12 big black guys in the hospital okay and now
[36:14.840 --> 36:21.360]  do I then hate blacks because because I grew up in Dallas and a couple black
[36:21.360 --> 36:25.840]  guys would say what are you looking at you son of a bitch you want some BAM
[36:25.840 --> 36:31.120]  boy right in the face no because I know that most black people aren't like that
[36:31.120 --> 36:36.240]  and most black people but it was always the same I'm the white devil you know
[36:36.240 --> 36:43.480]  they advertise go to Jamaica every week I see where some stupid liberal white
[36:43.480 --> 36:49.320]  leaves the little reservations at those resorts and climbs over the fence and
[36:49.320 --> 36:55.040]  walks down the beach and they're a little guilty chicken-necked white twit and
[36:55.040 --> 37:04.040]  up walks the Rastafarian and they slit the throat of the white devils the the
[37:04.040 --> 37:12.200]  the the the white she-devil the white male devil because we're animals we've
[37:12.200 --> 37:16.280]  been dehumanized just like Hitler dehumanized Jews and Gypsies and Poles
[37:16.280 --> 37:20.680]  and Communists anybody else he didn't like and then it was okay to kill them
[37:20.680 --> 37:27.080]  well see now Jamaica tries to keep this real quiet but their their their
[37:27.080 --> 37:31.240]  tourism's falling apart because people are finding out you know all these ads
[37:31.240 --> 37:37.880]  for Jamaica oh the happy smiling faces oh the Rastafarians want to hug you they
[37:37.880 --> 37:45.160]  want to love you they want to kiss you no they've been taught that you are the
[37:45.160 --> 37:52.160]  white devil they have been taught that you are an absolute piece of filth who
[37:52.160 --> 37:58.040]  hates them and wants to kill them and there's certainly been British oppression
[37:58.040 --> 38:07.800]  and that colony and enslavement and you know the sugarcane plantations and see
[38:07.800 --> 38:15.640]  I know that and I understand that so just because I had five Mexicans assault
[38:15.640 --> 38:23.040]  me in a parking lot and break my leg I don't hate all Mexicans I have been
[38:23.040 --> 38:29.320]  racially attacked by Mexicans repeatedly growing up in Dallas very rough
[38:29.320 --> 38:35.240]  town I have been repeatedly I mean is this ever happen to you've never been
[38:35.240 --> 38:38.440]  walking down the street and had two big black guys come running down the front
[38:38.440 --> 38:41.560]  porch you know because you're a hundred and seventy pound white guy at the time
[38:41.560 --> 38:44.360]  and said you know hey what are you doing in our neighborhood or what are you
[38:44.360 --> 38:54.080]  doing walking through here oh a little you know a little white devil and and
[38:54.080 --> 38:58.320]  and and now you know you've always got the advantage though when you're
[38:58.320 --> 39:02.800]  racially attacked because they don't expect you to go absolutely ape on them
[39:02.800 --> 39:07.640]  I mean that's when you can really fight is when I it's kind of enjoyable when
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.120]  three or four people pile on to you that's when you can really you mean
[39:11.120 --> 39:14.440]  because I can't get I mean I can't get it on you know what I'm talking about
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.520]  unless I'm really being attacked and then you can just savagely crush people
[39:18.520 --> 39:23.520]  but the point is I have been racially attacked over and over and over again
[39:23.520 --> 39:31.480]  growing up in Dallas Texas but I don't hate black people because of it and I
[39:31.480 --> 39:34.920]  don't hate Mexicans because of it
[39:37.800 --> 39:44.440]  but I'm tired listen you don't have some guilty bug-eyed chicken-necked little
[39:44.440 --> 39:49.080]  white yuppie here who feels guilty and and and cries in his little mitten all
[39:49.080 --> 39:55.680]  day over you I haven't done anything to black people or Mexicans the New World
[39:55.680 --> 40:01.800]  Order has taught whites to feel guilty and give up the country give up the
[40:01.800 --> 40:08.800]  sovereignty and they've made it a racial issue oh you need to support higher
[40:08.800 --> 40:13.080]  taxes or your racist or you need to support Barack Obama and his global
[40:13.080 --> 40:16.880]  carbon tax or you don't like black people
[40:16.880 --> 40:28.000]  it's a bunch of bull I don't have any guilt I am here actually trying to help
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.520]  little white little black little Hispanic children who were taken by CPS and
[40:32.520 --> 40:37.200]  put on drugs or have pesticides tested on them experimental drugs tested on them
[40:37.200 --> 40:43.760]  that kill them because I know that that little black child is not inherently a
[40:43.760 --> 40:48.320]  bad person but that little black child is not inherently evil that they are a
[40:48.320 --> 40:55.800]  blank slate upon which they can be come a good person or a bad person
[40:58.320 --> 41:04.280]  and so I will not be sucked in by all the racism and so you know the anti-
[41:04.280 --> 41:13.480]  Jewish groups can attack me and say I need to be killed all day long I won't
[41:13.480 --> 41:16.520]  expose Israel when they're corrupt I will expose Israel they're doing bad
[41:16.520 --> 41:21.200]  things clearly an engine of the New World Order you can debate all day the
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.760]  power structure the point is it's bad news and I will criticize people like
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.400]  Pat Robertson when he says China needs abortion and I had radio stations turn
[41:29.400 --> 41:32.240]  me off they said we know Pat said that but still you're not gonna talk about
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.400]  about Pat Robertson well I'm sorry I'm not for abortion and if you think I'm
[41:36.400 --> 41:42.320]  gonna ever compromise on that got nothing coming you see it's tribalism they
[41:42.320 --> 41:47.800]  know we love tribalism black white old young it doesn't matter they know we
[41:47.800 --> 41:52.320]  like to think of our group we like to you know work with our own type you know
[41:52.320 --> 41:58.120]  it's built into us and so the New World Order manipulates that and controls that
[41:58.120 --> 42:02.560]  hey what is your blackness or your whiteness doing for you right now that
[42:02.560 --> 42:09.920]  the bankers just stole eight point five trillion dollars and counting of taxpayer
[42:09.920 --> 42:16.600]  money and they're gonna use part of that money back as a stimulus package to
[42:16.600 --> 42:21.880]  further federalize and take control of everything how is that helping you know
[42:21.880 --> 42:25.960]  if you're black or you're white it's not it's we're all in this together ninety
[42:25.960 --> 42:30.680]  nine point nine percent of us against less than six thousand global elitist
[42:30.680 --> 42:33.520]  and that's in their own words Rothkopf the head of the Christian group and
[42:33.520 --> 42:36.080]  others he wrote superclass this year admitting they're setting up world
[42:36.080 --> 42:42.960]  government that's your enemy ladies and gentlemen and the globalist are masters
[42:42.960 --> 42:46.400]  at getting us to fight and argue about well what's the hierarchy of the elite
[42:46.400 --> 42:50.280]  well who's you know instead of mobilizing the public to come together
[42:50.280 --> 42:57.760]  black white Catholic Jewish Protestant whatever against tyranny for liberty for
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.440]  a bill of rights culture instead of that it's just all these groups fighting
[43:02.440 --> 43:06.760]  with each other why do you think the big foundations fund all these groups
[43:06.760 --> 43:14.320]  fighting with each other so let me just give everybody a travel advisory I
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.680]  told you five years ago that the Texas Mexico border was more dangerous than
[43:19.680 --> 43:23.560]  the West Bank that is now admitted by the State Department has been in the
[43:23.560 --> 43:29.880]  major news I'm also telling you that it's even more dangerous if you are white
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.080]  you will be racially targeted the media isn't going to tell you that if you're
[43:34.080 --> 43:41.520]  white and you go to Jamaica you will be racially targeted okay but you're not
[43:41.520 --> 43:48.640]  going to see Hollywood movies about that you know showing the evil racist you
[43:48.640 --> 43:56.160]  know black Israelites as they slit the throat of the white devil can you imagine
[43:56.160 --> 43:59.520]  if there was an island of white people and black people were going there to
[43:59.520 --> 44:03.560]  vacation and being murdered every other day and then the media wouldn't talk
[44:03.560 --> 44:10.560]  about it see how long you last go to Jamaica climb over the fence with your
[44:10.560 --> 44:16.920]  wife bring your kids will you they'll even kill your kids and just sit there
[44:16.920 --> 44:22.760]  begging going I'm a white guilty chicken neck oh oh please don't kill me
[44:22.760 --> 44:28.200]  you're black blacks aren't evil blacks it's impossible for blacks to racially
[44:28.200 --> 44:32.520]  attack somebody oh really blacks are just as tribal as any other group of
[44:32.520 --> 44:37.280]  homo sapiens sapiens you go to Africa it's blacks killing the blacks across the
[44:37.280 --> 44:43.600]  river it's blacks killing animus blacks and Christian blacks and Muslims black
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.000]  Muslims killing each other this is what human beings do and so I'm sick and
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.280]  tired of all of this and so there you go buddy now I said I was gonna take calls
[44:52.280 --> 44:56.640]  today and I don't want to get sidetracked by this we need to get our
[44:56.640 --> 45:02.160]  head screwed on and fight the new world order and educate people you know I
[45:02.160 --> 45:06.120]  don't hear the white supremacist I don't hear the black liberation groups I
[45:06.120 --> 45:09.280]  don't hear them saying hey don't drink sodium fluoride in the water don't eat
[45:09.280 --> 45:13.800]  GMO foods I don't hear your groups out there actually even trying to do
[45:13.800 --> 45:18.080]  anything for your quote race you're a bunch of infantile little boys they
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.320]  like to dress up in military or religious outfits and strut around to your
[45:22.320 --> 45:27.000]  little groups of people acting like your god and that's what the media gives you
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.600]  so much attention because they want that type of infantile behavior to expand
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.920]  and continue all right now I'm going to your calls right now and I'm gonna give
[45:35.920 --> 45:40.240]  each caller one minute because I want to take a lot of calls today and it seems
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.640]  like it's next to near impossible again I got a lot of news so it's open phones
[45:44.640 --> 45:51.360]  finish up Brydon in BC you said you're going into churches what's happening
[45:51.360 --> 45:57.080]  well I figure right like they pay money to heat the place and everything they
[45:57.080 --> 46:00.920]  could set it up so they don't have to you know like fishing for them teach them
[46:00.920 --> 46:04.160]  how to fish so they don't have to pay for power right but what you're going to
[46:04.160 --> 46:07.160]  understand what you're saying see I don't understand maybe it's me I set up
[46:07.160 --> 46:10.480]  free power for all the churches what I'm trying to like do for my own house
[46:10.480 --> 46:17.040]  right now right free power yeah I mean what is it solar power just like yeah
[46:17.040 --> 46:23.160]  anything wind good we get a lot of sun here so exactly people need to get back
[46:23.160 --> 46:26.080]  to the land they need to get independent Brydon good to hear from you
[46:26.080 --> 46:31.000]  great job being independent not being on the grid or or being partially on the
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.360]  grid partially off being self-sufficient that's what the new older
[46:34.360 --> 46:38.440]  doesn't want let's talk to Tim and Georgia Tim you're on the air

[47:13.600 --> 47:17.440]  new world or we don't want to fight each other so yo and I was in Jamaica a
[47:17.440 --> 47:22.280]  couple years ago Jamaica is messed up buddy you got more issues in Jamaica
[47:22.280 --> 47:25.760]  than you can stand to sit back here and waste your time talking to Alex Jones
[47:25.760 --> 47:30.560]  about your God look you so guy if you got six all problems then fix the new
[47:30.560 --> 47:34.760]  world order then we'll stop wasting our time go back to sleep good smoke you
[47:34.760 --> 47:39.280]  some marijuana something you know Alex I want the information I want the
[47:39.280 --> 47:42.320]  information that he brings up today I don't want him to spend a whole segment
[47:42.320 --> 47:46.280]  talking about racial and tribal issues because it's not an issue what the
[47:46.280 --> 47:49.240]  issue is to fight in the new world order well you know what makes me
[47:49.240 --> 47:53.440]  frustrated is I try not to get into all these tribal issues the new world order
[47:53.440 --> 47:56.560]  punches our buttons because we're all the same we're all the other same brain
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.880]  same genetics you know we're all the same same operating system here we're
[48:00.880 --> 48:05.480]  the same creatures and and and they know how to punch our buttons and I'm
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.160]  telling you I got all these groups they want me to talk about Catholics Jews
[48:09.160 --> 48:14.320]  Protestants blacks Mexicans and they just in all these groups get mad because I
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.680]  won't make it racial or religious I'm only trying to fight for liberty and
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.640]  God bless you my friend it's a distraction Alex already a distraction my only I got
[48:23.640 --> 48:29.280]  one question what is your stance on Cuba well you know again it's a very
[48:29.280 --> 48:37.000]  sophisticated Hegelian dialectic that the CIA funded Castro he was their man he
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  was on meet the press they told everybody he was wonderful until the late
[48:41.000 --> 48:51.120]  50s and then he basically stabbed the establishment on the back came in took
[48:51.120 --> 48:57.080]  over Cuba kicked the mafia out and brought in a new form of tyranny and so
[48:57.080 --> 49:03.000]  I I mean obviously I I think the way to reform Cuba is to open Cuba back up I
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.600]  think the way to reform Cuba is to allow free trade into there and allow
[49:07.600 --> 49:13.320]  people to visit but at the same time I don't support Cuba and the hundreds of
[49:13.320 --> 49:17.400]  thousands of people they've secretly arrested and killed and so I'm not in
[49:17.400 --> 49:23.440]  some love fest with Cuba but at the same time I know that the New World Order
[49:23.440 --> 49:26.120]  wanted to stage terror attacks and blaming on Cuba I mean what's your
[49:26.120 --> 49:32.520]  stance on Cuba mean personally I was I kind of like for them because of the
[49:32.520 --> 49:37.600]  health care system and how he did his central bank is not ran by the European
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.120]  Bank is is their own central bank and I was trying to get your stance I can
[49:42.120 --> 49:45.680]  fully get on the stand of it because he has a program over there that he will
[49:45.680 --> 49:51.040]  allow kids to come over there our high school and study in the medical school
[49:51.040 --> 49:55.680]  for free long as they agree to come back and work in poor in the public
[49:55.680 --> 50:02.880]  areas in their own country no I know I mean Cuba has been one of the purest
[50:02.880 --> 50:07.520]  models that we've seen anywhere I'll briefly comment on that when we get back
[50:07.520 --> 50:15.120]  did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.040]  around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection you
[50:19.040 --> 50:22.280]  may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of
[50:22.280 --> 50:26.320]  debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.000]  know it in fact clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.280]  cases don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis now you can fight

[51:14.440 --> 51:19.720]  war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is
[51:19.720 --> 51:24.120]  the enemy bin Laden this is his ammo we have to look to the Middle East we have
[51:24.120 --> 51:28.320]  to look to Osama bin Laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a

[53:07.800 --> 53:16.160]  of the revolution today I mean it's so silly it's so stupid I was thinking
[53:16.160 --> 53:21.920]  during the break the globalist by design are taking the blood out of the
[53:21.920 --> 53:28.240]  economy they're deflating it like a tire like a balloon they're bringing in
[53:28.240 --> 53:31.640]  their tyranny they're getting ready to use the US military against us which is
[53:31.640 --> 53:38.240]  filled with black people brown people white people I mean the New World orders
[53:38.240 --> 53:43.200]  your enemy folks you better figure that out I mean politically what the
[53:43.200 --> 53:48.760]  establishment is doing is so outrageous openly letting foreign banks set up
[53:48.760 --> 53:52.520]  governmental power openly tell the Congress to sit down and shut up the
[53:52.520 --> 53:57.840]  Congress is above the executive and the judicial the Congress is the one that
[53:57.840 --> 54:03.160]  that that that charters the Supreme Court it's the it's the legislatures in the
[54:03.160 --> 54:07.920]  states that create the state courts the cities the counties because the
[54:07.920 --> 54:13.880]  legislature is appointed is elected by the people but instead we've got the
[54:13.880 --> 54:17.680]  legislatures now the creatures of the executive and the judicial it's a
[54:17.680 --> 54:26.800]  tyranny but you know communism it's it's it's again if angels were
[54:26.800 --> 54:32.640]  administering it it would work but human hearts want power human hearts want
[54:32.640 --> 54:37.200]  control even if you're not a person filled with avarice and aggressive you
[54:37.200 --> 54:41.120]  soon figure out you need to have a little bit of power and funds just to be
[54:41.120 --> 54:45.080]  independent and protect yourself and there's always going to be people if
[54:45.080 --> 54:48.960]  you're even free market and successful who are going to be jealous and envious
[54:48.960 --> 54:52.400]  of your success now in the case of Cuba you have to look at the history of it
[54:52.400 --> 54:57.120]  you have to look at what happened there Cuba was never free and so they set the
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.640]  communist model up against what it previously was and call it free market
[55:02.640 --> 55:06.960]  it wasn't free market with Christopher Columbus coming in there and figuring out
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.400]  that tobacco was addictive and then sugar cane was profitable and then it was
[55:11.400 --> 55:17.400]  gold and silver in the Americas they came in they enslaved the natives just
[55:17.400 --> 55:20.480]  like Europeans enslaved their neighbors just like blacks enslaved blacks in
[55:20.480 --> 55:24.720]  Africa it's what humans do they know the public segments they say who the evil
[55:24.720 --> 55:28.400]  Spaniards they enslaved that's what natives did to each other always
[55:28.400 --> 55:34.400]  warring with each other always enslaving their neighbors as well and so they show
[55:34.400 --> 55:39.160]  up and they set up a tyranny and so you have a giant 98% of people poor 2%
[55:39.160 --> 55:47.120]  wealthy the plantation system the colonies the ranches the peons peon
[55:47.120 --> 55:55.280]  just means surf peasant peasant surf slave and it was slavery I mean you
[55:55.280 --> 55:58.720]  weren't early on they were called slaves but later they were just sharecropper
[55:58.720 --> 56:01.760]  slaves they didn't have any money they lived in the land they couldn't go
[56:01.760 --> 56:08.360]  anywhere some would run away from the plantations go to the big cities end up
[56:08.360 --> 56:11.120]  getting thrown on another slave ship taking to somewhere where slavery was
[56:11.120 --> 56:16.200]  still legal and so in comes these rebels and they're gonna you know fix it all
[56:16.200 --> 56:21.280]  and of all the communist systems North Korea Russia China Cuba has been one of
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.720]  the most pure and it's still been dehumanizing has broken down their
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.000]  society and they arrest you if you criticize the government and it's
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.920]  it's it's it's bad and they can advertise all day that you know they've got
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.840]  doctors and that they give people health care and the rest of it one reason
[56:39.840 --> 56:43.880]  Cuba's healthy is because they don't have all the GMOs and the rest of it so
[56:43.880 --> 56:47.600]  there's I mean it's a very sophisticated issue and the problem is
[56:47.600 --> 56:52.520]  callers ask me these really important nuanced very intelligent questions and

[59:37.680 --> 59:43.760]  of forms of command and control tyranny communism socialism fascism when humanity's
[59:43.760 --> 59:51.520]  never had true freedom it's a great responsibility very hard to even approach but we want more

[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:46.960]  taking calls i got a bunch of other news coming up russia finally made the wall street journal
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:50.240]  with some of their top analysts saying the country's going to collapse we're going to be talking
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:55.280]  about that but right now let's go to uh dustin in ohio dustin you're on the air
[1:00:55.280 --> 1:01:04.560]  sir mary christmas outlets are you doing good sir um a couple questions one your jfk movie
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:09.760]  when is that going to be finished up or coming out i'm really looking for okay the obama thing is
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:14.480]  so important that i've suspended the jfk film i've still been doing some shooting in dallas
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:21.760]  other places on it it's going to be coming out in the summer uh the obama film will come out
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:30.720]  uh and it's designed to destroy tyranny it's designed to expose tyranny in the info war
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:35.040]  so we're going to release it on march 15th uh
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:42.480]  so it will be out march 15th and we are racing to make this obama film which is also it's not
[1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:48.080]  just about obama it's it's it's it's a third about the shadow government a third about obama being a
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:56.400]  traitorous uh puppet and a third about the economic collapse in the martial law situation so we are
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:05.280]  racing with this film and i'm and the film is going to be pretty much done by inauguration except
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:10.080]  that i'm holding it for inauguration to see what happens after that to make it absolutely up to
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:19.040]  date and so it will be out in mid-march excellent excellent it's it's amazing to me that he even
[1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:24.160]  you know has won the presidency i personally think i'd like your comment on this but i personally
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:32.400]  think that the establishment is bringing obama and to kind of lay the groundwork for arnold
[1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:40.960]  uh you know electing a uh non-us citizen born you know president i personally think everything
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:46.080]  i've been reading that uh they're kind of uh paving the way for arnold to take the office here one
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:51.920]  of these days yeah well that was actually in the what chicago tribune and on the cbs news
[1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:56.240]  site 60 minutes what two weeks ago that he does want to be president he is lobbying
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:04.160]  to have the 22nd amendment changed and guess what 31 states all he needs 32 31 states
[1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:11.600]  or is it they have 32 they need 34 i've got to look that up um i know this they are
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:18.720]  two states away from having a constitutional convention and they can rewrite everything
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:22.640]  in there and they're claiming they want it for gay marriage in some states and other states they
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:28.560]  manipulate conservatives and say oh it's for a constitutional amendment on the borders but once
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:32.800]  they get the concony and you know they fool liberals to be for it for one reason and conservatives
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:37.920]  to be for it for another but always con cons turn out being bad they can rewrite the whole thing they
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:43.440]  can abolish the bill of rights and there's a big un move to get that done so i agree with you arnold
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:50.000]  is very special to the new world order and very wicked and that's why the three hour film 45 minutes
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.760]  of it exposes arnold and film is marshal law 911 rise the police state good to hear from you
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:01.360]  we're gonna come back and go directly to steve tim joe and many others stay with us
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:14.480]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:19.200]  and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:23.280]  you'll never have to scan in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:28.560]  super dome and beg for femen to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our
[1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:32.880]  elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:37.200]  your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:42.240]  hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american and european
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:47.760]  banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:53.520]  the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nancy germany super
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:58.320]  inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:04.080]  marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:08.560]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:14.000]  shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in america
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:18.800]  we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to
[1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:23.600]  choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:28.160]  prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you
[1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:32.240]  understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot
[1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:37.600]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one

[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:54.960]  next what issue what item what direction a caller will take us in as we spin the wheel of fortune
[1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:59.440]  but wide open phones for the next three hours that we have left in this transmission
[1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:09.520]  what do you think the biggest story of 2008 has been and that can be the biggest hyped media story
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:15.840]  or the biggest under reported story and what do you see happening in 2009 what are your predictions
[1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:20.720]  for 2009 yeah that's the big reason i canceled guests today we had some guests i canceled them
[1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:24.400]  because i've been wanting to have some shows this week where it's just collars in the news
[1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:32.880]  let's go ahead and go to steve in new york steve thanks for holding hey alex it's great here for me
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:40.480]  i listen to you quite often as much as i can uh you're a real rebel i love it uh i got three
[1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:50.640]  quick questions um how are you trying to uh i guess get your message to the deaf i have a deaf
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:58.560]  member in my family and you know i try my best but you know for them to go onto the internet or
[1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:07.040]  anything as they can't listen to your shawl well i mean the deaf uh generally for some reason have
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:15.680]  higher IQs and are really smart together uh competent people i mean at least i'm i guess i've
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:20.560]  worked in and around uh hearing impaired folks that are in the business world so i guess maybe that's
[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:28.240]  a a bad sample but they seem like really neat people to me uh we we have listeners from
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:37.360]  time to time that create transcripts of interviews yeah uh i don't have the funds to hire a transcript
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:42.800]  outfit because you know an hour long interview with with an inexpensive place would cost a few
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:49.760]  hundred dollars uh if somebody wants to give us an endowment i would spend a hundred percent of it
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:56.960]  on a transcript company to transcribe the entire show every day of enough money came in or just
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:02.720]  just the guest uh or if listeners want to volunteer which they have done from time to time
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:10.240]  and we're very thankful for that uh and then and then email us the transcript of the interviews
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:17.440]  we post those uh we have a lot of news articles and a lot of stories we write or or or other
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:23.440]  alternative commentary and analysis that we carry uh and but but we're not a big organization you
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:29.760]  know that's one way government wants to shut down the free internet is make every website uh have
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:35.040]  uh the software installed it automatically transcribes everything and that can be very
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:40.400]  expensive and then you've got to go through the regulators and that will shut us down uh and so
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:45.360]  that's being done by the big boys to try to stifle things they're throwing a whole bunch at uh the
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:51.360]  internet right now to try to shut down the small operators i'm not gonna close captioning in your
[1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:57.440]  movie well i mean here's another issue i barely have the time and the energy and i was here till
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:03.840]  1115 last night i'm not whining it's a passion but i was here till 1115 working on the obama film
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:10.720]  and it's it's myself erin dykes and rob jakemson and rob and erin have some other jobs up here
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:16.320]  videos we upload for the prison planet dot tv members and other things and we bring in a nice
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:23.520]  full name michael mcwartner for some of the graphics and he's part time so uh because i can't
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:32.320]  afford him full time so i i i would love to go out and say have it in spanish or german other
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:38.560]  languages or chinese uh but again it comes down to who we are sir we're a small organization
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:45.920]  uh that produces the amount of work that 200 300 people would do in a major hollywood operation
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:51.840]  uh so uh that's why we're trying that's why i have sponsors it's why i sell the books and videos
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:57.840]  so we can try to have enough money to to up our game uh but but we're trying to up our game even
[1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:06.240]  in the middle of a recession going into depression so i appreciate your call uh we need money and
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:10.800]  and again it's a symbiotic situation when you buy in game blueprint for global enslavement you get
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:15.600]  the preeminent film the best produced the best information the critics have you know basically
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:23.920]  said that unanimously that's my own opinion uh that in game is the rosetta stone for one two
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:29.280]  hour films about two and a half hours long to you know you watch that you know who the elite are
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:38.000]  what their program is what they're doing how they operate and hopefully how to stop them it's 1995
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:44.240]  you can get it for as low as 595 when you get with other dvds and info wars dot com and uh you
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:50.160]  know if you buy the books and videos on the site we'll have the money to continue uh if people don't
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:58.800]  we will stay the same size we are maybe even get smaller i mean we're feeling the economy
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:11.280]  here like everybody else ladies and gentlemen uh so again there are german versions of terror
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:17.840]  storm and in game there are spanish versions we even linked to them and so rather than selling
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:22.800]  a dvd that has all the languages done and which is tens of thousands of dollars have multiple
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:29.200]  languages you know we've we've looked into it done on the dvd then it takes months more to get it out
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:36.320]  and so we don't sell enough to do that and then there's the time constraint of slowing it down
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:40.320]  while it's sent off to the companies that do that you understand
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:47.040]  i mean this is the real world folks it's not just like instant gratification where i'm like a genie
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:53.040]  and i can just make things happen and so what do i do i end up linking on info wars dot com and
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:59.200]  prison planet dot com to the german or the spanish versions on youtube or google which then causes
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:05.600]  people to not buy the dvds which then destroys my business model where i can't fund myself you
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:11.520]  you like that cash 22 so i try to but as i said i appreciate your call take care um
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:20.880]  um again i get calls and emails hundreds of my day we need you to do this we need you to do that
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:28.240]  and i'm not saying don't send me ideas but talking about something and implementing it
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:35.120]  is another thing okay now again i don't want to get off into the show here talking about myself
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.800]  but that's okay that's what the wheel of fortune brought up here taking calls
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:46.400]  um so then i end up linking to the videos that have been i mean i mean if you ever tried looking
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:53.120]  for it in other languages uh there are actually i've seen for the hearing impaired uh people
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.800]  have done versions of my films with english subtitles so it's been done i mean did you
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:09.280]  look i you know i saw last night the hameed ghoul interview on youtube and it was the first clip
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:15.360]  of like seven or something and it had 20 something thousand views on the alex jones channel
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:23.280]  that an independent guy dav runs but he's since given us the codes and now he's volunteering and
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:29.120]  running but now it's officially my channel uh makes sense it's the alex jones channel we appreciate
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:34.640]  all day's work but uh i was just looking at comments on there and i spent about 30 minutes a day
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:39.120]  scanning through comments randomly and the guy was like hey how come alex jones didn't ask hameed
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:45.440]  ghoul about general amud Ahmed my mood of mad who was later head of pakistani intelligence
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:50.320]  reportedly wired made a mom and had a hey man i did ask him it's on the it's on the interview
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:56.480]  but see i can't satisfy you i can't even ask the question and then get credit for asking
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:04.000]  it i have to be punished and nailed to the wall eternally uh because you didn't listen to the
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:10.640]  whole interview but see that's what america does we just go off half cocked uh it's just an instant
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:21.040]  gratification but i mean i did bring that up i did press him on that and the interview may have
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:24.080]  been a little scary for him who knows if he'll come back on we're trying to get him back on right
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:30.320]  now there's also a sacrifice you make in losing a guest if you ask the hard questions but i did
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:34.320]  i knocked the ball out of the park and what do i get i get a drink thrown on my face and told
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:39.760]  that i dropped the ball and then i lost the ball game when i hit a grand slam thanks to my crew
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:48.800]  so again i'm i'm human ladies and gentlemen people now in the patriot movement believe i'm
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:58.480]  omnipresent um if internet sites go down randomly i'm blamed i supposedly have these
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:02.640]  braniacs i can barely keep my websites up but supposedly i'm running everything and shutting
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:08.240]  everything down or uh you know if i say something like judas go to there'll be someone who wrote
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:13.840]  a book called that they'll say are you attacking them is it no it says it's a 2000 year old saying
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:19.760]  everybody you it's like if the hair lips the admiral i don't want to whine about it but see
[1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:25.600]  we're just a nation of children a nation just uh uh uh meanwhile the whole new world order is coming
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:29.920]  down on us ladies and gentlemen and i'm trying to warn people about poison in the food and water
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:35.920]  things we can prove oh it doesn't matter how to go back to your calls uh let's talk to common

[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:43.040]  anybody who denies that a large sector and then you've got different types of raskafarians
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:49.520]  and you've got different types of black israelites and they all fight with each other and you know
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:55.600]  i like bob marley and auga thinks he was saying and doing that's a different variety but then his
[1:22:56.160 --> 1:23:03.600]  son has said that he transcended that all this race business and people who've been
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:09.600]  downtrodden you know they need that tribalism that sense of community to feel good about themselves
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:15.840]  my whole issue is i don't want to spend all day on this i got a guy calling me up week after week
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:24.960]  telling me that whites are all the devil okay and i'm saying that is a variety of the black israelite
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:30.400]  movement and and out of the black israel movement and if you've studied it as you say i've studied
[1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:38.560]  all these groups you get one of the main versions of the of the raskafarians and so i mean are you
[1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:45.520]  saying that that's not part of the tenets of a large group of it or what are you saying there sir
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:53.440]  am i on the air yes you are oh cool thank you yeah um i just want to emphasize i love your
[1:23:53.440 --> 1:24:00.240]  information you show um i just i'm having issues with me i don't know maybe it's the way you deliver
[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:08.400]  an information i know that i i know that um there's different sets of everything and i personally am a
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:14.640]  roster and i don't fight with any of these guys and if anything we're on uh indigenous people's
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:21.040]  land and we need to really kiss off with these people as you know the original people of this
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:28.800]  area to really but i mean come on you know the original people sir sir sir i only suggest
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:34.640]  outside love you bro i'm serious i'm not coming with no animosity or anything i'm just trying to
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:41.360]  you know rectify this because i tell all my people yo listen to this cat don't don't worry
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:47.280]  about his accent don't worry about he's loud i told my girlfriend she's like oh well i can't you
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:53.200]  know really listen i'm like look baby don't worry about his voice he's giving up some serious info
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:58.080]  and so she started checking it she started being like oh okay all right well let me just say this
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:02.480]  let me just stop you let me just stop you for a second i'm not trying to win a popularity contest
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:08.560]  a b i don't like getting into all this tribal infighting because even when i was trying to
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:14.720]  say it didn't matter and it was bad maybe i didn't say it in the in a nuanced way enough and then
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:20.880]  that causes more division so i'm not saying you personally are bad i personally like a lot of
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:26.560]  aspects of the whole roster movement against the new world order against the bankers against the
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:34.480]  vampires there's a lot of truth in it i'm saying large groups uh of the black israelite movement
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:39.120]  say that whites are the wicked devil and that's the same thing we heard about blacks that they
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:43.520]  were the devil and i'm just saying it's bad and i'm against it and i appreciate your call sir and
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:52.240]  god bless you okay and i'm saying i grew up in dallas where blacks and hispanics would attack
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:58.560]  whites and lord knows i'm sure there were cases of whites attacking blacks though i never saw
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:04.400]  that was never around it you know uh whites were these guilt-ridden hand ringing uh you know pathetic
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:09.600]  creatures uh you know when i grew up i didn't i didn't have white friends sitting around going
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:13.680]  inward this inward that and by the way i had a lot of black friends i played basketball with

[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:27.600]  some other black guys came up because they were racist and we got in a fight with them
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:35.440]  because there's racist black people doesn't mean i'm indicting black people i'm saying i don't indict

[1:31:25.360 --> 1:31:34.400]  all right joe in new york absolutely oh i'm already telling my six-year-old son about the
[1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:41.200]  new world order i'm trying to explain to him that in many countries the people in uniform
[1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:50.080]  are bad because those countries are run by tyrants but in some nations the people in uniform are good
[1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:56.480]  but that and then i give him history lessons about the romans and the rest of it my daughter
[1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:02.080]  my oldest daughter is not quite ready for all of that yet because it just confuses her
[1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:07.280]  her but you got to start them really early explaining to him how everything works and
[1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:13.040]  operates and that you can't just trust somebody if somebody's got a green mohawk that doesn't
[1:32:13.040 --> 1:32:18.240]  necessarily mean you don't trust them it doesn't mean you trust them either until you know them
[1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:24.800]  and you don't just trust somebody because they've got gray hair and wearing a suit
[1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:31.200]  or because they're wearing a uniform that that's why you family comes first because you know them
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:35.920]  and they have a stake in protecting you statistically historically doesn't mean you
[1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:40.240]  can completely trust your family either and you've got to teach your family not that i'm some
[1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:46.240]  grand poobah but i've learned this not to be gullible and not to you know i mean if kids are
[1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:50.160]  mean to you at school just don't talk to them anymore and i wish my parents would have told
[1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:54.720]  me that i would keep trying to be nice or you know it took me time to figure it out just fine
[1:32:54.720 --> 1:33:02.160]  you don't like me good you know have fun and do not care what people think about you and that doesn't
[1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:06.240]  mean you come in and drop your drawers in class or have mustard stains on the front of yourself
[1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:10.160]  you know you've got to have respect for yourself it means you keep your cards close to your vest
[1:33:12.880 --> 1:33:16.320]  and you know i mean i've even learned this the last few years i mean i've known this information
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:23.920]  but i haven't really put it into full function somebody cheats me pushes me screws me plays
[1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:26.880]  games with me now man they're out of my life so fast it makes their head spin
[1:33:29.440 --> 1:33:33.760]  because i always judge the world according to myself i mean i'm a pretty nice guy i'm a fair
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:39.520]  person i have a lot of love in my heart i'm also aggressive uh and i thought i had my whole life i
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:47.120]  thought everybody was like me well everybody isn't like nice people a lot of people are scum
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:55.600]  and the number one thing is you've got to teach your children that uh you know if you find one or
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:00.240]  two friends in your life people you can really trust you you're a blessed person
[1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:08.320]  i mean in now societies in such crisis the public is becoming more and more delusional they're like
[1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:13.680]  in trances they've got major studies out that that the adult population is in a lower brainwave
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:20.080]  than just 20 years ago the public is semi awake that they're in a mesmerized green state from over
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:24.800]  four and a half hours of tv viewing a day for an adult more than that for a child i mean they're
[1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:29.520]  literally zombies and and they're delusional it's like the government the media is people will make
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:34.000]  up little stories little excuses for what they're going to do to you when they screw you when they
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.160]  cheat you when they you know do things to you that's the general public then you've got the evil
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:44.080]  sociopaths and psychopaths that know what they're doing and they're just they're angling you know
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:48.400]  looking at you like they're on a rabbit hunt or something and the minute i see somebody looking
[1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:52.160]  at me like that like they're on a rabbit hunt i just say you know what i'm not giving you the
[1:34:52.160 --> 1:34:59.840]  benefit of the doubt get out of my life stay away from me right now because as society falls apart
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:08.960]  as things implode we've got to protect ourselves all right going back to uh joe joe i'm babbling
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:14.000]  at you does that answer your question or is that your question no that was great uh you see i have
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.320]  my daughter telling me how happy she was that uh obama won the election and i'm like why are you
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:22.960]  happy that she won't that he won the election and she just shrugged her shoulders and it's
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:29.200]  indoctrination by the mass media and i can't wait for the obama video that that you have
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:35.840]  planned oh we're making it right now and again when you tell somebody i mean i've had waiters
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:40.960]  and people come up to me at restaurants and it's almost every time i'm out to eat once or twice a
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:46.480]  week and they say hey what do you think of obama alex and i go well you know my show i i believe
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:55.680]  they're all puppets puppets yeah and they say but but you're you like mccain and i go no uh i don't
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:36:02.240]  like uh mccain i'm explaining to you that it'd be like if you showed up a car dealership and the
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:06.880]  guy showed you two cars he had like 500 more but he said these are the two these are the only two
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:12.000]  i'm selling and one of them is blue and one of them is red and they got the same engine in them
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.640]  they were made by the same company the same year and it didn't really a choice do i want to do i
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:22.480]  want a red one or a blue one i'm like no wait a minute i want to look at the other 498 cars or
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:29.120]  i want to go look at another dealership and see that's my point the same people brought us obama
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:35.120]  that brought us john mccain it's so elementary but the public has been not not even dumbed down
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:44.480]  they've been mesmerized or hypnotized or bamboozled uh into into buying into it and i mean and you
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:50.880]  can't blame them i mean people are all about the surface they're all about uh you know political
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:55.280]  colorations and and you know that's a propaganda term nothing to do with him being dark skin
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:59.840]  but it does play into the political coloration with the dark skin because it's it's something
[1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:09.600]  tangible look it he's he's brown and um then it turns into another tribal issue of whites wanting
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:15.040]  to prove they're not racist so it was white people predominantly that elected obama and then now
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:23.040]  i notice on my own info wars dot com and prison planet dot com on my own sites if i have an article
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:28.720]  criticizing obama you know he's for the gaza bombing people go in there and say you're just a racist
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:33.120]  you just don't like obama or or if i'm against obama and gun control they say oh you're just a
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:38.880]  racist you don't like obama or if i'm against obama and a carbon tax on every action and every
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:44.000]  activity humans carry out paid to foreign private banks you know it's like oh you just don't like
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:51.120]  obama you're you know you're you're just a racist no i don't want to pay a carbon tax to private
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:57.440]  banks no i don't want to bomb uh the gaza strip no i don't want that done in my name see but but
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:02.320]  people like it's simple they want to just it's simple george bush is good he's fighting the
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:09.280]  terrorist you know barack obama's good he's gonna get america back on track and um so a lot of it's
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:15.040]  how you approach your daughter a lot of it is how you you know come at it and and and say look i would
[1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:20.640]  love to believe that obama was a good guy we're about to have change but if it was real change
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:25.520]  instead of more tyranny that is the change uh then they would assassinate him or they would
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:31.600]  they would bring out the uh buying the senate seat he's clearly involved in that uh with his chief
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:39.760]  of staff rome manual but because he's playing ball you're not going to hear about that anything else
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:46.000]  sir no that what are your predictions for 2009 well i appreciate your call joe let me answer
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.320]  those and i'm glad somebody finally brought up the points i've been asking listeners so i'll
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:39:03.840]  i guess i'll start it off i think you're going to see intensified uh friction and i'd say 80
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:09.120]  percent chance some cross border incursions in the cashmere region between india and pakistan
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:16.640]  and it could turn into full-born war between the two nations i'd say that's a 30 40 chance
[1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:21.040]  i believe you're going to see more escalations between the united states nato and russia with
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:27.280]  more u.s forces when you say u.s globalist forces angle americans forces moving into
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:33.040]  encircle russia you're going to see more tyranny more crackdowns on free speech in russia you're
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:37.120]  going to see new restrictions and control over the internet i think you're going to see major
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:44.960]  internet outages in 2009 which then the government will offer a solution of internet to uh you know
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:51.200]  it was the way to fix the problem they created i believe that we will see hyperinflation
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:59.040]  accelerate uh so we'll have a dead economy i mean literally it's dead
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:08.960]  dead main street with an overlay of hyperinflation in certain sectors as the big private central
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:16.880]  banks buy up raw infrastructure and so i think you're going to see sit-ins that are going to
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:24.960]  end up getting violent with police in major factory cities and i believe by the end of 2009
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:32.320]  you may see full-scale riots in u.s cities i'd say a 70 chance of that and it's virtually if
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:46.320]  things continue along the globalist plan 100 by 2011 um barack obama will bring forward a carbon
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:56.080]  tax he will declare carbon dioxide a toxic waste he will have a 700 billion dollar bailout package
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:02.960]  for the public but that will only be select payoffs to crony cities counties and states to pay for
[1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:11.520]  federal unfunded mandates which will further federalize things i believe you will see israel
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:18.640]  off and on continue to bombard and squeeze uh the gaza strip which they've had under siege for
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:24.240]  years i believe you will probably see more bombardments uh into southern lebanon again
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:34.640]  against his below i believe i mean it's easy predictions we've seen a 500 increase in piracy
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:44.400]  i believe we'll see another 500 increase in piracy in 2009 worldwide i predict that by the
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:47.920]  end of next year they always do it about a year and a half late you will see crime statistics
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:55.920]  for 2008 showing a 25 percent on average or higher increase in violent crime and robberies
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:42:01.520]  and then by 2010 we're going to get 2009 numbers there will be a 100 percent increase in crime
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:11.840]  you will see increasing draconian actions with us army and marines running warrantless checkpoints
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:19.840]  on us highways as they're going on in california right now in san bernadino in other areas uh
[1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:24.720]  you will see a flaunting of the police state you will see the propaganda intensify worshiping the
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:34.400]  police state on the news it's not going to be pretty i can make a lot of other predictions
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:40.400]  but i'd like to hear your predictions i want to get into the cop story from last night before
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:45.040]  the sourance but let's continue with your calls right now uh let's go ahead and talk to tim and
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:52.720]  pa go ahead tim hi alex um i'd like to uh bring up um something that i feel is going to be one of
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:43:01.680]  the most important opportunities that we will have in 2009 to fight the evil empire i'm originally
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:09.040]  from main and i have a brother that's been missing since way back in 1992 uh from bangor main and in
[1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:13.440]  the years that we've been struggling he was indicted by the federal government two months
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:18.800]  after he disappeared and in the years that we've tried to get to the bottom of this of course we've
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:25.120]  on you know we lifted up the veneer of society and and and it wasn't the uh you know the corruption
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:31.520]  that he stepped into uh you know as far as the indian lambs claim money or the bank corruption
[1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:40.960]  up in the northeast but it was ultimately the uh the uh tied to uh the franklin cover-up and and
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:47.040]  we didn't know at the time but but how you sent me your brother's story before years ago well no
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:52.160]  actually i call it's probably about 10 years ago i called into your show and that we really i was
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:57.440]  like the last caller and we really didn't have a long time to talk but um but we we found out
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:04.080]  literally like in 2000 that uh he he was scheduled to meet with the main state attorney general the
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:10.160]  day he disappeared with some very incriminating information and we didn't know until literally
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:16.080]  eight years later that there was in washington at that very time there was going to be a congressional
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:20.240]  you know trying to get congressional hearings going on the whole subject do you think they murdered
[1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:28.160]  your brother well there's no question in 2002 a gentleman called my mom and said uh i know who
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:34.000]  killed your son and so as we developed the information that he gave us it took us actually
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:39.040]  several years to get to the bottom of it but actually so right now my brother's a fugitive
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:43.040]  from justice wanted for bank fraud and money laundering by the federal government and at
[1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:48.400]  the very same time there's an active murder investigation by the main state police because
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:55.840]  of information that we brought them like in 2003 and 2004 that they couldn't deny all right well
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:45:01.760]  send me send me a packet of info maybe i'll have you as a guest i appreciate uh your call um
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:06.880]  i wanted to ask him what the opportunity is in the new year but it's a long story
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:12.160]  um send me a packet of info on it sir if you want to be a guest and perhaps i'll
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:18.960]  have you on if i'm able to get that scheduled um what i do know is dinecore and haliburton
[1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:26.960]  run giant white slavery rings worldwide for sex slavery physical uh you know manual labor
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:33.520]  slavery and that's come out in major newspapers like the chicago tribune and they can get away
[1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:40.800]  with that in bosnia in syria in croatia they get away with that in russia they get away with that
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:47.920]  in the middle east they can do it here and there is a giant industrial pedophile operation in the
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:52.640]  country that's how pedophiles work they recruit their own people into positions of power once they
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:56.880]  get into position and that's why every couple weeks here about a homeland security state head
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:46:01.280]  caught little kids or you'll hear about the state police deputy head caught little kids or you'll
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:07.520]  hear about you know a prison where they're videotaping raping the women or raping the you know the uh
[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:15.760]  uh 12 year old boys here in texas or you'll read about all this and that's because it's just ongoing
[1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:21.200]  and then they recruit their own people into washington and there's been a big pedophile
[1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:26.800]  ring in washington for at least 80 years but now it's a large portion and a lot of that it shows
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:34.320]  that that around half of your congressmen are pedophiles um because that's like entrance into
[1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:40.480]  the club and so that's why you're always hearing about the head of missing and exploited children
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:45.040]  being caught being a pedophile or you know just all these groups it's just it's just i mean you
[1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:50.800]  all see it in the news and they kind of sweep it under the rug real fast uh they're horrible people
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:55.280]  i mean what kind of people would steal trillions of dollars and put cancer viruses and vaccines and
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:47:02.320]  but but you've got the eugenicist above the pedophiles and and then they use a pedophile guild
[1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:05.840]  you know they get to carry out their pedophilia as long as they serve the new world order
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:10.640]  and it's it's just a it was actually the same in rome if you study rome
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:17.280]  they had pedophile guilds by the end there that ran it and uh babel on ended up being run by
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:26.560]  pedophile guilds uh they love destroying innocence they love i mean why does satan sacrifice babies
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:32.960]  because it's the power it's it's it's about their personal power it's about you know they believe
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.800]  they're doing this horrible act and that they're becoming you know just energized and more human
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:41.040]  than human because they're willing to commit something so heinous that that's part of their
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:48.240]  strength again it's like in revenge of the sith for all the uh film nerds out there like he's a
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:53.920]  popular culture meme you know the emperor says go to the jedi temple and kill all the younglings
[1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:59.840]  then you will have more enough power and that's what stalin and lennon believed that's what the
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:06.560]  abstracts believed that's what they do and so it's come out even in major missouri papers about
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:10.720]  different abortionists they even admit their satanist now that's a sacrifice and how much
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:15.440]  they love jamming the scissors in the back of the partial birth abortion babies head and when
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:20.000]  it begs and pleads and grabs at the scissors and flails you've seen a baby like when it's
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.040]  it's newborn and you move it and it acts like it's about to fall over it it doesn't have balance
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:29.360]  it kind of puts its hands up to protect itself they love that see you don't like hearing about a
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:35.200]  baby having scissors jam in the back of its head and then a suction sucker sucking its brains out
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:41.840]  but to a satanist it's beautiful to them it it's about snuffing out that new beautiful life that
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:46.640]  little shoot of green coming up out of the ground it's about dominating and winning over goodness
[1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:52.080]  and evil prevailing and they just burn with what they describe as like a white light when they're
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:49:02.640]  doing it to them trash cans full of dead babies is beautiful hitler just loved watching burning
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:07.680]  cities and piles of dead bodies it was it was beautiful to him see it's beautiful they're
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:14.080]  creating a world that's beautiful to them it's beautiful to us it's it's hell to them it's

[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:10.080]  it just lets you know that you're going into a third world country i pulled out of my office
[1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:21.200]  went down the side street 1115 last night i looked down the frontage road of 290 and i see a police
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:30.960]  car racing along doing about 75 miles an hour and it's a three-lane frontage and as soon as he pulls
[1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:37.120]  past me i pull out into the slow lane and then i start getting over to go on the highway in the
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:45.440]  in the center lane and from way behind me had to be going about 80 a apd racing but i didn't know
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:49.440]  it was an apd yet he didn't have his lights on he didn't have his cherries his flashers on
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:57.920]  and he races right up on my hind end i mean i mean right up on my hind end and and i don't get
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:04.160]  into road rage stuff folks most of the time 99% of the time i don't ever you know end up responding
[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:08.000]  i've had somebody pull a truck in front of me earlier this year and jump out and i went
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:13.600]  ahead and got out and said look man just don't touch me uh but um i said let me go
[1:54:15.600 --> 1:54:21.600]  but um yeah i try to stay out of it and this car races right up on me and by then i'd already
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:25.200]  accelerated up to about 55 you know to get over and get on the highway and there was a whole other
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:31.360]  lane right beside me you know he could have gone around and i and i go i think that's a cop
[1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:37.840]  and he just almost hit me he flew out around me and i said oh my god and he pulls right up beside
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:47.120]  me and i go wow and shines his spotlight in on my face and uh he's right up right up beside me
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:51.840]  and i mean almost hitting the car and then he goes flying off down the highway and i almost
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:56.240]  followed him but then he had probably gunned me down or something and said i was al-qaeda
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:02.160]  and i guarantee you he was a steroid head back from iraq he's probably been greecing iraqies all
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:07.120]  day you know and thinks it's fun as these guys that and and and there was another you know cop car
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:11.520]  ahead of him but get it already sped on over the highway and then it exited off on congress
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:20.080]  the other guy exited before that before 35 and i almost called 911 but i said what call the man
[1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:25.120]  call the establishment and tattle that cop's been hired to act like a thug he's been hired
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:30.400]  to squeeze the slaves and let us know that he's the boss and you know as much as i want to hold
[1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:35.840]  up good police uh you know the point is this guy violently pulled up behind me and and then that
[1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:42.880]  wasn't enough because i didn't pull out in front of me no he was way down the road you know tiny
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:50.640]  headlights when i pulled out but i didn't realize he was going 75 80 miles an hour but instead of
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:59.120]  just shooting around me he didn't like it that a slave was out in the road that a slave you know
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:04.880]  was going home and so it wasn't enough to come right i mean right up folks i was like my i mean
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:09.520]  this thing was i mean his windshield i looked out my windshield i mean his windshield was right
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:13.920]  there and i could tell it was a cop car then i was like my god this cop is right on my tail
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:18.160]  i mean 80 miles an hour womb right up behind me they probably would have tasered me if he'd hit
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:24.400]  me probably you son of a bitch you you caused a cop to wreck game out beating by a certain slam on
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:29.440]  my head on the ground blood splattering everywhere i mean that's how they act i see reports all
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:35.040]  the time where cops beat people up they run into so i mean i ran into a dangerous person last night
[1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:42.480]  and thank god i made it home to my family uh but uh the issue is
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.200]  he needs to get in trouble for that or she whoever this nutcase was
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.240]  because it wasn't enough then to endanger everybody on the road they had to then shine
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:59.760]  light in my face to let me know hey we're the boss slave just keep the paycheck coming thank you for

[1:59:51.360 --> 1:59:59.520]  you they'll kill you and set you up nine times out of ten because i was going to go and say officer
[1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:03.840]  what's what's your problem you almost rear ended me and then you pull up beside me that's reckless
[2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:10.880]  driving but i i didn't want to race up this guy was going 80 and i was going like 55 i didn't
[2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:19.680]  want to race up and get the car number you know i miss that um i mean i guarantee you folks if i
[2:00:19.680 --> 2:00:25.200]  ran up on a cop like that 80 miles an hour right up on their hind end that cop would flip out slam
[2:00:25.200 --> 2:00:30.880]  on the brakes pull you over taser you because you're running around with a deadly weapon menacing people
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:38.240]  with it but no no no i as a slave scum citizen that's only here to have the bank steal everything
[2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:44.400]  from me the offshore banks i not only get to have him almost rear end me you know right up on my
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:48.960]  hind end i mean this went on for like you know 15 seconds with him right up just going in and out
[2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:54.160]  right up behind me then i get to have the cop pull around and shine a light in my face and then
[2:00:54.160 --> 2:01:00.160]  act like he's going to hit my car a cop going crazy you got a cop with a gun going crazy on
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:07.120]  the highway with you for no reason when there were lanes he could have gone around you on
[2:01:14.080 --> 2:01:19.120]  and the issue is i guarantee you it's a gang member psychology i guarantee you
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:22.480]  have other cops saw they'd probably laugh about it how'd you see that guy it's like it's like
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:27.600]  the videos of them rubber bulleting a city you know person in a in a red dress in the face in
[2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:32.480]  miami the woman's done nothing wrong she's standing here with a sign protesting so they rubber bullet
[2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:36.480]  her in the face she's bleeding and then it cuts back to the cops in front of the news cameras going
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:42.240]  to see how funny it was when we shot her in the face no it's not funny all the people you've killed
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:47.360]  with rubber bullets and you'll never take responsibility for what you've done every day i see
[2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:52.320]  an article where somebody's tasered and dies and then the police say oh it's a new syndrome
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:56.320]  where people just happen to die at the same time that we taser them it has nothing to do with a
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:06.080]  taser and again i have no desire to get up here and bash police hey let me tell you your old
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:11.360]  future is being ruined too bud and you know what i guess with wisdom not that i'm wise but i'm
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:16.560]  a little more wisdom than i used to comes understanding so i was mad for about 15 minutes
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:23.280]  about driving home 10 minutes driving home and then i just realized i just said you know what
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:29.200]  we've all done things that are wrong i just hope that guy whoever he is matures before he kills
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:34.960]  himself or kills somebody else but then i thought of something else they don't give us the benefit
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:40.480]  of the doubt that's what zero tolerance is all about you know a 10 year old girl has halls
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:50.480]  over the counter is sold in the candy section cough drops doesn't matter they go ahead and you
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:03:00.320]  know send her to principal's office kick her out of school zero tolerance see it's zero tolerance for
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:09.440]  us but not for them and that's the classical uh mark of tyranny but i want to ask the cops
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:14.160]  something do you want your kids growing up in a society where there are people out on the streets
[2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:21.360]  like you hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:25.760]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and
[2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:30.080]  water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:34.800]  never have to go to the super dome and beg for femen to take care of your family in any emergency
[2:03:34.800 --> 2:03:39.280]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail out for a special
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:43.680]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[2:03:43.680 --> 2:03:49.280]  they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:54.400]  and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:59.680]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach in
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:04.960]  pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:10.720]  over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:15.520]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:20.480]  to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business whatever
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:25.520]  happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:30.320]  of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:35.120]  it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:38.960]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storeable food the government the new
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:43.920]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:48.080]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:53.120]  you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from ecoli salmonella

[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:46.880]  alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:05:46.880 --> 2:05:53.840]  no but i'll tell you what happened last night driving home
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:07.360]  i realized that was probably some young former military person brain completely fried from
[2:06:07.360 --> 2:06:11.120]  ptsd he's gonna have a ruined life gonna have a horrible marriage horrible children
[2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:16.320]  and not gonna have any financial future and i and i didn't even take pleasure in that
[2:06:17.200 --> 2:06:20.720]  you know sickos that work for the government and do bad things in the past i've kind of
[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:25.600]  chortled and said oh yeah you think you're the pet puppy you think you're gonna be protected
[2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:30.160]  you think evil's cute you'll get yours you know now it's not even that i just feel sorry for the
[2:06:30.160 --> 2:06:37.200]  person i've and it's embarrassing i mean it's embarrassing to flaunt authority and flaunt
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:44.560]  power and abuse it i mean i would be embarrassed as a citizen to aggressively run up on somebody's
[2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:48.800]  tail just to mess with them and we know there's idiots out there that do that you can even be in
[2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:53.600]  the slow lane go on the speed limit they do it they got attitude problems they they feel cocooned
[2:06:53.600 --> 2:06:58.960]  psychologically in their cars and there's been a lot of studies done on this so they do these
[2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:02.480]  wild things they wouldn't do in person they've also found out with email people send really
[2:07:02.480 --> 2:07:07.040]  aggressive things an email and then confronted person about it they apologize and can't believe
[2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:11.840]  they did it because they're disconnected from reality so this guy you know menaces me with
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:19.600]  a deadly weapon a 3000 pound car flies around almost hits me shines a light in my eyes and i
[2:07:19.600 --> 2:07:26.320]  know i pulled out with blinkers on you know way ahead he just like it was the nd 500 and i wasn't
[2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:33.760]  supposed to be going down the highway and it was about his little personal exercise of power i mean
[2:07:33.760 --> 2:07:39.120]  i would be embarrassed to run up on somebody and then fly around them then shine a light in their
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:44.800]  face to just let them know i'm the boss it was blinding too i'm like ah it's nighttime and
[2:07:44.800 --> 2:07:54.960]  there's this light shining in my face and i see that car she cops driving like maniacs through
[2:07:54.960 --> 2:07:59.200]  neighborhoods like maniacs down the road they're not going anywhere they don't have their lights on
[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:08.160]  then you'll see other cops that drive the exact speed limit when i was on i-35 and the guy was
[2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:16.000]  driving exactly 60 in some city and i had my cruise control set about at 61 i started driving
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:22.080]  past him he pulled up said slow down you will go 60 so you've got the other uh uh you're the
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:30.160]  opposite of that the point is that uh i you know i don't enjoy being menaced by a car
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:37.120]  i want to get home to my family and i and maybe that cop hadn't been in a bad car wreck yet but
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:42.080]  i would imagine he's seen a few bad ones i mean i respect cars i know how deadly dangerous they are
[2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:45.680]  i've almost been killed in a few car wrecks and i you know i just
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:53.520]  just but i guarantee if you walked up to that guy in a restaurant and confronted him about it he
[2:08:53.520 --> 2:08:58.800]  would he would he would apologize or make a joke about it probably but see it's that unconsciousness
[2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:05.600]  in the uniform on the power trip and as americans we kind of put on this neural order uniform
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:10.880]  ourselves you know we feel like hey i got pride we're bombing them Arabs over there americas
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:20.800]  hitting the terrorist i mean i remember in 1991 i hadn't read none dare call a conspiracy yet
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:29.920]  i was just about to read it i was 16 and i remember being over at friends houses
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:35.920]  eating pizza in front of the tv going wow look at those missiles shoot to that window yeah usa
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:41.840]  and i remember a few days later driving with all the american flags on cars i remember going you
[2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:48.560]  know it's kind of sick you know something in my psyche told me you know this big powerful nation
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:53.200]  attacking this other country and i just didn't feel right then later i learned that saddam was
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:10:01.280]  set up and told to invade kawaii and the rest of it but i guess it's just that the that the american
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:08.080]  people don't don't grow up and then i was thinking about things i've done bad in my life you know when
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:13.280]  i was younger and i was realizing that all of us flux back and forth between good and evil
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:17.520]  unless you're totally turned over to evil and then you just revel in it and get deeper and deeper
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:23.120]  into it the psychopath the sociopath the psychopathic sadist the worst type out there
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:28.720]  and i i was thinking about uh
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:33.200]  you know mistakes in life that i've made
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:38.880]  and then i just thought about
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:45.600]  okay in my name three million iraqis are dead million and a half the last five years
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:53.600]  in my name i live in the country with all of the worldliness and the corruption and all of it
[2:10:55.840 --> 2:10:58.480]  that has killed more than 50 million babies
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:04.560]  and so i just always now kind of think to myself what do you expect of course you're
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:08.640]  going to have cops tasering people to death all over the place of course you're going to have
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:14.720]  cops driving like psychopaths and and and and coming right up on your hind end of course you're
[2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:18.080]  going to have a corrupt government of course you're going to have a government that stages
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:23.120]  terror attacks of course you're going to have all this evil go on because we had an evil new
[2:11:23.120 --> 2:11:29.600]  world order a hundred years ago and trying to take over the united states at the time but but
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:36.080]  we didn't have a people who could be twisted by the media to believe that killing babies is
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:46.640]  some wonderful fun little right that we have and that some feminist empowerment i mean really what
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:52.880]  do we expect and just like the police now say well it's a syndrome in england and germany and
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:58.640]  canada the u.s where people are tasered you know these young people 10 12 15 you know 20 years old
[2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:04.400]  25 they're not on drugs in many of the cases they the cops always say well he was on drugs
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:08.800]  that's why he died then they test the blood there's no cocaine no heroin they die and they say well
[2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:13.920]  it's a new syndrome uh they got so scared by the officers they had a heart attack and died
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:23.920]  with no medical evidence it's just made up but see that's more mental sophistry more excuses
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:34.160]  more lying to ourselves uh just like they say oh a baby's just a blob of tissue it's it's not a person
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:38.160]  and then see once you accept abortion especially partial birth abortion
[2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:44.640]  then you accept euthanasia of the old and they advertise like it's a right but the state is
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:50.480]  killing people that don't want to be killed and then oh why not have part human part cow
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:56.320]  part human part pig so we can grow these babies inside the uteruses of animals and then harvest
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:13:03.200]  them and get larger you know usable organs yes that's going on it's been going on for a decade
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:11.280]  that i know of i remember in 1997 seeing in the bbc 11 years
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:17.440]  and see people didn't want to face up to that then
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:22.720]  and then they email me or call me and say you're a liar there's not human cow hybrids
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:26.640]  or you're a liar there's not spider goats or you're a liar well now that it's all admitted
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:33.440]  and been on the news enough people to say oh big deal so what well if an iraqi doesn't have value
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:38.720]  and of a seven month old baby in a womb doesn't have value you're not going to have value when
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:44.000]  you're old they're going to get rid of your butt you're not going to have value now see when you
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:49.680]  don't care about anybody but yourself society falls apart around you and the globalists knew
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:55.040]  that they wanted us to only care about ourselves so it could be isolated and cornered so that we
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:14:01.360]  could be controlled and dominated and so when a police officer dominates a fellow citizen abuses
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:06.800]  their power they disgrace their uniform they disgrace their family name and they hurt their
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:13.680]  own country and the atmosphere that their children are going to grow up in and no amount of making
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:20.160]  jokes or laughing or saying i get over it ah whatever make a big deal out of it no amount of
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:25.200]  that we're none of us are perfect whatever none amount no amount of those making excuses is going
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:35.440]  to make it okay and so we all curse each other we all hurt each other go ahead and play that
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:41.360]  spider goat clip you know i uh got an email the other day saying i'm a liar there's no spider
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:51.120]  goats and so i just googled spider goats and this is what came up mainstream tv program here it is
[2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:59.760]  these are very special goats within their genetic makeup is uh one spider silk gene
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:07.840]  in a spider the gene is responsible for the making of so-called dragline silk the strongest natural
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:15.040]  fiber known to science dragline is the silk favored for the radii of the web and to suspend from
[2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:23.520]  it's a spider's lifeline how do you get the gene into the goat you start with the embryo
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:28.800]  all right let's stop there that's enough yeah so they go in and put this into the embryo now
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:33.840]  they tell you they change one gene well you know we've had the head of the one company
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:41.120]  the u.s. armies funding an upstate new york on a few years ago when they randomly change that one
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:45.520]  gene it then randomly each successive generation about whether they're breeding these goats
[2:15:46.480 --> 2:15:51.200]  creates random genetic mutations from the original spider gene
[2:15:55.920 --> 2:16:00.320]  now i've got another clip about superhumans and and believe me this is already going on
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:04.800]  we're gonna play that when we come back then i'm gonna go more of your calls but
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:10.160]  i mean why do people think i'm lying that there's hundreds of government documents
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:14.080]  that they're setting up a world government people i think i'm lying about spider goats
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:18.640]  why do i think i'm lying i'm not lying about any of this but see it's the denial it's all

[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:42.640]  m.o. we have to look to the middle east we have to look to the sum of bin laden fabled enemies is

[2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:52.960]  the united states some u.s. investigators believe that there are israelis again very much engaged
[2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:59.600]  in spying in and on the u.s. i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained and
[2:19:59.600 --> 2:20:04.720]  laden's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi arabian connection

[2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:37.200]  jason scott andrew jeremy pat we're going to you here momentarily here's another mainstream media
[2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:47.920]  clip you're all dealing with personal the elites wanting to create quote superhumans
[2:21:49.680 --> 2:21:56.720]  more than that they want to breed the general public to not be aggressive to not be independent
[2:21:58.560 --> 2:22:03.200]  and that's what brave new world talks about which was based on the plan of the british
[2:22:03.200 --> 2:22:08.880]  eugenicist and huxley's on record saying that his brother ran the united nations eugenics operation
[2:22:09.920 --> 2:22:15.360]  he was the head of unesco so this is the plan they are carrying out against us
[2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:20.480]  all right uh let's go ahead and play that clip dealing with the superhumans
[2:22:23.920 --> 2:22:30.480]  with the recent sequencing of the human genome the genetic blueprint for human beings it is now
[2:22:30.480 --> 2:22:37.280]  possible to isolate genes responsible for various human characteristics the temptation is to begin
[2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:44.800]  the process of engineering our own future evolution all genes in every single living organism on the
[2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:53.200]  earth are made with dna if you can give a mouse a jellyfish gene which makes the mouse glow in the
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:23:00.800]  dark you can do the same thing with a human baby although i'm not saying this should ever be done it's
[2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:10.720]  mind-boggling to say that any biological property that exists anywhere in the living world in any
[2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:18.960]  organism could be brought into human beings this is really quite quite amazing scientists
[2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:26.240]  are partly to blame for the lack of knowledge because scientists always want to keep things
[2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:33.760]  quiet they're afraid that if people understood where this technology would go they would completely
[2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:41.840]  freak out no rational academic scientists will admit to wanting to find genes that are going to
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:49.200]  be useful for enhancement however it's going to happen as a byproduct of the human genome project
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:55.760]  and then the question becomes we'll have the knowledge will people use it there are so many
[2:23:55.760 --> 2:24:01.440]  potential benefits such as protecting people from genetically inherited illnesses but it
[2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:07.680]  doesn't stop there if you go step by step through this process you're basically replicating evolution
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:14.000]  but you're doing it a million times faster we know so much more about genes for example
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:19.600]  that determine physical attributes the other kinds of things that are coming forth more quickly than
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:26.320]  we thought are mental characteristics we already know of some genes that give somebody a predisposition
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:34.080]  to think in a certain way think in a certain way get ready for a brave new world coming your way
[2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:39.600]  soon those scientists claim to have moral concerns about genetically enhancing humans
[2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:46.000]  it is surely inevitable that someone somewhere use the technology for this purpose the problem
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:52.960]  is that there is no clear line between overcoming disease and providing enhancement
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:59.600]  okay let's stop right there yeah it goes on to talk about how the highly evolved will dominate us
[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:04.960]  the suboid slaves now the elite plan to split us into two species in fact finish up that in part
[2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:12.320]  play that for folks here it is such highly evolved superhumans will be far superior to their humble
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:18.800]  ancestors stronger healthier more intelligent they will be as different to us as we are to
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:26.320]  earthworms and if that's so what's to stop them stepping on scientists don't want to believe this
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:31.360]  but anybody who studies genetics you realize that all right let's stop that's enough now look now
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:36.960]  now here's the deal the geneticists the head of the un they're all on records in my film in-game
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:42.080]  blueprint for global enslavement they're on records saying that's what they are doing with this
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:47.440]  that it is diabolical it is for control because they say well we're cold-blooded scientists
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:53.360]  and it's survival of the fittest so anything we do to dominate you anybody we kill anybody we destroy
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:58.880]  that was a manifestation of our fitness and that we were more fit than you and that you
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:03.840]  didn't have the will to dominate and to kill and to mutate and to dumb down and so you don't have
[2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:09.680]  a right to inherit the future so see this is introducing it to the public of oh it could
[2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:16.080]  be used for bad oh it may be oh a byproduct of the human genome project you know where the human
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:24.480]  genome project is based cold springs harbour the united states eugenics records office and testing
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:31.280]  facility and then i put him in my film mr watson the discoverer of the dna double helix uh saying
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:34.880]  he's a eugenicist and you know he wrote books about it and saying all this he's the head of
[2:26:34.880 --> 2:26:40.640]  the human genome he was there in the 40s when it was still officially the eugenics organization
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:47.120]  now he headed up the genome project till last year six months after in game came out he came out
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:54.160]  and said blacks weren't human remember well see he was already a star in in game because we knew
[2:26:54.160 --> 2:27:00.400]  what he was we didn't need the media to come around and tell us now some of you are racist and say
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:05.440]  well i don't like blacks go ahead and kill them let me give you a little newsflash the real target
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:10.960]  of the eugenicist is what they call their competition and they believe their competition is northern
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:18.320]  europeans so that's where they're really targeting we'll be right back we're on the march the empires
[2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:28.880]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network a few years ago john a 44 year old man came to
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:34.240]  me with fibromyalgia allergies arthritis back pain and headaches he came to me because he'd
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:39.360]  heard an ad about other people benefiting from using a product i carried my name is steven here
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:44.560]  i'm a professional nutritionist john was taking ultram a powerful painkiller to alleviate some
[2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:49.840]  of his pain however this was not healing his damaged tissues so his pain continued he ordered
[2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:54.720]  the product chrysalis chrysalis helps your body make the proteins necessary for healing so instead
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:28:00.240]  of stopping his body's ability to feel the pain with a drug he supported the healing of it within
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:05.280]  two weeks he noticed his back didn't hurt as much then a week later he didn't need the ultram anymore
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:09.760]  then his headaches disappeared and his allergies were virtually gone he felt better than he had in

[2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:45.680]  a race to dominate and control the food supplies it's a race
[2:30:48.720 --> 2:30:56.160]  everything is a race to get this new world order in place and so that's why the globalists
[2:30:56.160 --> 2:31:02.080]  rationalize all the corrupt things they engage in all the horribly abusive dehumanizing
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:08.000]  operations they carry out they all humans are a barbarous creature if we don't guard
[2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:14.000]  the sacred destiny of man with a bodyguard of wickedness and destruction and deceit
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:19.200]  that evil will prevail but when you really study the elites they are the inculcation
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:27.280]  you know the very personification of dehumanization they have lost their humanity they are aberrant
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:35.920]  they are malfunctioning they are engaged in a crime against their own species
[2:31:39.040 --> 2:31:41.280]  all right let's blitz through some of your phone calls
[2:31:43.360 --> 2:31:44.560]  is tim up next john
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:54.160]  jason jason in missouri go ahead jason how you doing alex good good it's an honor to
[2:31:54.160 --> 2:31:56.800]  uh to speak with you i've listened to you for
[2:31:58.240 --> 2:32:05.120]  last three years um it's it's you're a pretty amazing guy oh come on i'm just fighting the
[2:32:05.120 --> 2:32:09.280]  new world order man i'm just doing any normal person would do learn about this but i appreciate
[2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:15.200]  you listening what's on your mind um just that you know um trying to get people's eyes open to
[2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:21.600]  what's going on you know i mean it's amazing you know you know what would they deploy what
[2:32:21.600 --> 2:32:28.080]  20 000 more troops you know well they say the you know that's official news 20 000 you know that was
[2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:35.520]  what they put you know it went into georgia all right let's yeah let's be clear for decades
[2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:40.880]  they were secretly gearing up preparing for it saying it didn't exist while they were preparing
[2:32:40.880 --> 2:32:47.680]  to take over the country now uh they're claiming oh yes 20 000 combat troops from the army thousands
[2:32:47.680 --> 2:32:52.960]  from the marines thousands from the navy we're federalizing the national guard the executive
[2:32:52.960 --> 2:33:00.000]  is a dictatorship congress has no authority under pd 51 i mean just open dictatorship wall street
[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:06.160]  runs the executive wall street can't be reviewed wall street can have trillions a week of of taxpayer
[2:33:06.160 --> 2:33:12.880]  money i mean it is corruption to the power of a billion it is just the ultimate in your face
[2:33:12.880 --> 2:33:18.080]  obvious and then everything we warned people about was true it's all coming true now and
[2:33:18.080 --> 2:33:23.280]  still the public just sucks their thumb that much harder and you're exactly right and and
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:28.480]  i'm gonna tell you a little quick story about i angered my in-laws this you know over the holidays
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:35.360]  about uh you know bringing up these issues and and you know kind of you know i was i was using
[2:33:35.360 --> 2:33:40.880]  some of your you know i was kind of you know using you know some of your language and and
[2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:45.040]  because i you know i've researched what you got angry because deep down they got angry
[2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:49.200]  is deep down they know it's true go ahead well i mean i i don't i don't you know just take for
[2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:53.920]  what you hear and and you know always just believe it you know i researched it too you know just like
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:59.520]  any body would you know i mean just just because i hear it i don't necessarily understand good so
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:05.920]  i mean you know research and and they you know what the response was to me i'd just rather be
[2:34:05.920 --> 2:34:12.240]  blind to it i was like well the poison's working then well you're right a lot of people say i know
[2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:18.880]  it's true but i just don't care and they get this little selfish smile on their face yeah that that
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:24.720]  by denying it it's somehow or saying they don't care it somehow gives them power over it and and
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:33.120]  what those are are people that have zero respect for themselves yeah absolutely uh i mean i mean
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:40.160]  if you can be that that close minded you know i mean open your eyes people i mean you know
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:45.360]  you know i heard earlier you know which i'm going back a little ways you know people were accusing
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:52.240]  you of being racist i remember about two months ago uh whenever you know mccain and and uh and
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:57.280]  obama were were battling it out and uh you know people were calling you racist at that point you
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:02.640]  know criticizing you and you know i can't quote your word for word what you what your reply was
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:08.160]  but it was something along the lines of you know if i was racist well i'd want to bomb in there
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:13.360]  because he's going to be the fall guy anyway i don't want to make him look bad oh absolutely and
[2:35:13.360 --> 2:35:19.200]  you know and he it's going to create incredible racial tension because that's what multiculturalism
[2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:27.440]  does it it makes people focus on their differences it makes people obsess over it all day and it's
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:35.360]  already started rush limbaugh is playing you know these audio clips about uh these what the name of
[2:35:35.360 --> 2:35:42.080]  the song is super negro or or magical negro yeah puff the magic negro we're going to play it next
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:48.640]  hour and again that is meant to make this all racial and that will actually galvanize people
[2:35:48.640 --> 2:35:53.360]  to support obama especially whites because they don't want to be part of that racism
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:59.360]  and i mean no one else but limbaugh who's the government psi op could could get and again
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:03.280]  limbaugh says put everybody in jail for drugs but then he can be a drug addict and he doesn't get
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:09.280]  in trouble because again this thing is shut up for the corrupt anything else well i mean you know
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:15.600]  yeah i got a lot but i know you got limited time you know it one thing you know he was talking
[2:36:15.600 --> 2:36:21.200]  about to a gentleman not about an hour i've been on hold for about an hour in some minutes but
[2:36:21.200 --> 2:36:25.680]  that when i first got on there he's talking about you know a guy mentioned to you what what you
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:32.400]  expected to go on to 2009 you know and you talked about you know you know course inflation which is
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:38.000]  you see now you know you know i'm still making the same hour well actually i'm one of the ones
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:44.240]  that got laid off but you know hopefully i get i get you know my i get unemployment but i you know
[2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:48.720]  i still get that same amount of money but yet you know green means might end up costing me three
[2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:54.240]  dollars a can you know what i mean it's it's very serious and i appreciate your call we got to move
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:58.960]  on our folks will still be on hold for an hour uh scott in iowa you're on the air go ahead
[2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:02.320]  alex yes sir
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:09.360]  hey how you doing today good when the operation of the machine becomes so odious huh
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:13.760]  when you just can't go on with anymore you got to put yourself up against it
[2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:18.880]  and you got to put your body in the up against the levers and that the people who operate the
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:24.320]  machine know that you won't let the machine operate unless you are free okay i just was
[2:37:24.320 --> 2:37:27.680]  calling because of the kid you had called yesterday the 14 year old or 15 year old from
[2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:32.000]  the high school up there in minnesota wherever it was now we had him on as a guest yeah that kid
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:36.240]  is amazing and i commend him so much and i would have done anything to have been woken up at that
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:42.560]  age but unfortunately i woke up about two or three years ago um i had a friend of the big city i
[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:47.040]  live in us close to mississippi and i one a friend and then close to the arsenal told me you got to
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:52.320]  watch this news change video so i watched it and we came to the conclusion that well obviously the
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:37:56.960]  administration knew knew and let it happen but you know they weren't behind it they're obviously
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:02.000]  patsy's who we didn't we didn't just get who was really behind us all so two weeks later my aunt
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:08.160]  hands me a video called freedom to fascism and this is why the banking system is so the most
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:13.920]  important issue to me and i've done my fair share of waking people up and i live in a small town
[2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:18.480]  about six thousand and i've woken up quite a few people i've actually woken up one of a
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:22.640]  local police officers and he quit the force which i tried to talk him out of i wanted him to try to
[2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:27.760]  wake up other officers but anyway that's how i woke up once i understood the banking system
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:33.600]  and uh i think that's the main issue if people just understood just how the system works you
[2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:39.280]  know and people don't exactly scott you're great you're amazing you do a great job you speak to
[2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:47.600]  truth and uh that kid is great i love him i really like that kid he is fantastic scott keep it up
[2:38:47.600 --> 2:38:54.720]  man appreciate your call keep waking folks up in your area another way they control us is
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:39:00.480]  they tell you oh well you're not an adult till you're 18 you know 20 years old whatever
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:05.760]  and they tell you go out have fun don't be an adult don't have responsibility and then by then
[2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:12.880]  you're 25 years old you're in deep debt you know to go to college and you know your life's already
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:18.080]  partly over uh and and a big part of the best part of your life is over you're meant to be getting
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:25.440]  i mean there were quite a few signers the declaration of independence that were 25 26 27 years old
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:34.720]  and they many of them had been homeschooled back then you would be homeschooled most people were
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:40.320]  and then you would go take the bar exam or you would go take the college exam
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:45.280]  or you would go take the medical exam and then you would apprentice if you could pass the medical
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:50.480]  exam you would then be an assistant for a few years to a surgeon or to a physician
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:55.440]  or you would then go to one of the higher academies it was the same for lawyers blacksmiths you
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:40:02.160]  know whatever the profession was uh and and and i mean people owned companies they uh
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:07.200]  you know they were they were out captaining ships when they were 20 something years old
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:12.480]  and people are so amazed by somebody who gets involved when they're young now
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:17.280]  i mean i see this as i got started late i woke up when i was about 16
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:23.760]  i started studying and it still took me four years to figure out i want to go on the air and
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:30.640]  warn people so people marvel that i was on the air when i was 20 i was an old man when i was 20
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:36.640]  you know in ancient cultures people became men when they were about 12 or 13
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:43.680]  and uh they would be given responsibility and if you give a young person responsibility early on
[2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:49.360]  instead of treating them like little children they will become responsible daring intelligent people
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:56.800]  but if you don't that's why i love farming communities you know the areas that are still
[2:40:56.800 --> 2:41:01.280]  surviving i mean you'll see 11 year olds driving the big hay truck with the big machines behind it
[2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:05.760]  with the adults you know putting the you know the hay in run the machines or you'll see you'll see
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:11.440]  13 year olds you know out there driving the tractors and and shredding or you'll see 12
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:16.720]  year olds in there sweeping out the big chicken coops in the morning and coming in and putting
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:22.960]  the fresh feed down people like oh that poor child they have to work that person's a hundred
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:28.160]  times happier than the than the little sugarhead who's on prozac you know in they're watching 14
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:40.960]  hours of tv a day and so we've been destroyed by the great plenty that we had and we've turned
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:45.440]  into a bunch of decadent slobs we have to turn that around i would just tell young people folks
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:50.240]  stay out of the system don't let them institutionalize you
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:54.160]  if your parents send you to a government training camp
[2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:02.320]  keep your head down don't care about the cliques and the cool kids and the and then the this group
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:09.040]  or that group and so i mean let me tell young people a secret if you stop caring about people
[2:42:09.040 --> 2:42:14.000]  in high school you'll you'll basically turn into the most popular person in school overnight
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:18.000]  and then you'll find out that that's a prison it's not even fun
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:24.080]  i mean i know that by the time i was a junior and senior in high school i was hanging out with
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:32.880]  the college kids and i wanted to go camping and hiking and hunting and uh you know i wanted to
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:39.040]  date the college girls when i was 16 17 and i'm not saying i'm some advanced person i'm not the
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:45.520]  point is is that you don't want to stay it's not even stay a teenager it's like some false
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:52.320]  mode they put people in i see all these adults 35 40 50 years old still trying to act trendy
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:56.960]  and then who they are is as you know what little trendy group they're in whether it's a cowboy hat
[2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:00.960]  or dreadlocks or whatever and i'm not i don't care if you got a cowboy hat or dreadlocks
[2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:08.640]  that's fine as long as you're more than just your style as long as it's your integrity it's
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:14.000]  who you are it's what you stand for that's who you are not how you dress or how you look
[2:43:15.360 --> 2:43:19.440]  i mean i got short hair because i don't like messing with it in the morning coming straight
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:26.080]  back and how it falls for the day that's how it looks um and i don't like people seeing me as some
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:31.680]  preppy goody two shoes because uh i i i just dress moderately clean cut
[2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:41.600]  and i'm a white guy but i'm i mean i'm tired of everything being boiled down
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:45.840]  to the stereotypes and i try not to look at people through a stereotype
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:51.680]  it's been a long time since i had a whole show nothing but calls this is kind of crazy today
[2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:56.880]  uh let's uh talk to um andrew in colorado andrew go ahead
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:02.720]  your phone sounds like an electric razor i'm gonna let you go in a second do you have anything to say
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:10.320]  okay let andrew go goodness gracious jeremy in canada you're on the air jeremy
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:15.440]  oh that was funny hi alec thanks for taking my call thank you for calling what's on your mind
[2:44:15.440 --> 2:44:21.120]  um just wanted to talk to you a little bit about uh as i was waking up um going through
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:26.000]  history and learning all that the stuff about uh how we moved into this continent and a lot of
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:31.360]  the wars that went on and it kind of struck me that man is it really all over like his
[2:44:31.360 --> 2:44:37.440]  current society not like that anymore i mean uh but that was one of the things that really kind
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:43.120]  of got me now there's always subterfuge always secret societies always corruption and then
[2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:47.920]  they told us oh no that doesn't exist anymore the government's good everything's fine they love you
[2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:52.720]  and they tell us about all the millions of uh of uh indians that got killed with
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:57.680]  smallpox and and all the genocide that's going on now i mean did it ever really stop
[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:03.920]  no it didn't ever really stop and the textbooks now they want you to feel guilty
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:11.440]  as if you committed those crimes so that you'll do whatever the the the new cultural priest
[2:45:11.440 --> 2:45:20.080]  tell you is uh how you find salvation uh you know how you like buy a modern indulgence uh and so you
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:24.240]  do that by paying a carbon tax there's nothing to do with the earth nothing to do with helping
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:29.680]  indigenous peoples in fact the carbon tax is written to starve the third world and destroy
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:36.080]  africa but instead they they they dress it all up as a liberal uh you know religion when it's not
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:42.960]  even liberal again they just scramble all the terms uh together and so i mean about the high
[2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:48.080]  school stuff there too because even the language is built so that we have a paradigm of a thought
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:52.960]  and a paradigm of our structure of communication that only fits with the current society and the
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:56.480]  second you start using terms differently or start using concepts differently it becomes
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:00.400]  difficult to communicate with within that framework and that's what orwell talked about
[2:46:00.400 --> 2:46:07.280]  everything is about destroying language where you can't even communicate with people well
[2:46:07.280 --> 2:46:13.040]  and you see that in the science of uh or the the the philosophy of science every every paradigm
[2:46:13.040 --> 2:46:18.800]  shift they have difficulty even communicating between the paradigms and this is the ultimate
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:23.920]  paradigm shift i mean for better or worse for you know whether it's going to be good or bad and
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:29.200]  it all looks like it's going to be bad everything is in crisis everything is in upheaval and the
[2:46:29.200 --> 2:46:35.920]  elite are trying to be omnipresent they're trying to play god uh but but they aren't there you know
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:40.960]  they're able to steer things they're able to exercise and wield great power but they are not
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:46.320]  in control i gotta tell you another thing too alex uh i was so proud of some of the the messages
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:51.520]  you were sending that actually gave me my sign after you oh my gosh well that's such an honor
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:57.520]  and well you're just so nice i really appreciate that i got a couple questions concerning some of
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:01.440]  the products you have too like e colo blue and how effective it would be in canada here with
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:06.400]  our dry climate and would you happen to know if anyone has told you about that or i didn't know
[2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:14.640]  canada had a dry climate well it's just the cold weather you know man all i know is uh that it it
[2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:19.280]  does seven and a half gallons in regular humidity the lowest they say it does is about three and a
[2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:24.080]  half gallons our problem is it produces so much water we've got to remember to drink it and get
[2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:28.960]  it out of there i mean it's got a uv light over it but i mean i mean we've got the smallest unit
[2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:34.960]  they've got i've got one at my house and one at the office and this thing produces it's wonderful
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:40.640]  i mean it's like a water cooler without a water cooler top on it i gotta say some of your guests
[2:47:40.640 --> 2:47:45.680]  are just incredible like this dr. libel that you had on a few weeks ago and her general husband
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:48.640]  they're talking about the chemtrails you know i thought back to my past and i remember all
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:52.880]  those chemtrails as a kid thinking that you know something's up but never really tying the lines
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:58.560]  together and just by the way it has really upset the establishment and so they've got a lot of
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:04.320]  operatives attacking general stubblebine and dr. lebo right now and you listen to the attacks i've
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:08.800]  heard him a million times you know the same type of attacks is definitely going tell pro so those
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:14.000]  guys are definitely uh doing a good job and that's why they're under attack right now it's it's
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:20.400]  really sad you know they're upset to have a major general uh three star general speaking out anything
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:24.560]  else sir sure i'll wait for the great care okay stay there jeremy we'll come back to pat josh with

[2:59:02.880 --> 2:59:10.480]  put out the same why we've been hearing for a decade that gas receipts are down well if you
[2:59:10.480 --> 2:59:15.760]  simply go and you look at the fact that this country a decade what 12 years ago was using
[2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:21.760]  15 million barrels a day at its height 23 million barrels that's dropped down to about 20 so 20
[2:59:21.760 --> 2:59:27.600]  million barrels a day uh and the gross tax receipts for the states and the feds are way up
[2:59:27.600 --> 2:59:34.400]  up so the claim that they've got to track you uh by the mile and turn your car into a taxi cab

[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:34.960]  be the future and everybody's going to pay then i remember reading about governments doing it i
[3:06:34.960 --> 3:06:39.680]  remember seeing toyota and others saying they were preparing to make the public basically do this
[3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:45.200]  and then i would go on air and tell people and get the standard stuff you lie they'll never do that
[3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:51.120]  and then now they're doing it and i mean we need to say no i mean this is just amazing
[3:06:52.880 --> 3:06:55.600]  but the bigger issue is they keep claiming they need money folks
[3:06:55.600 --> 3:07:02.720]  it looks governments are erecting hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of new taxes and squeezing
[3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:09.120]  the public and the majority of the money that the government squeezes out of us goes to offshore
[3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:15.360]  banks and as if that wasn't enough they now publicly have made the treasury department
[3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:21.360]  above through the federal reserve that's private above congress and and the bloomberg financial
[3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:26.800]  reports were under war powers act martial law and i have congressman on to tell you
[3:07:26.800 --> 3:07:32.080]  martial laws basically been put in over congress congress is above the courts in the president
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:38.720]  you know first they taught people 50 years ago that it was co-equal branches it's not i've read
[3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:43.360]  the federalist papers i've read the anti-federalist papers one of the few things they were unanimous
[3:07:43.360 --> 3:07:51.680]  about was a second amendment a first amendment and that the legislature is preeminent but
[3:07:52.880 --> 3:07:58.480]  now they say no the executive is above the legislative and the executive openly says
[3:07:58.480 --> 3:08:00.480]  that it commands the legislative
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:11.120]  look at korea look at vietnam where the president just goes off to war and there's no declaration
[3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:15.680]  congress has to declare war name the enemy and then they raise the money and then they
[3:08:17.680 --> 3:08:19.600]  command the commander-in-chief
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:29.040]  now they tell us no no the president's above them totally made up total fraud again i go
[3:08:29.040 --> 3:08:32.000]  back to the 17th amendment same year we got the income tax on the private federal reserve to
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:41.440]  govern 2013 what did they say what did they do before you would elect your state reps and then
[3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:50.320]  they would vote and they would elect the u.s senator so the state controlled the congress
[3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:57.200]  through the senate local control i mean what does dictator mean it means the central government
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:02.080]  dictates it tells you oh you don't want a war it's still gonna happen oh you don't want
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:05.760]  open borders it's still gonna happen oh you don't want a carbon tax it's still gonna happen
[3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:12.560]  this is a dictatorship of the corrupt elite and the president is just a front man and all
[3:09:12.560 --> 3:09:18.480]  of us now meanwhile all these serious issues going on i got black guys calling up the show
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:25.040]  in the first hour telling me i'm a white devil again today and this one brand of black israeli
[3:09:25.040 --> 3:09:29.440]  israeli where it says the whites are all the devil and the jews particularly are
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:34.240]  just absolute satan seed and i'm like look man i'm not getting involved in this i don't
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:37.280]  think blacks are the devil i don't think whites are the devil i don't think chinese are the
[3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:43.680]  devil we're all just human beings but meanwhile can you blame all this racism when people like
[3:09:43.680 --> 3:09:49.040]  limbaugh this fake conservative drug addict oxy cotton head involved in all this stuff
[3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:53.680]  and always flying out of third world countries with big bags of viagra whatever the point is
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:59.760]  his hypocrite he says if somebody's caught with cocaine the type that blacks tend to use give
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:05.840]  them 25 years in prison first time but if he's caught with synthetic heroin nothing happens to him
[3:10:08.400 --> 3:10:12.880]  and i don't like bashing limbaugh even though he's bashing me quite a few times because it almost
[3:10:12.880 --> 3:10:18.480]  gets on his level and and and he's not i mean he's part of the false left right paradigm that's why
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:25.360]  the media always gives him attention you know he's the guy that fooled republicans to come out
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:32.560]  for hillary so that mccain would lose you're saying that we're gonna beat obama and it was some
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:39.840]  you know secret plan and all the rest of it that was really a setup and limbaugh on record says
[3:10:39.840 --> 3:10:43.760]  the council on farm relations doesn't exist and now he admits to exist but says it's just a think
[3:10:43.760 --> 3:10:47.840]  tank he says there's no new world order when hundreds of newspapers are announcing world
[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:52.000]  government of foreign by the private banks openly admitting the private central banks
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:58.400]  are engaged in all these activities you know they engineer the crisis now you're gonna pay
[3:10:58.400 --> 3:11:06.480]  your carbon taxes to them limbaugh won't tell you that but what he will do is play things that i mean
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:11.440]  really are incendiary racially now i believe in the first amendment and he's got a right to play
[3:11:11.440 --> 3:11:17.360]  stuff like this but some people think the first amendment is not having a right to criticize it
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:22.240]  i have a right to criticize it and isn't that i'm walking on eggshells and can't handle stuff it's
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:28.400]  that it's pointless and it actually helps barack obama calling him the magical negro
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:37.120]  will cause more racial tension will cause bigger racial divides and will
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:44.880]  empower white guilty yuppies to support obama no matter what he does because they're not going
[3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:51.120]  to be seen as being in a racist camp by making it racial it diverts us off of his policies that are
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:59.760]  bad gun control open borders carbon taxes more wars and then makes it left right makes it you
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:07.760]  know black white makes it vulcanizes it so here is the it's not even a racist song it's a manipulative
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:16.400]  brainwashing song it's a manipulative brainwashing song to make people who don't like
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:39.360]  obama look bad it's not a legitimate attack on obama you understand go ahead and roll it
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:47.760]  yeah the guy from the LA paper said he made guilty whites feel good they'll vote for him
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:58.400]  and not for me cause he's not from the hood see real black men like snoop dog or me or ferro con
[3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:10.880]  have talked to talk and walk the walk not coming late at one oh barack the magic negro lives in
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:21.440]  dc the LA times they called him that cause he's black but not authentic leave barack the magic
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:31.760]  negro lives in dc the LA times they called him that cause he's black but not authentic leave
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:42.640]  some safer rocks articulate and bright and new and clean the media sure love this guy
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:53.600]  away into lopas dream but when you vote for president watch out and don't be fooled don't vote
[3:13:53.600 --> 3:14:01.440]  the magic negro in curse because i won't have nothing after all these years of sacrifice
[3:14:01.440 --> 3:14:14.320]  i can't i can't listen anymore of it okay now i mean it's stupid it again it makes everything
[3:14:14.320 --> 3:14:21.360]  about the fact that he's black not that we don't want his policies it's petty it's it's it's it's
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:25.040]  skin deep and this was first you know being distributed by republican national committee
[3:14:25.040 --> 3:14:30.480]  chairman mike um duncan who's been distributing this and lembos playing and saying it's real
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:36.320]  funding again this is part of tearing america apart play a little bit of limbaugh saying he
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:44.720]  doesn't care uh he doesn't uh you know care uh again this is about a stunt this is about limbaugh
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:48.960]  when he doesn't get the attention he needs coming out and saying black quarterbacks are no good or
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:55.920]  whatever i mean again it's all a big fat diversion here it is controversy every one of you out there
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:15:00.800]  that think you've got something here on barack the magic negro i'm gonna try to help you and save you
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:06.720]  saltsman defends the cd telling cnn i think most people recognize political satire when they see it
[3:15:06.720 --> 3:15:12.240]  i think rnc members understand that but current rnc chairman mike duncan says he's appalled
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:17.760]  in a statement to cnn the 2008 election was a wake-up call for republicans to reach out and
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:22.720]  bring more people into our party there's a crowd of conservatives that takes a special pride in
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:27.040]  being anti-pc well i don't think they fully appreciate as it comes across somewhere between
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:32.960]  being indifferent to hostile and that's how let's stop right there again and then and then the main
[3:15:32.960 --> 3:15:38.080]  line social engineer liberals can grandstand like they've got the moral high ground and push through
[3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:43.600]  their agenda on global warming which is admittedly targeted to shut down africa latin america and asias
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:47.760]  industrialized development will actually kill tens of millions of people that are dying every year
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:56.080]  of starvation so again it's more just petty mindless diversions uh and distractions uh and and and
[3:15:56.080 --> 3:16:00.960]  more of a way for the establishment to put limbaugh out there like he's a renegade like he's cutting
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:12.080]  edge when the guy is a hypocrite when the guy is uh not a real conservative and when the guy is a
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:20.320]  tragedy he's a tragedy i feel sorry for rush limbaugh because he's a smart guy and he knows
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:27.680]  that he's just there to deceive and to neutralize conservatives to give them a false brand of
[3:16:27.680 --> 3:16:30.880]  conservatism to make sure they're defeated to make sure the new world order comes in
[3:16:34.240 --> 3:16:40.960]  on september 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops i went to ground zero and we knew

[3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:51.920]  and i got a video clip from russian tv i want to play this has been picked up by the wall street journal
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:29:58.960]  but right now let's go ahead and go back to the calls pat in texas you're on the air go ahead
[3:30:00.080 --> 3:30:06.800]  hey uh i need more in a minute um i i know you haven't done it but you need to do a show about
[3:30:06.800 --> 3:30:12.960]  this uh danger we had to the constitutional convention because texas is guilty again roby wade
[3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:19.360]  and now we maybe our fault that if we lose the constitution there was a aid they don't say this
[3:30:19.360 --> 3:30:26.960]  on wikipedia but he was an aid to uh former uh transportation czar who fell dead rick wilson
[3:30:26.960 --> 3:30:35.760]  and the guy's name was gregory watson i was there i was trying to fight it uh he went back 200 years
[3:30:35.760 --> 3:30:43.200]  and got called for the constitutional convention on the ruse well at that time i thought it was important
[3:30:43.200 --> 3:30:48.800]  um that you could not write yourself a raise while you're in office you couldn't get it till you reelected
[3:30:49.760 --> 3:30:55.680]  well it hasn't stopped him from doing it under cola it's been the court uh and uh castle living
[3:30:55.680 --> 3:31:02.240]  raises they're getting their first raises but what this guy was really working on when he did that
[3:31:02.240 --> 3:31:11.280]  was an er a amendment and what it amounts to alex is this he wanted to prove he started doing that
[3:31:11.280 --> 3:31:17.280]  in 82 and when we approached rick wilson he act like he really didn't know anything that texas had
[3:31:17.280 --> 3:31:23.600]  a call for a constitutional commitment amendment to convention with a uh a ruse to balance the budget
[3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:29.360]  it's a bait and uh switch things people don't understand they're always trying to get a
[3:31:29.360 --> 3:31:33.920]  state income tax too uh for those that don't know a constitutional convention is where they can call
[3:31:33.920 --> 3:31:38.720]  all the states together they're only two states short of it right now uh the closest we've been
[3:31:38.720 --> 3:31:43.440]  in decades to getting a constitutional convention they can rewrite the entire bill of rights
[3:31:43.440 --> 3:31:48.960]  entire constitution uh and they've got the ruse of gay marriage for the left to get behind it in
[3:31:48.960 --> 3:31:53.600]  some states in right wing states they claim it's for you know a illegal alien amendment
[3:31:53.600 --> 3:31:59.520]  uh but but but the group's pushing and admit it's really about gutting everything once they get it
[3:32:00.080 --> 3:32:03.920]  and the hell the the you know the executives already declared itself dictator above the
[3:32:03.920 --> 3:32:08.160]  legislative but that doesn't mean that's legitimate but they could legitimately it would
[3:32:08.160 --> 3:32:13.920]  still be tyrannical but but more legitimately at least ram through in a concon and so we need
[3:32:13.920 --> 3:32:19.520]  to beat that i appreciate your call good to hear from you pat joshua in oregon you're on the air
[3:32:19.520 --> 3:32:26.720]  welcome uh yeah hey alex um i want to talk to talk to you about something that's really important
[3:32:26.720 --> 3:32:32.880]  to you are you there yes i am okay um you know i heard you're having some difficulty with your
[3:32:32.880 --> 3:32:41.600]  websites in google um you know seo is my job i all all day long i handle search engines and stuff
[3:32:41.600 --> 3:32:46.240]  and you know when i heard about that i went and checked out info wars and then prison planet
[3:32:46.240 --> 3:32:53.280]  dot com and your problem is not with google it's with the design of your website uh your website
[3:32:53.280 --> 3:32:58.560]  should be be pulling a huge amount of traffic but because there's some simple errors on your websites
[3:32:59.280 --> 3:33:05.040]  google is completely ignoring them well sir i mean it's more than that it's it's it's my
[3:33:05.040 --> 3:33:10.560]  videos being delisted or erased off google or youtube uh it's a lot of other things that are
[3:33:10.560 --> 3:33:16.720]  going on uh that are uh happening but yes we moved to the word press so people could comment
[3:33:17.600 --> 3:33:22.480]  and then we have problems with word press not letting like i can't comment from my house for
[3:33:22.480 --> 3:33:27.120]  some reason we don't know why and then people accuse us of censorship because there's you know
[3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:33.120]  it's got such traffic uh and yes i know a lot of people told us it's not listed right for the search
[3:33:33.120 --> 3:33:40.240]  engines so do me a favor email erin at info wars dot com and he'll pass that on to curt uh email is
[3:33:40.240 --> 3:33:44.480]  about a lot of people tell me that we don't have the tags done right on there and uh you know we're
[3:33:44.480 --> 3:33:50.000]  trying to be we're just normal folks uh you know we're lucky if we can keep my websites up for a
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:55.040]  week straight uh and so yes i know there's a lot of ineffective things we're doing and since we moved
[3:33:55.040 --> 3:34:03.120]  from html to the word press we've lost a lot of our search engine rankings uh and and and and
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:06.800]  that's horrible because we're not reaching as many people randomly out there with our news
[3:34:06.800 --> 3:34:12.000]  and information so that needs to be changed please send me that info why don't you tell

[3:34:24.400 --> 3:34:30.240]  robot text file right there that is deliberately telling google to ignore it to ignore the entire
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:38.000]  website uh it's all of the the link on prison planner dot com has no follow tags on them
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:43.040]  which again tells google to completely norma i mean to me you know it yeah you would you would be
[3:34:43.040 --> 3:34:48.720]  hard to get out of a word press site that is is worse you know than prison planet dot com is as
[3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:55.120]  bad as it possibly can be um it is understand it's worse than your worst thing we work hard around

[3:36:56.400 --> 3:37:03.600]  on youtube i believe the old info wars site it featured it and i'd like people to check that
[3:37:03.600 --> 3:37:08.960]  out if they haven't seen it you can go to youtube and type in tear storm remix and it should be the
[3:37:08.960 --> 3:37:19.280]  first result okay alex jones infusion tear storm remix and uh also uh i have a close family member
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:27.840]  who worked for the air force civilian do d side and classified areas avionics for about 40 years
[3:37:27.840 --> 3:37:34.640]  and uh i was able to convince him about 9 11 truth and i had a discussion with them
[3:37:35.200 --> 3:37:41.520]  about how they might have remote control the planes global hawk and he told a full grown
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:45.280]  adults still say there's no such thing as remote control when they can shoot chris missiles through
[3:37:45.280 --> 3:37:53.040]  people's chimneys down their chimneys and and and uh joe kennedy jr died remote controlling
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:37:59.520]  in a chase plane a b17 loaded with explosives as a drone i mean they've had it since world war two
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:06.320]  they've been having jumbo jets take off in la and fly to australia since the 70s but the public
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:12.320]  just says it doesn't exist but then they say cell phones work at 20 000 feet when they don't work
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:19.360]  at 5000 feet they're making cell phone calls and then now barbara olson's husband has been caught
[3:38:19.360 --> 3:38:24.240]  having to admit with the phone records that barbara olson never called him it wasn't real it isn't
[3:38:24.240 --> 3:38:31.280]  true yeah but i had this conversation with him and and like i said he worked in classified avionics
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:39.680]  and i asked him about that and he said that is exactly how that it was done using global hawk
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:49.920]  and i also had a couple questions i wanted to ask you about uh false flag attacks and and if you
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:56.880]  had a hypothesize what kind of black ops outfit do you think the was behind it was it like delta
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:04.720]  or was it the cia special activities exactly it's it's it's a nexus of cia running the drills
[3:39:04.720 --> 3:39:10.880]  to make everybody stand down norad keep people standing down to screw up all the others uh groups
[3:39:10.880 --> 3:39:17.520]  that were tracking it at norad and the f a a and then they used uh because they were loyal and would
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:24.720]  do it i i believe massad was involved on the ground uh along with other cold warrior groups uh
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:30.000]  christiansionist who you know really believe that the muslim threat is so great that the attacks
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:34.560]  had to be staged to get america's head screwed on right let us know we got a deal with this
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:39.360]  threat and now they've written all these articles in the news saying 9 11 sure helped us we need
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:44.800]  another one uh so you know they're and we've got all these republican memos that have come out about
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:50.080]  man we shooting another attack that was sure great uh you know peanut explained it cheney
[3:39:50.080 --> 3:39:54.880]  explained the terror attacks would help them get through with their agenda uh so i believe they
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:40:00.400]  used uh contractors people who've been in special forces people who you know are at that level above
[3:40:00.400 --> 3:40:06.720]  government and uh it would take about a hundred people to do the ground ops inside those buildings
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:12.320]  where they had complete access and control um jeb bush uh brother marvin bush was running security
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:18.480]  and uh i mean it's this nexus of all these key people there i appreciate your call i want to
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:23.360]  get to this clip so i can come back and take more calls uh in the final segment wall street
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:30.240]  journal reports as if things weren't bad enough russian professor predicts end of us and and
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:36.160]  the whole article says you know the evil corrupt russians they just want america to fall and they
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:43.440]  just hate america so now if you talk about the us breaking up going bankrupt you're an evil ruski
[3:40:44.720 --> 3:40:49.920]  all the russians are saying he's been saying this for 10 years is that through globalization
[3:40:49.920 --> 3:40:56.480]  and vulcanization that the united states is falling apart and he actually goes on his real
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:41:02.880]  reports to say this is going to hurt russia russia doesn't want this uh but if you look at the
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:07.680]  international banks they've always and they've bragged the club of rome's bragged that they want
[3:41:07.680 --> 3:41:11.600]  america to have a low standard of living they want to get rid of the middle class they want the us
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:17.680]  to fall apart so they can buy it all up cheaper and control the population so so see now they ignore
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:23.040]  jaryl salente and and peter schiff and myself and all these others and ron paul who've been predicting
[3:41:23.040 --> 3:41:27.600]  this for years i'm predicting a lot longer than schiff and others who i don't care if i get credit
[3:41:27.600 --> 3:41:34.480]  whatever uh the point is uh is that you know they pretty much ignore us but then they go oh look
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:41.920]  the ruskies are saying the ruskies they hate america no the globalists are the ones that want
[3:41:41.920 --> 3:41:46.480]  this to happen and they are breaking the us up so let's go ahead and look at this uh clip
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:51.360]  from russia today a few weeks ago the point is it's finally now made the wall street journal
[3:41:51.360 --> 3:41:57.920]  we've got a link to that up on prisonplanet.com here it is the financial crisis and its potential
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:02.320]  consequences have been occupied in minds of many experts across the globe recently indeed the term
[3:42:02.320 --> 3:42:08.000]  all originated in the us and a russian professor of economics has put forward his own theory about
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:13.040]  the impact the credit crunch will have on america join the studio now by ego punaro who says the us
[3:42:13.040 --> 3:42:19.040]  will split into six pieces because of the crisis let's talk more about this so good evening to you
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:24.320]  thanks for joining us in the studio uh quite controversial thoughts these explain your thought
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:27.760]  processor
[3:42:33.440 --> 3:42:38.880]  i believe that in 1998 i was writing my theory it has to do with the fact that first of all
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:44.080]  different states of the united states have different history different culture and different
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:50.640]  level of financial and economical significance in the life and activities of the united states
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:59.040]  today i believe that the world is at the point of united states development when in fall of 2009
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:06.320]  there may uh a huge crisis may develop and eventually it will lead in summer of 2010
[3:43:06.320 --> 3:43:12.240]  that the territory of the united states will be divided into six different states my immediate
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:17.120]  thought is do you think this would have happened may happen according to your theory if it weren't
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:22.400]  for the financial crisis and if this scenario did happen where would the power base be
[3:43:26.080 --> 3:43:30.400]  well the main power base there will be actually three power bases in the territory of the united
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:35.280]  states new york and washington which will be under the influence of london first of all
[3:43:35.280 --> 3:43:40.320]  it's california and texas which will be under the influence of three countries russia china
[3:43:40.320 --> 3:43:45.120]  and mexico from my point of view now a german chancellor angler merkel says the us got into
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:48.800]  this trouble in the first place by borrowing cheap money and using cheap money do agree with her
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:58.800]  i believe that she's right first of all i can emphasize that russia and germany often have
[3:43:58.800 --> 3:44:03.360]  the same points of view as far as the financial crisis concern in particular but also want to
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:08.800]  emphasize that the problem is that the dollar is not backed by gold and there are too many dollars
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:13.760]  in this world mr panara what are your forecasts for the outcome here in russia regarding the
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:22.560]  financial crisis i believe that the crisis in russia uh can be finally prevented only with
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:28.800]  making the ruble the main reserve currency of euro asia and turning moscon to the main
[3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:33.680]  financial center of the european continent just very briefly i just want to also pick up on
[3:44:33.680 --> 3:44:38.480]  something you said in your report that you even speculated this scenario that alaska might wonder
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:46.480]  when you its ties with russia why is that then i believe that alaska should return to russia
[3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:54.480]  and there is a very good manager roman abramovich all right that's enough okay that a bit fanciful
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:59.760]  there at the end but decadent bankrupt bully nations do fall apart and do get usurped but
[3:44:59.760 --> 3:45:06.880]  again just like 150 years ago ten western powers went in and divided up china into their own private
[3:45:06.880 --> 3:45:12.880]  business district uh and had paramilitary police on every street corner and different companies and
[3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:18.720]  nations had different armed mercenary groups that protected them that's what the united states
[3:45:19.280 --> 3:45:27.280]  is shifting to that's why the navy is creating its own army now uh the criminals have taken over
[3:45:27.280 --> 3:45:31.840]  government and they have decided to loot the hell out of us i want to bring up ten anderson right
[3:45:31.840 --> 3:45:35.360]  now they got a few final calls right at the end of the show ten i'm not going to belabor this long

[3:45:45.760 --> 3:45:53.200]  gold last buy when it was at 770 you have a little bit of gold uh left at those prices you are also
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:57.280]  one of our great sponsors here on the tv shows we'll put some of your phone numbers and graphics
[3:45:57.280 --> 3:46:02.400]  up on the screen at prison planet dot tv uh ten anderson joining us from minnesota are you there
[3:46:02.400 --> 3:46:06.720]  yeah i'm right here with you uh ten uh correct you're still offering gold that you bought at the
[3:46:06.720 --> 3:46:12.640]  770 level yeah we sure are we still have those francs at 205 and we have the british sovereigns at
[3:46:12.640 --> 3:46:19.040]  254 uh you're talking we're talking last time what's the best buy in the house right now um i'm
[3:46:19.040 --> 3:46:24.240]  still offering silver dollars are the creature from jackall island for 2645 and people sure
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:29.200]  don't need to know about central banking uh we have the walking liberty halves they're currently
[3:46:29.200 --> 3:46:34.800]  at 840 uh i just can't say it enough i mean there's just so much going on economically in this world
[3:46:35.600 --> 3:46:40.720]  that you simply have to take a serious look at your investments well ten let's be clear that
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:46.160]  creature from jackall island deal the book i know is it you paid 14 bucks for those uh and then
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:51.680]  you're offering a silver dollar that they're selling everywhere for above 20 bucks and so i mean for
[3:46:51.680 --> 3:46:58.240]  26 dollars you are losing money on this well yeah alex we lose money on it but the the point of it
[3:46:58.240 --> 3:47:02.720]  is is that we need to carry this message not just to the listeners here of the alex jones show
[3:47:02.720 --> 3:47:07.360]  but these people need to have the ammunition and the knowledge to carry to their friends and family
