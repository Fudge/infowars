[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.000 --> 00:22.000]  Environmentalists target SUVs with stickers. A bolder environmentalist told 7News Tuesday that he put stickers on SUVs to remind the vehicle's owners that they are polluting the air.
[00:22.000 --> 00:35.000]  We had on a guest a year ago that started this. The man identified only as Drew, and we've got him on with us, Drew Agras, said that he puts bumper stickers with the words, I don't care about the air, on parked SUVs.
[00:35.000 --> 00:45.000]  Well, we're on, in Boulder. I guess you can tune in to the show there. This practice is a growing trend, both locally and nationally, 7News reported, and it goes on.
[00:45.000 --> 00:56.000]  Basically, it's labeling cars with owners that I believe really don't care about the air because they've gone and spent a couple thousand dollars on something that pollutes more and is less fuel-efficient than other cars, Drew said.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  We're joined by Drew Agras. Drew, thanks for joining us today, sir.
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.000]  Thanks very much, Alex.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Let me first tell you where I stand, okay?
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  Go ahead.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  I care about the environment, okay?
[01:10.000 --> 01:25.000]  And I am really concerned about the New Scientist article about the Texas company ProteGene that put AIDS vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine and three other nasty things in a corn plant where the corn grows this.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  The corn kernels have this in them. It's now spread into at least three states.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  They're now saying they're putting cancer into cows and pigs to make them grow faster and mutate to create new developments.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  Those have even pro people that are for genetic engineering out of control. This has got them freaked out.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  But I don't really hear the environmental groups doing something about that.
[01:46.000 --> 01:54.000]  Here in Austin, I see them grabbing farms and ranches with the city and the big corporations, Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, Audubon Society.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  I've been to their smart growth conferences. It's all bankers up there, Bank of America, Citibank, all these groups.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  It seems like a pretext to attack private property.
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  SUVs putting out a little bit more pollution, and by the way, they've raised their standards.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  The government even admits it's now much cleaner than it was a decade ago or 50 years ago for that matter.
[02:14.000 --> 02:23.000]  It seems like you're polishing silverware on the Titanic and vandalizing cars. Your comments to that?
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  Well, that's a good point. I mean, there's a lot of causes out there for the environment, and I certainly can't fight all of them.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  There might even be better causes out there, but SUVs are a problem nowadays, and that's something I feel strongly about.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  Well, my family has a ranch we've had since 1830, thousands of acres. A lot of it's swamp land.
[02:41.000 --> 02:48.000]  I have a Tahoe, four-wheel drive. Should I have to have a special license because I use it?
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  I mean, shouldn't I be able to have an SUV? Even if I didn't, even if I was driving on the highway, shouldn't I be able to buy whatever car I want?
[02:56.000 --> 03:06.000]  That's a well-used argument. Of course, we live in America and we have all sorts of rights, and if something's for sale, of course you have the right to buy it. I don't argue that.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  So what, you're just trying to get the people to think about it and not have SUVs?
[03:11.000 --> 03:20.000]  Yeah, I think the main point here is that there's two problems with SUVs here. There's two actions against us in the environment.
[03:20.000 --> 03:29.000]  One is the government, which hasn't raised standards for light trucks and SUVs in the last 15 years, and the other would be the auto industry itself,
[03:29.000 --> 03:39.000]  which really just sells SUVs as sort of a sexy, powerful, safe sort of transportation, but they bore all the environmental problems.
[03:39.000 --> 03:51.000]  The feds have raised eight times in the last decade, twice in the last year, general overall emissions, and states and conglomerates and regional governments, totally illegal,
[03:51.000 --> 04:00.000]  are coming up with their own taxing schemes about that. I'm telling you that Kyoto and the rest of it are being rammed through by the oil companies so they can just jack up oil prices
[04:01.000 --> 04:10.000]  and sell us a plentiful commodity by artificially restricting the amount of it, just like De Beers does with his diamond monopoly.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  And I'm telling you, you're being used. Have you ever been to a smart growth conference?
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  A smart growth conference? No, I haven't.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  Okay, what organizations are you a member of, Drew?
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  Actually, the only organization about this particular problem is my website itself.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  And tell us about that.
[04:28.000 --> 04:37.000]  Well, it's basically trying to promote a little bit more education about SUVs and traffic patterns and transportation itself,
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  as compared to either misinformation or lack of information that the auto industry actually gives us.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  And it's, I don't care about the air.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  That's right.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  Now, when you said that pollution standards have increased over the last couple of years,
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  that's only a very specific and small amount of pollution have actually, the emissions controls have increased.
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  And that is smog emitting pollutants have actually decreased, or the standards have been increased in the last couple of years.
[05:05.000 --> 05:12.000]  But when it comes to CO2, which is the main global warming factor, they say, say the scientists, or 90 percent...
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  I'm not here to divide people. I'm not here to attack you and call you an environmental psycho.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  Oh, no, that's fine.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  No, I'm not here to call you that, but I want you to listen to me.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  Go ahead.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  I've been to the smart growth conferences. I've made films. I've been involved. I've seen it.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  And let me tell you again that if you will just go to the major environmental group websites,
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  they're all run by Monsanto and ExxonMobil and the rest of them,
[05:36.000 --> 05:43.000]  and Dutch Roll Shell basically finances the National Geographic Propaganda Land Grab Channel.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  The NRA supports the CARA bill to grab $47 million of private land.
[05:48.000 --> 05:55.000]  So the very people I'm sure that you don't like are the very people that are really Trojan horses pushing this whole movement.
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  Now they're saying major universities, major studies, people that did believe in global warming,
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000]  now they're saying we're entering global cooling.
[06:03.000 --> 06:08.000]  The earth has cycles, and you know a volcano. This is admitted.
[06:08.000 --> 06:14.000]  Mount St. Helens put out more emissions than the whole U.S. did for the whole decade of the 80s.
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.000]  Now, that's the government's own numbers.
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.000]  Now, how do you answer that, and why are you so obsessed with restricting mobility?
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.000]  You said traffic patterns. You call that smart growth, don't you?
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.000]  Actually, I shouldn't have said traffic patterns, but really more trends in buying SUVs.
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  For instance, for light trucks. Back in 1975, after the oil crisis, about 20% of cars sold were light trucks,
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  and that was mostly to farmers and other industries.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  Today, it's just past 50% of all new cars are SUVs and light trucks.
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.000]  Now, that says a lot. I mean, even if you say that fuel standards have increased and emissions have decreased,
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  the trends in buying have dramatically changed.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  Yeah, we are using another 8 million barrels of oil a day than we were in the 70s.
[06:57.000 --> 07:06.000]  Now, I've studied this. What I'm trying to explain to you is they are now putting cancer viruses in the cows to make them produce more milk.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  I have the New Scientist here in front of me. I have the Times of London here in front of me.
[07:11.000 --> 07:20.000]  They are putting HIV, experimental vaccine, in corn, sir. That makes SUV stuff not even on the radar.
[07:21.000 --> 07:28.000]  I agree. That's an incredibly weird scientific report. I haven't heard it, and it sounds terrible. I agree with you.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  Let me read it to you then, since you're here.
[07:30.000 --> 07:36.000]  No, that's Putin brings back Soviet Red Star, visas issued to 105 terrorist watch lists. No.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  Los Angeles prosecutors won't fall charges in remaining rampart cases. Italian doctor says clone baby due January.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  No, that's all coming up. Hold on. Hurdles remain for Army airline pilots.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  Oh, here it is. This is the London Observer. We also have Times of London on this.
[07:51.000 --> 07:59.000]  Researchers have developed a technique to speed evolution by inserting human cancer genes, cancer-causing genes, into animals and plants.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  Scientists condemn new gene technique. Hundreds of mutant breeds, which would normally take nature millennia to produce,
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  would be developed in months by a method known as hyper-mutation ability.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  But the technique, designed to improve production of new animal and crop breeds, has shocked many scientists and environmentalists.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  Some say the process could result in organisms and human cancer-causing genes being released into the environment.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  Others worry that attempts to accelerate evolution could be dangerous.
[08:21.000 --> 08:28.000]  However, its creator, the U.S.-based company Morfotag, should all be arrested, says it could be valuable to drug and agriculture companies,
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.000]  making it possible to isolate highly profitable breeds, drought-resistant plants, or milk-rich cows.
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  Details of the methods were pressed, passed by the Observer last week by a senior British researcher working on one of Europe's largest biological operations.
[08:42.000 --> 08:50.000]  Although a keen supporter of genome technology, the scientist was dismayed to learn about Morfotag's plans after its directors launched a sales tour of Europe.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  I was completely shocked, he said. What would happen if the organism containing such a dangerous gene escaped?
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  What if the gene got into the food chain? Some people could suffer fatal reactions.
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.000]  Now, the FDA has authorized full release of this open air. Let me read to you the open air test of this.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  Then I'll get your response and you'll stop this SUV business if you really care about the environment.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  This is the new scientist. GM crop mishaps unite friends and foes.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  Goes on to report mysterious pharmacological GM crop goes wrong in the U.S.
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  Texas-based company Protegene has been given authorization for the transmittable.
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  According to G.S. U.S. DM records, Protegene has received 85 test permits for experimental open air trials of pharmacological GM crops
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  and chemical crops for planting in at least 96 locations.
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  It's now spread to three states into soybean crops that they don't even own, by the way.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  AIDS vaccine, this is what's in the corn.
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  AIDS vaccine GP 120, a glycoprotein, blood clotting agent, artopene,
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  trispen, digestive enzyme that can cause the use in leather tanning or produce insulin,
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  industrial adhesive, lax case, an enzyme derived from fungus.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  Other pharmacological GM crops reportedly grown by Protegene include experimental oral vaccines,
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  Repetitis B, and for a pig disease, transmittable gastrotracitis, according to USDA records.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  Now, you still worried about SUVs?
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  Yes, I am. I think there's a lot of problems in the environment today,
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  and I think that you have a very interesting case there that we should be looking into some farming policies.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  Now, there's problems everywhere.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  Farming policies?
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  There's farming policies.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  There's transmittal of cancer-causing chemicals, all sorts of stuff,
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  but I maintain that there's not one thing that we should fight against.
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.000]  I think there's many.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  Yeah, but you notice, there you are in Boulder, involved in the environment,
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  you notice you knew all about the evil SUVs, which aren't causing a problem.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  I looked at the scientific data from all sides, but you feel good about that
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  because the news has given you some issue of no significance to attack mobility
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  and freedom of movement and all this and property rights and the roads we paid for.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  But you don't know about mass wickedness, do you?
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  Mass wickedness?
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  Yeah, that's what this is. This is cancer garbage.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  All right.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  This is mass evil, buddy. This is late-night horror science fiction flick.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  Yeah, I'd sort of argue that the auto industry as a whole
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  represents a mass wickedness against our environment with SUVs as well.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  Well, I've heard the environmental groups say they want to ban our cars
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  and have satellite tracker boxes to tax us when we drive.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  Have you heard of that?
[11:26.000 --> 11:27.000]  Yeah, I don't go that far.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  I really don't believe we need to restrict our freedom for transportation at all.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  Well, that's the U.S. government plan started in 2005.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  And I wouldn't support that at all.
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  All right, I've been running over you.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  I want to get some more comments from you on the other side.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  Please stay with us.
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.000]  Unbelievable.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  And then we hear the phony conservatives say,
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  oh, look at these environmentalist wackos.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  Now, this is a dangerous movement, folks,
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  controlled by the very groups that are decrying
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  in a political dialectic dog-and-pony show.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  We cut through that to the real issues that affect all of us.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  Man, listen.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk archives.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  And we are listeners supported with the honor system.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  We ask that you wait.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones.
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  The websites are infoawards.com, infoawards.net, jonesreport.com,
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  and now prisonplanet.com.
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  We're talking to Drew Agris, environmentalist who goes around
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  sticking bumper stickers on people's cars.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  What do the bumper stickers say that you stick on SUVs, Drew?
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Yeah, actually we have quite a number of stickers.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  I don't actually do the tagging of cars myself,
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  but there's a national network of people who do.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  Some of the stickers say, I don't care about the air.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  That's the original sticker.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  Well, you know, I've gotten a little...
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  They're placed on SUVs in order to make the owner who has to peel it off
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  think about what they're actually doing.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  Well, I've never been a vandal,
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  but once I saw a million mommy 100 bureaucrat mark sticker on a car,
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  and I couldn't help myself. No.
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  But I guess you're for disarming the American people, too.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  Are you for gun control?
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  Actually, I am, yeah.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  See, I don't think you're a bad person, Drew,
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  but you need to figure out a few things.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  You notice the cops are wearing black uniforms and ski masks now?
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  Uh-huh.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  Have you noticed that they're keeping tabs on people like you
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  in Boulder, in Denver, illegal police files?
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  Sure, you heard about that, right?
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Well, why do you want to disarm me, then,
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  when they're building giant prison camps everywhere?
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  Well, actually, you know, I guess I'd actually be for gun control
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  because of the lack of education with using guns.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  I think if they had a better program...
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  Oh, because some people do something wrong, let's punish everybody.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  You see, you need to become an American and a constitutionalist.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  I agree with you that people should have the right to have guns
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  if they know how to use them better.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  You know, a child here in Colorado died the other day
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  because they found a gun.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  His brother found a gun on a nightstand.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  Twelve times the number of children dies here in automobile accidents.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  Right.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  Three times the number of children dies here drowning.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  We're going to ban swimming pools, ban lakes, ban ponds.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  Think about safety belt laws.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  Let me tell you something.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Once they go after something, they destroy it,
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  and the plan of this government is to totally disarm the American people.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  Let's take a call.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  Who's up first here, Mark?
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  Cody in West Virginia.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  You're on the air, Cody, with our guest, Drew.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  How are you guys doing?
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  Yeah, they say there's like over 700 times doctors
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  that kill people on mishaps and stuff than there are gun accidents.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  Yeah, that's the actual Justice Department numbers.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  Yeah, and with the SUVs, you also got to consider,
[15:01.000 --> 15:09.000]  when you're using SUVs in pickup trucks, people are also carrying bigger loads,
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  loads that can't be carried in cars.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  There are also loads that would take three car trips to carry more people.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  Most of the people that have SUVs have got, hold on,
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  have got three or four children.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  They've got to put all the baseballs and basketballs and hockey gear in the back.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  I mean, look.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  I'd like to comment on that, actually.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  Drew, let me tell you something.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  You want to get involved in regulating our lives, and it's wrong,
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  and you're serving the very global as you think you're fighting.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  Actually, we definitely ask people to not tag pickup trucks
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  which are used in agriculture and construction,
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  not tag anything that has a company logo on the side of the truck.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  You're absolutely right, Cody, that many SUVs or light trucks are used for industry and farming,
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  and that's something that we don't fight against.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  But if you hang out on a street corner and watch what's driving by,
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  it's mostly single people driving huge excursions.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  All right, let me give you an example, and I'm going to make a film about this.
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  In Austin, they put 16 face-scanning cameras per bus.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  Over half the buses have no one on them at any time.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  They block lanes of traffic. They melt black smoke.
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  This is just the bus companies of the big corrupt metro systems wanting to go after our cars.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  They've said it.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  The Wall Street Journal reported the smart growth movement,
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  quote, wants to slow the speed of traffic to the speed of a horse and buggy.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  Yeah, and I know people out in rural areas are using SUVs and stuff more efficiently.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  Well, it doesn't matter. It's not people's business.
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  It's not people's business.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  What we drive and what we do, now they're going to tax fast food.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  Are you for taxing fast food?
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  I never heard of that. No, I'm not.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  You haven't heard? The Department of Agriculture wants to start taxing foods that are too fattening
[16:45.000 --> 16:46.000]  and aren't good for us?
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  Here in Virginia, they're taxing meals and stuff at restaurants.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  They got two taxes on that.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  It's out of control. It's out of control.
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  The Kyoto Protocol is about taxing our fuel for the United Nations criminal system.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  I guess you probably think the U.N. is good, too, right, Drew?
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  That's a different subject, yeah.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  You need to educate yourself, Drew.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  Let me ask you a question, though. Let me ask you a question now.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  Let me ask you a final question.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  You are polishing silverware on the deck of the Titanic.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  Shouldn't you get concerned with pointing out the genetic engineering?
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  Maybe I should create a website about that as well.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Can I say something about that genetic engineering?
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  With the genetic engineering and the cancer agents that are in milks and stuff that they're selling now,
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  berry products, we've got to clarify that this isn't your average small farmer and working farmer.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  No, they're infecting the globalist.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  These are corporation farms.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  The globalists are infecting the whole food chain on purpose so they can then come in and regulate it.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  Last word, Drew, what did you want to say?
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  I was just going to say that the government is there for a purpose,
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  and I wonder what your opinion that purpose is for if it's not for the protection of our citizens.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  Protection? No, no, no. The government is not there,
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  and the courts have ruled that they have no duty to protect us.
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  They're there to feed on us as a criminal organization.
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  This is an unconstitutional government. Wake up.
