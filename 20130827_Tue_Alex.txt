[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:28.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:28.640 --> 00:36.000]  I've probably started 500 radio broadcasts the way I'm about to start this one, trying
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.440]  to contain myself, trying to make sure I go over coldly all the incredible evidence.
[00:43.440 --> 00:49.800]  This is truly a day where we're seeing the best of humanity and the worst of humanity.
[00:49.800 --> 00:59.960]  99% of Americans in a major poll are agreeing to an attack on Syria.
[00:59.960 --> 01:01.400]  This is unprecedented.
[01:01.400 --> 01:05.240]  This shows the dam has broken, the people are aware of the fraud, they're aware of the
[01:05.240 --> 01:06.920]  war provocation.
[01:06.920 --> 01:12.160]  Every military person I talk to, active duty and retired, all the way up to generals, some
[01:12.160 --> 01:19.280]  of them off record, some of them on record, are absolutely against this and know that
[01:19.280 --> 01:22.120]  the Syrian rebels, the al-Qaeda forces, are behind the attacks.
[01:22.120 --> 01:24.200]  They've been caught three separate times.
[01:24.200 --> 01:26.240]  There's no logic for Assad to do this.
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.760]  The area where it happened was rebel-held, and they targeted civilians, and then you
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.680]  watch John Kerry up there pushing his lies.
[01:37.680 --> 01:42.880]  This is unbelievable, but what it illustrates is we have a political class dictatorship,
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.120]  a bureaucratic, corporate, mega-globalist dictatorship that doesn't care, and they're
[01:48.120 --> 01:54.040]  now in NBC News, Associated Press Reuters, you name it, announcing the military strikes
[01:54.040 --> 01:56.920]  as early as Thursday.
[01:56.920 --> 02:04.600]  That's military strikes, heavy strikes, aircraft are massing in Cyprus 100 miles away, F-16s,
[02:04.600 --> 02:16.080]  F-18s, F-15s, Puff the Magic Dragon, C-130 gunships, you name it, they've even had B-2
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.000]  bombers taking off out of the U.S. and reportedly flying to Europe, that's why one of them crash-landed
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.320]  a few weeks ago.
[02:22.320 --> 02:26.080]  There is just all sorts of stuff going on right now.
[02:26.080 --> 02:30.960]  They're not just gearing up to hit Syria.
[02:30.960 --> 02:32.760]  They're not just gearing up to hit Syria, folks.
[02:32.760 --> 02:37.400]  They intend to get in a fight with the Russians, and the Russians have got anti-aircraft missiles
[02:37.400 --> 02:41.760]  that are the latest generation, they've got anti-ship missiles that are the latest generation,
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.040]  let me tell you, when you see U.S. ships sinking and on fire, and when you see U.S. aircraft
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.560]  getting shot down, the average good old boy is going to get behind Obama, kneel to him,
[02:50.560 --> 02:52.560]  and turn his guns in, basically.
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.240]  I mean, they know that, because they'll just get behind the military whenever they see
[02:57.240 --> 02:59.040]  U.S. ships blowing up.
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.520]  They may even false flag our ships, that got declassified, well, Cy Hirsch had sources
[03:03.520 --> 03:07.240]  inside, later they had to admit it, what, four years ago, that Cheney wanted to attack
[03:07.240 --> 03:14.160]  U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz and blame an Iran, but Bush said no, and stopped him.
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.200]  One of the few times he said, I'm the president, you're not going to do that, because Bush
[03:18.200 --> 03:21.800]  reportedly had some little soft spot for the Navy SEALs they were going to kill.
[03:21.800 --> 03:26.560]  I mean, that all came out, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.600]  That all came out, and it is the end, the BBC, that Western aircraft are arriving in
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.040]  Cyprus, Zero Edge is also gearing it.
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.600]  It's all up on infowars.com and prisonpana.com, and the leader of Al Qaeda, Zawa Heery, this
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.720]  is CNS News, has gone public backing the U.S. attack, he's very, very thankful for that,
[03:48.720 --> 03:54.800]  and saying after, they weren't taking out Libya, he says after Syria, then Damascus,
[03:54.800 --> 04:00.560]  the capital of Syria, then Cairo, then Jerusalem, absolutely, and Obama and our government is
[04:00.560 --> 04:03.000]  on record supporting that takeover.
[04:03.000 --> 04:10.280]  Now, here's the mega bombshell, and the story is up on infowars.com right now, with all
[04:10.280 --> 04:12.760]  the videos added to it.
[04:12.760 --> 04:17.080]  It's from WorldNet Daily, and we've got Dr. Corsi joining us at the start of the second
[04:17.080 --> 04:19.600]  hour.
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.680]  Paul found this a year ago when they first attacked them loading the missiles with the
[04:24.680 --> 04:28.480]  nerve gas, and because the Al Qaeda rebels posted, they're proud of themselves, they
[04:28.480 --> 04:31.120]  know how dumb Americans are on average.
[04:31.120 --> 04:36.400]  There are new videos of last week's attack with the jihadis loading the chemical mortars,
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.880]  and I told you it'd be chemical mortars, because that's how you precisely hit a civilian area,
[04:41.880 --> 04:43.560]  and then blame the opposition.
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.760]  We have the video, they posted it, that's how arrogant they are of them launching the
[04:48.760 --> 04:52.520]  chemical attack, and you know who's commanding them, John Kerry.
[04:52.520 --> 04:57.200]  So when he gets up and gives a speech about invading, he's the prime suspect of the nerve
[04:57.200 --> 04:59.200]  gas attack.

[06:59.280 --> 07:03.440]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[07:03.440 --> 07:08.560]  I do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their
[07:08.560 --> 07:11.320]  lives that the disaster won't get them.
[07:11.320 --> 07:16.280]  Hundreds of you helped EFOODS Direct ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[07:16.280 --> 07:20.880]  The problem is we can't help everybody, if every one of us who can, will take care of
[07:20.880 --> 07:24.880]  ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[07:24.880 --> 07:30.160]  The new Justin Case Pack from EFOODS Direct is the big brother to the 7 day emergency pack

[08:18.320 --> 08:23.680]  My friends, it looks like they're going to do it, they're really going to do it.
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.640]  And it conjures up an image of Charlton Heston at the end of the planet of the apes, discovering
[08:28.640 --> 08:35.800]  that the planet he's on is not some far far far off planetoid orbiting a distant sun,
[08:35.800 --> 08:41.760]  but is Earth when he sees the Statue of Liberty half submerged in the ocean melted from nuclear
[08:41.760 --> 08:45.640]  fire, thermonuclear explosion.
[08:45.640 --> 08:49.920]  He says they did it, they really did it.
[08:49.920 --> 08:51.680]  And that's the point we stand out here.
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.760]  I don't say this for rhetoric or to hype up the radio listeners.
[08:56.760 --> 09:03.400]  I am more concerned for my family and this country and the world than I have ever been.
[09:03.400 --> 09:08.360]  You know the globalists aren't going to let Obama just leave office in 2 and a half years.
[09:08.360 --> 09:11.560]  They haven't set up homeland security in the armored vehicles, the billions of bullets
[09:11.560 --> 09:16.000]  in the spy grids and gone public badmouthing the founding fathers, in the Department of
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.860]  Defense manuals that are public, the judicial watch is covering.
[09:19.860 --> 09:23.680]  They haven't tried to overthrow the country and shut down our power plants and ship our
[09:23.680 --> 09:26.000]  jobs to China for nothing.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.040]  They're going for broke.
[09:28.040 --> 09:35.600]  And they need a big war to get the American people to shut up and go along with it.
[09:35.600 --> 09:41.800]  There is a Russian fleet off the coast of Syria.
[09:41.800 --> 09:45.400]  The Guardian confirms with zero hedges reporting.
[09:45.400 --> 09:50.720]  You can look at the links on infowars.com and drudgereport.com right now that U.S. aircraft,
[09:50.720 --> 09:59.680]  British aircraft, French aircraft, NATO forces, F-16s, F-18s, you name it, German aircraft,
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.640]  they're all massing their tornadoes, the list goes on and on.
[10:04.640 --> 10:07.800]  And they are moving in strategic bombers.
[10:07.800 --> 10:11.040]  I know because they've left West Texas.
[10:11.040 --> 10:14.480]  They're gearing up for war with Russia, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:14.480 --> 10:22.800]  They're just going to use Syria as the detonator for this situation.
[10:22.800 --> 10:23.800]  There's the London Guardian.
[10:23.800 --> 10:30.280]  Syrian crisis, warplanes spotted in Cyprus, as tensions rise in Damascus.
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.480]  NBC News reports military strikes on Syria as early as Thursday.
[10:34.480 --> 10:40.400]  U.S. officials say it is on, ladies and gentlemen, right now.
[10:40.400 --> 10:44.960]  The Russian deputy premier calls the West a monkey with a hand grenade, and that's
[10:44.960 --> 10:51.560]  an old saying from World War I, because a monkey has no idea that it's holding absolute
[10:51.560 --> 10:54.760]  death in its hand.
[10:54.760 --> 11:04.040]  World War III, ladies and gentlemen, I liken it to a five-year-old who is playing monopoly
[11:04.040 --> 11:08.880]  with you and you catch them cheating.
[11:08.880 --> 11:15.840]  And except in this case, innocence die and part-place gets bombed, basically.
[11:15.840 --> 11:21.320]  And it is psychopathic, inbred, globalist royalty and bankers who make 40-to-one bets
[11:21.320 --> 11:26.520]  with other people's money and get in trouble only by being slapped on the wrist and given
[11:26.520 --> 11:28.520]  more taxpayer money.
[11:28.520 --> 11:34.080]  And they are accustomed to never failing, and they've got over 10,000 nuclear weapons
[11:34.080 --> 11:41.160]  in the U.S., more than 20,000 in Europe and England, Israel's got more than 600, and it's
[11:41.160 --> 11:45.720]  got dolphin submarines with cruise missiles aimed at Russia, saying they'll use them.
[11:45.720 --> 11:50.200]  The Israeli Knesset, even this year, had members say, let Russia back Syria, we'll just blow
[11:50.200 --> 11:51.200]  them off the map.
[11:51.200 --> 11:55.800]  I mean, this is crazy land, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:55.800 --> 12:00.520]  This is a monkey with a thermonuclear stockpile.
[12:00.520 --> 12:03.600]  This is worse than a monkey with a hand grenade, because then the monkey just blows themselves
[12:03.600 --> 12:09.760]  up, and it's just like Hitler turning east into Russia when he was already losing with
[12:09.760 --> 12:10.760]  the West.
[12:10.760 --> 12:13.880]  It's just like Napoleon going into Russia.
[12:13.880 --> 12:17.000]  Empires go into Russia to die, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.320]  And the Russians have shown historically that they will not blink when it comes time.
[12:21.320 --> 12:23.240]  They're going to fire nuclear weapons.
[12:23.240 --> 12:28.000]  Now, they already tried to have nuclear war in 1962 and 63.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.520]  Kennedy said no, and the CIA blew his head off.
[12:31.520 --> 12:34.280]  I don't romanticize Kennedy, he did a lot of bad stuff.
[12:34.280 --> 12:36.360]  They were getting ready to stage a false flag on Honduras.
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.080]  That's been declassified to blow up the U.S. Embassy to have a war down there.
[12:41.080 --> 12:46.520]  But Kennedy, this came out, Kurnis LeMay, the head of the Air Force, wanted to nuke Russia.
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.920]  If you see the movie Dr. Strangelove from 1964, that was made during that whole deal.
[12:50.920 --> 12:55.160]  And Kubrick, it's now been declassified, was given info by the Kennedy administration
[12:55.160 --> 13:00.200]  in 62 and 63 when they didn't think they'd be dead yet.
[13:00.200 --> 13:01.840]  There's a way to counter them.
[13:01.840 --> 13:08.600]  And of course, Kennedy then fired them all, L.L. Lemninser, Kurnis LeMay, the Dallas brothers
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.080]  running the CIA, he said, we're not going to have nuclear war.
[13:12.080 --> 13:17.480]  And he called Khrushchev up and said, look, bud, you back off right now, they're going
[13:17.480 --> 13:19.200]  to nuke you.
[13:19.200 --> 13:23.280]  And because he got that real phone call, the Russians stood down, pulled their missiles
[13:23.280 --> 13:26.880]  out of Cuba, and the U.S. pulled their missiles out of Turkey.
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.640]  The Russians put the missiles in Cuba because the U.S. put missiles in Turkey.
[13:32.640 --> 13:35.320]  Believe me, I know I had family over there that was deploying them.
[13:35.320 --> 13:38.240]  I remember hearing about that when I was a kid, you know, after it had happened.
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.840]  But back when I was a kid, it was just a few years after it had happened.
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.040]  Okay, this time you got a bunch of nutcases running the federal government, ladies and
[13:46.040 --> 13:47.040]  gentlemen.
[13:47.040 --> 13:49.400]  There is an agenda of Kennedy up there to stop this.
[13:49.400 --> 13:55.040]  And yes, the West has superior space weapons, DU, meteor guns, Sabos, all sorts of stuff.
[13:55.040 --> 13:56.040]  It still won't matter.
[13:56.040 --> 13:58.880]  They won't be able to shoot down all the Russian missiles.
[13:58.880 --> 14:09.800]  Now, Dick Cheney on 888 back in 2008 had their Western puppet launch an attack into Russian
[14:09.800 --> 14:16.760]  held areas, attack Russian bases on the border in Ossetia, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia.
[14:16.760 --> 14:18.760]  And our media said Russia has attacked Georgia.
[14:18.760 --> 14:21.680]  It came out three days later that no, actually the West attacked Russia.
[14:21.680 --> 14:24.000]  People said, how dare you side with Russia?
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.560]  Which I am an American, a constitutionalist, a defender of the whole Bill of Rights.
[14:28.560 --> 14:32.440]  We've been seized by crazy bankers that aren't even in the U.S. mainly.
[14:32.440 --> 14:36.680]  They've all moved to Luxembourg and, by the way, all the top Israeli billionaires, all
[14:36.680 --> 14:39.800]  of them the last two years, have moved out of Israel.
[14:39.800 --> 14:40.800]  Guys, type in those headlines.
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.960]  All the dots are connecting right now, even for me on air as we break this down.
[14:44.960 --> 14:47.280]  Just type in billionaires leaving Israel.
[14:47.280 --> 14:49.560]  And they're going to Australia, folks.
[14:49.560 --> 14:51.440]  They're going to London.
[14:51.440 --> 14:54.360]  They're going to Paraguay.
[14:54.360 --> 14:56.200]  The Israeli billionaires are leaving.
[14:56.200 --> 14:57.600]  The American billionaires are leaving.
[14:57.600 --> 15:01.480]  I personally know one of the richest women in America.
[15:01.480 --> 15:02.960]  She's no longer in America.
[15:02.960 --> 15:05.520]  Only ran into her by happenstance as she was a listener.
[15:05.520 --> 15:06.520]  I didn't even know she was.
[15:06.520 --> 15:08.400]  I looked her up and she told the truth.
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.720]  One of the richest defense contractor women in the world, she left five years ago.
[15:13.720 --> 15:16.200]  She said, quote, there will not be a United States.
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.600]  I said, what are you talking about?
[15:17.600 --> 15:20.200]  She said, look, you're going to get real big.
[15:20.200 --> 15:23.520]  It's everything you're saying is true, but you better get your family out of here within
[15:23.520 --> 15:24.520]  five years.
[15:24.520 --> 15:25.520]  It's five years later.
[15:25.520 --> 15:27.160]  I've told you that story for five years.
[15:27.160 --> 15:29.280]  Put the headline back up there for everybody.
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.040]  These crazy people are going to start World War three.
[15:32.040 --> 15:33.040]  Guys found the headlines.
[15:33.040 --> 15:37.080]  I want to read it to people out of London Guardian about the Israeli billionaires leaving
[15:37.080 --> 15:41.440]  because they know Israel is probably going to get hit in all this.
[15:41.440 --> 15:45.640]  Israeli billionaire, Adon offers moving to London, no loss to us.
[15:45.640 --> 15:47.000]  Bye-bye, Adon.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.120]  Your move will impact, won't impact Israel's economy.
[15:50.120 --> 15:52.720]  I mean, that's just, I guess, Israeli paper.
[15:52.720 --> 15:53.720]  What is that?
[15:53.720 --> 15:54.720]  Herats or Jerusalem Post?
[15:54.720 --> 15:55.720]  Yes, Herats.
[15:55.720 --> 16:00.240]  They've all been leaving, ladies and gentlemen, okay?
[16:00.240 --> 16:01.320]  Because let me tell you something.
[16:01.320 --> 16:06.840]  The globalists want to bring in world government and they have declassified that they staged
[16:06.840 --> 16:12.080]  World War one and suckered the Austrian, Hungarian Empire into that war, Germany into
[16:12.080 --> 16:16.520]  that war to bring in the League of Nations and then they engineered World War two.
[16:16.520 --> 16:23.560]  The globalists funding all sides to bring in the UN and now the final World War that
[16:23.560 --> 16:29.360]  Albert Pike wrote about in 1878, the head of the Illuminati, look it up, his letter
[16:29.360 --> 16:34.560]  in the Royal College in London, Royal Naval College, I've been there.
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, he said they'd have a final World War to bring in the Antichrist.
[16:39.400 --> 16:44.240]  Now, whether you believe in God or not, these people do and they're doing it and they believe
[16:44.240 --> 16:50.520]  out of this giant war that they're trying to set up.
[16:50.520 --> 16:52.600]  They pray to bring in the Antichrist.
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.000]  Now, I'm just telling you what the globalists think.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.480]  They call him their Christ.
[16:57.480 --> 16:59.520]  I call it the Antichrist.
[16:59.520 --> 17:03.600]  By the way, this is so bombshell, I can't even believe it.
[17:03.600 --> 17:07.400]  Up on infowars.com we're linked to the World Net Daily article with all the videos and
[17:07.400 --> 17:11.160]  I remember watching a year ago with nerve gas attacks showing the rebels bragging they'd
[17:11.160 --> 17:12.560]  done it.
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.680]  World Net Daily found all the Al-Qaeda videos from all of their Egyptian and Israeli sources
[17:17.680 --> 17:20.520]  because there are a bunch of cooler heads in Egypt and Israel that don't want this to
[17:20.520 --> 17:21.520]  happen.
[17:21.520 --> 17:24.680]  By the way, most people in Israel aren't for this either and large parts of the Knesset
[17:24.680 --> 17:25.680]  aren't as well.
[17:25.680 --> 17:26.680]  It doesn't matter though.
[17:26.680 --> 17:27.680]  Large parts are for it.
[17:27.680 --> 17:32.320]  And so through their contacts and Arab speakers, they have to work at World Net Daily, an incredible
[17:32.320 --> 17:33.320]  team they have folks.
[17:33.320 --> 17:34.320]  I've been to their offices in D.C.
[17:34.320 --> 17:35.560]  It's amazing.
[17:35.560 --> 17:40.560]  They were able to go find all the videos put out last week where the rebels, in fact show
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.320]  the article and scroll down and one of the videos, it's a still shot of them, loading
[17:44.320 --> 17:51.160]  the, and it's the Al-Qaeda rebels, remember last year, earlier this year, and the Israelis
[17:51.160 --> 17:55.040]  bombed it so they wouldn't get it, Al-Qaeda got into that chemical base and reportedly
[17:55.040 --> 17:56.040]  stole some.
[17:56.040 --> 18:02.680]  There is Al-Qaeda in their own videos, in their own brigade websites, loading the chemical
[18:02.680 --> 18:08.400]  mortars onto the mortars and firing them and bragging they did it.
[18:08.400 --> 18:11.200]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[18:11.200 --> 18:16.520]  And then John Kerry gets up there yesterday and says, anybody that questions this is aiding
[18:16.520 --> 18:21.200]  the terrorist and we don't even know, he goes on to say, who did the chemical?
[18:21.200 --> 18:22.200]  It doesn't matter.
[18:22.200 --> 18:23.200]  That's a quote.
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.400]  And even the Wall Street Journal today says that, has the quote going, well, does it matter?
[18:27.400 --> 18:28.400]  Who did it?
[18:28.400 --> 18:34.000]  If the UN finds chemical residue, they bomb the whole country and go in and turn it over
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.200]  to Al-Qaeda.
[18:36.200 --> 18:40.920]  I mean, they don't even care that we all know, because once they start a giant war, they
[18:40.920 --> 18:41.920]  think you'll get behind it.
[18:41.920 --> 18:45.480]  But let me tell the globalist something right now.
[18:45.480 --> 18:54.720]  I have pure research here with a 10-year graph from the 2003 start of the Iraq war until
[18:54.720 --> 18:57.040]  now, document can please.
[18:57.040 --> 19:05.200]  It started with a war started with a 72% approval rating.
[19:05.200 --> 19:10.840]  And the last time they did a poll, it had a 38% approval rating.
[19:10.840 --> 19:13.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, okay?
[19:13.640 --> 19:16.920]  And this pure research went from 2003-2008, doesn't go past that.
[19:16.920 --> 19:20.680]  So within those five, six-year period, it plunged more than half.
[19:20.680 --> 19:21.680]  Okay.
[19:21.680 --> 19:22.680]  There's that.
[19:22.680 --> 19:30.480]  Now, let me show you the new poll, Syria intervention, even less popular than Congress.
[19:30.480 --> 19:35.960]  A Reuters poll, scientific, only 9% support it.
[19:35.960 --> 19:38.920]  And there's another real clear politics poll.
[19:38.920 --> 19:41.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the deal, globalist.
[19:41.320 --> 19:43.240]  Everybody knows you're running the chemical attacks.
[19:43.240 --> 19:46.640]  By the way, you know why I got so sick and so angry, I actually had a fit yesterday up
[19:46.640 --> 19:47.640]  here.
[19:47.640 --> 19:53.840]  I mean, I was yelling and screaming for about a minute and a half, because I realized why
[19:53.840 --> 19:55.000]  I was getting so angry.
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.120]  When I'm looking at John Kerry, talking about these dead kids, the State Department's the
[19:58.120 --> 19:59.120]  one running this.
[19:59.120 --> 20:00.960]  We ordered the chemical attack.
[20:00.960 --> 20:06.360]  There are those curious about Bitcoins and those using and making money with Bitcoins.
[20:06.360 --> 20:07.360]  What are Bitcoins?
[20:07.360 --> 20:12.440]  A Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person
[20:12.440 --> 20:14.360]  to person over the Internet.
[20:14.360 --> 20:16.240]  No bank needed.
[20:16.240 --> 20:21.920]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[20:21.920 --> 20:24.160]  You are in control of your money.
[20:24.160 --> 20:25.320]  And the best part?
[20:25.320 --> 20:28.920]  You can start earning and making money with Bitcoins right away.
[20:28.920 --> 20:34.440]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with Bitcoins and a growing number of
[20:34.440 --> 20:36.800]  merchants now accept Bitcoins.
[20:36.800 --> 20:40.920]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[21:59.400 --> 22:04.160]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[22:04.160 --> 22:08.360]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[22:08.360 --> 22:09.360]  to serve as debt.
[22:09.360 --> 22:12.880]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[22:12.880 --> 22:16.160]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[22:16.160 --> 22:19.920]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[24:10.120 --> 24:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here and I want to do what we did yesterday.
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.440]  I want to give the number out again for active duty military especially if you've been over
[24:23.440 --> 24:27.600]  in Iraq they're on record arming the Al Qaeda rebels to send them in by the hundreds of
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.840]  thousands in the last two and a half years or if you've been at the bases in Jordan where
[24:31.840 --> 24:35.800]  two months ago the U.S. military had a drill and wouldn't leave Jordan and the Jordanian
[24:35.800 --> 24:38.600]  government said leave and our troops should sit there.
[24:38.600 --> 24:41.160]  U.S. troops have entered into the Gaza area.
[24:41.160 --> 24:47.920]  I mean all of this is being pre-deployed and then the West says a year ago if there's
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.280]  any chemical attacks period that's a red line we're going to attack.
[24:52.280 --> 24:55.920]  Everything Americans are simple minded and then on the date that Obama said that that's
[24:55.920 --> 24:57.920]  how these gangsters operate.
[24:57.920 --> 25:03.480]  They have Al Qaeda, world net daily folks, Dr. Jerome Corsi who worked in all sorts of
[25:03.480 --> 25:08.400]  black ops, Harvard political science guy, state department, I mean you know give me
[25:08.400 --> 25:09.400]  a break.
[25:09.400 --> 25:18.960]  I mean he's a major, major, major spook and he's saying that the rebels launched the chemical
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.120]  attack and they have the videos and their Arab sources.
[25:22.120 --> 25:23.360]  Of course they did.
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.520]  They did the last three events ladies and gentlemen and the fact that you've got somebody
[25:28.520 --> 25:33.880]  like Corsi who's a heavy hitter with all the big connections, worked at international banking
[25:33.880 --> 25:39.400]  you name it, coming out and saying exactly what we're saying and what Rush is saying.
[25:39.400 --> 25:45.360]  It's because it's the truth ladies and gentlemen and they're going to put a sod up there and
[25:45.360 --> 25:46.360]  go look.
[25:46.360 --> 25:47.880]  He has a mustache.
[25:47.880 --> 25:50.120]  He has brown skin a little bit.
[25:50.120 --> 25:52.480]  You know he has brown hair.
[25:52.480 --> 25:53.480]  Let me know.
[25:53.480 --> 25:54.480]  He's bad.
[25:54.480 --> 25:55.480]  He's a bad man.
[25:55.480 --> 25:56.480]  We better get him.
[25:56.480 --> 25:57.480]  He hurt the children.
[25:57.480 --> 26:00.000]  All the sods going I didn't do this.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  Don't attack us.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  The Russians are going to defend.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  I would never use an herb gas.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  You know that.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.800]  You guys have an evil government.
[26:06.800 --> 26:08.440]  Americans please don't let your government do this.
[26:08.440 --> 26:10.320]  They've been attacking us for two and a half years.
[26:10.320 --> 26:11.640]  Al Qaeda is murdering us.
[26:11.640 --> 26:13.400]  They're blowing up our churches.
[26:13.400 --> 26:14.920]  Please Americans please.
[26:14.920 --> 26:22.200]  And the good news is the American people in a major Reuters poll and then there's two
[26:22.200 --> 26:28.800]  others are between 9 and 12 percent supporting this.
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.520]  Ladies and gentlemen they had 72 percent in the major polls.
[26:33.520 --> 26:37.120]  Some of them even higher at the start of the last big staged war.
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.520]  Bill Clinton had over 70 percent support as well bombing Belgrade blowing up the Serb
[26:42.520 --> 26:43.520]  infrastructure.
[26:43.520 --> 26:46.000]  Now that was all made up as well.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.080]  That was the Western Civil War where they funded jihadis out of Albania, Al Qaeda again
[26:50.080 --> 26:51.080]  to attack.
[26:51.080 --> 26:53.600]  The Serbs defended themselves of course did some atrocities.
[26:53.600 --> 26:56.560]  Most sides were doing it and then the West went in and absolutely blew the daylights
[26:56.560 --> 26:57.560]  out of them.
[26:57.560 --> 26:59.600]  The point is the West, the bankers come.
[26:59.600 --> 27:03.000]  They inject people into your country, stir stuff up.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.440]  They sent in the Croats from one side.
[27:06.440 --> 27:09.640]  They sent in the Muslims from the other against the Serbs.
[27:09.640 --> 27:11.880]  The Serbs defended themselves, defeated it.
[27:11.880 --> 27:15.640]  Then the UN Zone Commission, you can look this up, said there were twice as many people
[27:15.640 --> 27:21.880]  killed in atrocities and war crimes against citizens by the Croats and the Muslims, double
[27:21.880 --> 27:26.320]  teaming the Serbs, then were killed by the Muslims and the Croats.
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.800]  I've had a few Croats and Muslim taxi drivers in New York and once in Austin and once in
[27:31.800 --> 27:32.800]  Dallas.
[27:32.800 --> 27:33.800]  This happened three times.
[27:33.800 --> 27:35.480]  Say you are Alex Jones.
[27:35.480 --> 27:37.520]  We love Bill Clinton.
[27:37.520 --> 27:38.520]  You side with Serbs.
[27:38.520 --> 27:39.520]  I don't like you.
[27:39.520 --> 27:43.040]  You don't want me to get out, no, but you do not know and I go, well, didn't you guys
[27:43.040 --> 27:45.080]  attack them first and kill double their number?
[27:45.080 --> 27:46.080]  Yes, they are evil.
[27:46.080 --> 27:47.800]  We will kill all Serbs.
[27:47.800 --> 27:50.320]  Why are you with the pig Serbs?
[27:50.320 --> 27:51.600]  And I'm like, I'm not.
[27:51.600 --> 27:54.720]  I don't even have any Slavic blood in me, but I'd be proud if I did.
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.680]  I'd be proud if I had, you know, your blood in me.
[27:56.680 --> 28:01.320]  I just, the point is the West started all this to get rid of a sovereign area.
[28:01.320 --> 28:04.640]  Well, okay, but to us, Bill Clinton is God.
[28:04.640 --> 28:07.340]  That was the conversation in New York.
[28:07.340 --> 28:11.760]  Back in 2004, I was there for the RNC and this guy, I was in the back, Kevin Booth was
[28:11.760 --> 28:14.640]  right next to me and this guy was just looking at me in the rear of a mirror and he looked
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.040]  like a pure white guy.
[28:16.040 --> 28:23.200]  He had like blonde hair, blue eyes, he was a Muslim and he was just like, I used to like
[28:23.200 --> 28:26.160]  you, but you do start support the pig Serb.
[28:26.160 --> 28:31.120]  I mean, it's just like, man, I don't support NATO in the new world order, sending people
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.720]  into some country to attack them.
[28:32.720 --> 28:35.920]  They defend themselves and then they're called terrorists and then the West blows up all
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.560]  their chemical plants, all their power plants, bombs, Belgrade with depleted uranium.
[28:40.560 --> 28:42.600]  I was against doing that to the Iraqis.
[28:42.600 --> 28:44.480]  I'd be against doing that to Eskimos.
[28:44.480 --> 28:46.040]  I'd be against doing it to Africans.
[28:46.040 --> 28:47.400]  Man, I got empathy.
[28:47.400 --> 28:49.520]  I don't believe in war crimes.
[28:49.520 --> 28:51.640]  I don't believe in being the bad guys.
[28:51.640 --> 28:57.320]  I don't believe in it being done in my name and they did this to the Serbs and they've
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.280]  done this to so many other people and now they're going to do it and they've been doing
[29:02.280 --> 29:05.360]  it for two and a half years and they're going to bomb that country from one end to the other
[29:05.360 --> 29:06.840]  and kill Russian troops.
[29:06.840 --> 29:09.840]  They're evacuating all Russian civilians right now.
[29:09.840 --> 29:14.080]  There are Russian troops piling off ships right now to go into the country as although
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.880]  men, women and children and diplomats leave and the Russians undoubtedly have brought
[29:18.880 --> 29:20.480]  nuclear weapons into Syria.
[29:20.480 --> 29:25.120]  You can bet your bottom dollar those, those missile cruisers, they've got right off the
[29:25.120 --> 29:26.120]  coast.
[29:26.120 --> 29:33.840]  They've got nukes on them, medium range cruise missiles, basically Russian versions of Trident's.
[29:33.840 --> 29:37.720]  I mean, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:37.720 --> 29:42.120]  This is not a joke, but here's what's happening, so-called elite.
[29:42.120 --> 29:43.760]  You're all butt naked.

[33:25.700 --> 33:32.080]  There is a proxy war going on between the bankers, the globalists, the New World Order
[33:32.080 --> 33:38.520]  faction that runs much of Western Europe, England, Canada, the United States, Australia,
[33:38.520 --> 33:40.520]  New Zealand.
[33:40.520 --> 33:48.760]  They are gearing up for a proxy war, an open war beyond proxy with Russia.
[33:48.760 --> 33:56.760]  And WorldNet Daily has translated a whole slew of videos shot last week of the Al-Qaeda,
[33:56.760 --> 34:06.760]  Qatari, Saudi Arabians, Al-Qaeda forces with Al-Qaeda flags, by the way, singing Osama
[34:06.760 --> 34:11.480]  Bin Laden, I mean it is disgusting, firing chemical weapons, you know they videotape
[34:11.480 --> 34:14.360]  everything they attack.
[34:14.360 --> 34:20.280]  And they know you're so dumb and the globalists have got this so badly coordinated that they
[34:20.280 --> 34:28.120]  are firing chemical weapons on video in a whole slew of videos uploaded last week and
[34:28.120 --> 34:31.800]  they're bragging it's theirs on their YouTube channels, they're even allowed to have YouTube
[34:31.800 --> 34:32.800]  channels.
[34:32.800 --> 34:36.840]  Imagine if I had a YouTube channel launching chemical attacks, I mean there'd be 50 black
[34:36.840 --> 34:42.200]  helicopters, highways shut down, Alex Jones the ultimate evil, our media is so controlled,
[34:42.200 --> 34:47.760]  there's all these videos of the Western forces and that's why Kerry came out yesterday and
[34:47.760 --> 34:52.600]  said it doesn't matter who it turns out launched this, we can't allow this to be used, it's
[34:52.600 --> 34:57.960]  Assad's fault this is happening and the Wall Street Journal quotes him as well today saying
[34:57.960 --> 35:03.640]  it doesn't matter who did it, it's Assad's fault and we must take over the country now,
[35:03.640 --> 35:06.880]  we must lock these weapons down.
[35:06.880 --> 35:13.120]  Earlier this year when Israel bombed reported chemical weapons storehouses in Syria which
[35:13.120 --> 35:16.440]  all major governments have, they said it was because the rebels had gotten in and they
[35:16.440 --> 35:20.080]  didn't want them to have it, was that an Israeli cover story because they knew they were really
[35:20.080 --> 35:22.760]  getting them in there to get them, I don't know.
[35:22.760 --> 35:29.680]  The point is it's rebels with what looks like Russian chemical weapons saying Allah Akbar
[35:29.680 --> 35:37.520]  you know death to Assad firing them video after video of them shelling neighborhoods
[35:37.520 --> 35:44.520]  so they could then blame it on Assad and our stinking wicked media CNN, MSNBC, Fox, neocon
[35:44.520 --> 35:51.480]  talk show host you know who's out there promoting that we've got to go in against Assad now,
[35:51.480 --> 35:55.000]  the same neocons that promoted the banker bailout but then later said it was bad, I am
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.960]  so tired of it folks and I'm not trying to differentiate myself with their talk show
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.920]  host, I'm not going to say their names, I just wish they weren't evil because they're
[36:03.920 --> 36:10.400]  not stupid, thank God WorldNet Daily is telling the truth because they've got a bunch of Arab
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.000]  speakers and former PLO people that work for them who have translated all this and you
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.800]  can go and translate it on the Google translator out of Arabic into English as well with the
[36:18.800 --> 36:24.880]  text enter into a text translator and it does say that they're celebrating firing the chemical
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.880]  attack last week from multiple video angles them launching it they also then videotape
[36:29.880 --> 36:34.880]  it exploding then they go in and film with gas masks the people dying it was their little
[36:34.880 --> 36:43.600]  Steven Spielberg production basically it's a bunch of sicko jihadis doing this and detonating
[36:43.600 --> 36:49.680]  chemical weapons and it is absolutely thoroughly disgusting you can see them blowing up cars
[36:49.680 --> 36:56.960]  buses trains firing mortars how many videos are like eight videos on the page I mean I
[36:56.960 --> 37:01.760]  mean there's four posts and a bunch of links in the article to others this is unbelievable
[37:01.760 --> 37:07.280]  and then Paul Watson earlier this year found video of them doing the same thing and bragging
[37:07.280 --> 37:13.360]  look we have chemical weapons and by the way some of these guys have been on BBC and CNN
[37:13.360 --> 37:18.680]  they're rebel leaders it's not like they're Assad forces posing as Syrian rebels to do
[37:18.680 --> 37:23.960]  a reverse false flag they don't even care because the establishment goes look the American
[37:23.960 --> 37:30.960]  people will buy anything they might as well have John Kerry go over there and load the
[37:30.960 --> 37:37.320]  mortars we already had John McCain and others show McCain visits the rebels photos and video
[37:37.320 --> 37:41.200]  in including meeting with the guy there's video of McCain meeting with the guy who two
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.920]  months later has a heart of a guy he just killed and is eating it on TV and if you're
[37:46.920 --> 37:51.160]  a new listener by the way write everything down I'm saying and look it up I can't even
[37:51.160 --> 37:56.640]  believe this okay I mean this is so beyond anything I can imagine Al Qaeda hanging out
[37:56.640 --> 38:01.840]  with John McCain and then chewing on hearts two months later and firing chemical weapons
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.720]  and then Kerry I watched the video before I did the nightly news last night and I watched
[38:07.720 --> 38:12.120]  it and I watched the seven minute press conference the White House has got another one coming
[38:12.120 --> 38:21.880]  up today and I got so enraged I couldn't I mean I had to actually and I don't ever do
[38:21.880 --> 38:25.920]  this folks I had to actually go in my office is for yelling just so I wouldn't break something
[38:25.920 --> 38:29.440]  and I psychoanalyzed why I got so upset it's because I realized this could be World War
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.800]  III we've got a bunch of madmen in control and we haven't done enough to stop them these
[38:33.800 --> 38:37.600]  globalists are madmen they're gonna cause World War III because out of the crisis they
[38:37.600 --> 38:42.560]  can get control but I finally realized what made me sick it was that ugly Botox head that
[38:42.560 --> 38:50.160]  giant deformed looks like alien head of that piece of garbage anti-American anti-gun anti-family
[38:50.160 --> 38:58.520]  banker bailout derivatives pushing scam artist scumbag black widow male black widow on record
[38:58.520 --> 39:04.040]  John Kerry these people are like cancers they just never get out of our lives saying I want
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.800]  you to go watch those videos because they're painful he has this sick look in his eye and
[39:08.800 --> 39:12.240]  he knows that other people aren't psychopaths like him and he can use the pain of those
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.800]  kids that to sell a much more giant war and then it clicked while I was so upset I know
[39:17.800 --> 39:21.080]  the State Department when the Pentagon doesn't like something because the Pentagon's been
[39:21.080 --> 39:25.200]  bucking this and they've been not getting congressional approval they've been doing
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.360]  with other governments and NATO that it's the State Department that's running this and
[39:30.360 --> 39:36.320]  it all clicked I'm upset because that's the guy that gave the order for the chemical attack
[39:36.320 --> 39:43.920]  how absurdist is that and sick on TV using the dead kids to launch an even bigger war
[39:43.920 --> 39:52.240]  that's why I became physically ill I want to talk to current serving military personnel
[39:52.240 --> 40:02.200]  what do you think about this evil 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 I want to get your take on what
[40:02.200 --> 40:06.800]  I just said is anything I've said not true I mean plus you don't just believe me if you're
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.240]  a regular listener just everything I said I just gave you the headlines Washington Post
[40:11.240 --> 40:16.400]  new polls Syria intervention even less popular than Congress 9% approval rating scientific
[40:16.400 --> 40:23.120]  poll boom there's that article Israeli gas mass distribution ramps up amid Syrian escalation
[40:23.120 --> 40:30.680]  suspected chemical weapons use evidence Syria gas attack work of U.S. allies Dr. Jerome
[40:30.680 --> 40:37.400]  R. Corsi I mean that is so bold he's basically saying what we're saying it was basically run
[40:37.400 --> 40:44.480]  by the globalist run by Kerry unbelievable with the video to prove it Zawahiri the number
[40:44.480 --> 40:49.360]  one head of al Qaeda worldwide says the Syrian rebels Damascus first then Cairo then Jerusalem
[40:49.360 --> 40:57.800]  and salutes America the head of al Qaeda salutes America I had entered the twilight zone ladies
[40:57.800 --> 41:01.960]  and gentlemen and they know once the war starts and we're in a fight with the Russians the
[41:01.960 --> 41:08.720]  average American will turn their guns in they'll do whatever Obama says unbelievable inspectors
[41:08.720 --> 41:13.600]  in Syria forbidden from finding out who used chemical weapons only if they were used Wall
[41:13.600 --> 41:19.200]  Street Journal yeah yeah now they said that's what Kerry said didn't matter who did this
[41:19.200 --> 41:24.640]  because he knows he gave the order he's over the operation that's sculling bones brother
[41:24.640 --> 41:30.080]  that devil incarnate I mean this is more than I I can't even believe this how they're not
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.120]  even hiding any of it now I guess they've decided in the information age they just will
[41:34.120 --> 41:39.560]  do whatever they want here it is military strikes on Syria as early as Thursday U.S. officials
[41:39.560 --> 41:46.320]  say in B.C. Syria crisis Russia and China step up warning over strike meanwhile the
[41:46.320 --> 41:49.920]  globalists have already moved all their assets to China they're setting America up for a
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.800]  fall here this is the ultimate double cross Western war planes begin arriving in Cyprus
[41:55.800 --> 42:02.560]  zero hedge it's also in London Guardian but meanwhile that doesn't matter my elite Cyrus
[42:02.560 --> 42:07.720]  was humping on somebody on TV that's more important people are saying in the polls Syria
[42:07.720 --> 42:14.160]  strike doing days West tells opposition sources Reuters on and on U.S. to release report in
[42:14.160 --> 42:18.840]  coming days justifying Syrian strike president set to have a White House briefing today pushing
[42:18.840 --> 42:23.160]  it I mean ladies and gentlemen and by the way once they start a war with Syria they
[42:23.160 --> 42:29.200]  can shut up false flags and blame it on them and Iran and everybody'll say well Iran you
[42:29.200 --> 42:33.160]  know we better get behind the president this is this is how an imploding president with
[42:33.160 --> 42:39.720]  all these scandals the fast and furious the Benghazi the NSA gate all of it this is how
[42:39.720 --> 42:47.880]  this corrupt foreign coup this banker coup will keep control of America 8002599231 we're
[42:47.880 --> 42:53.600]  going to go to the active duty military that's calling in but first I want to go to a few
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.600]  clips here to remind you of what's happened before here is the Kuwaiti daughter of the
[42:58.600 --> 43:02.920]  ambassador who hadn't been to Kuwait since she was a baby here she is as a teenager they
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.920]  wouldn't even say what her name was putting out the lie the incubators that never happened
[43:06.920 --> 43:14.120]  then we'll show you how the media then spun the babies and then Wesley Clark the former
[43:14.120 --> 43:19.760]  head of NATO general admitting it was all a fraud let's go to the first clip our final
[43:19.760 --> 43:28.560]  witness is also using in some name and again we ask our friends in a media to respect the
[43:28.560 --> 43:34.920]  need to for her to protect these people are so criminal and we finally call on so criminal
[43:34.920 --> 43:41.480]  to testify so criminal volunteer volunteered at the Al-Adhan hospital with 12 other women
[43:41.480 --> 43:48.000]  who wanted to help as well I was the youngest volunteer other women were from 20 to 30 years
[43:48.000 --> 43:55.040]  old while I was there I saw the Iraqi soldiers coming to the hospital with guns they took
[43:55.040 --> 44:03.280]  the babies out of incubators the incubators and let the children to die on the cold floor
[44:03.280 --> 44:07.520]  all right that's enough and then in the next clip they go through all the lies and say
[44:07.520 --> 44:16.200]  they were bayonetting the pregnant women same thing Robert Rodriguez did with his machete
[44:16.200 --> 44:24.680]  movie where it shows the the the cowboys shooting pregnant Hispanics I mean it's it's war propaganda
[44:24.680 --> 44:30.080]  folks this is what propagandists do they wave the bloody shirt and they're doing it like
[44:30.080 --> 44:34.800]  you're an idiot the good news is here's my message the globalist you have a 9% approval
[44:34.800 --> 44:42.160]  rating in a major scientific poll 9% of people agree with you this shows you are a different
[44:42.160 --> 44:49.960]  group than America this shows we have a rogue criminal government the Pentagon by the way
[44:49.960 --> 44:54.760]  doesn't want to attack Syria and hasn't been liking what's going on and morale is at all-time
[44:54.760 --> 44:57.640]  loves so the run into the State Department remember when you see John Kerry up there
[44:57.640 --> 45:02.200]  folks that's who probably gave the order to release the nerve gas on the one-year anniversary
[45:02.200 --> 45:09.400]  of Obama saying that's the red line how sick is that you don't get that'd be like Jeffrey
[45:09.400 --> 45:12.720]  Dahmer having a press conference about kids missing in the neighborhood all he's got
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.600]  a barrel right next to him with a five-year-old in it I mean I mean this is just over the
[45:17.600 --> 45:23.200]  top man reality is so insane now let's go to them hyping this up then we'll go to Max
[45:23.200 --> 45:28.560]  and Steve and others active duty let's let's go to the clip then after she gave the testimony
[45:28.560 --> 45:37.920]  of why we had to attack Iraq in 2003 but before this in 1990 they took the babies out of incubators
[45:37.920 --> 45:49.320]  and carries like they nerve gas the children how these animals can commit such barbaric
[45:49.320 --> 45:54.920]  and inhuman act this woman's almost laughing that these acts ever took place that lie premature
[45:54.920 --> 46:09.080]  infants in incubators were sentenced to die by having the incubators removed the hardest
[46:09.080 --> 46:23.760]  thing was burying the babies I myself buried 14 newborn babies that had been taken from
[46:23.760 --> 46:30.560]  their incubators now is the time to check the aggression of this ruthless dictator whose
[46:30.560 --> 46:36.640]  troops have bayoneted pregnant women and have ripped babies from their incubators in Kuwait
[46:36.640 --> 46:41.600]  I cannot help but think of my nephew who's more premature might have died that day as
[46:41.600 --> 46:47.240]  well they had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so the Kuwait
[46:47.240 --> 46:52.960]  could be systematically dismantled all right folks turned out that was a complete lie and
[46:52.960 --> 46:59.960]  over 5 million Iraqis died over a million of them from military connected events that's
[46:59.960 --> 47:06.760]  the British Medical Journal 500,000 children by 1997 had already starved or died that is
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.280]  Malin Albright admitting that saying it was quote a good price to pay but look can you
[47:10.280 --> 47:14.080]  find her saying that folks that don't believe me just search YouTube about Malin Albright
[47:14.080 --> 47:19.760]  500,000 that Iraqi children and it'll come up for you good price to pay by the way the
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.640]  Esquire magazine didn't believe me when I told him that then they wouldn't found it or
[47:23.640 --> 47:28.880]  like oh my gosh it's like 500,000 kids at its like a pothole no big deal you know it's
[47:28.880 --> 47:32.920]  like getting your windshield cracked it's no big deal oh but the children in Syria they
[47:32.920 --> 47:36.600]  got nerve gas now in the case of the incubators it didn't happen in the case of the nerve
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.960]  gas kids oh it happened and they're like hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola
[47:40.960 --> 47:44.200]  hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hola hold on the
[47:44.200 --> 47:51.680]  shooting the missiles off on their official YouTube channels and singing we love Obama.
[47:51.680 --> 47:55.000]  There's videos of this, we're putting them together for the Obama deception, just dancing
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.400]  around Obama we love you.
[48:00.400 --> 48:03.240]  You cannot make up stuff this weird.
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.800]  Now I'm going to go to some phone calls and then we're going to get into the other video
[48:07.800 --> 48:08.800]  clips of war propaganda.
[48:08.800 --> 48:11.000]  Let's get to one more before I go to the calls.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.200]  Here is Wesley Clark on the seven nation hit list where they bring him in and go, yeah
[48:16.200 --> 48:18.680]  here's the countries we're going to hit and we're going to make stuff up to do it.
[48:18.680 --> 48:19.840]  Here's that clip.
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.480]  I went through the Pentagon 10 days after 9-11 and an officer from the joint staff called
[48:24.480 --> 48:29.760]  me into his office and said I want you to know he said sir we're going to attack Iraq
[48:29.760 --> 48:31.520]  and I said why?
[48:31.520 --> 48:36.640]  He said we don't know and then I came back to the Pentagon about six weeks later I saw
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.480]  the same officer I said why haven't we attacked Iraq we're still going to attack Iraq he said
[48:41.480 --> 48:44.900]  oh sir he says it's worse than that because I just got this memo from the Secretary of
[48:44.900 --> 48:49.120]  Defense's office that says we're going to attack and destroy the governments in seven
[48:49.120 --> 48:50.120]  countries.
[48:50.120 --> 48:51.440]  This was before 9-11 by the way.
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.160]  We're going to start with Iraq and then we're going to move to Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia,
[48:56.160 --> 48:58.840]  Sudan and Iran.
[48:58.840 --> 49:00.720]  And they use Al Qaeda to do it.
[49:00.720 --> 49:05.040]  Let's go to Max in Wisconsin active military or you army Marines and then we're going
[49:05.040 --> 49:08.480]  to go to Steve and others that are holding what's your take on this Max?
[49:08.480 --> 49:16.200]  Hello Mr. Jones I was wondering if you'd like to know how to stop this situation in Syria.
[49:16.200 --> 49:19.720]  Well yeah have sanity prevail and have the American people stop the globalist I mean
[49:19.720 --> 49:21.440]  what's your take on it?
[49:21.440 --> 49:27.520]  Okay well like in Serbia when they did mortar attacks in the northern Croatian border they
[49:27.520 --> 49:33.800]  have to provide targeting systems and GPS coordinates to be a satellite.
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.560]  That's right so they have GPS jammers and the Russians reportedly have those.
[49:37.560 --> 49:42.720]  The same thing will be going on in Syria right now if you find the corporate company that's
[49:42.720 --> 49:49.680]  probably has connections to an American company or another company such as L3 communications
[49:49.680 --> 49:55.640]  or such MPRI companies like that you can probably backlog that back to the state.
[49:55.640 --> 50:00.520]  Yeah we have a lot of people calling in saying track the contractors and when they're actually
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.240]  the contracts in the last two years have been going on assisting the rebels I want my reporters
[50:05.240 --> 50:08.680]  to look into that and do some reports I've seen that but no they've been moving all sorts
[50:08.680 --> 50:13.280]  of even heavy equipment in not just things like that I mean is there any way to unjam
[50:13.280 --> 50:17.000]  when the Russians jam?
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.680]  Well it's not jamming it's more providing for the chemical attack they use mortars right?
[50:22.680 --> 50:23.680]  Yes.
[50:23.680 --> 50:28.640]  So in order to launch those mortars especially with chemical warfare you have to be very
[50:28.640 --> 50:34.440]  accurate and the rebels themselves cannot provide such accuracy so that must be done
[50:34.440 --> 50:35.440]  to their party.
[50:35.440 --> 50:36.440]  No no no I got your point.
[50:36.440 --> 50:39.120]  No exactly the State Department is directing all this so yeah man I'm sure Kerry probably
[50:39.120 --> 50:42.520]  sat around in his office with the coordinates so we're going to hit this area it's a civilian
[50:42.520 --> 50:45.920]  area that will be used but stay there I want to come back to you I mean you can just see
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.080]  Kerry in there with the computer screens picking the targets probably that's who does that
[50:50.080 --> 50:52.920]  and then he can go out and give you a speech about it after he killed all those kids.
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.320]  I'll say it he's the prime suspect I believe John Kerry murdered the children.
[50:56.320 --> 51:01.120]  Well they're right back sir I'm going to come back to you Max and then Stephen.

[53:58.240 --> 54:05.520]  Berkey guy all right folks we're back live you know when I talk to active duty though
[54:05.520 --> 54:09.440]  they'll never even talk about what they're doing because they don't end up like Bradley
[54:09.440 --> 54:13.280]  Manning I get that but then they go too far because they're just like I would look in
[54:13.280 --> 54:19.320]  this general area at the L3 systems used to target these things and look at the contracts
[54:19.320 --> 54:22.640]  instead of just saying hey these groups are over there aiding the rebels that's actually
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.840]  come out in the news I just want your perspective as active duty about what does it feel like
[54:27.840 --> 54:32.520]  to be in a military run by foreign banks in an occupied America trying to start war with
[54:32.520 --> 54:38.560]  Russia aiding Al Qaeda and then going well Assad's a bad guy no he's not compared he
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.400]  was democratizing the country they don't want free countries over there they're gonna put
[54:42.400 --> 54:48.360]  jihad he's in to run around murdering everybody so so max specifically it's on record there
[54:48.360 --> 54:57.120]  are CIA commandos MI6 SAS you name it actually leading different brigades of the scum that's
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.680]  over there these martyrs brigades so that's actually come out in the news I wonder how
[55:02.680 --> 55:08.320]  those people feel being part of this and I wonder how the Obama folks think they're
[55:08.320 --> 55:13.440]  gonna cover this up your take on that max and then we'll go to Steven well I agree
[55:13.440 --> 55:20.840]  with you I wish that I could provide more specifics but these are shadowy groups and
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.800]  agencies and corporations are always changing up their names and using the bureaucracy kind
[55:25.800 --> 55:31.720]  of against us and they think they're using contractors or commandos the other oh they're
[55:31.720 --> 55:39.040]  using both but the ones for the communication Intel is most likely a corporate entity that
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.880]  was sent in there for some sort of other reason in order to ride like a cover because they
[55:44.880 --> 55:48.640]  know it's pretty sophisticated stuff sure sure let me ask you this question I know both
[55:48.640 --> 55:53.600]  are in there but I'm saying aiding them up front with a chemical attack I mean I wouldn't
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.200]  want to be the people helping the rebels launch a chemical attack those people are all gonna
[55:57.200 --> 56:04.200]  get killed I mean how dumb are they let's just say they're cut from a different cloth
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.520]  and they believe in a different God than we do and they worship a different entity than
[56:08.520 --> 56:14.680]  we do and frankly I'm sick of the blood sick of the bloodshed children's are not we all
[56:14.680 --> 56:19.880]  deserve a better lifestyle that's all I can say do you think Obama will get away with
[56:19.880 --> 56:26.880]  attacking Syria to aid Al Qaeda openly it's if we let them it's off to us it's the same
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.800]  thing with Serbia that was the first time it was whites killing whites I don't mean
[56:31.800 --> 56:39.360]  that racially but we let it happen and you know you can pick a war if the American people
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.640]  let it happen and let the blood be on their hands depends on how much soap how much gojo
[56:44.640 --> 56:49.600]  they're gonna use to try to wash it off but it seems like we're already pretty much just
[56:49.600 --> 56:54.920]  1000 soap and this blood of civilians that we don't even know the numbers how many well
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.200]  it's just crazy to be aiding Al Qaeda when they're gonna wreck the whole place I appreciate
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.920]  your call let's talk to Steven in California active duty Marine Steven what is your take
[57:02.920 --> 57:06.400]  on this and what are people saying around you I'm gonna get the sense of the military
[57:06.400 --> 57:11.720]  are they getting what's happening here it's a pleasure to be on the show I would thank
[57:11.720 --> 57:16.520]  you for having me thank you yeah I'm not to be a Marine over here Marine Corps Air Station
[57:16.520 --> 57:22.760]  Miramar in San Diego I most of the military like the younger guys don't really they don't
[57:22.760 --> 57:26.160]  pay attention to much what's going on you know they're too busy you know trying to be
[57:26.160 --> 57:29.960]  a Marine and stuff I that's the way I feel it is I said the higher ups you tell them
[57:29.960 --> 57:34.120]  about it I try to tell them about it I say hey do you guys know who I was Jones is you
[57:34.120 --> 57:38.440]  know he's a he's you know he's a he's a patriot you know you guys should listen to him he has
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.840]  a lot of good points of what's going on you know people people just kind of like kind
[57:42.840 --> 57:46.040]  of don't know who you are and then the people they do know who you are they're really good
[57:46.040 --> 57:51.880]  to go I'm not surprised that they're gonna try to go it can go after Syria now and install
[57:51.880 --> 57:56.680]  off stage well I gotta say now I guess that's out at the Navy SEAL base there I've got to
[57:56.680 --> 58:01.240]  say the Navy and I've said this before is the least awake group I run into the Army
[58:01.240 --> 58:08.000]  it's over half Marines a lot of times about 30 40% but not but yeah some of the younger
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.960]  folks don't know what's going on but you're saying when you do talk people who do listen
[58:11.960 --> 58:15.560]  to show they're aware I mean look when WorldNet Daily's covering this they're in trouble
[58:15.560 --> 58:20.920]  now this is all starting to come out anything else you'd like to add Steven you know honestly
[58:20.920 --> 58:23.800]  Alex you know I've been trying I've been trying to call into your show for a while I've been

[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.120]  Kerry Club it's on the computer from the State Department briefing I want to show that going
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.640]  back to a Steven who is a Marine stationed out in Southern California they're in San
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:30.720]  Diego you wanted to make some points go ahead I think so yeah I wouldn't I want to bring
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.600]  up the fact you know I'm not I'm not surprised that the you know that the military is doing
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.480]  because the Marine Corps and specifically I can only speak for the Marine Corps they're
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.000]  really they're really shady you know regarding especially suicide you know I had on my best
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.360]  friend Jeffrey again PFC PFC again he died April 24 2009 committed suicide in the barracks
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.920]  and when I was at the duty you know he's my best friend you know he committed suicide
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.440]  and they forced my staff and CEO made me go in his room and inventory his stuff and take
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.600]  all this furniture out of his room because I was always working for the barracks manager
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.560]  at the time you know the Marine Corps like I've seen personally you know I've seen the
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.840]  Marine Corps do shady stuff you know and it was really terrible you know I had to go
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.200]  through that well that's putting it lightly the Marine Corps for over a hundred years
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:26.840]  has overthrown more than 80 governments Smedley Butler himself over helped overthrow six and
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.160]  he wrote a book called war is a racket two times congressional medal of honor winner
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.880]  he was in line to be the command on the Marine Corps but he refused it because he was offered
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.040]  that job to be part of a coup d'etat against America and he would be called a traitor by
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.160]  the foreign banks know he's a patriot and of course I mean now the military is in the
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.360]  hands of the globalist the average military person after they're out is the number one
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.840]  enemy of the globalist because you've been trained to be a killer but you don't work
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:57.120]  for them now so the military better wake up and defend the republic and decide what side

[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:29.000]  and gentlemen thank you for joining us we are on the verge of what could be world war
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.520]  three as dr. Jerome course he said yesterday and as a many top analysts are now saying
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:39.480]  the russians and the chinese are now threatening nato saying if you strike them there will
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:46.360]  be repercussions there are russian troops piling off ships right now into syria and
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:51.600]  russian civilians are being evacuated NBC news is announcing that they plan to start bombing
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.340]  as early as thursday or friday lap and thursday or friday the washington post has the headline
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:05.000]  from a reuters poll scientific only nine percent of respondents said they believed
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:12.680]  that the u.s. military should respond to what's happening in syria and the vast majority also
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.400]  do not believe that the syrian government launched a chemical attack yeah because it
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:23.180]  goes against logic and we've caught them in these lies over and over again and no one
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:29.160]  believes a word obama says now here's my issue when kerry gets up and says it doesn't matter
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.080]  we're going to play this clip coming up says it doesn't matter who did it that's also the
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:39.000]  wall street journal we've got to go in because the chemicals have been used it's incredible
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.520]  well there are videos up on worldnetdaily.com we have it linked on info wars dot com right
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.520]  now and worldnetdaily has the arab speakers to break it down we've checked it it's how
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.960]  it translates they're up there with the mortars firing them this is unprecedented here's the
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:04.080]  headline syria gas attack work of u.s. allies dr. Jerome coursey very respected person
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.440]  of course phd harvard university political science bestselling new york times bestselling
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.640]  author of unfit for command and so many other amazing books worked as a consultant at the
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.120]  highest levels of national security i'll just leave it at that i know large areas of the
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.000]  pentagon know this is a pure evil what's about to happen and the russians will probably
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.960]  respond so i want to give him the floor we only got him for this segment dr. coursey
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:37.000]  how big is this that that they're doing this and that they don't have support bush had
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.400]  seventy two percent in gallup polls and pew at seventy two in two thousand and three i
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.960]  think this is the total collapse of credibility but it's kind of like hitler wasn't supported
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.280]  at the end either but he was still in control of the rike what are we seeing here and break
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:00.000]  down this bombshell well and first of all alex the article we got running on worldnetdailywnd.com
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.400]  right now as you say we went i went yesterday and researched check with the arabic speaking
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:13.560]  sources while each of us who helped write the article are there's numerous videos on
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:21.280]  the internet and in the arabic speaking world that make it clear the rebels are the ones
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.760]  who have launched the sarin gas attacks not the Assad government now the Assad government
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.200]  is not a great government i miss it's there's no good guys in syria but the point is the
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.200]  truth is the truth and i think the attempt by the obama administration which now appears
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.320]  to be the second time the obama administration has tried this there was the narrative being
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.840]  run out of the white house back in may that the Assad government was launching chemical
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:56.760]  attacks but the problem is that there's no validation of it there's no hard proof john
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:03.520]  carrey secretary of state said yesterday he has indisputable proof well let's see it why
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:11.360]  don't we see this proof it's not there even the united nations going back to may doubted
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.440]  very seriously that the Assad regime as bad as it is was going to use sarin gas attacks
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.920]  as you said it doesn't does not make any sense why when the Assad government's winning would
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:30.920]  it resort to sarin gas attacks and with video after video with testimony after testimony
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:37.840]  coming out of the era of world in syria it's widely known that it's the rebels which are
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:46.920]  you know a group of al-qaeda muslim brotherhood ragtag radicals that are opposing the regime
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:53.120]  and the obama administration supporting these are not good guys and to think that they wouldn't
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:59.040]  use sarin gas attacks stretches the imagination especially when we have pictures of the sarin
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:05.520]  gas arsenals with the gas and the other chemicals coming from saudi arabia i mean it seems to
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.800]  me that um if the obama administration administration is going to go to war on syria which is what
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:18.600]  this means a very massive step i mean i can't emphasize to people listening how much we
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:25.760]  are on the verge here of world war three russia and china not going to sit by obama thinks
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.600]  he can wag the dog get attention off of his other problems or you know run a false flag
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:39.520]  here it isn't going to fly with russia and china saying to obama you don't have the evidence
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:49.080]  and we're not going to tolerate a military attack that's it that's the very very frightening
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:56.840]  moment in u.s. and in world history very very succinctly said dr. coursey i want to break
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.800]  something down for my blisters and viewers out there you have never talked like this
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:07.880]  in the decade that i've been interviewing you or more and i've talked to a lot of other
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:14.040]  top people on and off air about this colonel shafer is one of them but many others off
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:20.240]  record and they all are saying exactly what you're saying and it's so transparent how
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.000]  does obama think he's going to get away with this well again i think obama administration
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.400]  has gotten to the point where they think they can lie with impunity certainly that's what
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:34.480]  this appears to be and you know alex i don't think we've been in a more critical moment
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:40.560]  since the cuban missile crisis now the cuban missile crisis jack kennedy had photographs
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:46.760]  of the missiles from u2 flights over cuba and jack kennedy showed those to the world
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:52.760]  he went to the united nations and he said here's the pictures of the missiles in cuba obama
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:59.400]  has not done that obama has not presented to the american people or to the un his evidence
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:05.880]  of the Assad regime being involved in the sarin gas attacks and you've got Assad denying
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:11.600]  it got russia denying it you've got china denying it all of them with logic on their
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:19.200]  side and we've published at w&d the videos where you can see with your own eyes the terrorists
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:25.600]  the rebels the forces obama supporting being the culprits in the gas attacks absolutely
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.120]  and we're linked to that article as well and mirrored at info wars dot com it's very important
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.120]  that people get all the articles that are coming out at w&d dot com drudge report dot
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:42.160]  com info wars dot com and get those out to everybody and i'm very sad to see some of
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.320]  the mainline conservative talk radio saying well i don't like us a sod or i don't like
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.880]  the rebels either but i don't like obama but we got to get behind this i think obama is
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.480]  gambling that if they can start the war and then undoubtedly they've got russian anti
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.360]  aircraft missiles russian anti ship missiles you will see americans die probably in large
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.000]  numbers they think americans are going to get behind this i don't think that's the case
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.920]  because usually going into one of these they've got over seventy percent they've got nine
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:14.040]  percent approval rating i think this is one of the most historic things to ever happen
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:20.360]  to the globalist i believe we've seen a collapse in their con game here and that the fact that
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:26.280]  the rebels had to launch this because they're losing the war the al-qaeda rebels shows desperation
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:32.280]  on so many fronts dr coursey what does this poll number signify and is there any way for
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:38.720]  obama and his kleptocratic wing to back off out of this or will they really try to commit
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:43.160]  us to world war three what are your sources saying i want to make a couple of points one
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:50.120]  first of all people gotta realize that you know russia and china are not borrowing a trillion
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:57.000]  dollars a year to make their budget we are we're in a vastly weakened economic position
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.280]  and the world knows it secondly where american public opinion is right now is not in favor
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:10.880]  of a military action and i don't see it changing quickly now when the let's say we have a cruise
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:17.560]  missile attack or we have a bomber attack over syria if we get involved in a shooting
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:24.760]  war not just with syria but with russia with russia and china the ramifications of that
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:32.400]  are unpredictable and unpredictably frightening because if russia and china say the united
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:39.000]  states you can't sustain a war economically and you're on the wrong side here and if russia
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.320]  and china stand behind Assad which they are doing we are moving we're escalating the whole
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.960]  conflict beyond the level of surrogates into where we're risking a direct confrontation
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.160]  with russia certainly with russia and giving them the moral high ground which history shows
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:03.680]  you cannot win a immoral war long term well where is you know at least with jack kennedy
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:09.080]  the white house he said adlai stevens and it was the u n ambassador to the u n and he showed
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.640]  the pictures of the missiles in cuba today we don't have a single thing by the way they're
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.040]  coming out with this new dossier but i expect that to be more you know phony baloney as
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.240]  well what are you expecting remember we've had we've gone through this the the left
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.440]  is the publicity here is amazing to me when it was george w boys saying there were weapons
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.840]  of mass destruction in iraq the left john carrey rock obama were all over the issue
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:42.040]  saying it was a lie and now you've got obama and carrey using the same lie to advance what
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.080]  could end up being another phony pretext for a phony war i think the american people are
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.240]  can see through this sure we got one minute left bottom line what do you expect to happen
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.960]  in your gut my gut is that the obama administration so far out in the limb they're going to attack
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.680]  and we're going to come to the edge of world war three unfortunately i agree with you i
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.040]  hope everybody's saying their prayers for their children tonight and grand people better
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.560]  understand how serious this is it's been one of the most serious serious moments in world
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.160]  history that we have ever faced and they're all doing it because these power mad control
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.440]  freaks that run washington think they're invincible and obama does not want us talking
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:27.400]  about the irs scandal with the tea party groups or the nsa eavesdropping on ben gazi or ben
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:32.000]  gazi or the fact that we're again out of money and spending another trillion dollars we don't
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.160]  have another control budget obama doesn't want these topics doctor we're going to have

[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.880]  he just talked about but also looking at major threats to humanity and why the elite is so
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:48.280]  eric at the technocracy we have scheduled for the balance of the hour dr. noel scharke
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:57.880]  who is a phd professor of artificial intelligence and robotics and a professor of public engagement
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.840]  at the university of sheffield department of computer science and journal editor he has
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:09.480]  held a number of research positions at the uk and asics and sheffield and also at yale
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:15.640]  and stanford and i'm not going to go over all of his bio but he's one of the top professors
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:21.000]  looking at the merger of man and machine the technocracy all the things that are happening
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.600]  a lot of governments are now listening to him he has the campaign to stop killer robots
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:33.160]  as it's known professor says robots to patrol cities what is your id number what are you
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:39.360]  doing here that's the headline by paul watson he also wrote the paper big robot is watching
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.000]  you report on the future of robots for policing surveillance and security by professor noel
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.640]  scharke and he joins us with the balance of the hour we really appreciate him coming on
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:55.640]  today because i wanted people to really think about as humans we better decide the future
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:01.760]  of our development collectively and through free thinking ideas and renaissance not through
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.680]  the military industrial complex worldwide that eisenhower warned of that was already
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:13.040]  deciding our our journey when he gave that speech in 1961 and he said it's the technological
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:18.160]  elitist speech running man who a lot of them are you genesis and pretty anti-human and
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.680]  they think the computers are better than us if you look at what they put out so we've
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.880]  got him on and i just think people should know about this and he was already scheduled
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.680]  last week i appreciate him coming on and being cut a little bit short because of the horrible
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.640]  serious situation but this is very important as well we got a long segment coming up this
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:39.600]  is a short segment dr scharke we're very honored to have you here with us in a nutshell what
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:45.320]  are we what are we facing what are we what are we dealing with here sir well hi alex
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.880]  it's great to be back on the show again that's an honor as well thank you for that well we're
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.480]  facing all sorts of things the main there's a lot of a lot of bad things that could happen
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.960]  but one of the worst is really for me is the use by the military of autonomous weapons
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:08.320]  and or robots and what we mean by that and in simple terms is simply a weapon that once
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:15.440]  it's been launched can select its own targets and kill them without further human intervention
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:23.520]  and that to me is a very very scary thought and even last year the u.s. air force already
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:29.360]  launched an autonomous drone and i know the uk has already as well yes that's right there's
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:35.280]  the x-47 b which is the united states one and they've got they're fairly advanced in
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.680]  testing it can leave an aircraft carrier land on an aircraft carrier and there was a lot
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:46.440]  of bravo about what it was going to do in the pacific but since our campaign has started
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.160]  they're starting to say things like yeah there's going to be a human supervising it if it's
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:58.480]  used for attacks continue doctor oh sorry so they're saying there's going to be a human
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.000]  supervising it but they're not being clear about what they mean by human supervising
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.840]  it i've heard your dan quaylor from your congressional committee for unmanned systems the congressional
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:14.640]  caucus saying that for instance that there'll always be somebody super there'll always be
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:20.320]  somebody on the loop to program it and that does not fill me with joy i must say because
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:26.520]  the idea of a weapon system going off and finding its own targets at the minute is ridiculous
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:34.040]  because there's no way that a robot can discriminate between a child and a soldier at the moment
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.600]  let me put it in perspective just this week there's been an announcement for a massive
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.960]  european project okay seven million euros that's about i don't know what that is eight
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:49.520]  and a half million dollars and what the project is six big universities all specialists in
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.800]  robotics and what they're going to be working over the next five years is finding a system
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.720]  a robot that can tell the difference between an old person lying on the ground collapsed
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:08.520]  and a duffle bag that's how advanced we are so if that's the case how could you possibly
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:14.040]  be contemplating sending these things into the theater of war it's absurd to me and morally
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:21.960]  outrageous absolutely plus the reason i wanted to get you on the the big issue for me is
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.880]  that the technocrats act like they're not even human they're basically inbred psychopaths
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:30.080]  so they're not really even human we see them throughout history Stalin Hitler all these
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.240]  people they want machines because they'll follow orders soldiers could say no to immoral
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.880]  orders i want to talk about the nuremberg question here of just following orders you
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.080]  know will we execute robots or we execute people that build the killer robots stay with

[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:39.880]  intelligence and robotics who has done research projects at yale and stanford boys stanford
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:45.400]  research institutes the real real top of the pyramid he joins us from england and where
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:52.320]  the watsons are from their beautiful sheffield robin hoodland what about the issue of not
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.360]  just the robots getting out of control but the pentagon zone plan to get rid of all
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:02.960]  combat troops all combat aircraft have it all just programmed and then have technicians
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.240]  on floating fortresses they say they're going away from aircraft carriers to more like giant
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:15.440]  1984 equivalent of oil rig cities that are basically autonomous robot bases the robot
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:20.440]  factories back on the mainland are built by robots you have technicians already most
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.040]  ai people say they don't even know how the computers work different experts have to
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:30.080]  come together i mean aren't we losing our humanity through this and and and and what
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.960]  would happen with old nuremberg thing of just following orders doesn't cut it we already
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.600]  had the military saying no to a lot of attacks today and stopping bush and then now obama
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:45.480]  from launching bigger wars that's come out what about once it's 90% autonomous robots
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:51.680]  i mean isn't this like attack of the clones or something doctor yeah you're exactly right
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.480]  there i mean i i don't go as far into the future as you with what you're saying i think
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:02.360]  that that part of that is a kind of us military complex fantasy to be honest with a lot of
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.960]  saber rattling and what you're going to get is a lot of failed systems and that's going
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:12.520]  to be disastrous for your country really but in terms of the a dictatorship or some sort
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:18.440]  of authoritarian regime well you imagine the the arab spring in egypt the soldiers refuse
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:24.520]  to fire gadafi soldiers refuse to fire autonomous robots are not going to refuse to fire and
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:28.520]  anybody are they they just do with them would you program them to do so if you're an evil
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:35.040]  dictator all you need to a bunch of very loyal henchmen who are programmers and you're away
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.440]  you're going to be able to kill people left right and center particularly if you're not
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:43.600]  very moral like surya at the moment and you're not really concerned about civilians that's
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:48.400]  a perfect place for robots at the moment i hate to say that and i don't want to put ideas
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:54.160]  into a sad said but that would be the ideal thing for him would just have robots slaughtering
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:59.480]  everybody and it wouldn't be that hard when you're not worried about the morality break
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:03.600]  that down some of the systems is not just drones you're right about they've got they've
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:10.000]  got drone tanks drone cars drone submarines uh uh uh uh swords they've got the eater as
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:18.440]  it's called uh that like each dead people to fuel itself that's we just lost his audio
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440]  Go ahead, Dr.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.480]  It's all right, we'll get you reconnected skype's wonderful, but sometimes it has problems
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.700]  I want him to break down really when when when he gives these big
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.240]  Conferences to governments you name it
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.040]  What their concerns are because the good news is
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.240]  That there are people in the system as well
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  That that are concerned
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:49.320]  Sir, you were telling my producer that the good news is a lot of people in government are concerned
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:54.280]  But then also want to get into some of the systems that are being developed. Yeah, you've got the floor. I mean give us a briefing
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.600]  Okay, well, let me tell you a bit of a story then at last year
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:05.440]  Oh, we we started this international committee for Robert arms control a small group of four of this international in
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:11.240]  2009 there are 26 of us now professionals and we're an NGO now
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:18.920]  And what happened was last year human rights watch came to see me in Sheffield and to discuss the issues and they decided to
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.520]  Along with art the great article 36 a British NGO
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.080]  They decided to work with us and start a campaign and the Nobel women's initiative
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.080]  So lots of Nobel Peace Prize winners there
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:33.840]  And so we got together human rights watch in
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:40.440]  November last year wrote a report called losing humanity the case against killer robots
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:46.320]  I advised them on that and that started getting governments talking a little bit the US at least
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:50.280]  Because before that we could not get any international discussion at all
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:56.640]  But human rights watch is big so they managed to do something the Department of Defense three days later
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:04.040]  Issued guidelines for the development of autonomous weapons saying they'd always be supervised in some sort of way
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.960]  And I'll get into that a little bit more in a few minutes of you like about what they're planning
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:10.960]  So after that
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:19.880]  We got together in New York after that and then we launched a campaign from the UK in in April the 23rd this year
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:26.320]  And that was very successful launch for campaign. We've got over 40 NGOs including Amnesty International
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.040]  Real biggies and so we're really pushing governments now
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.760]  But you know, so it started them chattering a bit which they weren't doing it all before
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:41.600]  And let me just take a digression here for one second and tell you why it's very very important to me that
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.960]  Governments talk to each other
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:50.640]  Because what they're not thinking about the United States in particular and I must say that I love the United States
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.960]  I've lived there, but you know, one of the problems for me is it's extremely blinkered
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:00.640]  It thinks it's the only technological country in the world will come up with a technological solution
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.240]  They did the same with the atomic bomb. They didn't really think the Russians were going to get it so quickly
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:11.240]  So they come up with these brilliant developments. They're very creative and then everybody else in the world copies them
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:16.480]  And they think that they're going to build these autonomous robots and they want to send swarms of them out
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:22.040]  It's force multiplication. They call it. So the idea is to use swarms of them to beat their enemy
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:29.080]  But their enemy are going to have them China developing them Russia developing them Israel are developing and the UK are developing them
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:35.520]  Everybody will have them if we carry on like this and the one thing that nobody knows nobody on this planet knows
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.360]  If you've got hidden secret programs
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.000]  Strategic programs for fighting when those robots meet each other
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:49.360]  Nobody knows what the hell is going to happen. Anything could happen. I can't predict it. So that's a real worry
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:57.840]  Now the good news for us was that Christof Haines who's the special rapporteur for extra judicial killings for the United Nations
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:05.000]  Wrote a report. We all talked to him about it and discussed it with him and he presented that report to the United Nations in
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:13.240]  May the 29th this year and that report is calling for a complete moratorium throughout the world on the
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:17.000]  development of lethal autonomous robots now
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:17.880]  That's great news
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:23.040]  But of course all the governments now like the UK have been debating it in Parliament and the House of Lords
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:30.360]  The United States have been developing it France has been debating it 24 countries showed up to debate it
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.160]  But the big nations are saying well, of course, you're right
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:40.920]  These can't these can't work with international humanitarian law that they can't comply. You're right. They can't discriminate and things yet
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.400]  So we're going to make sure they're supervised
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.940]  But now the big question that comes up and it's a depressing question is what do they mean by
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:55.940]  Supervised do they mean some guy presses a button and stands there watching it while it kills people do they mean?
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:01.540]  It's like the Patriot missile which gives you 10 seconds to veto it if it finds a target
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:02.860]  That's not what we want
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:09.260]  We want proper meaningful human supervision of all technology that is going to kill people
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:13.060]  I better let you have a word there Alex. No, it's true. It's true
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:18.860]  Oh, I don't shut up then I'll never shut up so I can either shut up completely or just sit back and listen to your or have
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.100]  So many points. I'll just be interjecting. We were just showing an Air Force
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:28.180]  We were just showing an Air Force training video of a drone flying over and spilling out
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:31.580]  It was a futuristic projection about you baby killer drones
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:38.420]  And then they already admit in Department of Homeland Security training drone videos. It shows them targeting American gun owners
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:47.380]  So so they're already fantasizing so all these cowardly government people can just send out a bunch of little, you know
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:49.780]  Foot long or half foot long
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:55.740]  Robots with with nerve gas in them or with hang grenade. They throw at you or with a you know with
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:01.140]  357 Magnum mounted in it or a shotgun to kill us and and and so it's just a bunch of bureaucrats
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:03.660]  fantasizing because robotics has gotten cheaper
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:09.740]  Weaponizing everything in in just an orgy of evil and I'm so sick of it
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:15.100]  How about real conventions and and just like we've done with chemical weapons biological weapons nuclear weapons
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:20.660]  How about we have conventions and use Isaac Asimov's first rule of robotics that you can have no
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:26.940]  Robotic system that can do harm because obviously once you allow this out of the out of the box
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:33.900]  It's going to move towards a singularity with the entire architecture of the entire robotic development system
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:39.540]  Not like NASA where so much technology came out of it to make our lives better because it wasn't warlike now
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:47.220]  Everything's warlike so everything has a basic architecture for war and the computers that may become AI someday or the expert tell us
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:53.220]  We think that'll happen. We'll fundamentally have been engineered to kill so I mean it just sounds like the worst-case scenario
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.180]  I
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:59.580]  Think one thing you're right there as a most first law, which is the only law you can really apply a
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.100]  Robot must not harm a human
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.820]  That's that that would to me would be a perfect rule
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:08.500]  Now what we're trying to do and as you know, I'm a professor of robotics
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.980]  But I've now become an activist because of this having never been an activist in my life before
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:19.740]  But the the problem is that what we're trying to get done here and I've got really good people with me the people working with me on this
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:25.860]  Campaign are the people who got cluster munitions banned the people who got landmines banned
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:31.060]  And what we're trying to do is get a new international treaty to ban the kill function
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:37.620]  We don't ban autonomous robots. They can be used for monitoring, you know global climate change and a lot of useful things
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:42.780]  But we want no robots ever ever to decide to kill a human
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:48.820]  That should just be written into the the statement that goes in the sky in stone as it were sure like
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:54.900]  But one of the big worries another big worry of mine that you've just pointed to is this sort of idea of using
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:47:01.220]  Robots in the civil world for policing and they talk about using them with non-lethal weapons
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:08.340]  Sure, there's no such a thing as a non-lethal weapon really if you look at the photographs of non-lethal weapons being applied
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:10.380]  I mean they mean people they don't kill them
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:15.620]  It's true most of the time but they mean them although tasers have killed a lot of people in the United States
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:17.740]  but the whole idea of this
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:25.620]  Creeping authoritarianism, I would call it and people just think well, you know people in the UK say if you've got nothing to hide
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:27.620]  You've got nothing to worry about
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:34.820]  Well, the problem is if you put these things into the hands of governments governments in the West change every four or five years
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:39.580]  Put them into the hands of the governments each new government inherits these weapons
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:44.820]  They inherit this technology and the laws can change because you don't set up laws
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:51.020]  You can enforce now when you get strike action in the UK you've got collections of people protesting
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:57.300]  You'll start seeing robots being used maybe with water cannon to begin with and you could start seeing a creeping
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:04.260]  Authoritarianism coming throughout the West and it can happen really quickly people laugh at me when I say this and say oh
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:07.380]  No, we're a democracy this could never happen
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:15.340]  Well, you know as well as I do you the sort of person who does know what could happen if governments get this technology? Well
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:21.220]  There's no doubt. I mean they've already been caught using drones domestically in cattle rustling things with the Department of Defense
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:26.620]  They're already using robots with the SWAT teams to go in and find out where you're at so they can kill you
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:32.660]  I mean the entire architecture as I've said, and I'm not a professor like you. I just read what you write when countless others, right?
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:35.300]  effect most
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:37.060]  even though you
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:42.500]  and a lot of your colleagues know at some time are funded by government grants almost every AI or robotics professor
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:43.700]  I talked to
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:49.620]  Says that yes, this is going in the wrong direction is very dangerous, but it doesn't matter because the technologies just get shipped off to
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:57.380]  All these big defense contractor companies that I mean look at the robot smart meters controlling our houses
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:59.540]  look at the robot face scanning cameras and
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:05.580]  License plate reading cameras. I mean just because something doesn't walk around like Robbie the robot doesn't mean it's not a
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:10.140]  Surveillance pod an imperial probe droid, but let me ask you this question
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:15.140]  What do you expect on the truly artificially intelligent front?
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:19.180]  I mean obviously when it comes to acting like a human being able to reproduce
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:24.820]  Being able to have sentient thoughts. They're probably a pretty far off from that
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:31.820]  but at least a computer that malfunctions and believes its mission is to say kill everybody or
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:37.340]  Or or something else. I think that is is is becoming a probability
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:43.260]  Certainly the consent that they can send a robot in to kill people. There's no question of that
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.020]  I'm not I'm a bit skeptical about the time course of AI
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:50.060]  I think it's going to take a very long time to get smart machines
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:52.540]  But that's not going to stop the developments anyway
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:56.300]  They're going to happen smart machines or not and that's one of the big worries
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:50:03.420]  But as you say what you've alluded to a couple of times is the big word that's used I talked to weapons manufacturers quite a lot
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.460]  Believe it or not
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:11.740]  And one of the big words that's used in the United States and it's helped by the recession law is the word jobs
[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:15.020]  Okay, this is bringing jobs to our people
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:20.460]  You know, I talked to something like 200 weapons manufacturers at a big conference
[01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:23.900]  I was at a big convention and I walked around saying to everybody
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:31.100]  Well, you know, they were making I mean these companies making the tiny subtle components like sensors for your predator robot
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:35.100]  Little bits of electronics and I would say to all of them the same question
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:41.420]  What are you going to do when Afghanistan stops when Iraq stops and they would all say the same thing
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:46.060]  They would all say exactly the same thing and that was oh just start another war
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:50.460]  And they said it like a joke, but you know, it wasn't very funny
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:55.180]  No, no, and it's not a joke and here's the deal the biggest battleground is in our domestic countries
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:51:00.380]  And that's what they're deploying these into stay there. We're talking about that. We come back big news by the way on syria
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:05.180]  Hello, this is ty bolinger author of the best-selling book cancer step outside the box
[01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:07.980]  I want you to know some very important information
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:13.820]  In 1985 president ronald reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the white house
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:17.260]  At a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer

[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:43.180]  Ron Paul said recently the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:47.500]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the constitution

[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:18.060]  And I do this every few weeks on a particular national security issues to get their take
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.140]  because
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:24.060]  They're the ones that are going to be shun in until the robots replace some of the autonomous systems
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.540]  and and I want to know their take on
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:30.380]  The fact that Assad's come out and this article is going up on info works dot com in minutes
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.900]  Kid Daniels did it off of Assad's statements that nobody's picking up
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:39.260]  That we are a sovereign nation fighting al-qaeda and that's it over a hundred thousand injected by the west
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:42.380]  I'm not a fan of Assad or qaddafi or any of these guys
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:48.540]  But the point is is that they're trying to replace one corrupt system that's not offensive and that is democratizing
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:50.540]  With something far worse
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:53.340]  And his daughter course. He said earlier in the hour
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.300]  Many analysts say this could turn into world war three
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:58.940]  And here's the bbc
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.180]  Syria crisis russia and china step up
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:08.380]  Warning over strike russia and china stepped with their warning against military intervention in syria and moscow saying any such action would have
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:14.620]  Catastrophic consequences their foreign minister likened the west to a monkey with a hand grenade. How about a monkey with nuclear weapons?
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:16.460]  and
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.460]  Again, i've had syrian opposition on people that live in other countries that are famous
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:24.060]  Like bb the syrian girl. You know dab is like one of the top ministers
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.340]  They hate Assad and say he's ten times better than al-qaeda
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:33.340]  They were run out of the country and they're against this because this is evil ladies and gentlemen and now the evidence
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:37.900]  The muslim extremist shot video of themselves loading the chemical weapon mortars
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:42.380]  I'm predicted to be mortars as those attacks look like that's how they deployed it
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:47.260]  I mean that's that's why carry saying doesn't matter who did it now. We've got to invade. This is incredible now
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:52.940]  This this segues into the bombshell. He was just dropping these statements when he goes to these conferences
[01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:55.180]  They're like we'll just start a new war
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:56:01.820]  Our money the tens of trillions we've spent turning into an empire has taken us from the greatest saving nation
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:04.780]  To now the the greatest deader nation
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:10.220]  We these guys that have jobs sure they've got jobs, but it sucks our economy dry
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:16.780]  These these pentagon jobs are not good these these defense contractors jobs are not good and now it's shifting
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:23.900]  These big companies the robot companies and they sold austin like 15 million dollars worth this year three five million dollar robots
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:29.420]  And I looked them up the robots don't even cost really 500 000 to build in closing sir
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:33.260]  I mean this is about the military industrial complex run rampant for me
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:35.900]  Uh, what is your final points doctor?
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:40.220]  Noel Sharkey and how do people visit your campaign against killer robots to learn more?
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.740]  Well, I've given you the links. I've given your producer the link
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:47.660]  So it's going to put them on your web website, which will lead you to the
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:50.380]  To the right place to find out about this
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:56.300]  But one thing it's worth saying apart from the big industrial military complex and all this nonsense about jobs
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:02.140]  It's really putting money in certain people's pockets a lot of money and that's what really is behind it
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:07.420]  But one thing that people keep saying is but surely robots are good to lead to bloodless wars
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:15.180]  Well, that's really not thinking at all. That's the usual blinkered thing that a lot of your united states lawyers come up with all the time
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:17.980]  Oh, this would be great. We can have bloodless conflicts
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:24.060]  Well, the problem is that there's been a continuous conflict almost as far as I can see since the second world war
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.700]  And this is not going to alleviate it at all
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:32.860]  It just means you can carry on with low level of killing people constantly all the time
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:38.300]  If they're against your nation's interests and people talk about, you know, you don't have to commit troops
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:42.860]  Well, I'm sorry, but you know, I don't want to see any young men being killed
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:44.860]  I have friends fighting in Afghanistan
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:52.060]  But without the threat of body bags coming home, it's very easy just to continue killing and killing and killing
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:57.820]  And I think you laid out the big giant key there is this just allows us to sit here watch football
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:02.140]  While our robot armies kill everybody and it's not even an American interest
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.100]  I mean, it is so immoral
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:11.900]  And cowardly to give you know higher than purple heart awards to the drone pilots. Oh, yeah, that was a good one
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.940]  Why don't we give them peace prizes like Obama?
[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:16.620]  Yeah, that's right
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:22.220]  I think that every every drone pilot should get an Nobel Peace Prize that would fit well with what you're saying
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:28.940]  Wow, okay, we've had your website up on screen for folks to visit and we'll post it up on info wars.com and links
[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:34.620]  And everything you're doing a bit professor. Thank you so much under Noel Sharkey. Thank you so much. We'll talk to you soon

[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:50.380]  Coming up in the next segment. I'm going to recap the latest bombshell developments
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:52.860]  We also have a clip from last
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.420]  night
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:57.420]  With john carrey and his statement
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:01.740]  About how well first off. He said there's no doubt a sob did the chemical weapons
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:08.300]  But later he says it doesn't matter who really launched the chemicals. We can't allow a country to have
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:13.820]  These chemicals so the u.n. Must go in so it's globalism. We're going to attack you for peace
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:17.660]  And we're going to bring in rebels to do it and go after your legal weapons
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:21.740]  And i've got a transcript that i'm going to be going over as well. We have the video as well
[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:29.260]  With carney saying this is not regime change. In fact, that's the london guardian with the transcript of that
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:32.700]  carney, of course famously a few months ago said that
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:36.620]  They're launching non-lethal lethal operations
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:40.220]  In different parts of the world. So so it's non-lethal lethal
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:43.020]  So kill your neighbor hypothetically
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:47.020]  Beat the brains out and the cops shoves go. It's non-lethal lethal
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:48.940]  i'm j carney
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.380]  In fact, where are j carney's suit look like of a punk
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:57.660]  Class president who you wouldn't trust, you know to water your plants when you're out of town
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:03.580]  I mean you take one look at carney. He is an arrogant narcissistic full of himself jackass criminal
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:09.740]  And i want to say this all the liars that work for this regime and all the media whores at cnn ms mbc
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:14.860]  You know, you are who go along with all this warmongering and the conservative talk show host that that know full
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.500]  Well, what's going on and so we've got to attack syria
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:21.900]  You're the scum of the earth and you are complicit in these war crimes
[02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:25.980]  Good job for dr. Corsi and world net daily coming out against us and saying it's a fraud
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:30.060]  Good job for drudge report post of the article showing it's a fraud. Good job
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.100]  For pat bucanon coming out
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:36.380]  And saying this is a fraud good job to infall wars
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:41.740]  Because you know, we stay on the right side of history. Assad is no angel cake, but compared to his daddy is
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:48.700]  He was a stabilizing force in the region and he was trying to democratize and they used that to be able to infiltrate and start this up
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:52.300]  Makes his dad's point, doesn't it?
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:57.900]  So that's the problem the globalist always introduced instability which which then helps dictators stay in power worldwide
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:03.100]  The globalists want dictatorship because they can centralize control through it
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:07.820]  And you're going to find out in the coming months and years the men from the boys who cares about humanity
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:11.820]  Who values the truth like dr. Corsi said now? He is a famous
[02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:14.540]  conservative pretty much a neocon
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:19.820]  and there he is having to admit these wars have been fraudulent and have bankrupted us and that
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:26.220]  And that the al-qaeda rebels are run by the white house and there's videos of them staging the chemical attack
[02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:30.220]  And he goes the sod's bad, but the truth is the truth exactly
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:37.100]  The truth is the truth that isn't about well. He's a bad guy. So let's do something. Let's be conservative 500 times worse
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:41.580]  To say he's 10 times worse. No
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:48.780]  You could go to Syria and go to the beach and hang out go to movies and women could go to college and and Jews and Christians could live in peace and
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:51.260]  Unless you were a radical
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:54.620]  Violent Islamic group. You could have freedom in that country
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:57.820]  The anger
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:03:59.820]  The anger
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:06.460]  Against the sod is just like here. The government gives contracts to croning insiders. That's the tyranny
[02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:09.180]  Is that just like in Egypt?
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:13.420]  hazy mubarak gave contracts to his buddies and screwed over taxpayers
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:18.620]  Is exactly what our government's doing and notice only nine percent of americans 91 percent
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:21.900]  Are against this war
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:24.220]  91 percent
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:29.100]  In the major of roiders poll the town and they don't care. They go ahead with it
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:31.980]  now
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:36.780]  I mean are we gonna have somebody invade us because we've got a corrupt government and then blow the country up like they're doing
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:42.780]  It's a favor. No, thanks. No, thanks. You know, I don't want any foreign governments to invade to kick out obama
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:45.020]  It's the same type of deal
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:49.020]  But obama is at war with logic and truth
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:54.140]  If a sod comes out and just says what about the logic the articles up on info wars dot com
[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:58.940]  It's red linked a sod says syria is a sovereign country fighting out. I don't

[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.700]  Into this world. We're thrown
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:39.420]  Let me just recap the top headlines and new developments that i'm going to give the number out for active duty or
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:47.260]  Retired special forces trips particularly who've recently retired and to give us your take on this it's on record for
[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:53.180]  Almost three years now. It's it's over two and a half years. They've been funding al-qaeda mainly 60 percent
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:09:00.780]  It's estimated by the council on foreign relations to invade out of iraq out of jordan and out of turkey
[02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:09.580]  Uh, no one knows the numbers. There's as many as 60 000 at any one time in the country. They believe it's over 200 000 have been injected
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:12.380]  Uh in the last two and a half years
[02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:18.540]  And they're given us weapons. You name it. Uh, german weapons, dutch weapons, british weapons
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:22.780]  They're now being given us tow missiles heat seeking missiles
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:26.940]  French anti-aircraft missiles. That's the heat seekers. They've got mainly
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:32.940]  And now this you'll notice now they're telling police departments get ready for al-qaeda to shoot down aircraft with heat seekers
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:36.540]  And they won't even care when they shoot down our aircraft later
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:40.860]  It'll be like that trader alex says our government gave it to them when it's on record
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:44.140]  They did see being a trader is being informed
[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:50.220]  Being a trader is loving america being a trader is loving justice being a trader is loving the truth
[02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:54.860]  Being a trader is being an american against the globalist occupation of this country
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:59.020]  And obama wants a big giant distraction from everything that's happening
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:02.940]  The irs gate
[02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:08.780]  The nsa gate the persecution of the pro-life groups the vengazi gate the fast and furious gate
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:14.860]  And all the new stuff the muslin brotherhood. It's coming out make funded directly by obama and his family
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:17.260]  He's like making money using covert money
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:23.180]  To then give his family large positions in the middle east. I mean this is incredible
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:28.140]  It's like lbj himself reportedly made over 500 million dollars just on the dredging
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:32.700]  Of one area off the coast of south vietnam to bring in ships
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:35.260]  And that was back in the 60s
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.260]  He made 500 million off that
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:40.540]  Uh, I mean it's just it's just the president personally
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:47.020]  Is in there doing this and he smiles at his idiot followers and but the good news is this is bombshell
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:53.740]  Major Reuters poll out and i'm going to dig through it here and show tv viewers the actual washington post headline
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.620]  What the headline is
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:59.180]  syrian war
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:01.580]  us intervention in syrian war
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:05.740]  Less popular than congress is the headline
[02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:10.300]  I'm going for memory. I'll pull it out here and there it is new polls syrian intervention even less popular than congress
[02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:13.100]  uh washington post
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:17.340]  Folks it's already an intervention our dirty evil government
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:20.940]  Did the whole thing and i want to explain something here people say well
[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:25.420]  How do you dislike the corrupt government but say you love our military our military is the most awake group?
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:29.340]  I know they're good men and women on average. They're awake folks
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:34.700]  It's like if your plane got hijacked by a hijacker and they put on the
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:41.420]  Captain's uniform which they a lot of times do because of psychological reasons people tend to stop resisting just because they're in the uniform
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:46.620]  We have criminals in the uniform of the president the commander in chief
[02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:53.100]  The the leader of the senate the leader of the house. They're all globalist who themselves are out of control
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:56.860]  I've studied criminology. I've studied megalomania
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.020]  studying history
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:03.180]  And you get the roman empire the babelonian empire meso american empires you name it
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:05.180]  When do they always go into decline?
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:08.060]  you'll have some king
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:16.140]  That comes from a line of people that was you know tough strong focused intelligent was into art literature building up society building aqueducts
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:20.460]  It's the same story everywhere and things thrive population grows. There's good rule
[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:23.260]  Everybody gets happy then
[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:30.300]  His grandson's kind of a punk, but he gets into power 50 years later and is arrogant put some corrupt people in
[02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:33.260]  And gets a little jealous of some other folks that have some money
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:34.460]  So he shuts them down
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:40.380]  He decides to conquer some neighbors that they've been trading with for a long time and that shuts down that productivity
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:43.260]  And then they start conquering other neighbors in looting the peasants
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:49.660]  You know with 80 tax rates to be able to fund the new wars and then he'll and then his own guard turns against him
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:56.940]  So he brings in mercenaries to oppress them and then he has a spoiled rotten son that gets control who likes to
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:02.300]  Change children up in the town square and chew their throats out in front of everyone
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:05.500]  That was a common thing for some reason a Nero
[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:11.820]  Was it Nero or Caligula that dressed up like a werewolf and would chain up the children in the banquet hall and rip their throats out nightly
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:13.740]  It was Nero
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:15.740]  That was Nero wasn't Caligula
[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:20.620]  I mean you can look that up by the way and and just it doesn't matter whether it was the Aztecs or the romans
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:23.180]  finally
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:27.020]  You know vladian paler. I think it was his granddaughter would bathe in the blood of babies
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:32.460]  They would chop their heads off and spew the blood onto her because she thought it made her look younger that that's by the way
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:34.780]  Archaeology they've dug that up. That's true
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:41.100]  Bringing the peasant baby chop its head off and spray the blood on me. This is what we've allowed
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:44.860]  It's like hitler stall on her mouth. We just have absolute
[02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:47.500]  ravenous scum of the earth
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:52.940]  In control that want to destroy themselves subconsciously
[02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:59.100]  Look at what a degenerate new Nero looks looks like I mean look at that
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:05.420]  I mean he looks look how crazed on a power trip. He looks
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:10.380]  Those romans could really get it down to what they look like look at that psycho demon
[02:14:11.180 --> 02:14:14.700]  He finally committed suicide. He was so decadent. He said I've murdered my family
[02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:18.700]  He burned the city down the only thing I can do that's more evil is kill myself
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:21.660]  look it up
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:23.180]  That's what
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:24.860]  linen said
[02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:28.220]  He wrote poetry you can pull it up. He said I'd like to take over the planet
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:32.700]  And and and create weapons systems and he talked about scientists
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:36.620]  It had theorized it theorized by 1900 atomic weapons. This was in the 30s
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:41.420]  He said I'd like to blow up the earth. No blow up the sun. No blow up everything
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:44.380]  And he said my dream is to kill everybody
[02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:51.660]  And he would go to a little island. This is actually uh clonies would put this in one of his movies
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:57.900]  Uh a a a breakdown of it where a crazy hillbilly's killing white rabbits and I always saw that and wondered
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:01.420]  What does that mean? Where would you come up with that when later? I learned?
[02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:05.660]  Oh, he had a private island where they would stock thousands of white rabbits
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:10.700]  They would run around with guns and hatchets just for like eight hours straight biting them ripping their heads off
[02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:12.700]  Flapping around on the ground
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:16.060]  I mean, I'm sorry to what's that movie with bridges?
[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:18.140]  that
[02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:20.940]  Plenicewood did it's uh lightfoot and something
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:24.220]  No, it's not the bridges
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:26.620]  It's something in lightfoot
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:29.180]  The point is it doesn't matter
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:31.340]  That's based off what linen would do
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:35.820]  And and and we're going to give these people nuclear weapons and everything and
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:39.820]  Thunderbolt and lightfoot there you go
[02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:42.300]  And
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.300]  that's the type of issue
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:47.180]  that we're facing here
[02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:49.180]  and
[02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:51.180]  The sane people
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:53.340]  Are going to have to stand up
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:59.180]  And take action against the psychopaths before they destroy the world because of the old days the tires would run their course and collapse
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:04.300]  Finally and then the barbarians would come in and take over the primitives and then society would start back over again
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:10.620]  This time that's not going to happen with the technocracy. They're going to do things that humanity the world has never seen before
[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:15.740]  You wonder why do they put fluoride in the water when they know it increases cancer and brain damages?
[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:18.300]  Well, they've all written white papers like the white house science are
[02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:22.060]  He wants you to be dumbed down so he can control you
[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:27.420]  They get off on walking through the mall or down the street looking at all their victims. It's a power trip
[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:29.740]  Well, let me tell you something you pieces of crap
[02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:34.060]  I see you and I know who you are and I know what you are
[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:39.980]  And I am here to try to ignite the spirit of liberty and I could feel it already happening and you will pay
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:45.100]  You will be defeated. I am not going to stand by and God is not going to stand by
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:48.380]  And the American people and the rest of the planet that loves justice
[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:51.980]  He's not going to stand by and watch you filth run rampant anymore
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:57.820]  Every stinking false flag they've pulled they've gotten over 70 approval ratings to go into countries
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:03.740]  But people now know so they've pulled conservatives libertarians liberals. You name it the average is
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:11.740]  9% support your new fraud and that's why Kerry yesterday said I want you to look at the images of these dead children
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:16.300]  And I want you to understand how horrible it is and then I'm sitting there watching it and wondered why I got
[02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:22.620]  Probably more angry than I ever had my life looking at this sack of arrogant narcissistic garbage
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:30.540]  Drunk on the blood of innocence in his fancy suit threatening us that are awake going and how dare those of you claim they
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:32.540]  You know the rebels
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.540]  That you know that Assad didn't do this
[02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:37.660]  And then he later says but it doesn't matter who did it
[02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:42.460]  And then he goes on to say uh, it doesn't matter either. We have to go in and get the weapons
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:43.740]  Knowing full well
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:49.740]  It's going to come out the rebels did it and who commands them the state department's running this illegal operation outside congress
[02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:53.980]  That's come out and who heads up the state department. You're looking at the guy that did it
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:56.540]  The un investigation
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:18:00.860]  Will not determine who used these chemical weapons see only
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:03.420]  Whether such weapons were used
[02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:07.580]  A judgment that is already clear to the world
[02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:12.220]  That's an I spoke on Thursday now. Now he goes on to talk about the children and everything else
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:14.940]  I I did the whole thing on the news last night and talked over it
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:17.020]  uh
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:21.980]  I could hardly walk out of here last night. I was so freaked out and so exhausted. I'm gonna be honest with you
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:25.340]  People say man. What why are you angry? Why am I angry?
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:33.020]  My government is hijacked and run by an ivy league piece of trash an arrogant frat boy scumbag
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:36.300]  A nero wannabe
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:39.100]  in america's name
[02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:44.300]  I mean when my children get older if they ever came the police ever came and it turned out one of my children
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:49.260]  Done something horrible. I would feel terrible about it because it's in my name and it means I failed
[02:18:50.060 --> 02:18:55.340]  And it's the same thing. I have failed. We've all failed. We've got this disgusting trash
[02:18:56.300 --> 02:19:00.460]  Butchering our country waging war on us saying veterans of the number one terror threat
[02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:06.700]  George washington is bad in the army manual. I mean, I can't even believe I'm saying that it's so over the top
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:08.940]  These people are the enemy
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:15.980]  And the fact that I'm on over 160 stations and reach 15 million people a week shows america still got a chance to fix ourselves like
[02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:18.060]  Nineveh
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:20.060]  to get that reprieve
[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:22.220]  Before judgment comes down on us
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:25.100]  But I'm here to tell you
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:27.260]  right now
[02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:29.660]  Just as Jonah warned Nineveh
[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:33.020]  Those of us that have been warning people about what's happening
[02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:38.940]  America is going to go into full bondage and hell on earth if we continue to allow these people to rule over us
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:45.180]  We are going under judgment. How does god judge people read about israel when they would do the prophets would tell them
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:48.140]  You're going to be judged. You're going to be allowed to go into captivity
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:54.460]  When you become evil you judge yourself. You let the evil take over. They're not going to stop at syria
[02:19:54.620 --> 02:20:00.380]  They're not going to stop anywhere where you think they hate syrians. They really hate americans the globalist

[02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:26.460]  But I believe you should be informed about it because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels

[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:30.700]  al-zahari
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:37.180]  The leader of al-qaeda praises what the west is doing helping the rebels and says damascus first then chiro then jerusalem
[02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:41.420]  I mean, who knows maybe maybe obama will end up supporting the al-qaeda
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:46.140]  I guess they are supporting the attack on the chiro, but how about the they call them protesters on seeing an activist
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.260]  How about calling them activists and people when they attack jerusalem?
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:52.300]  Who knows have seen stranger things. They might actually support that
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:56.700]  Continuing international i'll be a trader for not supporting that I guess
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:26:00.140]  Uh, I don't like al-qaeda. I'll admit it. I guess i'm a bad man

[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:30.140]  Is a sovereign country fighting al-qaeda. That's like saying the sky was blue today
[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:33.740]  So that article just went up on info wars dot com. Please
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:37.100]  Get that article out to everyone. You know
[02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:39.740]  uh, saudi threatened russia with
[02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:44.220]  Olympic terrorist attacks unless it abandoned syria support
[02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:50.860]  Yeah, that's right. The saudi terrorist states that's helping supply the jihadis is openly saying they're going to attack
[02:26:50.860 --> 02:26:55.260]  Uh, russia with proxy soldiers. Uh, if they don't hand over syria to them
[02:26:55.820 --> 02:27:00.220]  It's the nato with the degenerate saudi leadership doing all this. I just it's unbelievable folks
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:03.740]  I mean our government's done some evil stuff before this is just just naked
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:08.220]  And then they launched that nerve gas attack and get up there and talk about how they're
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:14.060]  Humanitarians and blaming on other groups so they can kill hundreds of thousands more on the backs of a few hundred dead people
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:15.820]  They killed
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.820]  And they know you have emotions. They're psychos
[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:19.820]  At least sociopaths
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:22.780]  The only time they feel emotions when they're doing something evil
[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:27.180]  It's what animates them study criminology folks. You need to understand our enemy
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:35.020]  Assad says syria again is a sovereign country fighting al-qaeda americans 91 opposition to syrian war
[02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:41.500]  Insignificant to the technocrats, but it does show the mass awakening is happening. That is huge news in your face
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:44.060]  Miley Cyrus soft porn as obama
[02:27:44.060 --> 02:27:51.100]  Prepares to murder syrians. I saw articles where it's more popular in the news and on twitter about Miley Cyrus
[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:56.940]  Again who sold you to the youth to try to corrupt them and now she runs around bending over
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:59.420]  simulating uh
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:00.860]  sex on tv
[02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:05.660]  Knowing everybody will pick up on it so she can sell more tickets and again if that's what you want to do fine
[02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:08.220]  my issue is
[02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:10.220]  it is it shows the incredible
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:12.300]  immoralness that
[02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:16.940]  That americans sure have woken up and are against another war. They know. Oh, they always lie about stuff. I don't believe them
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:19.340]  But that's so what let me see that girl been over
[02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:22.220]  And and it's like hey man

[02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:30.780]  Okay
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:35.420]  You know democrats are like, yeah, I guess obama's kind of out of control, but I still like him
[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:40.860]  And he'll be on j1o talking about uh, well, hey you you got caught spying on people without warrants
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:45.500]  You lied about that, but I'm for gay marriage and like well, I guess it's so it's like a it's like a throwaway thing
[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:51.100]  I'm for gay marriage. Just hey, I caught you robbing the bank. I'm for gay marriage officers. Well, I guess that's okay
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:56.620]  Then it's just it's just all these little petty distractions going to break here's some a carney an hour ago
[02:28:57.100 --> 02:29:02.140]  With his bull at the white house press briefing and you don't need to go on a horse barn to find manure folks
[02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:06.140]  It comes out of this guy's mouth. Here it is. What I would say is that yesterday. I made clear that the
[02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:09.100]  intelligence community
[02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:14.620]  Is working on an assessment and that once we had that assessment we would be working on more bold information to the public
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:16.780]  About it
[02:29:16.780 --> 02:29:20.620]  In the coming days and that remains true. I think that that fed speculation that it would
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:26.220]  Come just look at him as body language total liar some other day, but it will come and I can think you can expect it this week
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:29.020]  Let me also say and I
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:31.020]  think that both
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:33.020]  Secretary Kerry and I
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:35.020]  Attempted to make clear yesterday
[02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:37.420]  That there is no doubt here
[02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:39.420]  The chemical weapons were used
[02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:46.620]  On a massive scale. See see we're gonna come back 21st, but he repeats what Kerry said. It doesn't matter of Assad use it now
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:52.460]  They can use chemical weapons anywhere they want then invade you. We're on the march the empire

[02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:14.460]  And then we're going to go to the veterans. I wanted to get on ex-military intelligence
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:17.260]  vet nuclear launch officer
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:20.700]  Uh current serving military. I want to get your take on what's happening
[02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:22.940]  But you heard dr. Jerome coursey last hour
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:26.620]  He said this is the greatest threat of nuclear war since the cuban missile crisis
[02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:30.540]  And it's all based on a lie and world end daily with their arab speaking bureau
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:32.540]  Found all the al-qaeda videos
[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:37.980]  With them launching the attacks last week bragging and it's on their channels. They've had for two years
[02:34:38.460 --> 02:34:44.380]  Showing their attacks. They're that proud. They got caught earlier this year launching a chemical attack that even yahoo
[02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:50.220]  Reported on but I wanted to get dr. Roberts on today. He wrote a story that's at paul cregg roberts.org
[02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:53.340]  And we also have it up on info wars.com
[02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:57.820]  Syria another western war crime in the making paul cregg roberts
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:02.380]  And I wanted to get the former head of policy at the treasury father of reaganomics
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:06.140]  On to give a truly conservative
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:12.860]  Perspective on this and to ask him is it good news that only nine percent of americans in a roiders poll
[02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:19.020]  Agree with us. I think this is the collapse of support and it really shows. We have a a rogue state
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:25.580]  A cleptocracy in there a but b does he think they'll go ahead and strike dr.
[02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:29.660]  Corsi believes they will and it may cause world war three dr. Roberts. Thanks for coming on
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:32.700]  Pleased to be with the alex break it down
[02:35:33.740 --> 02:35:40.380]  Well, they're going to strike and of course it was not done by a sod. It was staged by the americans and the israelis
[02:35:41.180 --> 02:35:46.460]  We've known this from the beginning the minute that uh, obama said there was a line drawn
[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:49.580]  We knew they were gonna have a false flag event
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:58.380]  Um, the fact that the american people are finally caught on or tired of these wars that don't serve their purposes
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:02.540]  Uh, doesn't matter because washington now is no longer accountable
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:09.180]  Except to a few powerful profit interests. So I think it will go ahead
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:13.260]  I don't think uh nuclear war will result because
[02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:18.300]  Of this strike, but it's going to result because what the united states is doing
[02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:22.140]  Uh, they're radicalizing the muslims
[02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:30.860]  It's a way of destabilizing both russia and china russia has large muslim populations
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:37.660]  It's bordered by numerous muslim countries china has some muslim populations and borders
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:40.220]  And so as this radicalization
[02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:47.900]  Of muslim spreads it spreads into these two countries and becomes destabilizing for them
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:53.340]  And as well, the united states has inside russia hundreds of
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:57.900]  non-governmental organizations funded with american money
[02:36:58.700 --> 02:37:01.820]  Whose purpose is to destabilize russia
[02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:04.060]  to
[02:37:04.060 --> 02:37:10.620]  And demand liberalization which is really a way of creating dissenting forces
[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:13.420]  arousing
[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:15.420]  the different nationality
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:17.820]  passions of the
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:21.180]  Of the peoples in russia the same in china and china
[02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:23.740]  Every time an american company
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:26.780]  Locates a new plant or a bank branch
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.940]  In china they create a board and they put on this board
[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:35.980]  The chinese relatives of the local and regional party officials
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:38.620]  And so that board becomes a way of
[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:41.820]  It's a conduit for money
[02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:43.340]  into the
[02:37:43.340 --> 02:37:45.340]  regional and local
[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:48.060]  Communist party and it creates loyalties
[02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:55.900]  That put them at odds with the central government. So it's a global corporatist takeover above all the nations
[02:37:56.140 --> 02:37:58.140]  Let me ask you this question dr. Roberts
[02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:04.860]  How far can the madness go when every military officer? I talked to says the military is awakened upset
[02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:10.860]  When when the polls show almost no one's buying it, but as you said they don't care they go forward
[02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:13.740]  Is there any way to stop this madness?
[02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:16.860]  I doubt it
[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:24.700]  Uh, I I think it will lead to nuclear war because what the chinese and russians are learning is that there's no international law
[02:38:24.700 --> 02:38:32.620]  I mean the united states has no respect for international law and the chinese and russians are learning that there is no restraint whatsoever
[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:35.100]  on washington's criminality
[02:38:35.980 --> 02:38:42.940]  And since they are isolated diplomatically they're outgun militarily all they really can do is to take
[02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:49.260]  Refuge in nuclear weapons and both are rapidly upgrading their strategic nuclear weapons
[02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:56.860]  So I think the idiots in washington, you know trying to have world hedge enemy are driving the world to nuclear war
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:39:05.020]  I think that is the the certain outcome of the new conservative policy of american hedge enemy
[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:10.540]  Again dr. Paul craig roberts joins us
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:18.940]  He's an economist and also has worked internationally on many deals including the peace deals with the soviet union back in 1991
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:20.940]  doctor
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:25.580]  Unfortunately, I have to agree with you and all the other experts. I talked to agree and I've done my own research
[02:39:26.140 --> 02:39:28.860]  Uh, I think the only thing that may stop it is
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:31.740]  the military itself quietly
[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:35.180]  leaking information sabotaging things
[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:37.980]  in a peaceful way
[02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:44.780]  Kind of blocking what's going on and and that's why you see such a focus on persecuting whistleblowers because
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:49.740]  Uh, the the the kleptocrats that have seized control of our central government
[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:54.380]  Uh seem to be concerned about that. So I think that shows that that may be a weakness
[02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:59.900]  Well, um, you know dimsy the chairman of the joint chiefs has warned against it
[02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:07.260]  But I think on the whole uh, the military is un is unable to do anything or what they would have to do would be simply to have a coup
[02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:13.580]  But actually the war serves the purpose of the military if it serves a military security complex
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:17.580]  Uh, they go along get along generals when they retire
[02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:23.260]  Uh, they either get to be a pentagon consultants or they become lobbyists sure
[02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:26.860]  But it's not going to serve them if we go totally bankrupt and there's a nuclear war
[02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:33.580]  I know but everybody thinks about their interests. Who's looking after me? This is my chance
[02:40:34.060 --> 02:40:36.060]  I can't rock the boat
[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:38.060]  So it becomes very hard
[02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:40.300]  for the military to
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:43.500]  Uh, to do something that's actually against
[02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:48.460]  Uh, the short run interest of all of the members in the higher ranks
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:52.460]  So I don't know that we can count on the military stopping it
[02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:55.900]  They haven't stopped any of the other wars
[02:40:56.860 --> 02:41:03.100]  Why do you think they're going ahead with this now to distract from all the scandals to try to get Iran to get involved
[02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:05.260]  So they can have a wider war
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:13.580]  Well, you know, uh, it's part of the the neoconservative document that they put out and general Wesley Clark is reported
[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:17.100]  He he was shown the same thing when he visited the pentagon
[02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:23.580]  So I think what what it's really about is, uh, the united states was going to pull off in Syria
[02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:30.140]  The exactly the same scenario it used in libya only this time the russians and the chinese
[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:31.980]  vetoed
[02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:38.460]  The no-fly zone because they they had learned that the no-fly zone was actually something the americans and nato used
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:46.220]  For attacking, uh, qaddafi's forces. So they vetoed it. So the americans had all the washington had already, uh,
[02:41:46.940 --> 02:41:49.340]  instigated the outside, uh
[02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:53.980]  jihadists going into syria to overthrow the circular president
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:42:00.780]  And yet there was no air support. And so the american backs forces the washington back forces are being defeated
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:07.980]  And so they've got to find some way to come to the aid of the forces
[02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:13.180]  And so that's what this chemical weapons, uh, false flag attack is all about
[02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:18.700]  It gives washington an excuse to run in there and rescue the forces that it sent to work
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:25.260]  Sir, uh, joel scalzen who does world affairs brief has has has been very accurate in his analysis as have you been
[02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:27.100]  he believes
[02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:30.700]  That the anglo-american, uh power structure is trying
[02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:36.060]  To get russia and china to start a nuclear war and that they believe out of that global crisis
[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:40.460]  They'll be able to create a new police state here roll out some of the space based weapons
[02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:48.380]  They've got to defeat them and finally have world domination and that this is truly, uh, a megalomaniacal thing that's happening
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:50.620]  What's your take on that analysis?
[02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:55.580]  Well, we already have a police state. They already have that and nobody survives nuclear war
[02:42:55.580 --> 02:42:57.580]  I mean, there won't be any survivors
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:03.100]  So I think sure that that's an incorrect analysis and uh
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:08.380]  Okay, okay, well you and I could see the end of this and and he can see the end of it
[02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:11.500]  And and everybody else I talked to that's intelligent could see the end of it
[02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:15.420]  What is the power structure thinking then if they don't want world war three?
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:17.100]  Why are they trying to start it?
[02:43:17.100 --> 02:43:23.740]  Or are they so arrogant like don corezine making 40 to 1 bets, uh in the stock market that they just think they're invincible
[02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:30.940]  Well, they probably are full of hubris and they're full of the ideology that they're indispensable and exceptional
[02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:33.580]  But they're also counting on winning
[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:38.780]  They're counting on their strategy of destabilizing russia and china working. I mean they do we
[02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:46.620]  Washington does have fifth columns in both countries and so if radicalizing the muslim populations, uh causes
[02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:53.820]  Uh more instability than washington says we can win so they're they're banking on winning without the nuclear war
[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:58.940]  But what they're overlooking is that that's the only weapons that china and russia would have to stop this
[02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:03.980]  So I think it would come out. We'll all be simply destroyed. It'd be the end of life on earth
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:07.580]  And they also like to use the radical muslims
[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:12.860]  They're flooding the us and europe with as another way to destabilize you then take all our liberties from the threat
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:17.820]  They literally created dr. Paul craig roberts. Folks can read your columns on your site and
[02:44:17.900 --> 02:44:23.980]  Ascindicated around the web on places like info wars.com paul craig roberts.org. Thank you so much for your analysis
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:31.340]  Please talk to you. Thank you doctor. Well, there you go. There's the father of ergonomics listed as one of the top 10 economists in the world
[02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:33.740]  by Forbes magazine and other publications
[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:38.780]  Here telling us that we're probably going to end up the next few years if not sooner have nuclear war. We're all dead
[02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:41.580]  and don corezine and
[02:44:41.580 --> 02:44:44.540]  Blank fine everybody just doesn't care because they've just got trillions
[02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:51.500]  They've stolen and they're just they're all just got jet copters and 20 mistresses and they're invincible like like every every other
[02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:53.820]  group of control freaks in history
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:44:58.620]  They got to have world government man. They just got to have it
[02:44:59.420 --> 02:45:02.460]  They got to have it. They got to have it now. We're going to go to your phone calls here
[02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:04.940]  Now in just a moment
[02:45:04.940 --> 02:45:09.580]  ahead of all this it's more important than ever that everyone become prison planet dot tv subscribers

[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:51.420]  Warn people. I think this can be stopped. There are a lot of smart people in the system that realize where this is going and
[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:56.540]  That's why they haven't gone over the edge because every joint chief of staff has said don't do this and don't attack
[02:45:56.540 --> 02:46:00.060]  Iran and don't because they they warfight folks and they know
[02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:06.060]  What the Russians are up to and the globalists have this double game trying to take over China. It's just madness
[02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:08.620]  It's not america

[02:47:56.700 --> 02:48:01.260]  I was also in the peacekeeping force in the steinheim in the 70s under carter
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:05.100]  This is a message that I got about a week ago from a friend
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:10.700]  Who's with military seal of command on a row a row row boat that's death a roll on roll off
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:14.620]  He getting an email and uh a message from his staff phone
[02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:19.340]  He said that we are loaded ready to roll and we're headed for the med. That was over a week ago
[02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:23.180]  Second point. There's a book that all of your listeners should read
[02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:30.940]  It's by the british author ian johnson. It is called a mosque in munich and it details through declassified documents
[02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:36.700]  How after world war two the cia got ss war criminals and the gestapo
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:41.500]  Aligned them with the mogul in brotherhood sent these guys to the middle east
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:47.820]  And uh gave a crapload of money to the muslim brotherhood and then got these war criminals
[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:50.380]  to south america away from prosecution
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:55.180]  And that's now been declassified over 30 000 of an operation paper clip in the rat line
[02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:56.540]  Let me ask you this sir
[02:48:56.540 --> 02:49:00.060]  So I can just hear the what you know the the nomenclature using you know what you're talking about
[02:49:00.540 --> 02:49:04.620]  That's what I was told by military a week and a half ago that it was that it was going to be on soon
[02:49:04.940 --> 02:49:08.620]  You're saying you got this message before the chemical attack or after
[02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:11.260]  before
[02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:13.260]  Looking a week ago looking at this
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:15.660]  Sorry go ahead
[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:22.460]  This guy works for the military ceilidh command. He's a senior mate. He's right below an officer. He's been there for god
[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:27.500]  Over 30 years. He's been with them since about the 70s. All right
[02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:30.620]  um a military ceilidh command is a
[02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:33.660]  civilian part of the navy that carries
[02:49:34.220 --> 02:49:39.260]  A cargo all over the world. He's in a really big ship called a railroad that says the roll-on roll-off
[02:49:39.260 --> 02:49:46.620]  It's got big hatches on the ship. It can carry tanks. It's like a it's like a rolling. Um, uh, alex
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:50.300]  Cargo truck. It's an amphibious
[02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:56.380]  It's an amphibious landing delivery platform correct similar to something like that something like the coronado
[02:49:57.260 --> 02:50:02.620]  It can handle it can handle huge trucks. It can handle humvee. It can handle m1 ebrams tanks
[02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:08.140]  He said to me a brief message an email message. He said we're about ready to go into the med
[02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:10.460]  He said we're loaded up and we're ready to go
[02:50:11.580 --> 02:50:15.500]  And to be specific then that would mean that they have contingencies for land forces
[02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:21.900]  Which we know they're already deploying into the golon areas and they're also deploying into, um
[02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:26.460]  Jordan and into the Gaza area. That was a month ago or two months ago now
[02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:27.980]  um
[02:50:27.980 --> 02:50:33.420]  Let me ask you this. What do you think of this overall operation and what do you think of the chemical attack?
[02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:40.540]  I think that it is it is it is if you study political science and a guy named dr. Hans Morden's house
[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:45.500]  There's no such thing as foreign policy all foreign aggression is done to cover
[02:50:45.980 --> 02:50:51.740]  Internal problems in a country Hitler's problem of laban's realm because between the wars
[02:50:51.980 --> 02:50:58.460]  They had a high birthrate. He had a movie because it's exactly a living space well said that man knows what he's talking about
[02:50:58.540 --> 02:51:00.540]  We'll be back

[02:51:07.900 --> 02:51:14.140]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health

[02:51:23.100 --> 02:51:26.620]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace

[02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:02.060]  Let's go to uh passman then we'll go to david and david and scott
[02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:07.660]  We're gonna get to everybody going to overdrive passman. Uh, you say you're former uh nuclear launch officer
[02:55:08.060 --> 02:55:11.740]  Uh, do you agree with dr. Roberts and dr. Corsi both saying
[02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:14.460]  This is one of the most dangerous times in world history
[02:55:14.460 --> 02:55:22.380]  Well, I think it could be alex. Uh, I'm a former intercontinental ballistic missile launch officer from the 321st
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:29.100]  Howdy to all my brothers there from the 321st and uh, I am completely and thoroughly familiar
[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:35.660]  With all top secret nuclear weapons launch plans. I can't talk about it, but I can give you my opinion
[02:55:36.220 --> 02:55:38.220]  Yes, sir. Give us your take on this, please
[02:55:38.220 --> 02:55:43.820]  My opinion is all it's going to take is one nuclear weapon to be released
[02:55:44.380 --> 02:55:46.700]  And everything's going to be released
[02:55:47.580 --> 02:55:49.580]  Because everyone is afraid
[02:55:49.740 --> 02:55:54.140]  China, russia, they're all afraid. We're going to hit them first. So everybody's going to go up
[02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:57.580]  Because nobody wants to get caught with their birds on the ground
[02:55:59.020 --> 02:56:01.020]  It's the end of the world
[02:56:01.020 --> 02:56:04.380]  And that's standard exactly. So what do you think the bankers are doing?
[02:56:04.380 --> 02:56:08.620]  I mean, I've never called for a military coup, but at a certain point. I mean, this is getting out of control
[02:56:10.700 --> 02:56:15.580]  Yeah, that's I mean I listened to your show and I think you got a pretty good handle on the banker
[02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:20.780]  I'm not really an economic expert. They must have some pretty good bunkers
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:23.820]  They're going to go down into and wait this thing out if it goes up
[02:56:25.500 --> 02:56:29.900]  Well, that's the thing I I'm not a nuclear expert like you, but I've studied the textbooks on it
[02:56:29.900 --> 02:56:34.300]  If there's the northern hemisphere will be unlivable for 50 years or so
[02:56:34.540 --> 02:56:38.460]  I mean, you'll have massive cancer rates 10 20,000 times of the rdr
[02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:44.220]  Southern hemisphere won't be as bad. But I mean, it'll create a nuclear winter probably the temperatures will drop
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:47.100]  We might have winners, you know, where it's like Minnesota and Texas
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:49.820]  I mean this
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:53.980]  I mean for everybody living in the in the west, it's the end of the world. I mean, is that what you've got, sir?
[02:56:55.500 --> 02:56:57.500]  Well, I think it's not just the one thing that's going to happen
[02:56:57.500 --> 02:57:03.340]  Well, I think it's not just the west. I think all over the world is going to be pretty bad
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:09.100]  No, I know, but I'm worried about me. I mean, I'll be honest at that point. Yeah, sure china russia. It's going to be molten as well
[02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:16.460]  Yeah, I would say, you know, look at your map if you live near a military base, you're probably a target
[02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:20.220]  Yeah, so I'm in austin surrounded by military bases. I'm dead
[02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:23.340]  Yep, pretty much
[02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:30.060]  What they'll send up one it'll pop up and with 20 20 warheads, maybe 10 of them are real just just just aimed at ford hood
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:35.660]  In fact, how many merves do you think they'd fired just at ford hood? They'd probably watch they probably might have signed five
[02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:39.100]  ICBMs to ford hood, wouldn't they? So that'd be sure I can
[02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:42.300]  I can talk about russian stuff. No problem
[02:57:42.940 --> 02:57:48.140]  Well, we'll tell us uh, I mean from what I've read they would probably try to hit something like ford hood with just
[02:57:48.140 --> 02:57:54.460]  Five ICBMs alone and they might have as many as a hundred warheads in in in in there
[02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:56.460]  That would that would not feel very good. Would it?
[02:57:58.140 --> 02:58:00.540]  No, no, you'd probably be a crispy critter
[02:58:03.740 --> 02:58:05.660]  I wonder if there's anywhere safe
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:09.980]  Go ahead. Sorry if you can get underground, you know, the global bankers my guess is they got
[02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:15.340]  Nice deep underground condos somewhere and they're gonna, you know, when it happens, they're gonna just
[02:58:15.340 --> 02:58:21.020]  Kick back and you know laugh at the rest of us. I guess and they've been setting homeland security up
[02:58:21.820 --> 02:58:24.780]  For reemerging to restore order after they've done it
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:29.820]  This is this could be the coup against america by the new world order is good as a new war with russia and china
[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:33.980]  And that's that's actually what scousin says, but he thinks it's coming down the road. It could be coming now
[02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:39.500]  Sir, i'm gonna come back to you. We're gonna do 30 minutes of overdrive. We're gonna go to david frankie scott david
[02:58:39.500 --> 02:58:41.500]  We're going to all of you stay there passman

[03:00:05.980 --> 03:00:11.660]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[03:00:12.300 --> 03:00:20.540]  Well, so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas
[03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:23.260]  alex jones
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:25.740]  All right, we're going to finish up with past man
[03:00:26.380 --> 03:00:28.380]  nuclear launch officer retired
[03:00:28.780 --> 03:00:31.580]  Then we're going to go to david and then scott
[03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:33.900]  and then
[03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:35.900]  frankie and and david
[03:00:39.340 --> 03:00:44.780]  By the way, you cannot overemphasize how serious this is this is not hype here
[03:00:45.180 --> 03:00:48.540]  i mean i can have the former head of the treasury on i can have a former, you know
[03:00:48.540 --> 03:00:54.540]  A specialist in all sorts of secret operations dr. Corsi on it's all the same analysis
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:01:00.620]  And it's what the the russians are saying you people are insane. You're like a monkey with a hand grenade. Leave us alone
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:07.260]  And again, i've been no fan of the russians, but our own globalist put the bolshevik sin that's now been declassified
[03:01:07.260 --> 03:01:11.100]  It's public it's these bankers folks. They have just been screwing everybody over
[03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:13.660]  playing us off against each other
[03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:15.660]  And i talked to a major defense contractor
[03:01:15.660 --> 03:01:18.620]  A billionaire who left the us five years ago
[03:01:19.180 --> 03:01:24.220]  To an island off australia saying there won't be an america in five years. That was five years ago
[03:01:24.220 --> 03:01:28.220]  I don't know if this could have been playing that far back, but she wouldn't say what it was
[03:01:28.780 --> 03:01:35.180]  Uh past man other points about this madness any of your colleagues you've talked to where you think this is going
[03:01:37.420 --> 03:01:43.660]  Well, the only thing i can say is it's my opinion that if one nuclear weapon goes off they all go off
[03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:47.660]  That's as much as i'm comfort saying it's my opinion
[03:01:49.260 --> 03:01:52.380]  Well, that is the default they call it what total commitment
[03:01:52.940 --> 03:01:57.500]  I mean a lot of this has come out in congressional hearings that all the subs come up and launch their
[03:01:58.220 --> 03:02:00.220]  their cruise missiles and their
[03:02:00.460 --> 03:02:02.460]  Their icbm's i guess their medium range
[03:02:03.260 --> 03:02:05.260]  and then i guess
[03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:11.180]  And then i guess they've got all those intercontinental ballistic missiles still got some of those and then they've got
[03:02:11.180 --> 03:02:18.220]  All the bombers and then i guess it's just total commitment and then i guess they use special forces deployed along the russian border to use
[03:02:19.260 --> 03:02:25.420]  Those to destroy a sub basis man. We're talking about a lot of radiation here any idea how many nukes will go off
[03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:29.180]  And isn't something like 40 000 if they have a big nuclear war?
[03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:34.860]  Yeah, I think it's less than that now at least uh what I read
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:38.060]  I don't know how much of the numbers are classified
[03:02:38.060 --> 03:02:42.220]  So I I don't think I should say that but that's all the stuff we're told is complete bull
[03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:49.020]  You know the air forces leaked one time that they've developed stuff beyond nuclear weapons. So we'll be lucky. They don't blow the whole planet up
[03:02:50.940 --> 03:02:52.940]  That's true
[03:02:52.940 --> 03:02:54.940]  We'll be lucky if they don't
[03:02:56.300 --> 03:03:02.940]  Do you agree with the with the folks we had on earlier saying this is probably the most dangerous time ever even worse than the cuban missile crisis?
[03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:06.300]  It sounds like it's a big deal
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:09.580]  It sounds like it to me. It really does
[03:03:14.540 --> 03:03:16.940]  What about russia and china they might blink
[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:19.980]  I mean they've already kind of sold out to the globalists. I mean they could just
[03:03:20.540 --> 03:03:25.260]  They could just submit and say okay you rule. I mean maybe the globalists think that's what they're going to do
[03:03:26.860 --> 03:03:29.740]  Yeah, it doesn't work that way. You know we we uh
[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:35.100]  Uh, I think well, man, I can't say that
[03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:38.780]  I think russia and china target everybody
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:45.180]  Yeah, including each other that's on record. Yeah. Yeah, and nobody can nobody can sit on the sidelines in this
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:48.620]  So, you know take that for what it is
[03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:54.140]  Well, no, I mean it was declassified that russia approached in what 1964
[03:03:54.940 --> 03:03:59.020]  Uh, that was came out last year approached the us and asked for a joint strike on china
[03:03:59.020 --> 03:04:04.220]  So that shows how crazy the russians are they already wanted to have a nuclear war with china. Is that what you were getting at?
[03:04:05.580 --> 03:04:10.380]  Yeah, yeah that and just that everybody targets everybody so there's not there's not uh
[03:04:11.100 --> 03:04:17.260]  When this thing happens, it's not going to be you know a slow dance one two three. It's just going to be shoot the work
[03:04:19.260 --> 03:04:21.260]  Exactly everything's pre-targeted drilled
[03:04:21.660 --> 03:04:27.100]  And it's just pavlovian turn the keys enter the you know enter the launch sequence when you've got the code and fire the weapons
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:33.740]  Yeah, what we say in the missile business is read a step do a step feed a banana turn the key
[03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:38.860]  Monkey with a hand grenade
[03:04:40.780 --> 03:04:44.780]  Oh, man, I hope when this is all over people go dig the glove list out of their rat holes, man
[03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:48.140]  That's that's somebody record this and save it. Just make sure
[03:04:48.780 --> 03:04:50.780]  Make sure they all get hung high
[03:04:50.780 --> 03:04:55.260]  God bless you sir. We'll be right back and take more calls stay with us david and frankie and scott and david

[03:08:29.900 --> 03:08:33.420]  All right, we're live ladies and gentlemen into overdrive going to
[03:08:34.540 --> 03:08:40.380]  military veterans calls about the concern of nuclear war starting with russia and china backed up as proxies
[03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:46.940]  And we've had a bunch of top experts on dr. Corsi dr. Roberts. They have been saying that's probably what this could lead to
[03:08:47.740 --> 03:08:52.540]  Um, and then once iran starts attacking people. I mean, this is a big political diversion
[03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:58.460]  It's a perfect reason for homeland security to take over society and the globalist hate americans more than anybody
[03:08:59.020 --> 03:09:02.220]  And during a major war even if it's just a theater war
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:08.620]  Regional war with iran attacking israel back and forth chemical weapons being used scud missiles iran's announced that
[03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:14.140]  They're gonna be able to clamp down stage some events. I ran might even pull the trigger on sleeper cells
[03:09:14.140 --> 03:09:19.420]  There'll be real events and then that's an excuse to just go about their business robbing the pension funds
[03:09:19.820 --> 03:09:26.140]  Everything else will just salute the flag. Uh, we're talking to david and maryland former army. What's your take on this, sir?
[03:09:27.340 --> 03:09:28.860]  Yeah, alex
[03:09:28.860 --> 03:09:32.060]  The one thing that a lot of people don't realize is how close we are
[03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:40.220]  If you do look at the death con level, they got it listed at five now and that that should wake people up
[03:09:42.460 --> 03:09:48.460]  Well go go guys pull up the death con thing from norad and uh and and shayan mountain and uh
[03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:53.180]  We can pull up a graphic and show people the different death cons explain to people what the death con system is
[03:09:53.180 --> 03:10:01.020]  That's where it tells you where your alert level is how high the alert is and we're sitting pretty darn high
[03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:11.660]  What is your take uh on on the the fact that there's evidence overwhelming evidence that the syrian rebels
[03:10:12.140 --> 03:10:17.100]  Uh launched the chemical attack and there's even videos of it and even carrey and carney
[03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:19.740]  Uh are saying oh, this is um
[03:10:19.740 --> 03:10:26.540]  Um, no big deal. Who even who did it? We've just got to go in now when it's their rebels they put in that did it
[03:10:26.860 --> 03:10:28.860]  It's amazing
[03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:34.620]  And most people are aware of it. There are a lot of people that know there are a lot of people that talk about it
[03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:37.260]  But what do you do? I mean, I talked to
[03:10:38.380 --> 03:10:42.620]  Out the wazoo to people when it just you know, sometimes it seems like it's just bouncing off people's heads
[03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:50.060]  Uh, then you look around you see you watch what happened with miley sires and that do you wonder how come
[03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:52.620]  Our society's gotten so decadent
[03:10:52.780 --> 03:10:57.180]  Well, you know a lot of the times there's not even a death con going on but the fact that it's in five
[03:10:57.740 --> 03:11:01.180]  Uh for people I've talked to they say it's more like in death con three or two
[03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:04.460]  And once this bombing starts it's going to go to death con two
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:07.740]  And I guess death con ones go ahead and launch all the missiles, isn't it?
[03:11:07.740 --> 03:11:10.620]  Mm-hmm exactly
[03:11:13.180 --> 03:11:17.020]  So that's all I had to say on the subject. Well, I guess well god bless you sir
[03:11:17.020 --> 03:11:21.340]  I guess we got to let the bankers play god though. Let them blow everything up. You know, they're the government
[03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:23.820]  They've got fancy suits and ties. It must be okay
[03:11:24.700 --> 03:11:29.820]  It's okay for them to fund al-qaeda. Okay for them to start a nuclear war scott and jennessey than frankie and david
[03:11:30.140 --> 03:11:32.140]  Uh scott you're on the air go ahead
[03:11:32.380 --> 03:11:34.380]  Hey, what's up, man? Uh
[03:11:34.380 --> 03:11:35.420]  I'm just
[03:11:35.420 --> 03:11:37.900]  Gonna go ahead and tell you. I'm not as you know
[03:11:38.540 --> 03:11:41.980]  Special and everything is these other guests you've had. I know did you hear those?
[03:11:42.220 --> 03:11:46.860]  Well, yeah, I mean you hear those two other guys. I know that stuff. They were the real deal. Do you hear those guys?
[03:11:47.500 --> 03:11:50.700]  Yeah, I heard them and you know, I'm just I was just a meat for the grinder
[03:11:50.700 --> 03:11:55.660]  I was a rifleman and I reckoned up in a stand. Hey, buddy. That's important. That's that's important right there
[03:11:55.900 --> 03:12:00.460]  Uh, well, you know, I learned a lot about life, but you know, I'm gonna stay on topic here
[03:12:00.860 --> 03:12:03.980]  a lot of people are talking about the nuclear end of it and you know
[03:12:03.980 --> 03:12:05.500]  I'm
[03:12:05.500 --> 03:12:11.660]  You know, that's very possible and let's just go ahead and assume that cereal will be attacked by united states uk
[03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:12.860]  whatever
[03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:15.260]  But I as much as it breaks my heart
[03:12:15.340 --> 03:12:19.900]  I have to disagree with dr. Roberts when he said that other than nuclear
[03:12:20.540 --> 03:12:23.340]  options russian china have no response and
[03:12:23.900 --> 03:12:28.780]  I just want to go ahead and remind everybody that how powerful they are economically
[03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:34.620]  I mean they own together trillions of dollars worth of treasuries that they could dump overnight
[03:12:34.700 --> 03:12:39.580]  They wouldn't even have to fire a single shot and no, no, I agree with you and I think roberts is wrong
[03:12:39.740 --> 03:12:45.660]  I think they're very close to I don't think he's fully wrong. I think he's intelligent. I respect his view, but
[03:12:46.620 --> 03:12:48.860]  Of course, he thinks they're going to do it too. The question is
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:51.500]  You know, is there any way for sanity prevail?
[03:12:51.900 --> 03:12:55.740]  You know, can they have the joint chief come back out and say it's a bad idea as they've already done?
[03:12:55.740 --> 03:12:59.500]  I mean, we're seeing a lot of good signs. This would have already happened with these crazies
[03:12:59.980 --> 03:13:06.060]  Look chaining had them attack russia held areas when the russians rolled in medium range mobile missile trucks
[03:13:06.380 --> 03:13:07.980]  They pulled out
[03:13:07.980 --> 03:13:12.620]  Because they had nato troops landing to back them up the russians came and rolled in so let's get it on right now
[03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:15.020]  and rolled their nukes in so
[03:13:15.020 --> 03:13:16.780]  uh
[03:13:16.780 --> 03:13:22.380]  That's the thing. I just don't get it. It's like these psychos have to play this game because it's the only thing that excites them
[03:13:22.380 --> 03:13:28.460]  I think that's what's part of this and also what the gentlemen said earlier about how war is the health of the state
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:34.780]  They need this as a diversion. Maybe they're just doing this and escalating as a diversion from the scandals
[03:13:34.780 --> 03:13:37.740]  Maybe they won't do it. What else do you think we could do to stop this?
[03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:46.060]  Well, I don't think there's much stopping it. I mean, it's a long convoluted plan that's been going back since 1913 for
[03:13:46.860 --> 03:13:48.540]  domination and
[03:13:48.540 --> 03:13:55.420]  As long as the petro dollar remains in effect, uh, there's not much that can be done to stop anything that you guys want to do
[03:13:55.500 --> 03:14:01.100]  So we'll just so we're just gonna let goldman sacks and jp morgan and the dutch and british royalty and the rothschilds and rocker fellers
[03:14:01.900 --> 03:14:07.020]  Just just run around and murder everybody and take our rights and bankrupt everything and deindustrializes
[03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:10.700]  I mean a certain point people people know who's doing this
[03:14:11.820 --> 03:14:15.900]  And they do and but it's a cycle. It's just you know, it's just like a solar system
[03:14:15.900 --> 03:14:21.500]  A sun forms itself. It gets great and powerful and big and bright and then it caves in on itself
[03:14:21.580 --> 03:14:26.140]  And then it blows up and then it blows up and maybe takes everything around it with it, you know
[03:14:26.220 --> 03:14:32.540]  So unfortunately, there's a natural cycle to things even psychopaths and bankers. There's natural cycles
[03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:38.620]  No, they destroy themselves everybody with them. Uh, and I think that's what roberts was saying then he just says we're doomed
[03:14:38.620 --> 03:14:46.060]  Exactly and you know being prepared is probably the best thing you can do to help yourself and your friends and your family
[03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:52.460]  And you know, there's not much. I mean look at we're just the tions, you know, what can we do?
[03:14:52.540 --> 03:14:56.300]  Well, I'll say this they morally destroyed us. That's why it's so devilish. It's beyond humans
[03:14:56.620 --> 03:14:58.620]  They turned us all into a bunch of idiots
[03:14:58.620 --> 03:15:01.740]  Not everybody nine percent approval rating for this war, you know, I think there's hope
[03:15:01.740 --> 03:15:08.540]  I just think people better get how much danger we're in and better make some phone calls and and and pray and
[03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:11.660]  Politically do whatever you got to pull your money out of the big banks
[03:15:11.820 --> 03:15:15.980]  Let them know why you're doing it and realize these corporations that are running things are our enemy
[03:15:16.060 --> 03:15:22.860]  I mean, they are our enemy. Uh, let's go ahead. I mean these bankers put the commies in man. We owe russia an apology
[03:15:23.580 --> 03:15:25.580]  uh, let's go ahead and talk to uh
[03:15:25.580 --> 03:15:31.980]  Franky and then david franky from new jersey. I give us your take on this. You say your government agency intelligence. Go ahead
[03:15:36.380 --> 03:15:38.380]  Franky go ahead buddy
[03:15:38.700 --> 03:15:44.540]  All right, go back to david and see if franky comes back david uh in indiana. You're on the air say you're a vet
[03:15:44.620 --> 03:15:46.620]  What's your take on this?
[03:15:46.940 --> 03:15:48.940]  but you know, alex uh
[03:15:49.180 --> 03:15:50.860]  russia china
[03:15:50.860 --> 03:15:56.540]  United states european union japan they all got eyes in the sky over there they if there is a
[03:15:57.100 --> 03:16:00.940]  A missile launch with gas they could take it right back
[03:16:01.820 --> 03:16:06.700]  To wherever it came from and then they could follow those trucks back to the dump. They got it from
[03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:11.980]  You know if they want if they want war it it's because they want war
[03:16:12.380 --> 03:16:16.780]  They're not trying to diffuse this thing at all because they could make united states
[03:16:16.780 --> 03:16:21.500]  look like a first class lion idiot if they wanted to
[03:16:23.500 --> 03:16:30.460]  Absolutely and and and look we we have the videos that the muslim extremists always videotape themselves loading the the mortars
[03:16:31.180 --> 03:16:35.100]  Uh, and and and and engaging and they've been caught three separate times
[03:16:35.740 --> 03:16:40.060]  Uh, they've been caught. I mean they've been caught. It's not like it's russian media or whatever it's it's you know world
[03:16:40.060 --> 03:16:43.500]  And daily others. I mean it's their training videos on their established sites
[03:16:43.500 --> 03:16:48.860]  They're very very proud of themselves and it shows the total disdain that the establishment has for everybody
[03:16:49.340 --> 03:16:53.260]  Uh, yeah, you know, they're preparing this new fake dossier or whatever
[03:16:53.260 --> 03:16:57.740]  But you know, of course they've got zoom in of everything that happened they could show us
[03:16:58.300 --> 03:17:01.020]  Of course, they can also show us forest gump shaking hands with
[03:17:02.780 --> 03:17:07.900]  lbj so they can also put out fake stuff, but regardless why would a sod do something like this?
[03:17:09.100 --> 03:17:11.340]  Well, you know, it's it's a globalist
[03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:14.060]  You know show, you know
[03:17:15.580 --> 03:17:22.940]  He's a little bit backward. I think so, you know, he's just probably the the number one manipulated person in this whole game
[03:17:24.460 --> 03:17:26.460]  Talking about a sod. Yeah
[03:17:29.180 --> 03:17:32.380]  Well, there's the al-qaeda rebels loading the chemical warhead
[03:17:33.740 --> 03:17:36.380]  And they they they announced they did they're very proud of it
[03:17:36.380 --> 03:17:43.900]  And wax they got the dog on patriot batteries sprinkled around, uh, you know, there's no way in the world
[03:17:44.140 --> 03:17:51.420]  That they don't know where where these things come they could take the vibration tell you if it's a 16-wheeler or a 32-wheeler going down the highway
[03:17:51.980 --> 03:17:53.500]  You know, it's all
[03:17:53.500 --> 03:17:59.820]  All energy transferage frequency these people got the capability if they want war they're going to have it
[03:17:59.820 --> 03:18:06.460]  They're going to bring it about, you know and and all together. There's no there's nobody being duped here
[03:18:07.820 --> 03:18:13.180]  Russians aren't duped the Chinese aren't duped. We're not duped. You know, it's it. You know, you want to
[03:18:15.260 --> 03:18:20.140]  You want to depopulate, you know, you depopulate that's right. All right. Well, folks
[03:18:20.220 --> 03:18:25.100]  I appreciate your call drink your fluoride eat your GMOs to give your kids all the shots
[03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:30.620]  And they'll probably die when they're 15 20 years old. You'll get to take them and put them in the ground
[03:18:31.260 --> 03:18:34.140]  After the doctors torture them for about two years and suck everything out of them
[03:18:34.700 --> 03:18:37.580]  And I guess that's it. We just submit to evil and that's the end of it
[03:18:38.380 --> 03:18:40.540]  Everybody wants to be evil. Everybody thinks evil's cool
[03:18:41.580 --> 03:18:43.580]  And that's just the way it is
[03:18:43.660 --> 03:18:47.820]  And Kerry can go doesn't matter who did the chemical weapons. We're gonna attack and and it's his people doing it
[03:18:48.140 --> 03:18:52.860]  Like the guy who gave the order on record, you know, he runs the state department and the rebels worked for him
[03:18:52.860 --> 03:18:55.420]  And then he's up there. I mean, it's just it's just so sick
