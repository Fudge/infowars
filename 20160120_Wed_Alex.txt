[00:21.840 --> 00:28.560]  well the Bilderberg group meets in secret to push world government but Davos is
[00:28.560 --> 00:32.880]  basically made up of the exact same people and over a thousand members of
[00:32.880 --> 00:38.560]  the media and jetliners landing full of prostitutes they're high atop a mountain
[00:38.560 --> 00:44.180]  right now in Davos Switzerland and they are scheming on how to basically
[00:44.180 --> 00:48.560]  further enslave the middle class here's a special report the meeting to
[00:48.560 --> 00:53.280]  terminate the American middle class is underway atop a mountain of greed
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.480]  located in the highest town in the Alps Davos Switzerland from January 20th to
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.240]  January 23rd the invitation only annual globalist event of 2,500 attendees
[01:04.240 --> 01:10.640]  includes 40 heads of state a smattering of celebrities and 14 noble laureates the

[01:16.640 --> 01:23.400]  Reuters reports anti-poverty charity Oxfam announced that just 62 people 53 of
[01:23.400 --> 01:29.320]  them men own as much wealth as the poorest half of the entire world population
[01:29.320 --> 01:36.280]  and the richest 1% of those own more than the other 99% put together the wealth
[01:36.280 --> 01:41.680]  gap is widening faster than anyone anticipated with the 1% overtaking the
[01:41.680 --> 01:47.440]  rest one year earlier than Oxfam had predicted only a year ago among the key
[01:47.440 --> 01:52.600]  figures in Davos will be US Vice President Joe Biden Secretary of State
[01:52.600 --> 01:57.040]  John Kerry Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the foreign
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.880]  ministers of both Iran and Saudi Arabia as the global economy slows populism
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.080]  grows and the daily possibility of a derivative inflated bubble bursting has
[02:08.080 --> 02:13.200]  world leaders and their mega corporate banking counterparts racing to close the
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.880]  diminishing gap on the American middle class as a hasty bid to reduce the
[02:17.880 --> 02:23.000]  United States to a third world nation dominated by surveillance technology

[02:38.120 --> 02:42.840]  increase exponentially this will drive the creation of ever more sophisticated
[02:42.840 --> 02:47.840]  analysis algorithms products and companies basically trapping the American
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.440]  population like rats in a cage among the 250 closed-door meetings and elbow
[02:53.440 --> 02:58.080]  rubbing parties will be discussions about the status of job-stealing robots

[03:30.120 --> 03:34.400]  President Obama and others continue to lie about job growth which has stayed
[03:34.400 --> 03:40.520]  relatively flat in comparison to the skyrocketing corporate profit growth so
[03:40.520 --> 03:46.160]  it would only make sense that the richer the very few get the more paranoid they
[03:46.160 --> 03:50.720]  become basically we're destabilizing the world we're creating massive amounts of
[03:50.720 --> 03:59.240]  fear and we're spending all of our money on surveillance and control and I have a
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.520]  slide from Medard de Bell on how much we spend on war and how if we spend the
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.680]  third of that on peace we could give every single person on the planet a
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.040]  two-story cinder block home with running water electricity and even a swimming
[04:14.040 --> 04:19.640]  pool on the injustice that is being perpetuated right now we now know that
[04:19.640 --> 04:25.280]  62 people on the planet have as much wealth as the lower 3 billion this is
[04:25.280 --> 04:29.760]  insane concentration of wealth and I have my you've showed it on your show

[05:00.560 --> 05:03.880]  community's inspector general has just revealed to lawmakers that Hillary
[05:03.880 --> 05:09.640]  Clinton had classified documents above top secret on her private email server in
[05:09.640 --> 05:14.560]  addition to over 1,300 other classified emails. Access to information in the
[05:14.560 --> 05:18.680]  special access program is more highly restricted more sensitive than top secret
[05:18.680 --> 05:23.000]  because it would likely reveal the source putting lives at risk. We're
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.200]  constantly told that our money our rule of law our liberties must all be
[05:27.200 --> 05:31.440]  sacrificed on the altar of national security. Hillary has violated the
[05:31.440 --> 05:36.160]  surveillance state's religion and she needs to be burned at the stake. Orange is
[05:36.160 --> 05:40.400]  the new pantsuit Hillary but she's being investigated by Obama's Justice
[05:40.400 --> 05:44.480]  Department and she has about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop
[05:44.480 --> 05:48.440]  if she gets away with these crimes the fraud of the surveillance state will be

[09:32.880 --> 09:37.840]  made up and pure propaganda and a fantasy world but what was the exact
[09:37.840 --> 09:42.400]  quote maybe we can find it again that our economy wasn't the strongest in the
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.840]  world and doing great and getting stronger I mean he went on for like five
[09:46.840 --> 09:57.640]  minutes it's wild we're going to be going over this today and opening the

[10:37.040 --> 10:43.880]  Oval Office the globalists have pushed for this for a long time they are very
[10:43.880 --> 10:48.600]  close to having with the British Empire failed to do and that is to have a
[10:48.600 --> 10:59.320]  complete planetary government it is a very very incredible time to be alive
[10:59.320 --> 11:06.960]  another headline from drudgerport.com chip enables brain to communicate
[11:06.960 --> 11:14.560]  directly with computer scientists find evidence of ninth planet in the solar
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.840]  system after delisting Pluto as a planet naming an old member of the
[11:19.840 --> 11:25.680]  hundreds of objects in the Kuiper belt but now they have found another planet
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.440]  bigger than Pluto and are looking at listing it as a planet we're gonna get
[11:32.440 --> 11:39.440]  into that today as well what an epic time to be alive women are beginning and
[11:39.440 --> 11:48.640]  polls to turn against Hillary as it comes out her brutal defense of her
[11:48.640 --> 11:55.000]  beard Bill Clinton when he would brutally write women and they would
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.960]  settle the cases she would go out to tack dog them saying they were liars and
[11:58.960 --> 12:05.080]  have her feminist surrogates attack dog them because all they are is women more
[12:05.080 --> 12:11.160]  male than men who wish to slap around and control and put their boot on other
[12:11.160 --> 12:17.560]  women's throats they're women that want to shove men out of the way at the trough
[12:17.560 --> 12:23.600]  predatory men they want to shove them aside like rooting pigs in a slop
[12:23.600 --> 12:29.200]  feast and put their snouts in there themselves and dominate the great
[12:29.200 --> 12:38.600]  feminine energy they're not feminine at all they're dogs global warming major
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.880]  snowstorm may threaten DC New York but again they're saying it's global warming
[12:42.880 --> 12:48.160]  that's some of the stories up on info wars.com 13 hours with the CIA and
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.640]  Hillary don't want you to see who will lead the UN to world domination another
[12:54.640 --> 13:03.040]  very important report that's just some of the news up on info wars.com and
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.880]  prisonplanet.com right now another headline Lewis Farrakhan exposes the
[13:09.880 --> 13:18.400]  real white devils. Oh yes that video is up on the site and we will be premiering
[13:18.400 --> 13:31.720]  today an hour long boil down of the two-hour Lewis Farrakhan interview that
[13:31.720 --> 13:43.080]  I conducted two weeks ago today or yesterday in Phoenix Arizona and then
[13:43.080 --> 13:49.480]  the full interview two plus hours we'll go up this afternoon on info wars.com
[13:49.480 --> 13:54.600]  and we might as well just get the article from their newspaper final call
[13:54.600 --> 13:58.200]  that's a transcript of much of the interview and just post that and post
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.960]  the video in with it but there are several excerpts we haven't aired yet
[14:02.960 --> 14:07.080]  ahead of that today where Lewis Farrakhan dares the mainstream media to
[14:07.080 --> 14:11.920]  actually report on what he says in this interview and we also talks about the
[14:11.920 --> 14:16.200]  Federal Reserve the foreign banking cartel that controls America and a lot
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.920]  of people will say hey I hate Lewis Farrakhan he's the black racist that
[14:20.920 --> 14:27.600]  says that white people are basically the devil and cannot be reformed and Lewis
[14:27.600 --> 14:37.200]  Farrakhan did say that 30 years ago and he said less sensational less infamous
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.520]  things since then but still very incendiary that are taken and put on the
[14:42.520 --> 14:46.320]  news out of context and I'm not defending everything he said I'm simply
[14:46.320 --> 14:51.560]  trying to have a coup against the globalist and people like George Soros
[14:51.560 --> 14:56.360]  that won a race war in this country for destabilization that if the Liberty
[14:56.360 --> 15:06.640]  Movement can deescalate the developed fissures that are in the community some
[15:06.640 --> 15:12.200]  real some exacerbated between whites and blacks and others and come together
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.640]  against the real threat the New World Order that is manipulating our genetics
[15:17.640 --> 15:25.000]  that is poisoning our water that is forcing inoculations on us that is
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.720]  engaged in just incredible levels of oppression if we can do that it is a
[15:31.720 --> 15:39.000]  giant victory now I'm not likening Lewis Farrakhan to Hitler but let's use
[15:39.000 --> 15:48.080]  that analogy if I could meet with Hitler in 1935 when he been in power two
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.360]  years but hadn't committed giant atrocities yet and hadn't been
[15:53.360 --> 15:57.200]  manipulated by the West which has been declassified into starting World War
[15:57.200 --> 16:01.560]  2 we could have changed the course of history if somebody else could have
[16:01.560 --> 16:08.840]  talked to Hitler and gotten Hitler to change his views and to grow and to get
[16:08.840 --> 16:15.760]  outside the controlled paradigm imagine how the world would be different today
[16:15.760 --> 16:23.560]  now I use that allegory to pick a really bad guy to compare to Farrakhan not
[16:23.560 --> 16:30.000]  because I think that fits but just for the sake of argument if you could get
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.480]  Hitler to change his mind why wouldn't you go and try to do it like Muhammad
[16:34.480 --> 16:41.480]  Gandhi who was friends with Hitler did in multiple letters the two were pen
[16:41.480 --> 16:52.680]  pals both didn't like the British Empire you can judge Gandhi for that but
[16:52.680 --> 16:57.560]  Hitler was seen as a reformer even by liberals in Europe and the United States
[16:57.560 --> 17:02.560]  until about 1939 he was Time Magazine man of the year twice so what I'm getting
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.480]  at here he was in gardening magazines and vegetarian magazines and my
[17:07.480 --> 17:11.040]  grandfather remember you're hearing Dallas radio praise him and play his
[17:11.040 --> 17:21.840]  speeches and translated into English it's the same thing if I could meet with
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.680]  Obama and get him to change his mind and change his worldview or grow I would do
[17:25.680 --> 17:32.560]  it if I could meet with David Duke and do that I had David Duke on and it was
[17:32.560 --> 17:38.240]  all just about scoring points and and I was literally trying to just get him to
[17:38.240 --> 17:42.040]  understand there's a larger threat against humanity than the threats he is
[17:42.040 --> 17:47.360]  postulating and that people need to come together and just be against eugenics and
[17:47.360 --> 17:51.960]  he just didn't want to hear it and folks said oh David Duke won the debate it
[17:51.960 --> 17:57.040]  wasn't really a debate it was me trying to have a discussion with somebody that
[17:57.040 --> 18:01.920]  is incendiary and that is a major leader probably the greatest quote white
[18:01.920 --> 18:07.080]  nationalist leader in the world in fact I think undoubtedly hands down well
[18:07.080 --> 18:12.360]  Lewis Farrakhan I was thinking about this last night talking to Rob dude and
[18:12.360 --> 18:17.120]  talking to Josh Owens back there in their offices actually did a Facebook
[18:17.120 --> 18:22.640]  mentioned so it's on video where we were just thinking aloud saying you know
[18:22.640 --> 18:31.360]  Lewis Farrakhan is in the top 10 most famous black people in history and in
[18:31.360 --> 18:37.120]  the last 100 years he's in the top five or six and currently he's probably the
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.440]  second most influential famous black person in the world after Barack Obama
[18:41.440 --> 18:48.200]  when we talk about politics not not sports because that that comes and goes
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.880]  videos Farrakhan dash new poison found in water because part of it's about Farrakhan
[18:53.880 --> 19:00.120]  the other parts about what they found in the Flint water because it's Barack
[19:00.120 --> 19:03.000]  Obama than it's Lewis Farrakhan I mean obviously you could say it's somebody
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.800]  like Nelson Mandela even more famous than him Martin Luther King Malcolm X
[19:09.800 --> 19:17.440]  about as famous as Lewis Farrakhan maybe more so with pop culture and so it's
[19:17.440 --> 19:21.960]  important to do these type of things and that's why we did it and it's a very
[19:21.960 --> 19:28.920]  thought-provoking interview the full two hour basically nothing's cut out it's
[19:28.920 --> 19:31.680]  not a proper term to say unedited because we take parts where he talks
[19:31.680 --> 19:35.280]  about the same subject here and then an hour later we put that together put a
[19:35.280 --> 19:39.280]  lot of interesting historical clips in it's kind of a documentary that's gonna
[19:39.280 --> 19:43.120]  go up the next few hours and in full wars dot com but we're gonna air large
[19:43.120 --> 19:48.720]  excerpts about an hour of it coming up at the bottom of the next hour through the

[22:05.800 --> 22:09.040]  protect you from electronic pickpocketing 10 years ago I created a way to
[22:09.040 --> 22:12.000]  protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.200]  talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID
[22:16.200 --> 22:19.920]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[22:19.920 --> 22:24.440]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports
[22:24.440 --> 22:29.440]  hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID it was
[22:29.440 --> 22:32.920]  then I formed ID stronghold to share my inventions and blocking RFID signals
[22:32.920 --> 22:36.880]  with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID

[24:13.760 --> 24:23.840]  all I ask you to have a clear phone and be ready 800-259-9231-1800-2599231 I am
[24:23.840 --> 24:29.360]  Alex Jones your host I don't know where to start every day now there's like five
[24:29.360 --> 24:35.680]  or six new videos of the migrants in Europe stabbing people robbing people
[24:35.680 --> 24:40.160]  trying to rape women raping women running around burning things shooting
[24:40.160 --> 24:45.520]  guns in the air hijacking cars and then articles where the police will attack
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.000]  anybody that demonstrates against it I mean I've got a stack of news and now
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.880]  Afghans saying I can't stand being in Europe I want to kill the Europeans and
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.560]  eat them I mean it just gets crazier and crazier you have these liberal aid
[24:58.560 --> 25:03.120]  workers try to bring food and stuff and they get robbed and stabbed I mean it's
[25:03.120 --> 25:11.640]  just over the top and then you ask why is Europe doing this because they want
[25:11.640 --> 25:18.320]  to break the West they want to make a submit but then there's good news Texas
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.720]  battling against tyranny as usual Supreme Court to hear Obama immigration
[25:23.720 --> 25:26.840]  challenge and I know this came out yesterday we mentioned it but notice
[25:26.840 --> 25:34.320]  it's Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who's leading 26 states in this lawsuit
[25:34.320 --> 25:39.080]  and now beginning lawsuits on the gun executive orders meanwhile Larry
[25:39.080 --> 25:45.040]  Klayman who successfully got the NSA spying overturned for over a year until
[25:45.040 --> 25:51.120]  another court reversed it now he's battling there he's introduced a lawsuit
[25:51.120 --> 26:01.520]  to stop Obama's executive gun control grab but let's go back to Ken Paxton
[26:01.520 --> 26:06.240]  remember last year I said Paxton is filing suit on this and on shutting down
[26:06.240 --> 26:11.920]  our power plants and on going after the guns at that time on executive actions
[26:11.920 --> 26:18.600]  and so what they do they indicted him through Democrats they control and
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.320]  through the politicized state police I'm not saying all the state police are
[26:23.320 --> 26:29.000]  bad but they've been federalized folks for all intents and purposes it's very
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.160]  very sad and they had a dinner he talked to three people about a stock he thought
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.000]  was good when they asked him and he'd forgotten to file a piece of paper that
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.440]  he was a financial instrument salesman basically a stock seller and that he was
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.520]  involved in the company even though he hadn't been involved and or trading the
[26:51.520 --> 26:57.800]  stocks in over a year and a half and all these other lawyers and experts looked
[26:57.800 --> 27:02.160]  at it and said it's it's it's it's not even unethical they don't care see
[27:02.160 --> 27:07.000]  Hillary can take billions from foreign dictators to sell weapons and an order
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.560]  to stand down in Benghazi and be involved in all these other crimes and
[27:11.560 --> 27:15.520]  Obama can have the IRS persecuting people publicly and be caught lying and
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.320]  she can be caught lying with classified emails and it's no problem but the
[27:20.320 --> 27:27.920]  Texas Attorney General a protégé of the governor who was Attorney General
[27:27.920 --> 27:34.280]  stands up and they've indicted him see they don't come as redcoats like they
[27:34.280 --> 27:43.360]  did in 1776 to arrest the founding fathers they come with kangaroo courts
[27:43.360 --> 27:50.360]  and in Travis County and in one other Texas County run by Democrats you see
[27:50.360 --> 27:58.120]  them go after Ken lay and then he magically just disappears when he's
[27:58.120 --> 28:04.400]  supposedly going to be sent to prison and that's because the Republicans and
[28:04.400 --> 28:09.320]  the Democrats at the top are basically the same people but you look at places
[28:09.320 --> 28:17.120]  like Texas where people aren't doing anything wrong and they're being
[28:17.120 --> 28:24.000]  persecuted and of course it was in Ron and Al Gore and all the rest of them who
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.640]  developed the carbon tax fraud idea bipartisan just like Republicans came
[28:28.640 --> 28:33.280]  up with the Obamacare screw job then they have their Democrat lackeys run it
[28:33.280 --> 28:38.640]  through over their idiot constituents and I know I'm digressing it's just out
[28:38.640 --> 28:42.200]  of all the news there's so much of it here I mean I'm swimming in it new
[28:42.200 --> 28:45.960]  planets being discovered in the solar system and this crazy stuff in the
[28:45.960 --> 28:53.080]  economy worldwide meltdowns happening oil plunging all the rest of it federal
[28:53.080 --> 28:58.400]  land grabs going on all over the country but with the backdrop all over the
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.920]  United States and all over Europe they are inditing and arresting people for
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.320]  their speech in France in Germany they don't even hide it if you're a member of
[29:09.320 --> 29:12.880]  the Congress or the Parliament or the government or you're the number one
[29:12.880 --> 29:20.800]  presidential candidate and the leader of the fastest-growing party in France
[29:22.640 --> 29:27.320]  you're the daughter of one of the most famous statesman and you say we're
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.840]  under Islamic invasion and they arrested her and now they're finding her and
[29:30.840 --> 29:38.120]  about to arrest her again again we are under insane levels of bizarro leftist
[29:38.120 --> 29:45.240]  oppression it's not coming it's here and they're going for a broke and their
[29:45.240 --> 29:50.440]  constituents want to be screwed over we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:50.440 --> 29:56.240]  run Alex Joe's GCN radio they're lunatics they love to be abused they
[29:56.240 --> 30:04.160]  love being done serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration a real
[30:04.160 --> 30:08.120]  estate developer partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of
[30:08.120 --> 30:13.320]  Rights the developer Triple Crown Corp secured a permit to demolish a two-story
[30:13.320 --> 30:18.160]  stone building formerly known as James Bell Tavern in Silver Springs Township
[30:18.160 --> 30:22.400]  Pennsylvania by the time a third of the building was destroyed the city stopped
[30:22.400 --> 30:26.640]  the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at
[30:26.640 --> 30:31.640]  the Tavern during a 1788 meeting how appropriate that part of the building
[30:31.640 --> 30:36.240]  has been torn down while other parts remain commenter WC handy wrote to the
[30:36.240 --> 30:40.680]  local Sentinel newspaper we have a Congress that is so intent on destroying
[30:40.680 --> 30:44.880]  the Bill of Rights the building as it stands now is rather indicative of the
[30:44.880 --> 30:49.040]  current state of our Bill of Rights why not leave the building as it is to
[30:49.040 --> 30:54.280]  serve as a reminder to us all he added you can find more reports on info wars

[33:27.600 --> 33:32.040]  play right just during the break we have those little news pieces instead of
[33:32.040 --> 33:36.800]  commercials sometimes I think information is even more important than
[33:36.800 --> 33:41.280]  basically anything else we do obviously and it was your carie Jackson with a
[33:41.280 --> 33:47.400]  report about how they just demolished the birthplace of the bill of rights oh and
[33:47.400 --> 33:51.720]  then remembered it was a historic building just a microcosm of what's
[33:51.720 --> 33:56.640]  happening everywhere else across the society and then we have this report
[33:56.640 --> 34:02.080]  that I heard at the very start of the broadcast and that little five minutes
[34:02.080 --> 34:06.880]  section that some stations don't carry that John bound did on the big Davos
[34:06.880 --> 34:13.600]  meeting that is kicking off that is the public version of the builder bar group
[34:13.600 --> 34:16.360]  meeting I'm going to be talking about that a moment and on your phone calls
[34:16.360 --> 34:22.440]  and then another report we've got that David Knight filed on dumb and dumber
[34:22.440 --> 34:27.360]  smart guns that's very informative but also very very funny and I've just got
[34:27.360 --> 34:34.240]  to say the brain trust of the reporters we've got here and the quality of
[34:34.240 --> 34:38.640]  information they're putting out is unprecedented and I know that many of
[34:38.640 --> 34:44.080]  their reports get seen and heard by millions of people but then sometimes
[34:44.080 --> 34:48.120]  they put a report out I don't air it on air and it just gets 20,000 views on
[34:48.120 --> 34:51.760]  YouTube and a couple hundred thousand on the nightly news which is still great
[34:51.760 --> 34:58.360]  it's just that if the world could see that Davos report if the world could see
[34:58.360 --> 35:02.920]  what we're doing what we're covering we could really turn things around very
[35:02.920 --> 35:09.680]  very quickly because the globalist really have stolen the future they're a
[35:09.680 --> 35:12.840]  breakaway civilization and they're running with the ball towards the
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.680]  finish line the general public's in a trance still they're starting to wake
[35:17.680 --> 35:21.280]  up they're starting to figure out that something's going on and that they've
[35:21.280 --> 35:25.440]  been sleepwalking but they need to really get awake fast they need cold
[35:25.440 --> 35:31.800]  ice water in a big old you know cooler like at the end of a football game
[35:31.800 --> 35:37.040]  dumping in on the winner of the team on the head coach we need ice buckets poured
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.160]  on the American people's heads you know you had the ice bucket challenge that was
[35:42.160 --> 35:49.440]  so viral a few years ago all about raising money for was it muscular
[35:49.440 --> 35:54.320]  dystrophy or something I forget what about an ice bucket challenge to wake up
[35:54.320 --> 35:57.680]  to the tyranny and wake up to the fact that our birth rights are all being
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.120]  stolen and that's why I was so happy interview Lewis Farrakhan I mean I
[36:02.120 --> 36:06.480]  could shoot a Facebook mentions or do a YouTube video and it gets a million two
[36:06.480 --> 36:12.040]  million three million views and used to maybe every 15 videos I did got a million
[36:12.040 --> 36:15.360]  two million views now every third or fourth video does and I'm not bragging
[36:15.360 --> 36:18.520]  but I can just be sitting there talking about some news item and it gets three
[36:18.520 --> 36:22.720]  million views and then we spend thousands of dollars time energy with a
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.360]  Farrakhan interview and I hope it gets watched a million times on YouTube it
[36:28.360 --> 36:32.680]  of course will be seen by millions of people here on the air and heard but
[36:32.680 --> 36:36.280]  it's really weird like something you work incredibly hard on that you put so
[36:36.280 --> 36:42.440]  much energy into that's so important that could really change things it won't
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.480]  hit and be big and then some other little side issue or me arguing with
[36:46.480 --> 36:50.280]  somebody on the side of the street will be seen 20 million times but you know
[36:50.280 --> 36:55.320]  it's all in God's larger plan and another thing is I hear all these rave
[36:55.320 --> 37:00.400]  reviews on the street I hear all these rave reviews in the hallways by the crew
[37:00.400 --> 37:03.600]  members you know Leanne McAdoo talking about what Superfemale Vitality's done
[37:03.600 --> 37:07.840]  for her I'm gonna do a plug right now and then go to the news in your calls
[37:07.840 --> 37:11.360]  people on the street come up and you know tell me you can read the reviews
[37:11.360 --> 37:16.920]  at m4slife.com but Rob Dew who wanted to do such a good job on the big full
[37:16.920 --> 37:20.960]  Farrakhan interview that's gonna go up later this afternoon at infowars.com
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.080]  we're gonna be hearing big excerpts coming up middle the next hour he was
[37:25.080 --> 37:30.640]  sitting back there in Buckley's office talking about the rollout of the video
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.560]  today and news articles with it and things like that and I was walking by
[37:34.560 --> 37:41.040]  from the water cooler and heard him going no it's incredible you know I really
[37:41.040 --> 37:46.080]  feel great coffee just won't do it for me but I worked till 6 a.m. yesterday
[37:46.080 --> 37:50.360]  getting it finished and then came back in a few hours ago to make sure it had
[37:50.360 --> 37:53.160]  imported and dumped back out and of course the video had failed so he's
[37:53.160 --> 37:56.280]  exporting the full interview again that's what come out a little bit later
[37:56.280 --> 38:01.080]  this afternoon now you know we have done the 50 minute one 60 minute one we're
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.640]  gonna be airing on air that's the boil down he said but I tell you brain force
[38:04.640 --> 38:08.040]  is the most incredible thing I've tried other energy pills and I'm just kind of
[38:08.040 --> 38:11.720]  sitting there by the door listening because it's amazing the clean energy
[38:11.720 --> 38:15.200]  it just gave me right through and then I went slept a few hours took some more
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.040]  and I'm awake again and I step around the corner and I go I'm eavesdropping I
[38:20.040 --> 38:24.760]  said why don't you go do a video testimonial about that dude he goes oh
[38:24.760 --> 38:27.720]  yeah I should I go well you're too tired do it later but I said you know what
[38:27.720 --> 38:34.040]  it's spontaneous it's real I'm about to go do the plug of the hour which funds
[38:34.040 --> 38:37.040]  their operation if you go read about brain force that I don't promote them
[38:37.040 --> 38:42.400]  enough but it is a what they call it newtropic thought-based and it's not
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.240]  based on stimulants folks it's got some green tea extract in there it's based on
[38:46.240 --> 38:50.160]  some things that are prescription in Europe that really are brain food brains
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.000]  based on that's been key co-factors and there's a whole list of them but we set
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.680]  out to make the best brain pill and also helps other nerves in the body
[39:00.680 --> 39:11.600]  obviously but the best neurological pill we could and it's amazing absolutely
[39:11.600 --> 39:15.600]  amazing instead of having afternoon coffee I actually forgot to drink coffee
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.240]  this morning I slept a little late today didn't work out so I'm having my cup of
[39:20.240 --> 39:24.440]  coffee usually about one cup of coffee a day now and if I'm out on the road doing
[39:24.440 --> 39:27.680]  stuff I'm really tired coffee doesn't do it anymore there's just a time in your
[39:27.680 --> 39:30.280]  life where you drink two cups of coffee and you're ready to go to sleep
[39:30.280 --> 39:38.080]  actually but brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it it's got
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.760]  four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.080]  party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have
[39:47.080 --> 39:52.600]  the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off and without
[39:52.600 --> 39:57.320]  further ado I'll get back in the news but do is here in the control room which
[39:57.320 --> 39:59.800]  by the way we don't have a over-the-head shot of the control room that's
[39:59.800 --> 40:03.120]  simply amazing we'll show the TV viewers that here in a moment as well I'm very
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.760]  very proud of what we built here there on the M4s News Center looks like the deck
[40:07.760 --> 40:15.520]  of a Imperial Star Destroyer command base but Rob do joins us and was with
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.960]  George Washington banner behind him a fitting do you're amazing now I told
[40:20.960 --> 40:24.080]  you quit killing yourself four or five days ago I said the interview is
[40:24.080 --> 40:27.520]  important but my gosh you guys are like making a film here that's basically
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.720]  turning the documentaries two of them but you worked I guess like 20 plus
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.560]  hours and tell us what brain force did I guess I just repeated what I heard you
[40:37.560 --> 40:41.400]  say but tell folks what I was hiding around the corner listening to sure
[40:41.400 --> 40:45.560]  yeah so last night I get I'd been working all day I took a couple hours off
[40:45.560 --> 40:50.680]  coaching basketball with my five-year-old I get in here at 830 Josh is
[40:50.680 --> 40:56.400]  in here finishing up working and I was kind of run down you know I just didn't
[40:56.400 --> 40:59.200]  feel like I was gonna make it and I really want to do a good job on the
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.240]  interview I hadn't had an intro for it and I got my bottle of brain force right
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.680]  there I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like being everything
[41:08.680 --> 41:12.960]  just kind of clears up in your head if you have that fog people know what the
[41:12.960 --> 41:16.280]  fog is you know yeah after I got off the air after three four hours I feel like I
[41:16.280 --> 41:19.640]  would hit by a truck yeah a lot of times I forget I go wait take another brain
[41:19.640 --> 41:26.080]  force exactly and after that hit I was super strong to about 2.33 in the
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.680]  morning I took another little break walked around finished up and you know
[41:30.680 --> 41:34.160]  it's a long it's a long interview let me tell you to go through everything if you
[41:34.160 --> 41:36.800]  want you want to change one thing you got to go through make sure everything
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.400]  else has changed so it's a lot of so I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that
[41:40.400 --> 41:43.640]  in a while but I probably could not have done it without brain force and I'm
[41:43.640 --> 41:48.240]  almost sure of that and then I went home about 645 this morning took three
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.640]  hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in and I'm not gonna
[41:52.640 --> 41:58.280]  do this every day but I do want to add one more person who I got on brain force
[41:58.280 --> 42:02.720]  Travis is detoxing from coffee is what he says he's I'm trying to get caffeine
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.080]  out of my sister I don't know Travis didn't look bad but he's lost weight he
[42:06.080 --> 42:10.120]  looks more manly and he always look manly but he really he's like running
[42:10.120 --> 42:13.880]  around the office he runs around the office now and I said hey man try brain
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.000]  force he's got a plenty of foot looking as I know I'm not kidding I had it and he
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.960]  took it and I walked by 15 minutes later he's like oh my god this stuff works
[42:21.960 --> 42:28.200]  people you really won't believe it until you try it yourself and it all I could
[42:28.200 --> 42:31.680]  say is it works and it works emphatically I mean it there's it's not
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.120]  like I kind of feel better you're gonna notice the results within 15 minutes if
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.200]  you're like me and by the way I've tried whole caplets of green tea I've tried
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.400]  other stuff and again stimulants actually usually relax me that's why
[42:45.400 --> 42:48.640]  alcohol is a stimulant for me because I'm kind of the opposite I guess I'm a
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.200]  DHD that's what they said when I was in school but the point is bouncing off the
[42:53.200 --> 43:00.840]  walls lots of energy stimulants make me calm depressants make me hyper and so
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.960]  that's why I like brain force is because if I got to work till 2 3 4 in the
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.640]  morning a six pack of beer used to do it now dope not gonna do the drinking don't
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.360]  take the brain force because coffee again in the morning wakes me up makes me
[43:13.360 --> 43:16.360]  sleepy at night I'm I'm kind of digressing often this discussion this
[43:16.360 --> 43:19.560]  but I just heard the other part of your talk that yeah other stimulants don't
[43:19.560 --> 43:25.360]  work that's because this isn't really a stimulant it's got these compounds and
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.600]  in factors and it folks can read the scientific facts themselves then for
[43:28.600 --> 43:33.040]  his life.com that are building blocks in the brain for the electrochemical
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.760]  processes in the brain itself not something that just jazzes it speeds it
[43:37.760 --> 43:42.320]  all up it just allows the brain to operate with more efficiency and I think
[43:42.320 --> 43:45.480]  that's basically the way to describe it just try it folks you're supporting the
[43:45.480 --> 43:49.080]  broadcast regardless thank you so much Rob do any other points about the
[43:49.080 --> 43:53.000]  Farrakhan interview coming up. I hope people get this out to everybody I hope
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.520]  they watch the the 50 minute version I hope they watch the two hour version I
[43:56.520 --> 44:01.320]  mean it really is I mean you two guys coming together I think is a very
[44:01.320 --> 44:04.600]  positive thing in this world especially with what we're going through now and
[44:04.600 --> 44:09.280]  we need more people to come together put aside petty differences and really start
[44:09.280 --> 44:13.400]  making a stand against the people that are really trying to kill us and it's not
[44:13.400 --> 44:17.880]  each other we should not be you know trying to kill each other in the ground
[44:17.880 --> 44:22.400]  level we should all be working together to to get rid of you know the globalist
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.400]  and what they're doing to us and notice that Farrakhan has said a few
[44:25.400 --> 44:28.640]  incendiary things right around the time of the interview and right after that
[44:28.640 --> 44:32.080]  has been national news all over everything but when he says I support
[44:32.080 --> 44:36.440]  Trump not letting Muslims in till they vet who's coming in because terrorists
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.960]  are coming in when he says all this really incredible newsmaking stuff zero
[44:40.960 --> 44:45.200]  coverage because it's not what they want to portray exactly they only want to
[44:45.200 --> 44:51.000]  portray the guy is a racist hate monger and who you know doesn't want to get
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.760]  anybody together and I think that's exactly opposite of what he really is
[44:53.760 --> 44:57.000]  and I went back and looked at a bunch of old interviews of him too and he does
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.240]  say some fiery things but I think all through that and he said this in the
[45:01.240 --> 45:04.840]  interview that you did with him you know I have to look out for my people and
[45:04.840 --> 45:08.760]  then once I've done that we can all work together and I think that's his that's
[45:08.760 --> 45:12.400]  been his lifelong mission here's what I respect and I disagree with some of
[45:12.400 --> 45:16.920]  the things he said in the past and even currently but he's not a coward he sat
[45:16.920 --> 45:20.480]  down and talked to us because he knows we're real and all these other
[45:20.480 --> 45:24.040]  communist groups socialist groups establishment right wing groups they're
[45:24.040 --> 45:26.880]  all cowards they won't sit down for a real interview they don't want to debate
[45:26.880 --> 45:32.600]  their ideas they just want to sit around and take things out of context and you
[45:32.600 --> 45:35.960]  know we put some things in context where he said some really incendiary things I
[45:35.960 --> 45:41.680]  disagree with but the year he was saying you can't reform the white devils we
[45:41.680 --> 45:46.040]  cut to police dogs attacking black people and shooting them with fire hoses
[45:46.040 --> 45:49.520]  and black women being beaten over the head with Billy clubs you have to
[45:49.520 --> 45:54.640]  understand the context of when he said that and I get people's anger and
[45:54.640 --> 45:58.240]  what's happened to them but they can't take that experience now and the
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.480]  globalist use it as mind control to turn them into new political slaves on the
[46:02.480 --> 46:07.000]  Democratic Party plantation and Farrakhan agreed with that and he agreed that he
[46:07.000 --> 46:12.400]  has quote grown and changed and folks I've grown I've changed as well and that
[46:12.400 --> 46:14.840]  doesn't mean Farrakhan's gonna be perfect or I'm gonna be perfect doesn't
[46:14.840 --> 46:17.800]  mean we're all gonna hold hands and you know jump down the yellow brick road
[46:17.800 --> 46:24.080]  you know into the sunset it just means that I don't want to be in some
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.480]  mindless fight with black people or any other group when the globalist have
[46:28.480 --> 46:36.760]  farms all over the world with humanoids growing inside cows sheep pigs and
[46:36.760 --> 46:39.600]  again if you're a new listener you're saying this sounds insane it's all over
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.120]  the news this week and last week I knew about it 20 years ago and talked about
[46:43.120 --> 46:49.000]  it now it's public that they're growing humanoids and you say well aren't there
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.600]  laws no because they're not considered animal or human so they the animal
[46:53.600 --> 46:57.600]  experimentation rules don't apply and the human ones don't because they've got
[46:57.600 --> 47:03.080]  it in law they can do it 30 years ago they've got human z's they go it's just
[47:03.080 --> 47:08.960]  everything folks yes they've crossed humans with chimpanzees great apes you
[47:08.960 --> 47:13.160]  name it I mean we and I know I just keep getting back to that every day it's
[47:13.160 --> 47:17.400]  because come on folks we really got to go and fight with each other on the
[47:17.400 --> 47:22.520]  streets and you know and be stirred up by Michael Moore and George Soros I get
[47:22.520 --> 47:25.760]  some of the police are out of control it's a globalist program I get they're
[47:25.760 --> 47:28.200]  shooting people in the back they're getting indicted they're getting in
[47:28.200 --> 47:32.320]  trouble you know it kind of kills the narrative you know when it's black cops
[47:32.320 --> 47:36.480]  in the back of the truck where the guy gets beat to death and he's black there
[47:36.480 --> 47:42.600]  is police brutality a hundred and something people might as be as high as
[47:42.600 --> 47:47.360]  200 get killed questionably every year by police is 200 dead on the on the tops
[47:47.360 --> 47:53.440]  the big issue or is four or five million kids being aborted see they they divert
[47:53.440 --> 48:02.960]  us often to all these distractions I want to go out to break you know what I'm
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.440]  gonna do I'm gonna come back in the next hour actually and start directly with
[48:06.440 --> 48:11.800]  your calls Frank and John and Liberty and Owen and Peter and others but I do
[48:11.800 --> 48:15.760]  want to come back in the next segment and actually play Lewis Farrakhan on who
[48:15.760 --> 48:21.120]  the real white devils are and then we're also going to play his clip where he
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.600]  says I dare you you know mainstream media to actually look at what I really said
[48:24.600 --> 48:27.440]  because you would think it's newsworthy to have Lewis Farrakhan going I've
[48:27.440 --> 48:31.480]  changed and you know I don't basically think all the white people are the white
[48:31.480 --> 48:38.840]  devil that's pretty newsmaking but you notice it's not there but see that's
[48:38.840 --> 48:42.480]  what the mainstream media is dying or has already collapsed in many areas is
[48:42.480 --> 48:46.520]  because we are the media you think no one will see this interview you think no
[48:46.520 --> 48:50.640]  one will hear this interview people will and it's not about Lewis Farrakhan or
[48:50.640 --> 48:54.880]  Alex Jones it's the fact that whatever these interviews are whatever the news
[48:54.880 --> 48:59.520]  is the system doesn't want to see her here in the fourth hour David Knight's
[48:59.520 --> 49:05.200]  gonna play the video the articles going up on info wars.com as we speak where
[49:05.200 --> 49:13.240]  the BLM out there in Oregon got caught on video bragging how they took that mind
[49:13.240 --> 49:17.160]  for themselves and how they're basically piratically stealing property and so I
[49:17.160 --> 49:21.000]  get the wrong the feds are committing I get they control most the land in the
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  West I get the fact it's under UN control UN biospheres I made a film about
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.200]  it in 97 I'm a huge land rights activist I supported the Bundy's when they had
[49:30.200 --> 49:36.320]  grazing rights but clearly having people in federal buildings people being
[49:36.320 --> 49:41.440]  arrested driving federal vehicles around now people being mailed boxes of sex
[49:41.440 --> 49:46.680]  toys and they gripe about it on TV knowing the image is just ridiculous to
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.520]  make them look stupid and the people walk into the traps and it's just not a
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.120]  good place to have that fight I'm allowed my opinion and you notice it's
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.920]  being borne out right now that it's a very foolish errand but I used to have
[50:00.920 --> 50:05.880]  to admire people that are trying to do something they're still a lot better than
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.240]  people that just sit around and watch the NFL all day and don't care and look
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.400]  I'm not judging people that watch the NFL the folks come to me like hey it's not
[50:14.400 --> 50:17.520]  bad I watch the NFL you know I'm involved in the Liberty movement too I
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.960]  get it I'm not talking to you I'm talking to people that play fantasy
[50:21.960 --> 50:26.920]  football all day while their kids are getting hooked on heroin or people that
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.240]  don't buy their kids vitamins because and don't give enough good food to eat
[50:31.240 --> 50:35.440]  because they're busy spending all their money on Powerball I'm talking to those
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.360]  people and you know what if you're feeling guilty maybe there's a reason
[50:39.360 --> 50:44.280]  look I feel guilty every day that I don't do more okay and quite frankly I
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.600]  have to deal with it because none of us are perfect and I can't do everything
[50:48.600 --> 50:53.920]  there's Rob do in there powered by brain force and for life calm and all your

[54:41.600 --> 55:05.240]  it's hard to turn off music like this isn't it I have never had more news to
[55:05.240 --> 55:09.000]  cover I have never had more incredible things to talk about I've never had more
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.360]  and senior eclipse and just amazing things and I've never been more
[55:14.360 --> 55:19.560]  speechless I was just walking around in the hall earlier going over some news
[55:19.560 --> 55:23.880]  articles that were coming out of the printer the reason we always print
[55:23.880 --> 55:26.920]  articles that we look at is because so many times they change them they remove
[55:26.920 --> 55:33.840]  them and we want to have a hard copy and it just kept hitting me that we're in a
[55:33.840 --> 55:41.640]  science fiction movie how stupid racism is how stupid infighting is how
[55:41.640 --> 55:49.120]  stupid tribalism is but it's all we've got it's who we are and it's real because
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.520]  people are being racist to white people and racist to black people I look at
[55:53.520 --> 55:58.040]  YouTube I look at info wars I look at all these other sites where you can
[55:58.040 --> 56:02.640]  comment and it is just a sea of people it's still a minority but it's like a
[56:02.640 --> 56:06.720]  third of it calling each other the n-word calling each other you know the
[56:06.720 --> 56:11.840]  honky word calling you just and then you go look and most of its bots it's just
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.920]  people causing infighting and I just think about what scum the elites are but
[56:16.920 --> 56:20.600]  of course it makes sense they want the world they want control they want to
[56:20.600 --> 56:23.880]  dominate they want the future they're gonna use whatever means they need to
[56:23.880 --> 56:30.200]  to dominate so they can mutate every plant every fish every animal every human
[56:30.200 --> 56:35.680]  and splice everything together and and grow humanoids inside animals and
[56:35.680 --> 56:40.360]  just and it's just not even a news item it they just report on it but they're
[56:40.360 --> 56:45.240]  talking about a new light bulb that came out and it's so fantastical the
[56:45.240 --> 56:48.960]  churches won't even talk about it because they're just won't even get into
[56:48.960 --> 56:53.400]  abortion because that's quote political so now they can't even get into humans
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.880]  being grown and humans being crossed with apes and fish and just and
[56:58.880 --> 57:04.200]  that's what we know about can you imagine what else is going on I said I
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.080]  get to the Farrakhan promo I have it it's pretty powerful Farrakhan on the
[57:08.080 --> 57:11.560]  Federal Reserve and the quote real white devil and you'll say well I already
[57:11.560 --> 57:13.880]  know all about the Federal Reserve I don't need Farrakhan to tell me it's a
[57:13.880 --> 57:18.080]  private foreign bank Farrakhan is the second biggest black leader in the
[57:18.080 --> 57:23.600]  world after Obama living black leader the guy goes and speaks in like 300 400
[57:23.600 --> 57:29.480]  500,000 people come out when he speaks in Libya or he speaks in South Africa or
[57:29.480 --> 57:35.560]  he speaks in Nigeria so he is a major see people always think about
[57:35.560 --> 57:39.440]  demographics on this radio station we target males this age that age or on

[58:09.880 --> 58:15.160]  offensive in cyberspace so the first thing they hear is Alex Jones and let
[58:15.160 --> 58:18.760]  them know there's solidarity worldwide pro-human humans better get together

[1:00:28.280 --> 1:00:33.080]  again the full boil down video will be posted the next hour and a half or so to

[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.960]  interview that that's the term I'm looking for the right term because I keep
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:53.840]  saying it's unedited that that's not true this on the right term you know you
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:58.040]  lie even when you're not trying to you just you just don't get the right par
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:06.280]  launch on the nomenclature and the words you're using from the lexicon I guess
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:15.200]  or the the Thoris would be the proper word it's unredacted it's everything you
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:18.520]  basically had to say other than me saying let's take a break I gotta go to
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:24.560]  the bathroom and then it's got a bunch of clips inserted in that have context
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:27.880]  historically to some of the things Farrakhan's talking about or if he talks
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:32.360]  about something that sounds outlandish we'll show a news article about it it's
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:38.160]  it's it's it's it's basically a film so that'll be up later this afternoon you
[1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:40.840]  know I'm gonna go to John and Wyoming he's on Trump and Hillard but since I'm
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:44.600]  talking about Farrakhan let's go to Frank because I'm intrigued by what it
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:48.520]  says on screen Lewis Farrakhan David Duke go ahead you're on the air
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:54.960]  Alex I know it sounds crazy but you know Duke Scott he's produced this film out
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:58.880]  there I think it's on YouTube and he's talking it's called I think dividing
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:03.440]  conquer rule by dividing conquer so he's very well-versed in all this but yeah I
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:08.080]  thought it would be a crazy idea to bring Lewis Farrakhan and David Duke into
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:13.240]  the studio or perhaps like you know it's a great idea I will offer to fly David
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:18.480]  Duke and Lewis Farrakhan here to be in studio I'm gonna get into Farrakhan's
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:23.800]  personal issues we survived cancer he's 80 plus years old and so I'll tell you
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:28.560]  this I mean I think because Duke's young I'm younger in better health probably I
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:32.600]  mean Farrakhan almost he's in bad health but you know he's an old guy you know
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:37.600]  go where Farrakhan wants and and and have a everybody videotapes it and do
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:42.520]  maybe a two-hour live video cast that I I think that would be a very very very
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:46.040]  interesting type discussion that's the stuff the mainstream media doesn't want
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:50.240]  to happen they don't want to have you know those type of different perspectives
[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:53.560]  at the same time having a discussion I mean it'd be great to have the head of
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:58.000]  the ADL there too or to have you know Michael Moore but you know see they
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.040]  don't do that they want to control the narrative go ahead yeah I mean that
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:09.040]  would be I mean just have a generally open you know conversation and not just
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:14.360]  talking points and not just talking points well yeah and you know I mean I
[1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:17.440]  get to see anything like that on the mainstream media and you know a lot of
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:21.240]  people are used to getting that talking points where they have to have talking
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:26.040]  points in order to stay you know you know because they're used to the
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:29.360]  treatment that they get their microphone being turned down I mean David Duke
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:32.440]  it's treated horribly by the media they do everything they can to make him look
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:36.400]  silly well I let David Duke talk about 60% of the time when he was on for two
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:40.800]  plus hours and then he complained like 15 times that I wasn't letting him talk
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:47.480]  and so my issue was people are gonna say I let Farrakhan talk too much I mean I
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:52.520]  probably talk 5% of the time in this interview I think I think Dr. Duke was
[1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:57.040]  overly sensitive with this treatment but you know a lot of that day he's got a
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:00.520]  little bit of paranoia going there you know that's what he used well here's the
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:05.000]  deal I did it to try to reach out because that they've openly announced it
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.080]  Davos and everywhere else that robots will replace us the age of humans is over
[1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:13.680]  I saw three or four mainstream articles saying it yesterday okay so we're
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:17.760]  screwed man they're putting genetic warfare garbage in the food and in the
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:22.760]  vaccines I don't have time to mess with black racist white racist or any of it
[1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:27.560]  I mean we we're dealing it's like if space aliens invaded okay we got a deal
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:31.520]  with them and the globalists say that their own species there are breakaway
[1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:34.880]  species they're creating an AI supercomputer to take over they're
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:39.520]  creating an alien okay they get their blasting holes in different dimensions
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:43.400]  with the Hadrian collider that could create black holes God knows what we're
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:48.680]  not in Kansas anymore and we don't have time to monkey around with infighting
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:59.760]  run by George Soros I'm just I just am tired of I'm tired of will you enter
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:04.240]  the matrix or fight its construction as the world economic forum underway in
[1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:08.720]  Davos fantasizes about a future that doesn't need it openly talked about the
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:13.120]  imposition of new technologies to control us the admission for example the
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:17.080]  driverless cars will be used as surveillance tools with CEO Rob Leslie

[1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:31.320]  these robot cars will be surveillance tools like satellites and drones the

[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:26.280]  later in the hour after I go through a lot of phone calls and break down the
[1:08:26.280 --> 1:08:33.880]  latest election news economy news second amendment news you name it we're going
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:39.920]  to start airing chunks of a almost hour long boil down interview that I
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:45.240]  conducted two weeks ago with Lewis Farrakhan and we basically made a
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:50.200]  documentary out of it and then within the end of the hour I will post the full
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:55.920]  videos you can watch it in the end at info wars calm and prison planet calm but
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:07.280]  I'm used to loud yesterday on Facebook mentions a lot of feed how important is
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:13.400]  Lewis Farrakhan well globally and with black communities he is the second most
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:18.480]  important living quote black person I don't like saying and according to you
[1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:23.720]  know quote supposed race but you know that's that's the perspective forget
[1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:27.800]  Michael Jackson forget pop I mean when it comes to the real world people that
[1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:32.720]  are politically or religiously involved he is extremely influential around the
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:38.360]  world and if you can get him talking about the new world order and talking
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:41.520]  about globalism and talking about eugenics something he already covers
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:47.200]  but if you can force it out into the debate and if you can point out that
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:51.720]  we're all under attack by the globalist technocracy that's meeting in Davos
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:57.680]  Switzerland right now it is a game changer and by extension and I'm gonna
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:03.600]  go to your calls this is what hit me Obama is the most important political
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:10.720]  black man in the world and by extension he is the most important man in the
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:14.520]  world when it comes to politics in the court of public opinion there are
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:21.760]  powerful elites behind the scenes but Obama is the figurehead and with a
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:28.360]  supposed African figurehead of the West we have seen black unemployment double
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:32.560]  we've seen the Pentagon be able to invade all of Africa and bring in radical
[1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:37.280]  jihadis as their pretext to do it we have seen radical Islamists take up with
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:40.880]  the Middle East they've now allowed them to invade Europe to then turn around and
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:45.440]  crush Africa and crush the Middle East as a response to what's been engineered
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:52.360]  it's a giant slow motion mega false flag in front of everyone and when I say
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:56.760]  mega that means million and you're talking about a million deaths in the
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:00.480]  syrup spring by the time it's all done I mean it's hundreds of thousands in
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:06.800]  Syria hundreds of thousands in North Africa it is places like Libya it is
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:11.000]  millions dead starting the destabilization in Iraq the country that
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:17.520]  fought al-Qaeda the country that was arch enemies of Saudi Arabia see how they
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:22.120]  say attack Syria because of ISIS when it's the West funding ISIS but we've
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:26.480]  reached this wonderful moment where we've got Lewis Farrakhan saying corrupt
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:32.840]  elements of the US government run ISIS and we've got Donald Trump saying the
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:37.480]  same thing we've reached a moment you're gonna hear it where Farrakhan says
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:41.240]  Donald Trump's right about blocking all Muslims because it's a bunch of terrorists
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:47.760]  being infiltrated to destabilize things to see that's a game changer because it
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:51.040]  flips everything on its head and that's what you're gonna see in a big populist
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:56.560]  movement is it's about truth and what's really going on and about real change not
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:04.160]  about labels not about what color your skin is but it hit me Obama wasn't real
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:09.040]  in his office Obama squandered all the goodwill he had by design the
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:14.040]  globalists are about in fighting and betrayal not about honor he destroyed
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:22.080]  an incredible legacy he could have had to bring people together instead of
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:28.680]  creating giant chasms and wounds and in rubbing salt in them and so Obama is not
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:36.240]  the most important person in the world because he has just become a puppet and
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:41.960]  he's not a black man he's not a white man he's a servant of the globalists that
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:48.920]  are anti-human he's a man of death and sin and lies and fraud
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:13:00.960]  his color is the color of the fires of Hades and he has a kindred spirit with
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.240]  the system of the world that he worships of ego and power trips and
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:12.400]  domination and control and lies so then that would make Lewis Farrakhan the
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:22.160]  most important black man in the world because Barack Obama in my view isn't
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:29.160]  like any black person I've ever known now you think about that so that's why we
[1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:31.480]  went and did the interview with Farrakhan that's why I gave us the interview
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:38.400]  and that's why I'm pointing out that things like this this seed is the type
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.440]  of thing that will bring the globalists down ISIS has complained and and and
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:46.600]  attacked info wars and it's recruitment videos and internal documents have come
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:49.840]  out where they tell their members no no no we don't work for the CIA we don't
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:54.680]  work for the West and that's the biggest thing impeding them and the biggest
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:57.480]  thing hurting their recruitment is they're learning that they're actually
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:14:02.280]  working against their own regions their own religion their own area and it is
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:08.960]  info wars that is effectively damaging them they said that and Assad three years
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:13.160]  ago it came out one independent they hacked their emails and there it was
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:18.240]  Assad with the Russians and others saying we're directing our information
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:24.200]  bureau our propaganda bureau to go with the reports that info wars.com and
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:28.320]  Alex Jones because they're the most accurate and our people don't understand
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:34.200]  geopolitics and so we've been advised to go with what Alex Jones is saying
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:40.960]  because that's the truth you can look it up and you notice it isn't just that it
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:44.360]  fit with what Assad wanted to put out he's not perfect by any yardstick he
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:49.280]  tried to reform he got set up like Saddam or like Gaddafi when you're
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:51.840]  surrounded by a bunch of Al Qaeda killers you do some bad stuff to survive
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:59.320]  I'm not defending it but what comes into the vacuum but you notice now what we
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:03.280]  said five years ago four years ago three years ago in the stage Syrian Civil
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:05.880]  War it's now coming out of the mouth of the former head of Defense
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:10.680]  Intelligence it's coming out of the mouth of the head of Southcom it's coming
[1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:15.400]  out of the mouth of Dempsey who left the former chairman it's coming out of the
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:19.080]  mouth of Donald Trump it's coming out of the mouth of Ted Cruz it's coming out of
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:22.640]  the mouth of Rand Paul it's coming out of the mouth of Rush Limbaugh it's
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:25.920]  coming out of the mouth of Glen Bet it's coming out of all their mouths and it
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:30.220]  came out of info wars and it came out of our guest the CIA whistleblowers the
[1:15:30.220 --> 1:15:37.280]  Navy SEALs the Army officers the Pentagon sources the Colonel Shaifers the
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:41.800]  Tosh Plumleys and it's all dead-on accurate and that's why people listen
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:46.280]  to us because folks we know how to sniff out the truth we know the enemy game
[1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:51.360]  plan we know how to stop it we know how to fight it and once you get in our
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:57.000]  mindset and see things through our optics you go whoa why didn't I ever see
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:00.200]  it before I'm like it's like the hidden picture you look out on the wall you know
[1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:03.240]  it looks like a maze or you go and finally you see you go how'd I never see
[1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:09.480]  that's a pyramid or a cat or whatever it is or our swan how'd I never see that
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:13.880]  because once you click it's there and you go Alex isn't that smart he just saw
[1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:21.800]  it he said there's exactly and when you cross that line it's the beginning of
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:25.800]  knowledge and let me warn you though with great wisdom as the Bible says
[1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:33.240]  comes great sorrow but the sorrow is very filling and is very strong and is
[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:39.280]  actually good to feel the pain of humanity to also feel its strength its
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:44.320]  will you have to own it all take it on and at first it's heavy and that it
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:48.640]  fills you and then now you're with all your ancestors and everyone to come
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:52.440]  after us if we survive and you realize the great mission of the total goal and
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:56.480]  it's absolutely transcendent
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:06.120]  and the great sorrow is how weak your flesh is and that even though you've
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:10.520]  spiritually transcended the world you're still in the world you're still
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:14.160]  controlled by the world if you're married and a beautiful woman walks by
[1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:18.960]  that's God's creation how do you not lust and you know it's a betrayal of
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:22.520]  your wife your children but you still even thinking in your mind you know
[1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:28.160]  it's not something that's good but it happened but the wicked ones they don't
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:32.440]  have any feelings of remorse they don't have you know King David I'm gonna skip
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:39.600]  this break go to your calls he was a man after God's own heart and not because
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:43.600]  he didn't send his best friend to be killed because he wanted his wife not
[1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:47.880]  because he didn't use evil schemes sometimes to defeat his enemies but he
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:53.400]  was so real so passionate and overall wanted to do good but he would still
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:57.240]  fall into darkness but his heart was pointed at God and he would truly repent
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:04.440]  and truly try to change and grow and that's what made David a man after God's
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:06.880]  own heart
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.760]  it's all a trick folks it's all a big con game the devil doesn't run anything
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:23.440]  but slaves that have been intimidated to serving
[1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:28.640]  and I'll be honest with you they offer your life extension technology they

[1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:35.000]  God that gives you the Apple take the knowledge take the logic of this system
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:44.520]  the dark logic join me my enemies will take that clip and say here is Alex Jones
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:49.560]  channeling the devil here's Alex Jones admitting he's the devil that's how
[1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:54.360]  their dark logic works that's how their deception works they take someone
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:20:01.800]  illustrating for them what the system's doing how it's operating and won't decide
[1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:06.960]  to face that system and fight it and warn others and expose what's already here
[1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:15.720]  and what is going to be coming they will instead make it about the orator that
[1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:20.240]  played the part for one minute just to give you an idea of what the
[1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:30.480]  establishment offers I have been taken up to the high places I have been offered
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:38.640]  the power and not because I'm a prophet not because I'm a Christ no no every
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:48.040]  great man every great woman is taken up to the high places figuratively but
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:54.800]  literally in the high buildings with the great men with the perfect dress the
[1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:59.360]  perfect smile the charm the whole world right out of the movie devil's advocate
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:05.680]  all that can be yours right now these women that penthouse this $300,000 car
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:10.120]  right now security people that'll take care of you people that care about you
[1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:17.040]  people that can fulfill you not the dirty rabble in the street who would tear
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:20.840]  you apart in a minute because you're made of greater stuff than they you
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:30.400]  belong with the elite you belong with the elect you belong here join us but
[1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:36.560]  your discernment lets you know it's a trap and history shows you what happens
[1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:51.080]  it's all fancily dressed slaves peacocks deathly empty they say the ninth
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:58.760]  circle of hell and Dante's Inferno is a frozen wasteland the allegories of hell
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:07.040]  or fire torment pain and stench but as you approach the center of hell I agree
[1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:13.280]  with Dante's vision it is a frozen cold wasteland of no honor no beauty no
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:29.120]  will nothing but a stinking refuge of failed twisted wisdom that could not be
[1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:33.880]  God and creation and all the incredible things that the life-giver has
[1:22:33.880 --> 1:22:42.720]  transmitted into the consciousness of reality and so the devil lives in the
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:49.040]  twisted the profane the diseased the fallen it takes what God has made and
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:55.000]  cannot create so only chops it up and rearranges it like the deformed guinea
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:59.400]  pigs eating the GMO with their testicles growing on the tops of their heads and
[1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:05.240]  legs sticking out their side dragging huge tumors behind them that's the artwork
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:19.320]  of the devil you want me to sign on to something like that in the street in the
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:25.360]  poorest areas of the world there is happiness there is glee there is
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:29.520]  enjoyment there is kinship there is friendship there is passion there is
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:34.160]  love until the televisions get turned on until the internet gets delivered the
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:40.360]  UN free internet free microloans so now the villagers can sit there and then the
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:43.880]  young kids don't want to go work on the farm with dad and grandpa anymore I don't
[1:23:43.880 --> 1:23:50.080]  care where they are in the world rural Texas or rural Africa and they sit there
[1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:55.160]  and they see Kim Kardashian they see shows with yachts and cars and money and
[1:23:55.160 --> 1:24:00.640]  helicopters and glitz and they didn't ever have that all they had was this all
[1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:05.280]  they had was their soul all they had was the light in their eyes and now they
[1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:10.760]  they they see the shining city on a hill this wonderland like all the little
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:15.960]  cheerleaders and drill team girls and beauty queens that are going to be
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:22.760]  models and movie stars and they show up in the dead zone of California and all
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:29.600]  there is is the sex industry and then you have your few movie parts in your
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:37.040]  modeling as the front for the rest of the stuff you do and that itself isn't
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:43.520]  even the sin the greater sin is that it was all a lie and then when that little
[1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:49.480]  moth took off from Kansas or New York or Florida or Oregon and flew into that
[1:24:49.480 --> 1:25:01.360]  bug zapper it never knew what hit it and I see women go off to California with
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:06.080]  that feminine power in their eyes and I see him come back with a sly look of a
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:12.120]  predator because once they're bitten by the vampires they succumb to the
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:18.480]  sickness and become vampires in their own right there can be black vampires
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:30.120]  white vampires asiatic vampires there's vampires of every quote race and they
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:38.240]  can't get blood out of other vampires the great age of the vampire parasite is
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:51.200]  upon us the devil's 15 minutes of fame are just about here and it's gonna be a
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:59.440]  rage driven foaming at the mouth looting the likes of which this world has
[1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:06.040]  never seen the insanity the hundreds of millions killed the genetic engineering
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:12.480]  the vandalism of the planet all of it the hydrogen bombs the superweapons the
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:20.320]  cyclotrons the leaking reactors all by design all part of the sickness all part
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:28.440]  of the breaking of the dam the falling of the gates as hell rushes in
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:38.440]  all right let's go to Owen formerly in whatever state he's in he's in FEMA
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:41.680]  region seven think about that the feds don't even see as their states they
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.000]  say that in the defense authorization acts it's just everything is so over the
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.960]  top of course we're under FEMA region seven or six where I live I mean they
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:53.680]  got farms everywhere with human oil growing in cows I mean you know that's
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:59.120]  all you need to know we're screwed but admitting we're in this position is the
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:04.240]  beginning of getting out of it I've seen people in bullies are beating them up
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:08.040]  they'll just want to fight back they'll lay there and then sometimes you'll see
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:11.440]  somebody finally fight back and just explode with energy and stomp the bullies
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:17.800]  under the ground and just realize we're in that position we got this little
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:24.920]  demon sitting on us losing pus all over us with little yellow eyes little buck
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:29.080]  teeth you know telling us how powerful it is dressed up in a little tuxedo and
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:35.360]  I just want to strangle it I mean I'm done I'm done I mean what type of God does
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:43.720]  this to people the God of this world is no God at all it hates us because we
[1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:52.400]  look like the creator like Genesis says in that image this entity doesn't like
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:57.960]  us because we're better than the devil the devil's just been around for a
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:00.840]  trillion years
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:07.720]  he's an old man that knows all the tricks taking a two-year-old out to the
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:16.800]  edge of a cliff and saying you got wings jump off you can fly Owen go ahead
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:22.880]  you're on the air well Alex thank you for that preface leading into my call and
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:27.000]  I think that anybody who agrees with you and feels that way it's time for us to
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.720]  mobilize and I think you would agree and I know you come on and you try to wake
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:34.440]  people up and it's really just a matter of time before everybody has woken up
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:39.040]  but we don't really have time anymore and I think there's a way that we can
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:43.440]  start to mobilize through your show and through your products I bought a lot of
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:46.320]  products from you they're all great I'd be happy to give you a review but you
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:50.320]  give out bumper stickers with all of your products and they're great bumper
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:54.680]  stickers their attention getters and you can place them all around town but I
[1:28:54.680 --> 1:29:00.280]  think maybe you should create a new bumper sticker custom-made that's just a
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:04.840]  square not like the long ones you make and anybody who agrees with what you
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:08.400]  just said anybody who's done living in the false reality who's done living in
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:12.160]  the false paradigm and he wants to survive the hell that's going to be
[1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:16.280]  unleashed on this country when they decide to burst all these economic
[1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:19.960]  bubbles when they decide to shut down the power grid or whatever it is that's
[1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:23.320]  going to happen it's time for everybody to instead of take them
[1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:28.120]  stay there I agree with you we we need this a bunch of different stickers that
[1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:32.880]  say it all a human with a club smashing a television a human with a club
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:37.400]  smashing an Illuminati pyramid a human with a club smashing a robot and it
[1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:40.000]  doesn't mean and it says info wars calm under it doesn't mean you're against
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:45.520]  technology you're against the robots being unleashed to take over working for
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:51.280]  the elite to checkmate human will we're on the March the Empire's on the run
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:30:01.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the intelligence community's inspector
[1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:05.240]  general has just revealed to lawmakers at Hillary Clinton had classified
[1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:10.040]  documents above top secret on her private email server in addition to
[1:30:10.040 --> 1:30:15.200]  over 1300 other classified emails access to information in the special access
[1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:19.240]  program is more highly restricted more sensitive than top secret because it
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:23.680]  would likely reveal the source putting lives at risk we're constantly told
[1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:28.160]  that our money our rule of law our liberties must all be sacrificed on
[1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:32.360]  the altar of national security Hillary has violated the surveillance states
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:37.040]  religion and she needs to be burned at the stake orange is the new pants suit
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:41.400]  Hillary but she's being investigated by Obama's Justice Department and she has
[1:30:41.400 --> 1:30:45.560]  about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop if she gets away with
[1:30:45.560 --> 1:30:49.200]  these crimes the fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably

[1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:25.880]  Alright here's what's gonna happen we've still got two and a half hours of
[1:33:25.880 --> 1:33:29.880]  transmission left I'm gonna keep going to your calls then I'm gonna start airing
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:34.680]  some of the sneak peeks of the interview with Farrakhan and then we're gonna start
[1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:38.200]  next hour airing large chunks of it right into the next with David Knight
[1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:43.600]  hosting because a lot of the news is gonna be breaking down at that time but
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:49.560]  what we're seeing right now is evil come out of the closet and it's really good
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:54.960]  at getting us to choose fake sides it's really good at making everything look
[1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:58.760]  like it's male against female or vice versa or black against white or vice
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:03.680]  versa and then when they set up these political collisions it's real what's
[1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:09.120]  happening it's manipulated but nevertheless you know tens of millions
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:14.280]  of immigrants unskilled coming from China and Latin America and places is
[1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:19.080]  creating a tower of Babel where we're all in fighting with the Democrats and
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:22.200]  Republicans in there playing both sides off against each other for
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:27.600]  Balkanization so even though I want to stop the third world from being dumbed
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:32.440]  down poisoned at the same time I have to then defend myself because the
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:36.120]  globalists are using the third world as a weapon they play all the different
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:39.960]  points off against each other because their tax exempt and have diplomatic
[1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:44.400]  immunity under basically above the law except when the power structure burns
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:51.000]  one of its own occasionally they have a rigged casino and more and more we have
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:56.640]  to psychologically spiritually mentally come out of the Babylon system we're in
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:01.520]  the world not of it and that doesn't mean that you don't see a movie or you
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:05.480]  don't listen whatever I'm not a Pharisee I'm not a hypocrite I'm not one of these
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:10.200]  churchgoers you know that if they hear a cuss word you know call the police but
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:17.560]  aren't doing anything to fight tyranny and I'm not judging them either but you
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:21.720]  know God uses all different types of people and I'll say it I'm an aggressive
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:30.200]  alpha male you know classic somewhat piratical in my youth and you know the
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:37.720]  real deal vicious aggressive smart mean sexual creature
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:45.520]  because that's part of the human nature but my good nature my high nature is
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:50.360]  just as extreme or more so as my bad side and everything is about an
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:55.200]  artificial construct everything is about putting you into a soft fake world so
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:59.840]  you never have to face real crisis so you never have to face real danger so
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:04.360]  you never have to learn to succeed and count on yourself and others around you
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:09.760]  it's about atomizing us into desperate individuals who have no friends or
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:19.240]  family who collectively join with the state and are absorbed this is a cult a
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:27.200]  globalist power cult that even if the devil is not a real entity we have a
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:32.720]  physical group consciousness manifestation of it so it's real as I've
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:39.440]  said a thousand times any way you look at it any way you do dissect it from any
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:46.040]  angle that's why they tell you oh there's no free will oh you're just a
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:50.000]  bunch of electrons oh you're just you know a clock that's wound up and starts
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.160]  oh you you know because they all know you have free will they want you to give
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:58.600]  up your free will and decide there's no point that's the spirit of the world is
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:03.760]  just an apathy and just I'm not worried about dying I'll just party all I want
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:06.760]  I'll just commit suicide when the time comes you know that's in the culture or
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:11.560]  I don't care about my kids or I don't care about what's happening you know
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:16.480]  India has some of the highest IQ people in the world but for thousands of years
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:23.320]  the social structure engineers came in and taught people dogmas of row row row
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:26.800]  your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:32.760]  dream and I've been told that repeatedly by wealthy prominent Indians and they'll
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:37.000]  defend the caste system to you they will tell you the people don't want to be
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:41.760]  free they will sit there and go yeah and I said well why can't India be free why
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:45.600]  can't India if they're so smart there's a billion plus of them ever you know
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:49.720]  develop itself properly and he says row row row your boat gently down the stream
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:55.680]  merrily merrily merrily last but a dream just don't care so smart you learn to
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:59.520]  just turn it off and not care so smart you just turn it off and decide not to
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:04.800]  transcend the squalor and the corruption and the tyranny you just decide to accept
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:11.880]  it and tune your brain with ancient basically mind control to not care that
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:19.720]  is delusion and that is a spell that is on India what we called spells thousands
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:27.400]  of years ago is nothing but a program a template a spirit because we broadcast in
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:30.760]  the sixth sense it's been proven that there is a broadcast from our huge
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:35.440]  electrochemical you know billions of cells billions and billions of cells in
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:38.640]  our brain they're all electrochemical they're broadcasting it's been proven
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:42.160]  that's why she feels someone looking at you it's why that's out there
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:45.720]  charlton's then come and claim they have more of it or can control it and then
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:49.920]  that's where the con artistry begins but everybody knows there's a sixth sense
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:57.760]  science knows it and they want to block that out or they want to get enough
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:01.440]  people being delusional and enough people buying into something to where it
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:05.560]  becomes a great mass delusion police and governments have always studied mob
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:10.560]  psychology why do people who are even super smart go into any mode you can
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:15.200]  imagine under mob psychology nighttime rallies with fire you know hitler did that
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:22.520]  or or or your mass chanting it's just ancient mind control technology folks
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:27.600]  and then once you get see but the added secret they won't tell you is they're
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:33.400]  trying to get enough people broadcasting like a pep rally at the school a pep
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:38.840]  rally isn't about football it's about loving the school it being your cult it
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:44.320]  being your culture it being your tribe it being your god not your ancestors not
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:48.520]  Christ not where you came from not your liberty not your freedom not meeting
[1:39:48.520 --> 1:39:54.000]  around the fire with the elders not transmitting knowledge by verbal
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:02.800]  generational experience and activating genetic memories no you go and yell and
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:08.160]  scream and face paint and everyone feels good goes with with with simulated
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:14.560]  war to turn the young men into ego maniacs to make sure that they never learn
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:18.760]  to be in war and business or life or culture or to be successful in real
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:24.440]  leaders like they would have learned around a campfire no they learn how to
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:29.280]  strut around and run with a ball to make sure that's what men do they run around
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.320]  with a ball and other men watch that because that's what men do you see the
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:43.000]  programming now you think football is okay to watch men that would have been
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:50.960]  something are now never even alive never even conscious never even lived
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:59.000]  they're stunted they're arrested they're gone they're acting like five-year-olds
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.880]  when they imagine they're superheroes I've gone and seen Marvel movies most
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:08.120]  of them are dumb on purpose they're getting so stupid it's insane for
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:12.480]  international audiences they're coming the culture down and I see grown men I
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:22.360]  see military people I have sat there and watched decorated combat troops
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:27.920]  salivate during things like the Avengers that is the most mindless crap it
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:36.200]  the planet ever produced and act like I acted when I was five years old
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:44.480]  meanwhile there's a real war going on against humanity it's declared it's
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:50.560]  open it's brazen
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:58.920]  and of course only generals and foreign leaders listen to the show I mean
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:03.160]  that's really where our audience is is with the intelligentsia because they
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:06.440]  can't turn on the TV or radio and hear anything like this that they live that
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:10.600]  they know and that's the big secret of this show folks the powerful listen
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:17.600]  because let me tell you something folks I know what's going on I know what goes
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:22.080]  on in their halls I know what their fears are
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:31.680]  I know what their plan is and that's what this comes down to all you that
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:37.280]  serve the system fools stop being idiots stop lying to yourself and telling
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:41.000]  yourself that this is all not true or that none of this is happening it's
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:47.480]  all being admitted you are under attack you're not part of the ruling system the
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:54.360]  truth is even the top globalist are in fear and at that level just basically
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:59.200]  join with this planet-killing spirit
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:05.840]  they're undead spiritually they're turned over
[1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:16.040]  no one escapes it no one joins with it and comes out on top you lose you join
[1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:24.040]  with this you lose you go along with this you lose and it's so good to not care
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:30.080]  of my hair is falling out to not care if I got a zit on my face to not care what
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:36.040]  people think about me it's so empowering to be above the mind control but it's
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:40.320]  also painful to see people caught in it and still I'll wear nice clothes I'll
[1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:44.680]  wear a watch if those trappings get mainstream people to watch and and make
[1:43:44.680 --> 1:43:48.040]  it look more establishment and and you'll have a nice background for you to
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:52.720]  present the info a nice package what matters is what's inside I'm going your
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:56.840]  calls I'm gonna shut up I've been really bad today but it's I think it's been
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:00.280]  important information we've been talking about Owen in FEMA region 7 finish
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:03.720]  your point and then we're gonna go to Rashid Mike Liberty Peter and others I
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:10.120]  apologize then to the Farrakhan interview here it is go ahead Owen well
[1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:14.000]  Alex anybody who recognizes the war on humanity is going on needs to mobilize
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:17.400]  digitize and start exercising their rights and I think through your products
[1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:22.120]  and your creativeness we can see you've already done phase one it has to be done
[1:44:22.120 --> 1:44:26.360]  in phases you've created a mass media platform for truth and liberty where lost
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:32.120]  souls have gone to really just dive into the rabbit hole and figure out how the
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:36.560]  world really works outside of the controlled paradigm but I think now we
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:41.200]  need to localize it I think you get that you get that all I was trying to do
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:45.640]  with other like-minded people was blow a hole out of the psychological spiritual
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.960]  prison and so info wars where you see me being attacked everywhere and the war
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:53.720]  going on around the rabbit hole entrance people get that's that's not me
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:58.760]  failing that's us winning as we go in that of course the enemy is attacking
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:04.400]  that's what we expect that's part of the victory so I think the next phase is for
[1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:08.720]  all the people who have broken free of the psychological jail cell that has
[1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:13.160]  been created by all these indoctrinating industries need to start
[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:17.880]  connecting and what we can do is you create a new bumper sticker just a
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:22.040]  little square and you either put it on your car or you put it on the wind door
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:26.280]  the storm door of your house and when you see that on other people's cars other
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:30.360]  people's houses you talk to them you communicate them and then you can
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:36.800]  create a new group a new kinship that can start to mobilize politically I
[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:41.360]  spent 10 minutes the other day on the phone and online I signed two petitions
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:46.640]  to return states rights to the state of Missouri and I called three politicians
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:50.840]  and I got through to each one of their offices and they heard my voice if we
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:56.960]  could get everybody who agrees with this to mobilize I agree but also contact the
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:01.320]  general public they're just as important as the Congress folks and let the public
[1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:04.920]  know they're important let them know they can get activated and just stop
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:09.200]  buying the system's products start speaking out against it absolutely God
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:12.680]  bless you it's a great idea I do want to come out with a whole flotilla of new
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:17.280]  bumper stickers and do a huge rollout where we say print up a special edition
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:20.800]  of the magazine which the magazine was successful but I've got rid of it because
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:24.280]  it took so much time to do per capita it wasn't good for the buck you know the
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:27.680]  bang for the buck wasn't as good as other platforms and so I got rid of it but
[1:46:27.680 --> 1:46:31.240]  I'm gonna bring it back sometimes with special issues that do have bumper
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:35.240]  stickers inside so you buy a you know magazine for a dollar it's got like 30
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:39.480]  bumper stickers in it and they can give those to people around you it has a huge
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:43.360]  effect but it's not just about people seeing info wars.com it's about the
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:47.160]  communication we're not alone we know what's happening you're absolutely right
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:52.520]  you're absolutely right I mean I've always been guided by just my gut my
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:57.440]  spirit and of course the news history information and I can see now everything
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:01.560]  we've done I'll be I'll feel like I need to do something and then I build it and
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:04.520]  it doesn't do what I thought it did it does four or five other things even
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:08.920]  better and then right as we finish some new platform the enemy attacks and
[1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:13.920]  damages or destroys another and then all the sudden just doors go boom it's
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:17.400]  like Providence and just all the support floods in I mean it's just
[1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:23.440]  incredible it's it's epic and I just wish people out there that were asleep
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:28.000]  were awake man I tell you what's scary I tell you what scares me is people that
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.440]  don't know what's going on I just I get the willies I get chills up and down my
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:38.040]  spine when I think about people that don't know what's going on and are
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:42.880]  spiritually blind that are getting chewed up man they are getting chewed up
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:51.040]  hard and they just have no idea what's all over them and but it's the animating
[1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:54.080]  contest it's the great experiment it's that's the great battle it's free will
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:59.440]  it's being free will creatures and it's it's it's it's a great contest and a
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:04.720]  little make us who we become we are children this plane of existence is a
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:11.480]  boot camp it is a test it is a drill it is the big the big enchilada and then
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:16.960]  past this I has not seen here's not heard the mind is not imagined what God's
[1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:22.240]  gotten store for us I think I can imagine a little bit because I can
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:25.360]  already pick it up and I could just see the path of humanity and it's
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:31.600]  spectacular absolutely spectacular just makes me love God so much I could just
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:38.920]  feel the goodness of God the strength the just just the endless will to create

[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:31.600]  year he got an office to be blamed on American gun owners shipping guns down
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:34.040]  there to then have them kill people and then be blamed on the second amendment
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:38.440]  that came out in the CBS News report that it was a false flag El Chapo had a
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:44.120]  50 caliber rifle they can take down a Learjet or a helicopter and they're not
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:47.560]  giving out the serial number of it boy talk about blowing up in their face a

[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:56.840]  down a helicopter and of course this has been out from Fox News this morning I
[1:54:56.840 --> 1:55:00.200]  should have covered it it's because this is the type of stuff that can bring
[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:04.360]  these people down if it doesn't bring them down I mean just the example of
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:11.760]  that what what else does it take I mean while Lynch defends Obama's gun actions
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:18.040]  the attorney general she lists the tragedies and says that they're allowed
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:24.600]  to use executive power oh really outside of law just cuz you said so stocks
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:28.600]  trim losses S&P still at lowest of 2014 we're gonna be getting to all that I'm
[1:55:28.600 --> 1:55:30.560]  gonna take a few more of your calls and then we're gonna start here in the
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:33.840]  Farrakhan interview and the big 50 minute boil down will go up in the next
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:38.920]  hour to or last in full wars.com then the full two-plus hour unredacted it's
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:42.160]  the full interview but it's been augmented had a lot of clips added
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:48.080]  will also go up as well to info wars.com in the same post but right now I
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:52.440]  want to play one of these promo clips of what's coming up this is where Lewis
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:56.480]  Farrakhan dares people then I'm gonna get to the Lewis Farrakhan exposes the
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:00.280]  real white devil so this is a Lewis Farrakhan daring the mainstream media to
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:07.880]  do their job this is the big picture an official television report to the
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:18.960]  nation. I dare you but I know you yes and modern warfare our military leaders
[1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:24.520]  are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons. Your power as
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:30.920]  media is gradually being destroyed. Mainstream media they're gonna take just
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:35.240]  what you said and just show the clip again out of context. Here recruits with
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:38.840]  specialized backgrounds were taught the nature methods and techniques of
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:45.280]  propaganda and its dissemination. Stop lying and start telling the truth to the
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:49.560]  American people and to the world. Perhaps its most rewarding form of
[1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:54.880]  expression is news for news is ready-made propaganda. Mainstream media is
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:58.520]  losing credibility losing ratings even us today a few weeks ago admitted
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:04.520]  television for politics is dead it faces its mortality. When you put Mr. Trump on
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:10.160]  television every minute of every day questioning hoping he would say something
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:14.320]  that would blow him out of the water and every day he got stronger and stronger
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:19.800]  that shows that your media is not working so why not work it for good. I
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:23.160]  know full well the media will take it out of context and say that Alex Jones
[1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:26.400]  endorses everything the minister Lewis Farrakhan has to say you know even it was
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:33.400]  30 40 years ago we all grow. Warn them tell them I dare you well I dare you to be
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:40.960]  good and I know you can't be good unless a gun is put to your head but gun is at
[1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:47.280]  your head right now so go on and be good it's better for you if you did.
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:52.240]  There's more of that okay I mean two hours of that and it's all powerful
[1:57:52.240 --> 1:57:56.240]  and it's got clips I mean really it's a film and I'm still sitting there trying
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:57:59.240]  to decide what to name all this that's why I've kind of pushed it back 30 minutes
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:03.400]  starting to release it here. It's going to be going up on infowars.com and

[1:59:59.480 --> 2:00:04.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:18.560]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:21.120]  Alright I want to finish up with a few of your phone calls and then I've got to
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:23.720]  start getting the Lewis Farrakhan interview that we've got here in
[2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:26.840]  segments because there's breaks obviously on radio. We'll be playing clips of this
[2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:34.280]  right in to the fourth hour with David Knight today. There is obviously a lot
[2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:38.480]  of things happening. Obama's gun grab agenda is in trouble. I cannot stress
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:42.280]  and I'm glad they pointed it out to me. They're in a few breaks they go why aren't
[2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:48.240]  you covering a Fast and Furious gun? 50 Cal at El Chapo's hideout that our
[2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:54.000]  government shipped into Mexico. I mean the real headline is El Chapo was given
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:58.040]  50 caliber by US government from Fast and Furious. Let's translate that Fox
[2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:01.400]  News headline and put that up because that's what it is and they ship tens of
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:05.000]  thousands of guns in to blame the Second Amendment. Pull up the CBS headline. You
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:12.440]  can do it. Anybody? Ten. Memo. ATF memo. Government plan to use Fast and Furious
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:17.520]  guns to pass more gun control because lower-level agents are like why are we
[2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:20.840]  doing this? This is horrible. They're like this is how we're gonna get the gun
[2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:27.920]  control passed. Amazing. But see they wanted people to get caught with the guns
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:31.840]  but not know it came from the government and now the government will not
[2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:36.560]  there to CBS Even News. ATF use Fast and Furious to make the case for gun
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:47.960]  registration. Folks, Nixon was impeached. He had to leave office because he had a
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:53.120]  hundred and something names in a safe he was planning to use for the IRS on.
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:58.440]  Obama did it to tens of thousands and then I've seen MSNBC repeatedly say of
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:01.480]  course we're going after the Tea Party with the IRS. You're racist. You deserve
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:05.680]  it. Of course Hitler's rounding up Jews. You're racist. You deserve it. You know,
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:13.840]  it's just the open naked persecution. You people are such totalitarians. You're
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:22.160]  shameful. You're dangerous. You have no self-preservation for your own family.
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:27.800]  You're idiots. There's no honor among thieves and there sure is no honor among
[2:02:27.800 --> 2:02:37.040]  these eugenicist murdering devils. We ought to come in with a clip just where I
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:40.440]  go Alex Jones goes super sour Wayne or what I don't really watch that show
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:46.760]  Dragon Ball Z right now. I think it's the Star Wars intro. One of those is pretty
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:53.560]  funny. It's a figure of speech. Actually, I think Obama is a devil. We got
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:57.560]  Farrakhan coming on top about the white devil. I'm making fun of Farrakhan. It's
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:03.120]  just fun to do that. In fact, now I walk around the office talking like that. It's kind of fun.
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:07.480]  Let's go ahead. I'm not as serious as those folks. It's not meant mainly. I like
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:12.720]  to screw around a little bit. Who's been holding the longest here?
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:20.640]  Mike in Mississippi. You're on the year worldwide. Yes sir. Welcome. Welcome sir.
[2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:28.480]  I appreciate it's an honor. First off, I love Iran. It did it rounds up my
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:33.000]  neighborhood. I've got my neighborhood informed about you and they listen to
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:40.960]  you. Also my question is if Donald Trump and Sarah Payne get into office and if
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:49.040]  Donald Trump gave you a seat within the White House, would you consider
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:53.280]  and take in that? Well, obviously I'd consider it. A, I don't think it's gonna
[2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:57.720]  happen. B, it would probably discredit me to be in the system. I think I'm more
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:04.200]  effective being a third party, you know, breaking down what's happening. There's
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:07.280]  so many laws they can selectively enforce. They probably indict me for,
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:10.640]  you know, not finishing a sandwich or something or having a crooked toenail as
[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:15.320]  they say. But look, I don't think Sarah Payne's perfect, but she's a lot better
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:19.160]  than Hillary. Great move if he has her as his vice presidential candidate. Then the
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:21.880]  liberals can all say she's a dumb woman because, you know, they're liberals. So
[2:04:21.880 --> 2:04:24.920]  they bring in radical Islamics to rape women and they call women dumb. They
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:29.520]  don't agree with and every stereotypical anti-female statement you can do. So, but
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:34.280]  I mean, what would they put me in there as? Is the as the director of federal
[2:04:34.280 --> 2:04:40.520]  communications or something? Maybe the speaker of the house, or maybe the
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:45.080]  candidate gets up at the podium and tells what, you know, Trump is done, what's
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:49.320]  going on. I mean, real information. I would love to be drawn on Trump's
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:52.400]  legging. You know what, if they wanted to make me speaker of the house that is an
[2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:57.320]  elected position, then, you know, who they can appoint, I would, I would do it.
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:01.120]  Yes, I would be speaker of the house. Will you enter the matrix or fight its
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:05.600]  construction? As the World Economic Forum underway in Davos fantasizes about a
[2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:09.360]  future that doesn't need us. They openly talked about the imposition of new
[2:05:09.360 --> 2:05:14.040]  technologies to control us. The admission, for example, that driverless cars will be
[2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:18.600]  used as surveillance tools with CEO Rob Leslie saying availability and
[2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:23.320]  resolution of imaging from satellites, drones and self-driving cars will continue
[2:05:23.320 --> 2:05:28.320]  to increase exponentially. In other words, these robot cars will be surveillance
[2:05:28.320 --> 2:05:33.000]  tools like satellites and drones. The federal department of transportation is
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:36.840]  expected to create legislation outside of Congress's involvement this year to
[2:05:36.840 --> 2:05:40.800]  regulate communication equipment on cars that would communicate vehicle to vehicle
[2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:45.840]  and vehicle to infrastructure. Detroit projects this to be a 46 billion
[2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:50.920]  dollar market in just four years. Or put another way, the price of cars is about
[2:05:50.920 --> 2:05:55.640]  to soar. Corporate profits and government surveillance, a match made in hell.
[2:05:55.640 --> 2:06:03.440]  This is David Knight for info wars.com. And it's that type of behavior that
[2:06:03.440 --> 2:06:08.160]  spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was
[2:06:08.160 --> 2:06:12.880]  designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are hit with
[2:06:12.880 --> 2:06:17.840]  modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it. Young
[2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:21.640]  humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered
[2:06:21.640 --> 2:06:26.400]  daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:30.040]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team,
[2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:33.680]  we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that
[2:06:33.680 --> 2:06:37.400]  children would actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer in

[2:07:59.320 --> 2:08:16.320]  You want answers? Well, so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:52.000]  Alright folks, we are now into the third hour, fourth hour coming up. I'm going to start
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:57.040]  airing big chunks of the Lewis Farrakhan interview, and we're also going to go to
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:02.800]  John O'Wyoming, Cody, Rashid, Donald, Anthony, and others as well interspersed
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:09.760]  with pieces of it. And then the 55 minute or so boil down of the interview will be
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:15.200]  posted to infowars.com by the bottom of the hour for folks that want to watch it
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:19.840]  without my commentary and without the calls and the rest of it. And then it'll
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:24.440]  go on into the fourth hour and I'll also play some more clips from the two hour
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:29.720]  interview, the full interview, the unredacted interview tomorrow. But the
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:33.680]  full interview needs to get emailed out to a lot of folks, so you'll be able to
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:37.120]  do that and you know, post it to your Facebook and the rest of it here in
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:41.560]  about 20 minutes, it'll go up on infowars.com. There's some promo clips up
[2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:44.840]  there already today. Lewis Farrakhan exposes the real white devil. That's the
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:49.880]  fellow reserve. And Lewis Farrakhan dares the media. Those are just short
[2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:53.840]  clips up there that are in the main interview, so that's coming up. But right
[2:09:53.840 --> 2:09:58.760]  now, let's go ahead and start airing excerpts. Here it is from the beginning
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:02.680]  and I'm not going to narrate this. Some of this is more for TV, so there'll be
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:05.920]  some spots for radio stations and folks here, you know, 10 seconds of music or
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:09.840]  whatever, where it's showing time lapses of Phoenix or whatever, or showing the
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:13.400]  neighborhood. But again, this is a documentary. We're basically premiering
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:17.440]  here right now. And then everyone else who's listening on radio, if you want to
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:22.000]  see it, it'll be on infowars.com again in the next 20 minutes. And then the
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:26.680]  later this afternoon, the full two-hour will be put up. We plan to release both
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:30.520]  of them together, but the computer died that it was rendering on, so it's
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:35.680]  being redone right now. So let's go ahead and go to the intro of this.
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:41.240]  And if you want to know where the white devils are, Mr. Lewis Farrakhan, I can
[2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:45.040]  tell you right now, they run the Democratic Party 100% and they've got
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:50.200]  black people in their web, murdering your people, and they love it, and they
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:53.760]  think that people don't see them while I see them, and I know who they are.
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:11:00.320]  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that Almighty God Allah revealed to
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:08.320]  him that the white race is a race of devils. And the only way, white folks,
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:14.600]  you can come out of this because you cannot be reformed. You cannot reform
[2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:23.560]  a devil. All the prophets tried and failed. You have to kill the devil.
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:32.760]  Devil meaning wicked by nature. What more could a devil do than what has been
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:38.120]  done to the black man of America? Won't you send these children out here with
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:44.440]  the thought of murder in their mind? Oh, yes, I am. It's putting to death time
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:48.040]  today. You know how mommy said, when it's time to sleep, you've been raised
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:54.120]  in hell all day. Betty, bye-bye. Time to go, bye-bye. Time to go to sleep.
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:12:01.000]  Well, it's time for the white man's mind to be put to eternal rest. Any human
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:07.040]  being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be considered a
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:12.880]  devil. It is the divine power of Almighty God Allah that is now bringing
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:17.000]  about the destruction of the United States of America.
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:33.360]  So if the federal government will not intercede in our affairs, then we must
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:43.440]  rise up and kill those who kill us. We want some of this, but we'll tear this
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:54.400]  goddamn country up. Stop them and kill them and let them feel the pain of death
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:55.440]  that we are seeing.
[2:12:55.440 --> 2:13:05.120]  Gentlemen, we're going to interview Louis Farrakhan. Doesn't do a lot of
[2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:09.840]  interviews. We're flying out this Sunday. Sunday afternoon. Sunday what time? About
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:13.320]  three o'clock. We're interviewing him on the fourth. I agree with a lot of stuff he
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:18.240]  says about Planned Parenthood, vaccines, false flag terror. He's a very interesting
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:22.920]  guy. I want to talk to him about Malcolm X, you name it. I don't agree with, you know,
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:26.000]  white people can't be reformed and they're the devil. He hadn't said that in a long
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:32.480]  time, but I'm going to really see how much he's evolved or grown and I'm really
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:36.240]  just seeking to open up a dialogue because somebody like Louis Farrakhan is
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:42.840]  so key when it comes to stopping the big foundations and the social
[2:13:42.840 --> 2:13:47.040]  engineers in this country around the world to really start a race war or
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:50.640]  divide and conquer. I mean nobody's winning with this war against Islam
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:55.360]  overseas that's just really causing a Sunni Shiite civil war. Nobody's winning
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:13:58.480]  with the males versus the females and the whole feminist thing. I want to hear
[2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:02.480]  what he thinks about political correctness and so much more because the last few
[2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:06.480]  years, I see Louis Farrakhan saying more and more things that I agree with and
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:13.880]  then occasionally saying something that I disagree with. The Constitution warns
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:24.960]  that America must never let anyone set up a central bank. Right now, the President
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:33.720]  of the United States is given authority to assassinate American citizens. But I
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:36.760]  want to go over some of this research that you guys have done, that there are
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:41.680]  people have sent us as well and hopefully we can do an interview that's
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:46.760]  really deep and that isn't just, you know, picked up by the tabloids with
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:50.800]  whatever zingers he throws in there and certainly you're not going to have a way
[2:14:50.800 --> 2:14:56.360]  then. But I really kind of want to find the real Louis Farrakhan here.
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:01.160]  Louis Walcott from Boston. Louis Walcott, front and center.
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:07.920]  I see you're quite a fellow up there in Boston. Says here that you're a track
[2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:11.880]  runner at English High School and that you've equaled every record in school, right?
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:15.360]  Yes, and I hope to break something next year when I put on a little more weight.
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:19.760]  You do, huh? Yes. How about your violin? Can you play that as fast as you can run?
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:23.160]  Well, not quite, but I've got a lot to learn. I hope to break some records with this
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.840]  someday. You're just a champion at heart, aren't you?
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:29.480]  The system doesn't want us going out to interview this guy. We're supposed to be
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:32.400]  kept in our little electronic ghettos. We're supposed to be kept in our little
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:36.760]  reservations, our little plantations. That's what Google does now, it sends you news,
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:42.040]  you agree with. We want to go actually try to work with people and talk to people
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:45.960]  and humanize it, because that's the last thing the globalists want.
[2:15:59.960 --> 2:16:05.160]  I've interviewed a lot of people and I've snuck in places like Bohemian Grove.
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:08.960]  I've been attacked at political demonstrations, been arrested many times.
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:15.200]  But I've got to say, this is probably the most surreal drive I've ever made to go
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:17.600]  meet someone that I'm going to be interviewing.
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:25.280]  Lewis Farrakhan, I remember watching him on C-Span, and I was really getting politically
[2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:31.680]  awakened to where when I was like a sophomore in high school, and my mom would come in on
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:35.560]  the weekend, I'd be eating lunch, watching it in the kitchen, she'd say, what are you
[2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:37.000]  doing watching Lewis Farrakhan?
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  The government for which you work is the number one enemy of the black man of America and the world.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:56.680]  And here we are, driving to their Phoenix headquarters. And look, it'd be easy to score
[2:16:56.680 --> 2:17:02.680]  a bunch of points and just be rude and make radical Islamic comments to them or whatever.
[2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:03.680]  I'm not going to do that.
[2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:29.600]  Thank you so much, Mr. Jones, for honoring us with your presence.
[2:17:29.600 --> 2:17:37.480]  We have watched you as you have watched us, and I have learned a lot from info wars and
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:41.440]  some of the wonderful things that you have done.
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:50.800]  We are two people interested in truth. We're two people that live in the greatest nation
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:18:02.720]  on this earth, but the nation is not now what it could be if truth unfettered would be given
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:08.480]  to the American people. And perhaps through this dialogue, that might happen.
[2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:14.440]  Well, I have to say, thank you for having me in your home and with your family. Driving
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:21.880]  over here, I talked about some of the reasons that I wanted to interview you. And then when
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:26.280]  I had a chance to be in your home right before the interview, you basically mirrored what
[2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:30.160]  I had to say. So in your own words, I'd like you to really, for the TV viewing audience
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:35.560]  out there, go over some of the interesting things that you had to say to me and to the
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:40.440]  audience because it just dovetailed exactly where I was going. And I have to say, I don't
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:45.600]  think I've ever had that happen before with an interview. So I'm really glad this is happening
[2:18:45.600 --> 2:18:51.360]  here today because as you know, there are forces that are trying to divide and conquer
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:59.000]  humanity. And we're really coming to a crossroads where people are being told to choose a side.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:03.800]  But I don't think the sides they're telling us to choose are real sites. So I'm trying
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:07.640]  to get people to think outside the box. And when I spoke to you earlier, that was basically
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:11.720]  your main focus. So I think this interview is meant to happen for a reason. So thank
[2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:18.260]  you so much for giving us the time and your busy schedule. So please just, if you could
[2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:22.120]  recapture what you told me in there earlier, it was very interesting.
[2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:31.440]  In the teachings of the honorable Elijah Muhammad, his great teacher, master Farid Muhammad,
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:42.040]  who came to enliven the black people in particular, he taught us that he never used color in
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:54.480]  this question and answer. He asked the question, who are the 85 percent? Who are the 10 percent?
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:20:05.960]  And who are the 5 percent? And in the answers that Mr. Muhammad gave that we study, 85 percent
[2:20:05.960 --> 2:20:16.120]  of the people don't understand the law of cause and effect. And wherever there is an
[2:20:16.120 --> 2:20:25.240]  effect that is real, the cause is just as real, though off times the hidden hand that's
[2:20:25.240 --> 2:20:34.720]  manipulating and creating the effect and the circumstances that begin to divide and destroy.
[2:20:34.720 --> 2:20:47.240]  This kind of satanic mind is absolutely in control and that satanic mind is hiding with
[2:20:47.240 --> 2:20:58.520]  a mask of humanity and civility, but now it is gradually being exposed. There are those
[2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:07.960]  at the top who guide and govern, who are not necessarily the friend of the masses of the
[2:21:07.960 --> 2:21:18.560]  people that they are governing. So it is the 5 percent are just a small group who know
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:26.040]  the truth, who understand the law of cause and effect, and they don't believe in a mystery
[2:21:26.040 --> 2:21:32.600]  God that somewhere making things happen. If there is a real evil, then there is a real
[2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:40.480]  devil. If there is a real saint, then there is a real good person doing saintly things.
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:48.000]  So here we are. Now a conspiracy absolutely is involved.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:54.800]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing
[2:21:54.800 --> 2:22:04.960]  more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems. Some of these
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:10.360]  same voices also do their best to gum up the works. They'll warn that tyranny is always
[2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:16.280]  lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices.
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:25.200]  Everything that's been done with torture, rendition, the NDAA, the Patriot acts 1 & 2,
[2:22:25.200 --> 2:22:40.600]  from day one was focused on the American people period. That's it. It's always been about
[2:22:40.600 --> 2:22:45.920]  erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly saying
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:50.560]  it's for al-Qaeda, rolling out torture saying it's for al-Qaeda but it's really for the
[2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:55.640]  general public, rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market
[2:22:55.640 --> 2:23:00.720]  systems in the name of fighting al-Qaeda but really shutting down any kind of free commerce.
[2:23:00.720 --> 2:23:10.160]  This is all about converting us from a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
[2:23:10.160 --> 2:23:33.960]  That really is a revolutionary thought that if you question the establishment, you question
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:37.640]  what they're saying when they're known liars, you're a conspiracy theorist. That's like
[2:23:37.640 --> 2:23:42.240]  saying you're a heretic. If we're a heretic against the system, I guess we're a heretic
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:48.480]  against the devil because this system, undoubtedly, you couldn't call it good. From my research,
[2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:54.640]  that's my concern. The 5% to 1% to 1, 10 to 1% that actually run and control manipulate
[2:23:54.640 --> 2:23:59.160]  things, they believe they're going to end up winning. They believe that they're getting
[2:23:59.160 --> 2:24:06.200]  ahead of people by keeping folks dumb down. Common sense shows and just my gut tells me
[2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:10.760]  you don't screw people over and then long-term get away with it. It comes back on you and
[2:24:10.760 --> 2:24:14.920]  I think the people serving the system are some of the most deceived out there because
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:19.640]  they know how the world really works but they've decided to basically try to screw over their
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:24.120]  fellow humans as if they're going to get ahead by doing that. I mean, just anybody who's
[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:28.480]  God fearing in their gut level has to know that's a lie.
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:37.760]  Well, Mr. Jones, in reality, there are those who go along to get along. They know what
[2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:48.600]  they're doing but they do not know the vast evil that they are a part of. So the politicians
[2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:58.760]  today, I looked at the many Republicans and Democrats that are trying to win the nomination
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:07.640]  of their party and it says to me, you know, it's like, I don't want to be vulgar but it's
[2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:23.280]  like you in any major city you see women undressed showing their wares for a John to buy them
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:33.440]  and it's like politicians who don't have money but have ideas and they parade themselves
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:43.920]  before rich and powerful people to get money, apparently, for their ideas that the rich
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:52.680]  agree with but the moment that they become what they're looking to become, they find
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:26:00.240]  that the rich have an agenda for them, that the rich have something to ask of them like
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:07.680]  the John asks of the prostitute and that's one of the things that I admire about Mr.
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:15.240]  Trump because he told them all, I don't want your money.
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:19.840]  Politicians are all talk, no action. Most of them don't know what they're doing, they
[2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:24.080]  just run. They're like, you know, like you wind them up and they run for office. They're
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:31.880]  controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors and by the special interests fully
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:37.040]  and you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:43.360]  do. You better believe it. So what specifically did they do? If I ask them, if I need them,
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:47.320]  you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given to just so you understand a lot
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:54.080]  of money. So from your experience in all, you know, tracking the media, experiencing demonization
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:59.080]  campaigns, it's a big deal to have Lewis Farrakhan come out and say, the Honorable Minister Lewis
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:04.360]  Farrakhan come out and say, hey, we should look at Trump. Can you flush that out and
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:09.120]  elaborate because undoubtedly they're going to try to, you know, take that and then twist
[2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:15.360]  it. Well, I said recently that if the American
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:28.720]  people voted for Trump, he could take them into the abyss of hell. He's free. He's rich.
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:42.960]  He hates political correctness and rightly so. But he said some things that I would hope
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:53.680]  that he would get around him persons who could help him because as a businessman par excellent,
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:28:04.760]  he has people around him to help him do business. But if he says, let's go in to Iraq and take
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:17.120]  the oil. That puts him in the class of those neo conservatives who had a project for a
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:25.360]  new American century. And they wrote to Bill Clinton and Trent Lott and they talked about
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:35.960]  attacking Iraq and taking out Saddam Hussein, not just because he may be in their eyes a
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:46.160]  dictator and was once on the payroll of the CIA in the war against Iran and Ayatollah
[2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:54.120]  Khomeini. But he had become a thorn in their sides and they wanted to get rid of him. He
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:59.360]  kind of become a Trump. He was doing his own thing. Yes, that was his crime. And that is
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:07.800]  the crime of those who refuse to come under the control of the IMF or the World Bank.
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:13.680]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:23.000]  United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:33.520]  Our government has gone into nations with money from our Congress to stimulate. We're
[2:29:33.520 --> 2:29:38.320]  going to come back, back it up 15 seconds and continue with this powerful interview
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:44.040]  that breaks the mold. And that's what info wars is all about outside the box. True cutting
[2:29:44.040 --> 2:29:52.240]  edge leading a edge information warfare. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:30:02.760]  Jones and the GCN radio network. The intelligence community's inspector general has just revealed
[2:30:02.760 --> 2:30:08.720]  to lawmakers that Hillary Clinton had classified documents above top secret on her private
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:14.360]  email server in addition to over 1300 other classified emails. Access to information in
[2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:18.840]  the special access program is more highly restricted, more sensitive than top secret
[2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:23.800]  because it would likely reveal the source putting lives at risk. We're constantly told
[2:30:23.800 --> 2:30:29.320]  that our money, our rule of law, our liberties must all be sacrificed on the altar of national
[2:30:29.320 --> 2:30:34.360]  security. Hillary has violated the surveillance state's religion and she needs to be burned
[2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:39.880]  at the stake. Orange is the new pantsuit, Hillary, but she's being investigated by Obama's
[2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:44.560]  Justice Department and she has about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop.
[2:30:44.560 --> 2:30:49.240]  If she gets away with these crimes, the fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably
[2:30:49.240 --> 2:30:59.040]  obvious to all. For more information, go to info wars.com. I'm David Knight.

[2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:23.760]  it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:29.200]  Jack Jackson is here with us in the studio. He's one of our big pro gun guys. He covers
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:33.240]  a lot of the gun. Second minute news for us and I wanted to briefly spend a few minutes
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:39.600]  with him then go to more of the exclusive interview with Lewis Farrakhan and then it's
[2:33:39.600 --> 2:33:42.960]  going to continue on in the fourth hour with David Knight and the full interview as we
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:47.960]  speak is going up. Like I'm told it's about to go up on infowarsteam.com. It has the title
[2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:53.440]  Lewis Farrakhan, Angel or Devil because obviously that's something that will get people to watch
[2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:59.600]  it and then they can make up their own mind. But it's overall a favorable angle because
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:03.840]  he was nice. He said a lot of things that we know are true and we're trying to bring
[2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:07.360]  folks together. That's what this is all about. He says he's grown. We've grown. Everybody
[2:34:07.360 --> 2:34:13.600]  grows. Basically, I was attempting to get David Duke to get past the whole race thing
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:18.480]  and it didn't work too well with Farrakhan. It went very well and that's just all I'm
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:23.280]  trying to do. And then the left media was like, aha, David Duke was being to Alex Jones.
[2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:28.560]  Alex Jones is an idiot because they want to just keep all this fighting going on. Now
[2:34:28.560 --> 2:34:32.440]  that said, again, we're going to play more of this than I promise I'm going to Cody
[2:34:32.440 --> 2:34:35.720]  and Rashid and Donald and Anthony and Steve. We're going to get to all of you. I promise
[2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:39.160]  you're there and I'm going to hear more of this tomorrow as well. But the full interview
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:44.160]  is going up the full two plus hours along with the 50-something minute documentary that
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:48.880]  you're watching right now, which is again about bringing people together around issues
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:52.440]  that all of humanity is threatened by the rise of the robots because the elite have decided
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:58.680]  to angle the robots and angle their deployment to make humans obsolete with the whole system
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:03.200]  saying humans are bad period. Get rid of this. This is the elite saying this. So this is
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:07.520]  an attack on everyone. It's epic. It's now mainstream news. It's not, you know, myself
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:12.440]  talking about it 20 years ago or the unabomber warning of it 25 years ago. Another guy that
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:17.160]  warned of it. It's the establishment. It's here. It's their view. We're in trouble. Of
[2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:21.040]  course, he worked for the CIA. That later came out. That's why Theodore Kaczynski knew
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:26.200]  all that was probably set up, but he's now locked up in a super max for decades and the
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:29.400]  media is not allowed to see him. Hope they don't blame something on me sometime because
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:36.000]  I'm nonviolent offensively. Folks know that I'm defensive, but looking at the huge Fast
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:42.200]  and Furious news that came in, it's Fox News Associated Press El Chapo had a 50 caliber
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:49.940]  rifle from Fast and Furious, not the movie Fast and Furious. Fast and Furious, the gun
[2:35:49.940 --> 2:35:55.800]  running program. And until it's turned to Kari's mic on, to Kari, this is a big, big deal and
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:35:59.240]  the government won't release the serial number. They just hope this goes away. This is the
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:03.680]  kind of thing that captures the public's attention and brings Fast and Furious back that Hillary
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:09.360]  and Obama and all of them have not gotten in trouble for or big sis or Eric Holder.
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:13.640]  Yes. And I believe it was last year, maybe the year before a Mexican beauty queen was
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:17.920]  in a shootout that involved a Fast and Furious gun. So when we see stories like this El
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:21.920]  Chapo, you know, the beauty queen, it brings it back to the American attention because
[2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:26.040]  so often we see so many scandals now. It's like a new week, new scandal. So people blow
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:29.840]  through this stuff pretty fast and it's hard to keep everybody's focus on one particular
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:33.840]  issue because next week it's going to be something else. But with the capture of El
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:38.800]  Chapo, I was actually watching a piece on him last night talking about the first time
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:43.320]  he escaped from the prison and, you know, the very elaborate thing. They dug a tunnel,
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:48.000]  you know, 90 feet underground train people in Germany. Yeah, it's it was quite interesting
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:51.920]  and fascinating how this guy does it. But, you know, he's been captured once again. We'll
[2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:55.800]  see if he escapes. But regardless, it does bring attention back to the Second Amendment
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:37:00.480]  issue. And Obama's saying that the reason why they have so much gun violence in Mexico
[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:05.520]  is because of the American gun owners, the Second Amendment. Meanwhile, he's giving guns
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:10.240]  to these cartel members to El Chapo. And then they want to blame the violence in Mexico
[2:37:10.240 --> 2:37:15.600]  on the American gun owner. No, it's because of the cartels there in the American people
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:19.120]  in the American government, not the American government as a whole, who continue to fund
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:23.480]  groups like the exactly. But if they don't bring them to justice, it is the American
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:28.760]  government. We could say it's basically rotten at the top. So many good people at low levels,
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:33.600]  mid levels, but they have no power. Yeah, and we've seen the documents from CBS News
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:37.520]  saying that Fast and Furious was there to blame the Second Amendment. Incredible. They
[2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:42.000]  want to demonize people. Then you got Obama making these speeches in Mexico. Eric Holder
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:46.520]  saying we need all these smart guns. Meanwhile, they I will say they're doing background checks
[2:37:46.520 --> 2:37:49.160]  on the people that they're giving these guns to because they're trying to give them to
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:52.960]  the worst people possible. They're getting to Al Qaeda. They're going into the cartels.
[2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:56.400]  They're all chopper. So they know where these guns are going. But they say, oh, we're going
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:37:59.920]  to track the guns and see where they lead us. Well, they lead you to a bunch of dead
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:02.880]  bodies. And if they couldn't see that from the forefront, there's something wrong with
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:07.280]  the administration. They did it to blame the Second Amendment. We have them caught red-handed
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:12.880]  the hand in the cookie jar. It is incredible. An actual false flag red-handed. This is just
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:17.600]  simply amazing. Jakari, we got Weldon Henson in there. You guys normally are the fellows
[2:38:17.600 --> 2:38:21.640]  that when the new gun shirts come in a you want one and because you like the Second
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:25.840]  Amendment, you're a big shooter and so does Weldon. But B, you know, you guys are pretty
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:30.040]  good shapes. You're good models to wear the shirts. These just came in yesterday. We,
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:38.040]  the people, it's got a M4 AR-15 on the front. We will never surrender. And on the back,
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:43.000]  it simply says, come and take it. The famous Texas Gonzales statement. And then on the
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:50.120]  right shoulder info wars dot com. And folks, this is another limited edition shirt. The
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:55.080]  Hillary for prison shirts are starting to sell out. We're not making more. I wish I
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:57.800]  wouldn't have made that a limited edition, but whatever you're making a limited edition,
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:01.080]  people seem to like that. They order more of them. That helps fund the operation, gets
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:06.040]  more great shirts out there on the street. Folks, we, the people will never surrender
[2:39:06.040 --> 2:39:10.720]  with the M4, with the main gun they want to ban first. And then on the back, come and
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:14.800]  take it on the right arm info wars dot com, where you can then point to your arm and tell
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:20.720]  folks where to go to learn more truth. It's 1995. This shirt is high quality and it funds
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:24.680]  the operation. We need to sell a lot of these. Be able to send reporters. I mean, I would
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:29.480]  have sent reporters to Davos, the public Bilderberg meeting that's going on right now, but we
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:33.880]  don't have the funds. I've sent folks to Bilderberg. I sent folks to cover other events, you know,
[2:39:33.880 --> 2:39:40.160]  the attacks in, in Paris. I mean, it comes down to the fact that we need a budget. We
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:43.920]  need to sell a lot of t-shirts, a lot of water filters, a lot of nutraceuticals, you know,
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:47.800]  to have this great group of reporters and crew and investigative journalists and editors
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:53.680]  and legal and, you know, the bandwidth costs and all of it. We're victims of our own success.
[2:39:53.680 --> 2:39:57.320]  I don't want to have to get rid of the free video feed to the daytime radio show that's
[2:39:57.320 --> 2:40:01.680]  four hours long, but when 15 to 16 million people watch it a month, it's tripled. And
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:06.280]  again, that's just one feed we put out. I started promoting it. And it's just, it's
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:09.680]  the effect. I want to do an ad on this call for folks to support us because we can show
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:14.360]  the metric of the bandwidth back and show the bills. I mean, $56,000. And I mean, we
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:19.000]  got some of the cheapest bandwidth out there. So I mean, believe me, we've shopped around
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:25.200]  and it's good bandwidth. And it's just a victim of our own success. When we have this many
[2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:31.640]  viewers again in a month, just on what 16 million times people connected and then Washington
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:34.760]  average was about 30 minutes. But the point is that's a lot of people. That's one small
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:38.840]  part of our audience, but it's growing. It shows the exponential growth, but it costs
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:45.120]  so much money. So infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com. What's your view on the shirt? I personally
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:49.080]  think it's awesome. The graphics crew came up with it because I was saying, we'll never
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:52.680]  surrender our guns on air. We've got to make a declaration of this. I kind of wanted one
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:56.480]  with like the Alamo and that statement. They said, no, this is better. I agree. Now, what's
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:40:57.880]  your view on the shirt, Jacari?
[2:40:57.880 --> 2:41:00.880]  Let's see us another in the series that we have, you know, it's a great shirt, high
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:05.000]  quality shirt, you know, very comfortable and it helps you to meet like minded people.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.760]  You know, you can go back to the archives. You can see the other come and take it shirts
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:13.440]  we have, but this is the new one. It's a great one. And you can see by the success of the
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:16.920]  Hillary shirt, you know, how much publicity we've gotten off that, how many black minded
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:20.160]  people have come together. You know, they're wearing it at political rallies, you know,
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:21.160]  it's Trump's talking about it.
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:24.640]  Yeah. I mean, it's a very popular shirt. And this can be that as well. If people get out
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:27.760]  there and make this an issue and just wear it. And you know, it's a great shirt.
[2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:33.120]  The Hillary shirt, we came out with four months before the end of the year. And then literally
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:37.920]  about early December, a huge shipment came in, made right here in America, printed here
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:41.600]  in America. Most shirts are made in America. We have cheaper ones that aren't people choose.
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:47.320]  But the point is that, that it's super popular. And other people, I'm sure making them, they
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:50.960]  are now and then that's fine. We're done when these are sold out. They're available at info
[2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:58.760]  or store.com info or is life.com or call 888-2533139. But this shirt again, I'm not going to just
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:05.800]  for four months. This is a shirt limited edition that will go for 2016. And then that's it.
[2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:11.200]  It's gone. So you've got basically 11 months and 10 days to get this shirt. And then it's
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:15.320]  gone forever. We got a lot of shirts that are not, you know, the Obama Joker one was
[2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:18.360]  a limited edition. Man, I wish I wouldn't got rid of that one. That was the all time
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:24.280]  best selling shirt ever and financed a bunch of stuff. In fact, I was able to hire three
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:28.840]  or four reporters. You were part of that wave jacari off the money that shirt made. That
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:35.080]  was our all time best. Oh, absolutely. But you know, that's it folks info or store.com.
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:38.760]  We're going to go to this fair con piece of that. Stay with me jacari. But let's go briefly
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:42.480]  to Weldon Henson in there in the control room. Weldon, I just said, Hey, throw all these
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:46.160]  shirts on, you know, drag you in here, give us your view on the new shirt. Weldon, because
[2:42:46.160 --> 2:42:51.760]  you're back there running the warehouse. Well, well, obviously, this is one that we had made
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:55.840]  kind of in response to the fact that every time we turn around, the second amendment's
[2:42:55.840 --> 2:43:00.960]  getting attacked. Obviously, Obama is on the war path to destroy the second amendment with
[2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:06.200]  his executive actions. So this is kind of a response. The shirt is is a way for him
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:10.520]  for wars to respond to that. And it helps fund the operation. And of course, we just
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:14.680]  got these in. I had to put one on. Instantly, I know you told me to but already had one
[2:43:14.680 --> 2:43:18.680]  in my office ready to go. So it's good to get over here and talk about it. Everyone
[2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:23.200]  needs to pick one up. It's a great conversation starter. Like jacari said, you know, you meet
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:27.080]  like minded people get one of these where to the gun range, wear it out to dinner. You
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:31.040]  know, let's get people thinking about these politically correct people want to end speech.
[2:43:31.040 --> 2:43:35.760]  They want to bully us and throw it in our face. This is almost like doing an open carry,
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:40.080]  but a lot safer. Open carries the cutting edge of civil rights, people exercising it
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:43.880]  to show people that guns haven't been banned. It's breaking that perception. We're beginning
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:49.040]  to win. But but this is the next best thing to that, I think. Absolutely because they
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:53.800]  demonize open carriers here in Texas. But it's the the actions of the open carriers
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:58.160]  guys like CJ Grisha and Cargill and all these other guys here in Texas, who actually made
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:02.600]  open carry a law for your pistol here in the state of Texas, because a lot of people think
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:06.600]  of Texas as a pro gun state. But you see these guys, it wasn't one of the best. But now it
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:10.720]  is. Yeah, you see these guys walking around with their M4s and their AKs because they're
[2:44:10.720 --> 2:44:13.920]  trying to make the point that they couldn't carry their pistols. And thanks to the work
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:17.800]  that they've done, they've been demonized in a lot of different areas, but it's a one
[2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:20.760]  tension. Yeah, they brought the and the governor's now talking about the New World Order and
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:24.760]  the world government. He's going to battle it. We're winning. We're marching forward.
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:27.880]  We're working with everybody. And I'm glad well about the point. The shirts, the protest
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:31.760]  shirt in the face of the system coming after them. You're not getting our guns. Well, anything
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:32.760]  else?
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:36.840]  I just want to say, you know, to everybody out there, there is a lot of support for what
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:40.200]  we're standing for in the Second Amendment everywhere you go. I know people get discouraged,
[2:44:40.200 --> 2:44:44.040]  but you know, I was up at the Capitol on Saturday and everywhere I looked, you know, they had
[2:44:44.040 --> 2:44:48.360]  the state troopers up there and they were carrying AR 15. So I just started talking to
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:52.320]  them and they were all fans of yours. They were all pro-second amendment. Everywhere
[2:44:52.320 --> 2:44:56.000]  I go, I meet people at a pro-second amendment and they're worried about what's going on
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  in this country.
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:00.520]  By the way, I want to be clear because I don't even know you went to the Capitol this weekend,
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:03.480]  Weldon, but I know that's how politically involved you are for this country. You know,
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:07.240]  that's what we do in our off time. We're not bragging when we say the police are waking
[2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:13.400]  up, the military is waking up, white people, black people, everybody's just people. It's
[2:45:13.400 --> 2:45:19.960]  really true that just Info Wars as one focal point is exploding. It's absolutely exploding
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:28.160]  and it's just crazy just as a gauge of how serious people are getting about what's happening.
[2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:33.320]  It's a huge war going on. It's a battle every day for our rights, but you know, we are winning.
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:38.440]  You say we're winning. It's such a large scale, but we are having an impact. We are affecting
[2:45:38.440 --> 2:45:42.520]  change. It's why this is all so important here at Info Wars. You're doing a great job,
[2:45:42.520 --> 2:45:46.400]  Alex. No, you are, and the listeners are. Please don't thank me. I'm telling you, everybody
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:50.360]  tolerates me around here. I'm the big guy. We just need to remember we are winning. We're
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:55.560]  having an effect. Well, you guys are awesome. God bless you, Weldon. God bless you, Jukari.
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:46:01.480]  Let's go back to the Lewis Faircon exclusive interview and the 50 minute boil down documentary.
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:05.520]  Lewis Faircon Angel or devil is now up on info wars.com. It's going up on Facebook. We're
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:11.440]  tweeting it out at real Alex Jones. And then again, in the next few hours, the full unredacted
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:16.880]  and it's a documentary as well. Two plus hour film on Lewis Faircon is coming out. We're
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:21.240]  going to title that. I don't know where to title it. The most important. Well, I'm coming
[2:46:21.240 --> 2:46:27.000]  up with that title soon. So let's go back to Lewis Faircon. Our government has gone
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:37.760]  into nations with money from our Congress to stimulate the dissatisfied and then armed
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:45.960]  them against a government that is their government. That's what America did in Libya. That's what
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:57.200]  they're doing in Syria. And the blowback now is they have created a refugee crisis that
[2:46:57.200 --> 2:47:07.880]  is destabilizing the countries in Europe. So when Mr. Trump said, um, we can't allow
[2:47:07.880 --> 2:47:17.640]  these Muslims refugees into America. Now, a lot of people were upset with him. But I
[2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:28.400]  know, um, sir, that the hatred for America in the Muslim world is building as we told
[2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:38.440]  Mr. Bush. No Muslim leader could call for jihad and have it stick. No Muslim leader had the
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:47.400]  power to unite the whole Muslim world. I said, but America's policies will unite those people
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:48:00.040]  against the West and it is happening. So in this way, Mr. Trump, I think is wise to vet
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:09.280]  anyone coming from that area into America because the hatred for America is in the streets
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:17.380]  now. So if those people are refugees and America feels I got to let 10,000 of them in because
[2:48:17.380 --> 2:48:26.040]  America created the problem. Now, if you let them in and you don't vet them carefully,
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:33.760]  you might be letting in your own destruction. We have before us the opportunity to forge
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:39.880]  for ourselves and for future generations a new world order, a world where the rule of
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:47.800]  law, not the law of the jungle governs the conduct of nations when we are successful
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:53.880]  and we will be. We have a real chance at this new world order in order in which a credible
[2:48:53.880 --> 2:49:00.640]  United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:13.160]  founders. No matter how hard the Schema's plan to destroy the good that can come to
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:23.960]  the people with proper governance, they are losing and they will lose because they have
[2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:31.360]  set a trap but they're getting caught in their own trap. The American people are waking
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:39.560]  up. The masses all over the earth are beginning to rise and that's why Zabignu Brzezinski
[2:49:39.560 --> 2:50:08.160]  said. So all kinds of schemes are developing to kill
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:17.640]  mass populations and you may have heard us say that the gentleman that was the Secretary
[2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:26.240]  of State under Nixon, Mr. Kissinger developed this memo called Memo 200 in which he said
[2:50:26.240 --> 2:50:39.480]  that two billion people on this earth had to be culled because the resources of the
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:48.680]  earth are getting shorter, the population getting more so we got to kill billions of
[2:50:48.680 --> 2:51:01.080]  people and it's going on as we speak. The radical, you call them the pharmaceutical
[2:51:01.080 --> 2:51:12.120]  companies, who goes against them? Nobody. Who goes against the gun lobby? Nobody. They
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:17.840]  don't have the power to change it. It's not that the American people shouldn't have
[2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:29.520]  guns. That's what the Constitution declares. We as Muslims, our leader told us no weapons.
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:38.280]  Not even as much as a pin knife because in our homes the nation of Islam has taught hundreds
[2:51:38.280 --> 2:51:49.560]  of thousands of people and in the nation you never hear Muslim killing Muslim in an argument
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:55.280]  because we are taught that it's the truth that settles all arguments so we don't have
[2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:02.640]  a gun to reach for or a knife to reach for. We reach for our intelligence and we argue
[2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:08.840]  over the truth. What is the truth? And if the truth is from my wife and it condemns
[2:52:08.840 --> 2:52:15.360]  an action of mine, I have to bow down to the truth. I can't raise my fist and strike
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:38.920]  them because it's against our law. I agree with you that free speech and liberation trumps
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:44.320]  violence. The problem is when an outside group comes who isn't going to listen to what you're
[2:52:44.320 --> 2:52:48.560]  having to say then you have to defend yourself but separately because that's one of my main
[2:52:48.560 --> 2:52:52.680]  questions and I've got to get to it with you. And then you just started getting into before
[2:52:52.680 --> 2:52:55.960]  I even asked it. This is an amazing interview because you're just following where I was
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:53:02.160]  going to go without even asking the question so it's amazing. But eugenics, yes, 1,100
[2:53:02.160 --> 2:53:08.000]  people get shot by the police every year and killed. In some cases, in fact in a lot of
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:13.560]  cases it's in the wrong. Sometimes bad officers get away with it. I've written books on the
[2:53:13.560 --> 2:53:19.200]  subject. I've criticized it. I'm the guy that tried to expose the police state but the police
[2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:24.560]  are only one small part of the police state and for me it becomes a scapegoat. We just
[2:53:24.560 --> 2:53:30.600]  make it about them and then project what bad officers do on other officers and then I look
[2:53:30.600 --> 2:53:38.800]  separately at how they use hatred of police in Ukraine. George Soros did to just now overthrow
[2:53:38.800 --> 2:53:43.560]  that government, not to empower the people, it was an elected government, but to create
[2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:50.840]  an even bigger crisis. So I see more than a million black people aborted every year
[2:53:50.840 --> 2:53:56.760]  on average in some states more than half the abortions are wonderful, beautiful black
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:54:02.560]  babies. And I don't hear a word about this from the liberal black leaders, the white
[2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:07.920]  black leaders or any of them. I know you speak about it. And so I kind of measure it. You
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:13.880]  got a million dead black people over here, chopped up babies. We know they're innocent.
[2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:17.080]  You can even watch some of the sonogram videos where they're fighting the scalpel with their
[2:54:17.080 --> 2:54:21.760]  hands and their feet. I don't care what color the baby is, they fight for their lives because
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:27.720]  they're red-blooded. And then over here I've got 1,100 dead people, maybe 1,000 of them
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:33.400]  are black. Let's say all 1,000 of them were murdered in cold blood. The system's telling
[2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:38.520]  me to get upset about that all day and make that my main focus. When over here I've got
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:42.360]  a million dead black people, and millions of dead white people, and millions of dead
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:45.840]  other human beings. I think the greatest city in the world is bringing children into the
[2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:50.440]  world. Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just mock when they're born. And then
[2:54:50.440 --> 2:54:54.080]  I read Margaret Sanger going, we're going to pose as liberals, we're going to go into
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:57.720]  these black communities, we're going to buy off their preachers, we're going to get control
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:55:01.920]  of them, and we're going to get them in these big cities. And I look at the big liberal
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:05.800]  cities where they've taken the guns from the black people, where they've shipped the drugs
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:10.560]  in, where they've got the Planned Parenthood on every corner. And I tell you, growing up
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:14.960]  around conservatives, libertarians, I never heard racist talk in Dallas, Texas. And when
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:19.120]  I started hearing the racist talk was when I would get around liberals and Democrats
[2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:22.720]  and people when I was in college, and when I was getting politically involved, I'd have
[2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:26.720]  white liberals and black liberals come up to me and they say nobody wants these trashy
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:32.320]  black scum, and if you want them, you take them. Why are you so worried about a zygote?
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:35.640]  Ultimately your sympathies do not lie with black people, they lie with your racist white
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:39.240]  middle class agenda, and that's where we'll always lie, and you will be destroyed holding
[2:55:39.240 --> 2:55:44.440]  that line. Okay, I adopted two children. Oh, good for you, white savior, aren't you so
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:51.200]  proud you're- They're not white. Exactly, he's not white, exactly, you're a white savior.
[2:55:51.200 --> 2:55:55.440]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right? How can
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:56:01.960]  you do a job? How many? How many did I adopt? I kill my kids. How many? How many did I adopt?
[2:56:01.960 --> 2:56:11.840]  I kill my kids. I kill my kids. I pay for that. I pay all my money for that. I get free
[2:56:11.840 --> 2:56:17.600]  abortions on demand without apology. You are wicked as hell. And I'm going to hell. Yeah,
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:23.200]  I still pay to kill babies though. Really? Oh yeah. How do you get your abortions paid?
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:30.200]  I pay for them. Yeah, I mean, you pay for them. Upwards of 50. Really? Oh yeah. Wow,
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:35.000]  you must- I raise money from the community for it. Oh, you don't use your money? Yep.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:39.440]  You multiply your efforts, huh? And I'm going to tell you right now, that's where I've heard
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:43.280]  the racism, that's where I've heard the sneakiness, and if you don't know where the white devils
[2:56:43.280 --> 2:56:48.960]  are, Mr. Lewis Farrakhan, I can tell you right now they run the Democratic Party 100% and
[2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:54.800]  they've got black people in their web, murdering your people, and they love it, and they think
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:58.600]  that people don't see them while I see them, and I know who they are. And I don't care
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:03.000]  what color a baby is, my soul won't allow me to hate somebody because of what color
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:07.680]  they are, because I know I'll be destroyed if I ever go that direction. And so that's
[2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:10.560]  where I stand, and that's why I wanted to have this meeting with you, because you already
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:15.000]  tell people a lot of great things, and I know you reach tens of millions, but if you, which
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:20.320]  you've already done, magnify, exposing what's in the vaccines, they've caught them in Africa
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:25.280]  and India with the steroids, you know that. If you expose the abortion, which I know you
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:29.720]  do, and said, you know what, somebody kills you and gets away with it, they need to be
[2:57:29.720 --> 2:57:34.320]  dealt with, I agree. Well, what about what's going on in these abortuaries? What about
[2:57:34.320 --> 2:57:38.240]  Planned Parenthood? What about what's happening there?
[2:57:38.240 --> 2:57:47.320]  When I was on the Mall a few weeks ago in Washington, I talked about my mom, and I talked
[2:57:47.320 --> 2:57:57.160]  about the circumstances around my birth, and my mother knew that if I came to birth, I
[2:57:57.160 --> 2:58:05.080]  could disrupt her relationship with the man that she was with, because my father, whom
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:15.200]  she married, and he was a handsome philanderer, so she got rid of him, but he came back on
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:25.600]  the scene, and she was pregnant with me. The man, my mother's very dark, and the man
[2:58:25.600 --> 2:58:27.200]  had to be arrived. Unfortunately, we have to interrupt this, because
[2:58:27.200 --> 2:58:30.480]  the end of the hour, we'll be back in 70 seconds after the break, we're going to back that
[2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:34.280]  up. This brought a tear to my mind when he told this story. His mother tried to abort
[2:58:34.280 --> 2:58:39.080]  him three times, four hours straight ahead at infowars.com forward slash go, trying to
[2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:47.400]  bring people together, trying to expose the bigger agenda, the war against humanity.

[2:59:35.720 --> 2:59:41.760]  important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano. Now available at infowarslife.com.

[2:59:51.200 --> 3:00:07.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:13.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. From the front lines of
[3:00:13.960 --> 3:00:26.840]  the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:26.840 --> 3:00:34.720]  You know, David Knight has got a story he's about to cover that is so big. And I just
[3:00:34.720 --> 3:00:41.160]  hope it's not overshadowed by some of the people that have taken over some of the federal
[3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:44.920]  buildings being arrested, driving around in the federal vehicles, going to the grocery
[3:00:44.920 --> 3:00:51.320]  store, people on TV begging for snacks. When they run stunts, mailing sex toys to them,
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:56.840]  they pull them out and wave them around on TV. I mean, it is just a disaster. And I supported
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:02.760]  the Bundys and their grazing rights in Nevada. And our reporters were there when they were
[3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:12.760]  threatened to shoot them. And then I just see this whole circus that it has become. And
[3:01:12.760 --> 3:01:19.000]  then meanwhile, we have footage that's gotten no attention. It went up on infowars.com.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:24.720]  And there's just hours of this at retirement parties for BLM people, where they're literally
[3:01:24.720 --> 3:01:32.280]  giving awards out for people that took more land from people and bragging about it. Quotes
[3:01:32.280 --> 3:01:36.960]  like, we're the bad guys, we come in and take this land. So you get that like the Bundys
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:43.320]  are like heroes making a stand, but they're doing it from not the best position, not the
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:48.480]  best place, wide open with all these weird homeless people and stuff. There's a whole
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:52.920]  trend of like homeless people that say they're militia, which fine, all men are militia,
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:57.160]  you know, going around and then just basically freeloading around. And it's just, it's, it's
[3:01:57.160 --> 3:02:05.000]  a disaster. And there's obviously fed swinging from the chandeliers. I mean, it is really
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  a provocation. And I don't think they're bad people. They're just walking into a disaster.
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:16.680]  That's coming up. I mean, the footage is unbelievable. And towards the end of the fourth hour, he's
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:20.400]  going to play another segment of the Farrakhan interview, but the full interview is now up
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:22.720]  on infowars.com.
[3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:27.480]  Lewis Farrakhan, angel or devil, Alex Jones, honorable minister, Farrakhan breakdown of
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:32.200]  the globalist and slave us all. And again, if you don't put it as if another that asks
[3:02:32.200 --> 3:02:36.280]  a question, nobody will watch the video. I don't even know about the subheadline. This
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:40.760]  is a powerful historic interview that breaks the mold. I think that's the subheadline.
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:44.560]  Not knocking folks. I didn't tell them what to write. I just think, you know, powerful
[3:02:44.560 --> 3:02:50.480]  in this powerful unprecedented interview, Alex Jones breaks the mold of interviewing
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:54.680]  Lewis Farrakhan, instead of just going in there and trying to get into fight with him
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:02:58.720]  and then have more balkanization. I say what I disagree with. I'd say what I agree with.
[3:02:58.720 --> 3:03:01.840]  It's powerful. I'm not going to have time to get to all this because when he comes
[3:03:01.840 --> 3:03:06.600]  back, I'll play it. But later in the hour, but the part about the abortion and how his
[3:03:06.600 --> 3:03:09.560]  mother tried to abort him three times, let's see if we have time to get to it before we
[3:03:09.560 --> 3:03:11.360]  go to break. Here it is.
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:16.200]  What about what's going on in these abortions? What about Planned Parenthood? What about
[3:03:16.200 --> 3:03:18.400]  what's happening there?
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:27.480]  When I was on the mall a few weeks ago in Washington, I talked about my mom and I talked
[3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:37.320]  about the circumstances around my birth and my mother knew that if I came to birth, I
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:45.240]  could disrupt her relationship with the man that she was with because my father, whom
[3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:55.320]  she married, and he was a handsome philanderer, so she got rid of him, but he came back on
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:04:06.080]  the scene and she was pregnant with me. The man, my mother is very dark and the man that
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:17.320]  gave my mother her first child is very dark, so my brother is dark, but my father was light-skinned,
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:26.760]  curly-haired, so she was afraid that if that baby came to birth and was light-skinned, it
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:34.960]  would destroy her relationship with that man, so she decided to abort me and she tried
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:45.440]  three times to abort me and on the third time in those days she used a hanger and she was
[3:04:45.440 --> 3:04:46.440]  unsuccessful.
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:50.400]  Folks, I mean again, this is breaking the mold. It's a very powerful interview. Help
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:59.280]  it go viral right now. The system does not want this info out. Infowars.com right now.
[3:04:59.280 --> 3:05:04.760]  Will you enter the matrix or fight its construction? As the World Economic Forum underway in Davos,
[3:05:04.760 --> 3:05:09.080]  it emphasizes about a future that doesn't need us. They openly talk about the imposition
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:14.000]  of new technologies to control us. The admission, for example, that driverless cars will be
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:19.800]  used as surveillance tools with CEO Rob Leslie saying, availability and resolution of imaging
[3:05:19.800 --> 3:05:25.360]  from satellites, drones and self-driving cars will continue to increase exponentially. In
[3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:31.440]  other words, these robot cars will be surveillance tools like satellites and drones. The federal
[3:05:31.440 --> 3:05:35.440]  Department of Transportation is expected to create legislation outside of Congress's
[3:05:35.440 --> 3:05:39.880]  involvement this year to regulate communication equipment on cars that would communicate
[3:05:39.880 --> 3:05:46.080]  vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure. Detroit projects this to be a $46 billion
[3:05:46.080 --> 3:05:52.240]  market in just four years. Or put another way, the price of cars is about to soar. Corporate
[3:05:52.240 --> 3:05:58.560]  profits and government surveillance, a match made in hell. This is David Knight for Infowars.com.

[3:08:21.280 --> 3:08:27.200]  of Wednesday, January the 20th, 2016. I'm David Knight, your host. I'll be here the rest of this
[3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:33.040]  hour. We're going to play another clip from Lewis Faircon to finish that up. I have some
[3:08:33.040 --> 3:08:38.720]  amazing news, as Alex has been telling you, a retirement party a few years ago, and we have
[3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:45.760]  the article up on infowarstore.com by Don Salazar that I think it's gone live now,
[3:08:45.760 --> 3:08:50.400]  but it's going to be coming up if it's not up there. Basically, what they're talking about
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:56.320]  is they're celebrating this lady they call the Acquisition Queen. They brag about all the land
[3:08:56.320 --> 3:09:01.520]  that she's taken, how much land she has taken for, and I'm not sure if it's the Park Service or the
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:05.120]  BLM. Look, they all work for the Department of Interior. They all work for the federal government.
[3:09:05.680 --> 3:09:11.680]  The BLM has different parts of its organization, some of them that confiscate land, some of them that
[3:09:13.040 --> 3:09:18.160]  supposedly manage land. That's questionable as we see this. But what you need to understand
[3:09:18.160 --> 3:09:24.960]  is the attitude of these bureaucrats. As I looked at this, have you ever wondered if there's any
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:30.880]  remorse or any regret from the people when they throw people out of their homes? And actually,
[3:09:30.880 --> 3:09:37.040]  when I look at this and the applause and the laughing and the taunting of private ownership
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:43.040]  that goes on in this retirement party, no, they don't. As a matter of fact, they want more people
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:48.560]  to take more land. Because even though this lady, as she was retiring from this one position,
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:52.800]  she was going to go out to Lassen Park in California. And they were talking about how
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:09:57.440]  many acres were owned there by the Park Service. Then they said, and in this area,
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:06.240]  there's another five acres out of compared to the 106,000 acres that are there. In other words,
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:13.920]  there is five 1,000th of a percent private land. And the guy who talks about this says, well,
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:19.520]  if I was that private landowner, I'd be concerned about this. We're going to play you those clips.
[3:10:19.520 --> 3:10:24.160]  It will make your blood boil. It makes my blood boil. This is what our government is doing,
[3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:29.360]  as we've seen many times. The people who are fighting this out west, the people who have seen,
[3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:36.560]  and again, in Utah, there was a demonstration held by a county commissioner that he organized,
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:41.280]  as the Park Service was going to shut down a trail that had been open to recreational vehicles.
[3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:45.360]  A lot of people in the city and a lot of people in the suburbs don't really understand what's
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:51.360]  going on with the ranchers. They think, well, I want to have these massive parks and understand
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:57.040]  that they're only going to let you use far less than 1% of this land. They're going to lock that
[3:10:57.040 --> 3:11:02.800]  up. And now they're locking down the 1%. And so they organized a protest. They threw the guy in
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:07.840]  jail for 10 days. They fined him. I think it was, I can't remember trying to go from memory. I think
[3:11:07.840 --> 3:11:15.680]  it was $100,000, $200,000 fine and put him on probation because these people did a protest ride
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:20.240]  down this trail that had been previously open to the public. They want to shut everything down.
[3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:24.800]  As I said, they want to lock up all the land and tell you that you can't have any of it.
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:31.280]  It's absolutely amazing. This is what's going on with Agenda 21. They call this sustainable
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:37.200]  development. Sustainable development means that 99.9999, and I'm not exaggerating,
[3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:43.600]  percent of the land in this country will be locked up and off limits to you. And you will be crammed
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:48.480]  into some congested cities that you can't even imagine what it's going to be like living in them
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:55.280]  with one 200 square foot apartments. That's their plan for the future. And so we have to understand
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:12:00.400]  where they're going, first of all, if we're going to stop it. And as Alex was pointing out, I think
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:05.840]  that the Bundys have done a great job when they were there with their property, with their neighbors
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:11.680]  standing against theft of their rights that they possessed as property. Those grazing rights
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:16.960]  are rights in and of themselves. Those are things that they had. They had done developments to that
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:23.200]  with water rights as well as grazing rights. They had developed water features. The BLM was going
[3:12:23.200 --> 3:12:29.040]  in destroying those, confiscating their cattle, literally not trying to manage the area. And
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:35.440]  that was Clive and Bundy's point. That's when he stopped paying the fees and protest. And that's
[3:12:35.440 --> 3:12:41.360]  a legitimate thing. They want to call him a welfare king rancher, okay? That's not what was going on.
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:46.720]  These people are the acquisition queens, the theft people. As one of them says,
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:51.840]  we're the bad guys. We come in and we take this land. They also brag about how they steal a mind.
[3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:58.560]  So we're going to play that. We're also going to play what Obama wants to do with smart guns as
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:06.000]  part of his executive plan on guns. He wants to force us to have smart guns that nobody really
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:11.520]  wants. There's absolutely no reason why you would want one of these things. There's other ways to
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:16.240]  address the issues that he wants to do. But of course, there's a reason that they want to put
[3:13:16.240 --> 3:13:20.880]  out the smart gun technology. And you need to understand what's behind that. Before we get to
[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:25.280]  those two stories and before we play the Lewis Farrakhan clip, I want to go over a couple of
[3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:30.640]  small but very insightful news features. For example, here's one, Chris Christie,
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:38.240]  the presidential candidate, the governor of New Jersey. He just signed into law a bill called
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:44.960]  the right to shovel. And let me tell you what these people are shoveling, okay? No, seriously.
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:52.400]  This is to establish a very narrow right for teenagers to be able to shovel snow for their
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:58.720]  neighbors and get paid a little bit of money without getting harassed by the cops. Isn't that
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:04.080]  pathetic? Isn't that pathetic? The police state of New Jersey. This is legislation sponsored by
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:10.240]  Senator Mike Dary. He ensured that kids have the right to offer snow shoveling services
[3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:14.880]  before the storms without municipal approval. And Governor Christie
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:21.440]  magnanimously signed that into law. Look, you need to understand that it's not just
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:26.240]  for the ranchers. It's not just in the rural areas. It's not just in the suburban areas.
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:34.400]  We live in Sherwood Forest. And the sheriff of Nottingham has locked this entire place up,
[3:14:34.400 --> 3:14:40.000]  and you can't do anything. No matter how minor, whether it's a lemonade stand or shoveling snow
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:46.480]  for your neighbors, you can't do anything unless the king expressly allows it. Otherwise,
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:50.960]  the sheriff of Nottingham is going to come in and bust your head or lock you up in jail,
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:55.120]  or maybe kill you if you get angry about the injustice. Here's what they said.
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:14:59.920]  He said, it's incredible that some towns wanted kids to register a business or to buy expensive
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:05.040]  solicitation permits before offering to shovel their neighbors driveways and sidewalks. Absolutely.
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:08.160]  I agree with him. This is the senator who put the blow on. He says this new law
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:12.320]  sends the message that kids looking to make a few bucks on a snow day
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:16.880]  shouldn't be subjected to government red tape or fine for shoveling snow. And he tweets out,
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:22.080]  my right to shovel bill was signed into law by Governor Christie just in time for a big snow
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:26.640]  storm expected this weekend. Now, I don't want to criticize this senator too much because he did
[3:15:26.640 --> 3:15:32.800]  the right thing. But when I look at this, I think about this and how pathetic, how pathetic,
[3:15:32.800 --> 3:15:38.800]  that we have to have a law passed to say that we have a right to do something. Because you
[3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:44.480]  understand, they have completely perverted everything this country is about. It's not a free
[3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:48.240]  country anymore. We used to say that when I was a kid. Can I do this? It's a free country.
[3:15:48.240 --> 3:15:53.680]  You ever hear anybody say that anymore? No. I notice it gradually got taken over by the idea,
[3:15:53.680 --> 3:15:58.640]  hey, there ought to be a law, then there ought to be a federal law. And now everything we do in
[3:15:58.640 --> 3:16:03.920]  this country is a privilege that is granted by government. We take the position that everything
[3:16:03.920 --> 3:16:11.200]  is denied to us unless expressly permitted. And so you can't even have a right to shovel,
[3:16:11.200 --> 3:16:17.280]  you have to have express permission from the government to shovel snow as a teenager.
[3:16:17.280 --> 3:16:20.960]  They said this was drafted in response to reports of a pair of high school seniors
[3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:27.120]  who were stopped in January last year by bound Brooke police, told they could not go door to
[3:16:27.120 --> 3:16:31.600]  door without a permit. They couldn't hand out flyers and attempt to solicit snow shoveling
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:39.520]  business for a snowstorm the next morning. Well, as he points out in this law, it says,
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:45.200]  no ordinance regulating solicitation for services shall be applicable to solicitations
[3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:50.800]  whether written or oral for snow shoveling services made within 24 hours of a snowstorm
[3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:54.880]  that has been predicted by commonly recognized commercial or governmental weather reporting
[3:16:54.880 --> 3:17:00.880]  entity. How about this? Instead of that long, legal, boring, opaque definition that I just
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:07.440]  read to you, why don't we fire these cops who harass the kids? Why don't we say you've got too
[3:17:07.440 --> 3:17:13.280]  many police in your department with nothing to do? We don't need to be paying taxes to support
[3:17:13.280 --> 3:17:18.160]  their salaries, send them home. There's too many cops, they have nothing to do.
[3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:24.160]  And when I look about this narrow definition of freedom, where we have to have a special bill
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:31.120]  introduced into the legislature signed by the governor to allow us to shovel snow without
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:37.840]  being harassed by the sheriff of Nottingham. I'm reminded of this quote that I think about
[3:17:37.840 --> 3:17:42.240]  all the time of George Washington when they asked him about the British as they talk about
[3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:49.440]  liberty, aren't the British people free? He said, they walk about freely, but between high walls.
[3:17:50.560 --> 3:17:58.720]  We walk about between high walls, we walk about between very narrow alleyways of permitted freedoms.
[3:17:58.720 --> 3:18:03.840]  Isn't it pathetic? Isn't it pathetic in this land of the free that we stand for this?
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:09.440]  And before we go to break, I want to read you this other example of overstep and one of the
[3:18:09.440 --> 3:18:14.080]  corrections for this. We have a situation where we've got a Captain Edwards, who was then a police
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:19.760]  lieutenant, flipped out when he put on his emergency lights, but not his siren, and a
[3:18:19.760 --> 3:18:23.440]  motorcyclist didn't pull over for three minutes. And the motorcyclist said, well,
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:27.520]  you can't turn around 100% behind you when you're riding a motorcycle. For one, you don't want to
[3:18:27.520 --> 3:18:32.800]  do that because you take your eyes off the road. The mirror on the motorcycle vibrates. His car
[3:18:32.800 --> 3:18:36.800]  was an undercover car with low profile lights. When I found out it was getting pulled over,
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:41.280]  I pulled over. And of course, as you can see, if you look at this picture of this, it's got a small
[3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:45.440]  red and white, red and blue lights located in the grill, along with a small light at the top of the
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:18:50.080]  windshield. Now, with his turn signal activated, he pulls over on their shoulder road, puts his
[3:18:50.080 --> 3:18:58.400]  feet on the ground. At this point, the policeman rams his 2006 sport bike with his new Camaro
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:03.760]  police car, knocking the motorcyclist over, causing damage to the front end of the new Camaro.
[3:19:03.760 --> 3:19:08.480]  He nearly took my leg off, said the motorcyclist. On a dial clock, 12 o'clock facing forward,
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:13.280]  he hit me about 7.30. When you have your foot on a peg on a motorcycle, it's at about 8.30.
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:18.800]  So he quickly stood up. He had his arms extended, palms up. The policeman jumps out of his vehicle
[3:19:18.800 --> 3:19:26.160]  with his gun pointed at this guy. Total road rage, total out of control, total barney fife.
[3:19:26.160 --> 3:19:31.360]  Then he yelled to get down to the ground. Okay? Now, this guy said, took him a second or so,
[3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:36.960]  because he has his helmet on, didn't do it quickly enough. So he gave him a karate kick to the chest.
[3:19:36.960 --> 3:19:45.040]  Okay? And broke his ribs or something. Nevertheless, a jury did something about it. The district
[3:19:45.040 --> 3:19:50.320]  attorney didn't bring charges. This guy was promoted from lieutenant to captain, but a jury
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:58.240]  fined him personally $180,000. That's why you have juries. That's why we need to take our power back.

[3:24:07.040 --> 3:24:11.040]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I am David Knight, your host on this fourth hour,
[3:24:11.040 --> 3:24:17.440]  January 20th, 2016. Now as promised, we're going to play you this amazing clip from
[3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:23.360]  this retirement party for a federal bureaucrat, the people who are in land acquisition. Again,
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:28.960]  it's part of the park service. She's a park service employee. All under the Department
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:33.920]  of Interior. They all work with the Bureau of Land Management. You've got the Fish and Wildlife
[3:24:33.920 --> 3:24:39.120]  people. You've got the BLM people. You've got the Park Service people. You've got the people right
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:44.000]  here who are stealing the land from people and locking it up. We're going to play you some of
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:47.520]  these clips. You will not believe this. Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know about
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:52.720]  some of the specials we've got this week. This week only, we have Survival Shield X2, our nascent
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:59.520]  iodine, and SuperMail Vitality for 15% off. Just this week, these are two of the most essential

[3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:32.720]  advanced multivitamin mineral complex to date. It provides you with the highest quality essential

[3:25:37.680 --> 3:25:43.280]  at infowarshealth.com. It's the world's first energy drink that's powered by flour pollen
[3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:49.840]  that contains a blend of powerful antioxidants and other key nutrients, and it will wake you up
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:55.600]  naturally. Let me tell you, I've used that. Pollen Burst is one way to wake yourself. You get some
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:26:01.280]  Pollen Burst and some Brain Force, and you're good to go. That's one of my favorite things to do.
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:08.480]  Okay, now let's get to this clip of the BLM stuff. This is coming from Lady Serena Katania.
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:11.760]  I think this is a way to pronounce her name. She has a Sustaining America channel.
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:17.120]  We were sent this clip. A couple of different people sent this to us. I want to try to get her
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:22.240]  on. She's got a website, SustainingAmerica.com. Talk to her a little bit more about the background
[3:26:22.240 --> 3:26:27.920]  of this. And of course, if you go to her YouTube channel, go to her website, you'll see some other
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:35.920]  very heartbreaking videos about people who built their dream home, wanted to retire close to a
[3:26:36.560 --> 3:26:43.120]  national park, and the national park comes in and takes their land. And this one video that she has,
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:49.840]  the lady says, they had just built their dream home. They were working on this, and they were
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:53.920]  going to confiscate all of it. She asked, well, what are you going to do with the home? They said,
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:27:00.080]  well, some of the nicer ones like yours, we won't tear down. We'll have park employees move into them.
[3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:07.040]  And it's like, oh, okay, so it's okay for the government bureaucrats to live in these homes.
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:13.520]  It's not an impact on the sustainability of the environment if a park employee or a federal
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:19.840]  employee steals this from you and lives in it, but you can't stay there. That's the reality that
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:25.600]  we live with, okay? So yeah, there's some heart-wrenching other videos that she has. She's gone around
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:29.440]  doing interviews with people. We're going to do the same thing here at InfoWars because we have
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:35.920]  to understand what this is about. This isn't just coming about the ranchers or the miners
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:41.920]  or the loggers, okay? They're coming after people with homes in the suburbs. And if you don't understand
[3:27:41.920 --> 3:27:45.760]  that these people have rights as well, you're going to lose your home as well.
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:51.120]  When you look at these massive forest fires that are happening on government land,
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:57.840]  it is because of a policy that puts a priority on locking people out of the land. It used to be
[3:27:57.840 --> 3:28:02.240]  they would allow people to come in and cut dead wood, standing dead wood, falling dead wood,
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:11.120]  okay? That was what would keep the forest fires down. By letting standing dead trees remain,
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:15.360]  by letting them remain on the ground after they fall, and without letting anybody pull these
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:22.000]  things out, that is causing massive devastation. As we talked about when we talked about the
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:27.040]  situation with the Hammond family, here was a situation where that year in Oregon,
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:32.000]  three and a half million acres burned from wildfires. They tried to stop a wildfire that was
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:39.120]  going to destroy their property. They did a backfire to stop it. 139 acres burned. And for that,
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:47.520]  the BLM called them arsonist and prosecuted them as terrorists. And by the way, the bureaucrat who
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:54.800]  did this, the prosecuting attorney who pushed that, has some pretty massive personal problems.
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:29:00.720]  She wound up having to resign, said she was suffering from PTSD. I don't know if she was
[3:29:00.720 --> 3:29:04.960]  a vet or if that was just a warfare she's conducting on the American people. Let me play
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:09.920]  this clip for you real quickly. Give you a taste of this. But I did have a letter here from the
[3:29:09.920 --> 3:29:17.200]  Washington office. And what it says in the letter to Mary is thank you for all of your support.
[3:29:18.400 --> 3:29:25.040]  And Mary has and Dick, they have supported land. Lands isn't always supported because we're the
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:31.600]  bad, the bad guys. We come in and we take this land and we always take it for less than it's
[3:29:31.600 --> 3:29:38.960]  worth. And I still talk to Washington and keep telling them you need more, you need more staff.
[3:29:39.920 --> 3:29:44.320]  Yeah, need more people to take land for less than it's worth. They're the bad guys.
[3:29:44.320 --> 3:29:47.440]  They're bragging about it. Stay with us. We've got more of that coming up.
[3:29:47.440 --> 3:29:54.160]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:54.160 --> 3:30:04.240]  The intelligence community's inspector general has just revealed the lawmakers at Hillary Clinton
[3:30:04.240 --> 3:30:11.200]  had classified documents above top secret on her private email server in addition to over 1300
[3:30:11.200 --> 3:30:16.000]  other classified emails. Access to information in the special access program is more highly
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:21.600]  restricted, more sensitive than top secret because it would likely reveal the source putting lives
[3:30:21.600 --> 3:30:27.040]  at risk. We're constantly told that our money, our rule of law, our liberties must all be
[3:30:27.040 --> 3:30:32.240]  sacrificed on the altar of national security. Hillary has violated the surveillance state's
[3:30:32.240 --> 3:30:37.360]  religion and she needs to be burned at the stake. Orange is the new pants soup, Hillary,
[3:30:37.360 --> 3:30:42.160]  but she's being investigated by Obama's Justice Department and she has about as much chance
[3:30:42.160 --> 3:30:47.600]  of going to jail as a Chicago cop. If she gets away with these crimes, the fraud of the surveillance
[3:30:47.600 --> 3:30:57.840]  state will be inescapably obvious to all. For more information, go to infowars.com. I'm David Knight.

[3:33:19.840 --> 3:33:26.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live to the Central
[3:33:26.720 --> 3:33:33.040]  Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight,
[3:33:33.040 --> 3:33:39.280]  your host for the rest of this hour. We've been playing some excerpts from the retirement party
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:43.600]  for a Park Service employee, Mary Martin. She was going to be retiring from the Mojave Preserve,
[3:33:43.600 --> 3:33:46.880]  and she was going to be, though, transferring, not really a retirement. She was going to be
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:52.720]  transferring, I guess, to the Lassen Volcanic Preserve in California. Now, as we just played
[3:33:52.720 --> 3:33:58.160]  in the last segment, they're bragging about the fact that they take land for less than it's worth.
[3:33:58.160 --> 3:34:02.240]  Let's play that little clip just one more time as a lead end to what they're about to talk about next.
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:09.280]  Lands isn't always supported because we're the bad guys. We come in and we take this land,
[3:34:09.280 --> 3:34:13.680]  and we always take it for less than it's worth. Yeah, they come in, they take this land,
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:17.680]  they always take it for less than it's worth. So here's an example from the same lady at the
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:22.320]  same party where they're going to brag about the fact that there was a mine that they wanted to
[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:28.160]  take. They said they estimated it was $40 million. They eventually get it for $2.5 million. Okay,
[3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:33.600]  so maybe about 5% of the real value of the property. And she brags about the fact that
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:40.880]  she took it from two little old guys that were in World War II. Absolutely merciless theft.
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:46.080]  Let's play that clip. Now, we'd sit there and wonder, why are we here? Yeah, why are you here?
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:52.640]  That we weren't back too long, and Dick calls and said, we need to have a meeting.
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:58.880]  There's a mine I want to acquire. I want to acquire this mine. So, okay. And so we had this meeting
[3:34:58.880 --> 3:35:04.800]  and I'm sitting there. Is that for Harry Reid? And well, what's the value? Do you have an idea
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:13.120]  what the value of this mine is? Yeah, around $40 million. Well, I came from DC, lands, and I knew
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:18.800]  how much money was in the bank. I forget how long it took us to acquire it. It did take forever.
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:24.320]  Yeah, we don't have it of money. Let's just steal it. We went out to the mine and the owners were
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:31.840]  two little guys that had been in the Second World War. This mine was in operation in the 40s.
[3:35:31.840 --> 3:35:37.440]  Yeah, so school. And you have to do it with a tile. They're old guys. Take advantage of them.
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:44.720]  I swear it was. And wrap my hand, our attorney's going like this. We didn't know what to do.
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:49.200]  We called everybody in the country. Nobody knew what to do. Nobody wanted to touch it.
[3:35:49.840 --> 3:35:55.360]  But anyway, we did get it appraised and we did acquire for $2.5 million, which I stole the money
[3:35:55.360 --> 3:36:01.760]  from Washington. Yeah, great. She stole the money from Washington and she got it for $2.5
[3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:08.320]  million, just a little over 5% of what they had appraised it as. Yeah, you're the bad guys.
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:14.240]  You come in and you take our land and you take it for less than it's worth. That's the reality of
[3:36:14.240 --> 3:36:19.680]  it. Let's play this next clip. This is where they refer to her as the acquisition queen. And this
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:24.320]  is the celebration again of this lady who's retiring from working at the Mojave Preserve.
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:30.240]  They're going to talk about how much land this acquisition queen has stolen. And then they're
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:34.880]  going to look forward to what she's going to do at her next position in California. Let's play that
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:40.800]  clip. Up on the wall, and I don't know whether you can see them or not, are three red numbers.
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:48.960]  Some pretty big ones and one small one. And I don't know how to do this, but I guess we'll go
[3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:54.640]  start with the big one, $111,500. So he's playing a little game. He's having the people guess,
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:37:04.400]  what is this? Under the acquisition queen's regime. Yes. $111,550 under the acquisition queen regime.
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:12.800]  Oh, applause. Isn't that great? We love that. It's required 111,000 acres. $103,372.36. What's
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:22.240]  that number? Okay, I'll have the next number. It's the private agent last. Ha ha ha. Hold it
[3:37:22.240 --> 3:37:25.680]  right there. Hold it right there. Hold it right there. Let me get this up. This is radio. Okay,
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:31.120]  so they put two numbers up. One is 5.66. The other is 106 some odd thousand acres. Okay,
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:34.800]  what are these two numbers? Well, the first one, the big one, 106,000 acres. That's the number
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:40.240]  of acres in the Lassen Volcanic Park Preserve. Okay. And then he says, and then the small one,
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:48.160]  5.66. That's the amount of private land. Ha ha. Ha ha. Says the park service employees. Go ahead,
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:38:01.120]  play the rest of this. That makes my blood boil. I don't know if you can hear that. He says, if you
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:09.440]  own that 5.66 acres, would you be sweating right now? Because you see, they've already gotten all
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:17.200]  but five one thousandths of a percent of the land in that area. They want it all. They want it all.
[3:38:17.200 --> 3:38:22.160]  And you better be sweating because the federal government is going to steal every last thing
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:27.120]  you've got. And these people are laughing about it. They're the thieves who work for the federal
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:31.600]  government. Makes my blood boil to see this. We've got the federal government in Texas moving the
[3:38:31.600 --> 3:38:38.320]  boundaries around the Red River for land that people have had for century telling them that
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:42.080]  they're going to steal their land. They're going to steal their homes. This is land that has been
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:45.520]  private land. It's been registered. They've been paying taxes on it. They're doing this
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:50.080]  everywhere, folks. You better wake up. They're going to take your stuff too. Whether they're
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:55.760]  going to pull you over the side of the road and take your car because, well, war on drugs, I'm not
[3:38:55.760 --> 3:39:00.720]  going to wait and find you guilty for anything. I'm not going to even charge you with anything.
[3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:05.680]  I'm just going to charge your car with being maybe an accessory to my fantasy of it being
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:11.120]  connected in somehow to this illegal unconstitutional war on drugs. And I'll just take your property.
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:15.760]  Okay? Think about this, conservatives. If a government can take your land, they can take your
[3:39:15.760 --> 3:39:20.240]  car, they can take your plane, they can take anything because you don't have any rights.
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:24.560]  And all these people who want to support this because they hate drugs or all these people who
[3:39:24.560 --> 3:39:29.920]  want to support it on the left because they hate guns, understand the hole that you're digging
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:35.360]  yourself into. They're going to set you beside that hole and put a gun in your head and pop
[3:39:35.360 --> 3:39:39.520]  it one off and push you in the hole and cover it up. That's what this is all about, folks.
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:43.600]  You want to give them these kinds of unconstitutional powers that they don't have.
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:48.400]  Conservatives, do you understand that this is a you and agenda, this war on drugs? Do you
[3:39:48.400 --> 3:39:52.400]  understand that this has been totally ineffective except to take your rights and your property?
[3:39:53.120 --> 3:40:00.480]  All right, let's go to this Lewis Farrakhan interview because it is important that people
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:05.600]  start to come together across the spectrum. People in rural areas need to come together
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:09.840]  with people in the cities. Black and white need to come together. We need to understand
[3:40:10.720 --> 3:40:15.440]  they're not serving us except in the sense of the Twilight Zone movie where you find out that
[3:40:15.440 --> 3:40:19.920]  to serve mankind is actually a menu. Let's play that Lewis Farrakhan clip.
[3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:30.320]  That gave my mother her first child is very dark, so my brother is dark, but my father was light
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:41.360]  skinned, curly haired. So she was afraid that if that baby came to birth and was light skinned,
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:47.280]  it would destroy her relationship with that man. So she decided to abort me
[3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:56.000]  and she tried three times to abort me. And on the third time in those days,
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:41:07.440]  and she used a hanger and she was unsuccessful and I came to birth. And I said that on the mall
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:14.080]  to all those people that were there and to the millions who were watching, if my mother was
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:28.080]  successful in aborting me, what would the world have lost? Jesus was born under strange circumstances
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:38.480]  and she had to be put away privately as the Bible teaches because if she were seen pregnant,
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:45.600]  the law was, where's the husband? Where's the father? Well, you say Holy Ghost, but we know
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:55.440]  there's no human being born without the agency of a man. That's real. So they would have killed Mary,
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:04.880]  but her baby was the last prophet to the Jewish people, Jesus. I'm saying that to say this,
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:14.400]  every prayer that we pray is answered through the womb of a woman and a baby that was given a chance
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:24.080]  to live and to grow. And that's why we're against eugenics. Mr. Muhammad was death on birth control.
[3:42:24.080 --> 3:42:39.360]  He called it a death plan by the government against poor people. So we find that we are kindred spirits
[3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:50.560]  in so many ways. And you know, Mr. Jones, I felt that today. I felt that when we met
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:43:00.800]  and you could question me and strip away whatever there is, if there's something to be stripped away
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:20.080]  that America could see me as I am, white people could see me as I am.
[3:43:30.800 --> 3:43:39.200]  How dare you put yourself in that position as a moral judge? I think you should keep quiet.
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:46.960]  In the mind of Satan was to set up a one world government where he would be in time.
[3:43:46.960 --> 3:43:54.320]  They talk about me, but they won't confront me. What the hell business is it of yours?
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:44:05.360]  America should keep a mouth shut. I didn't mean to be so fired. That's good. That's good. That's my passion.
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:16.480]  As a student of my teacher, I think I should always be dignified in my expression, although
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:25.840]  sometimes in passion I lose it. And so I thought about, you know, when they said Farrakhan,
[3:44:27.040 --> 3:44:37.120]  he wants to kill all white people and he's advocating 10,000 fearless men to go out and kill
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:47.200]  white people as though I'm insane. That's insanity. And I've been teaching for 16 years, sir,
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:57.600]  and no one who follows me has ever gone out and killed a white person, harmed a Jewish person,
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:06.800]  bombed a synagogue or even put some swastika on a synagogue because that's against our religion
[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:16.080]  to deface a house of worship. I'm saying that to say this. When I said in Florida,
[3:45:18.960 --> 3:45:27.040]  you know, naming all the blacks that got shot down and according to something I just read,
[3:45:27.840 --> 3:45:35.840]  where one black man every 28 hours is shot by a policeman and young black men are
[3:45:35.840 --> 3:45:42.720]  nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers in 2015.
[3:45:43.520 --> 3:45:53.280]  According to the findings of the Guardian newspaper, 1,134 deaths at the hands of law
[3:45:53.280 --> 3:46:00.160]  enforcement officers happened last year. As a black man who loves my people,
[3:46:00.160 --> 3:46:10.880]  I'm grieved not only at police killing us, but I am grieved at our killing of each other,
[3:46:11.440 --> 3:46:20.560]  which sometimes is 10 times more than what white policemen have done. So in my passion
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:27.120]  against that, and this has been gradually increasing with me over the years,
[3:46:27.120 --> 3:46:37.600]  is I said, if the federal government does not intercede to see that justice comes to us,
[3:46:37.600 --> 3:46:45.840]  because that's the government's job. It's not my job to kill my killer. It's the government's job
[3:46:45.840 --> 3:46:53.360]  to arrest the killer, bring them before court of law and punish them for their misdeed.
[3:46:53.360 --> 3:47:03.760]  But when the government fails to do it, what are we to do? We have to defend our lives. And so I said,
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:13.840]  stop them wherever you find them. Not everybody, just the ones that kill us
[3:47:14.560 --> 3:47:22.080]  out of the law of justice. If the government won't arrest them and do that, somehow we're gonna
[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:31.360]  ultimately do that. And then it leads to what they'll say. It's a race war? No. We are not in any
[3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:42.960]  position at all to engage in a race war. It's ridiculous. It's destructive. It's suicidal.
[3:47:42.960 --> 3:47:55.280]  However, persecution in the Quran, it says, is worse than slaughter. And you know, you talk about
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:48:03.200]  1776. Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns. But El Castro took the guns.
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:09.120]  How many? Hugo Chavez took the guns. And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:13.360]  to take our firearms. Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging
[3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:19.200]  for them to have their guns taken. We will not relinquish them. Do you understand? And you are
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:33.040]  so right. But in 1776, America had enough. The colonial people under Britain had enough.
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:41.840]  So when Patrick Henry said, give us liberty, or we are willing to pay the price, which is death,
[3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:51.440]  you force people into that. When government fails to do its job to redress the grievance
[3:48:51.440 --> 3:48:56.640]  of the people who were suffering. I will put this interview out basically unedited. I mean,
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:48:59.840]  we'll put a lot of clips in and articles and things, but we're gonna put almost the whole
[3:48:59.840 --> 3:49:05.360]  interview out basically. Mainstream media, they're gonna take, just what you said,
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:08.480]  even though you quoted Patrick Henry and the rest of it, I guarantee they're gonna take that
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:14.880]  and just show the clip again out of context. They do that with me too. So I don't even,
[3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:19.280]  I'm asking you, how do we deal with that when there's nothing we can do? I guess
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:24.880]  mainstream media is losing credibility, losing ratings, even USA Today a few weeks ago admitted.
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:31.920]  Television for politics is dead. It faces this mortality. So I think I just answered my question.
[3:49:31.920 --> 3:49:56.000]  They've discredited themselves, but still, they just go online, they go on twisting.
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:50:00.240]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:04.000]  believes half of what he says. I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up.
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:09.680]  This isn't a game speech. Can anything be done to stop the hatred? I think Alex
[3:50:09.680 --> 3:50:18.320]  was the one who took the pro gun position. I don't want that man to have a gun.
[3:50:18.320 --> 3:50:22.960]  Alex Jones is a 9 11 truth or that conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:29.040]  theories. It's an internet talk show called info wars. I heard that on Alex Jones. So it's true.
[3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:33.760]  Okay. And you can see the rest of this on the Alex Jones YouTube channel. We don't have time
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:39.200]  to play the entire Lewis Farrakhan interview. It's a great job. A great documentary interviews.
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:43.360]  You just saw an excerpt there. One more excerpt. We come back. We're going to talk about child
[3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:59.360]  proof caps, airbags, smart guns. Obama says they're going to make us all safer. Do they? We'll be right back.
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:06.080]  My name is Don Wiscan. In 1994, I lost my 62 year old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[3:51:06.080 --> 3:51:11.760]  In 1977, my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment. He suffered a heart attack.
[3:51:11.760 --> 3:51:16.720]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed. 21 days later,
[3:51:16.720 --> 3:51:21.760]  my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital. He waited too long.
[3:51:21.760 --> 3:51:27.760]  In June that same year, I almost joined them at 42. What did I do? I took a seven herb formula I
[3:51:27.760 --> 3:51:32.720]  now call extendivite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginko, biloba, hawthorn, milk, thistle,
[3:51:32.720 --> 3:51:37.840]  and valerian based on German studies of natural medicine. Extendivite is designed to clear block

[3:53:01.600 --> 3:53:05.600]  of ID Stronghold. By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from
[3:53:05.600 --> 3:53:09.920]  electronic pickpocketing. Ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes
[3:53:09.920 --> 3:53:13.920]  after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in
[3:53:13.920 --> 3:53:19.120]  radio chip called RFID. I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[3:53:19.840 --> 3:53:24.400]  Soon after it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S. passports, hotel room
[3:53:24.400 --> 3:53:29.840]  keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed ID Stronghold
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:34.640]  to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of misconceptions
[3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:40.080]  out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected. Please go to
[3:53:40.080 --> 3:53:44.720]  idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your
[3:53:44.720 --> 3:53:49.200]  personal financial data. You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model
[3:53:49.200 --> 3:53:52.960]  you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets. It is as though the
[3:53:52.960 --> 3:54:07.840]  protection is free. Visit idstronghold.com today. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David
[3:54:07.840 --> 3:54:12.880]  Knight in this last segment. We're going to talk about Obama's push for smart guns and when he
[3:54:12.880 --> 3:54:18.400]  sells this he sells it as one more thing that the government can do like childproof caps or
[3:54:18.400 --> 3:54:23.600]  airbags. We're going to talk about those too as well as I'm going to plug the report that we've
[3:54:23.600 --> 3:54:28.560]  got up on infowars.com about smart guns. Before I do just quickly I want to let you know that we
[3:54:28.560 --> 3:54:34.640]  have the all-new Pro Pure shower filter that it's arrived. It's available at infowarsstore.com. It
[3:54:34.640 --> 3:54:40.800]  removes and reduces over 200 contaminants from shower water including heavy metals, pesticides,
[3:54:40.800 --> 3:54:47.120]  fluoride, chlorine, pharmaceuticals and odors. It's made out of BPA free plastic, easy to install,
[3:54:47.120 --> 3:54:52.880]  has a filtration capacity of up to nine months. It is available exclusively at infowarsstore.com
[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:58.320]  in a limited run. Also we have Super Female Vitality back in stock. There's a reason Super
[3:54:58.320 --> 3:55:03.440]  Female Vitality is sold out for over a month at infowarslife.com. Both men and women love it.
[3:55:03.440 --> 3:55:08.400]  95% of reviewers say they would recommend it to a friend. Now is a perfect time to get Super
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:13.520]  Female Vitality for your wife or girlfriend. Start the year off right before it sells out again.
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:20.320]  Again you can find both of those at infowarslife.com. Now as Obama is selling smart guns and I have an
[3:55:20.320 --> 3:55:26.640]  entire report about why people don't want smart guns and why Obama desperately wants them.
[3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:32.400]  But as he's selling them he's talking about how we've had these success stories of child proof
[3:55:32.400 --> 3:55:40.480]  medicine bottles. Let me give you some metrics about that. We saw a 45% drop in the deaths of
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:46.400]  children under five years old when we put in these medicine bottle caps. That's not a large
[3:55:46.400 --> 3:55:50.560]  number quite frankly. I was surprised that it didn't even reduce the fatalities by half.
[3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:58.080]  Understand that that saves 25 lives a year but there's still 31 children a year dying from
[3:55:58.080 --> 3:56:04.560]  getting these caps. It's a pretty major movement to get these quote unquote child proof bottles
[3:56:04.560 --> 3:56:12.000]  because again they're not child proof. This is I would think an example of straining at a net
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:17.600]  and swallowing a camel because it isn't the child proof caps that are really the problem.
[3:56:17.600 --> 3:56:23.120]  It's the drugs inside of them. If you really want to save lives you will seal these things up and
[3:56:23.120 --> 3:56:28.000]  not let people get to them because we had for example going back to the JAMA statistics of 1998
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:34.480]  over 106,000 people died from regular use of prescription drugs. This is not overdose. The
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:43.520]  overdose killed another 30,000 people. 4.6% of all deaths that year were from real from adverse
[3:56:43.520 --> 3:56:49.600]  drug reaction. People using them as prescribed. So you really want to get rid of deaths. Don't
[3:56:49.600 --> 3:56:57.200]  just use child proof locks which are only 45% effective. Only save 25 lives per year but still
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:02.080]  31 lives per year being lost to that. Then he goes on to talk about airbags as being another
[3:57:02.080 --> 3:57:08.480]  success story of government regulation. Here's an article from 2005 at the time and this is a
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:13.440]  statistic that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration loves to put out 10,000
[3:57:13.440 --> 3:57:17.520]  lives a year saved. How do they justify that? I don't know where they get their statistics
[3:57:17.520 --> 3:57:23.360]  but a statistician questioned that. This was Mary C. Meyer who is at the University of Georgia.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:28.560]  She did an article that was published. She said that the that NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:35.360]  Safety Administration, recorded 238 deaths from airbags between 1990 and 2002. And of course,
[3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:39.440]  you know, you've seen a lot of headlines about these malfunctioning airbags that have killed,
[3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:43.600]  I think, between 8 and 10 people. They've had millions of them recalled. When they go off,
[3:57:43.600 --> 3:57:48.080]  it shoots projectiles into your face. It's like being hit in the face with a shotgun.
[3:57:48.080 --> 3:57:53.360]  That's the way that thing fails. But she points out there's 238 deaths between 1990 and 2002.
[3:57:53.360 --> 3:57:57.520]  She said they all occurred at very low speed. And we know that they couldn't have been caused
[3:57:57.520 --> 3:58:02.080]  by anything other than airbags. But of course, NHTSA discounts the fact that
[3:58:02.080 --> 3:58:06.960]  people could die from the airbags at a high speed crash. She points out analysis found proper
[3:58:06.960 --> 3:58:13.920]  use of seat belts reduced death by 67%. Airbags had no statistical difference except to increase
[3:58:13.920 --> 3:58:21.440]  your chances of dying by a factor of four if you're not wearing seat belts. That's what they offer us
[3:58:21.440 --> 3:58:26.400]  with their safety mandates. And now they've got another one lined up. Smart Guns. Take a look
[3:58:26.400 --> 3:58:44.800]  at that article. Smart Guns, Diamond Dumber. Tonight, InfoWars, News 7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
