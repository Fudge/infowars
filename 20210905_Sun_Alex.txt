[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30.000 --> 00:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the battle is joined.
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  The tectonic forces of liberty are erupting, are rising.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are transmitting worldwide thanks to all your support on this live Sunday, September 5th, Transmission.
[01:06.000 --> 01:23.000]  I'm going to be here hosting both shows for the next four hours, and we have some major, major developments. Regulators now in 10 countries in just five days, including the US, the EU, and of course the UK.
[01:23.000 --> 01:41.000]  So that's, you use a lot more than just one country, so does the UK, it's three countries, Europe's 25 countries, have banned under-16s having the deadly COVID-19 shots, and the booster shots, and on and on and on saying it's dangerous.
[01:41.000 --> 01:57.000]  The wheels are coming off, and then they put out a huge panic story Friday, because Joe Rogan was the number one news story in the world saying he got better in basically a day with ivermectin, which is what I've experienced, many others have experienced, just a couple days max.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  My parents were almost dead, didn't even tell me they were sick for a week with COVID. I go over there, get them on ivermectin, get them on inhalable steroids, and other stuff that I got prescription for them with a doctor.
[02:05.000 --> 02:17.000]  I had doctors go to their house. Within a day, they were, my dad was putting furniture together that had just gotten delivered, you know, complex furniture. I wouldn't even do that, he loves doing it.
[02:17.000 --> 02:29.000]  They are suppressing this. I have a whole stack of mainline US government sponsored studies on ivermectin, being an incredible antiviral. They just don't want you having any hope.
[02:29.000 --> 02:38.000]  And so they ran this story that was, the minute I saw it Friday night, I said, that is very suspect on a little TV station in Oklahoma.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  And I said, I bet they got paid money to do that, because a lot of the local news is really just paid propaganda. A lot of national news is.
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  And I noticed there was no video of the hospitals overwhelmed. There was no evidence.
[02:50.000 --> 02:59.000]  They started making calls to hospitals, sort of making calls to the TV station, including a reporter we work with that's going to be in studio with us coming up later.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  She's coming up the studio right now. Christy Lee is going to be on with us.
[03:03.000 --> 03:18.000]  And it turns out the doctor had not worked at the hospital chain in two months, and they did not treat one person for ivermectin poisoning or overdose.
[03:18.000 --> 03:28.000]  So they ran this headline all over the national news on MSNBC, CNN. Oh my God, lines of people at the hospital, gunshot victims can't get in.
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  People having babies can't get in, because there's thousands in one area of Oklahoma, but funny, not around the rest of the country, that just can't get in.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  They show stock footage. We looked it up with stock footage. And it was all fake.
[03:41.000 --> 03:50.000]  The hospital put a letter out and said he hasn't worked here in Montreal. He has a very low rating. And no one ever came here with ivermectin poisoning.
[03:50.000 --> 04:02.000]  The thing is a thousand trillion percent, a hundred percent fraudulent, but it's been run in every damn newspaper from Business Insider to Washington Post.
[04:02.000 --> 04:14.000]  And I've been viciously attacked with it as well. They have just told me every name in the book over all of this. It has just been totally and completely out of control and insane.
[04:14.000 --> 04:22.000]  I've been in thousands of articles, printed in the top ten on Twitter and Facebook, saying Jones eats horse paste on air.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  By the way, since you say it, I didn't do that. I got it from a medical prescription.
[04:26.000 --> 04:33.000]  My name's on this prescription from a medical doctor. I did take ivermectin on air. It's very good for you.
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  It's probably anti-cancer, is what the experts say. But I got the horse paste one right here. It's the same molecule.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  I'm going to take this on air later. In fact, I'm going to take the whole thing.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  I'm not recommending you do this. Talk to your physicians, but I used to work for a large animal vet.
[04:49.000 --> 04:57.000]  Gosh, as long as I'm going to go 30-something years ago. I'm really old now, like 35 years ago, for a couple years. I used to say take it if you got the flu or whatever.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  I'm going to down the whole thing going up. Stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:17.000]  In late August, infill war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[05:17.000 --> 05:28.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have. It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[05:28.000 --> 05:35.000]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in. Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  It's high quality. It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com.
[05:39.000 --> 05:46.000]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:10.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:10.000 --> 06:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, September 5th.
[06:20.000 --> 06:30.000]  The year is 2021 and we have got one hell of a transmission lined up for you tonight.
[06:30.000 --> 06:40.000]  I've been doing my syndicated radio show for about 25 years. I've been on air 28 years now.
[06:40.000 --> 06:50.000]  I'm up in a month, it'll be 28 years and I have been doing a Sunday show for 12 years or 13 years now from 4 to 6 p.m. central.
[06:50.000 --> 07:02.000]  Going back during the election, now, wow, now already 10 months ago, 11 months ago, we started doing Sunday live, 6 to 8 p.m. with Owen Schreuer.
[07:02.000 --> 07:10.000]  Only six minutes of ads an hour for that, just for local TV and radio stations, we cut all our breaks off.
[07:10.000 --> 07:20.000]  I will be hosting that with a very special in-depth interview and more coming up in the 6 to 8 o'clock transmission that we call Sunday Live.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  This is the Alex Jones show that you're tuned into right now.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  And of course, I host my weekday broadcast 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  Harrison Smith does a great job with American Journal, 8 a.m. central.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  And of course, Owen Schreuer, 3 p.m. central to 6 p.m. central.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  Weekdays, we tend to add more shows and expand in their future thanks to your support.
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  And of course, we have freeworldnews.tv, that is the mirror of band.video, but band.video.
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  That URL is banned to share on most platforms, but freeworldnews.tv is not.
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.000]  Okay, let me just in this little segment give you a prelude to what is coming up this evening for everybody.
[08:01.000 --> 08:12.000]  We have so much good news against the globalists and against the corporate fraud and against Big Pharma's insane rollout and the wheels coming off of it.
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.000]  And the fact that the world's waking up to it and regulators in India and regulators in the EU and regulators in the U.S.
[08:19.000 --> 08:32.000]  and regulators in the U.K. and regulators in Mexico and the Mexican president, regulators in Brazil and regulators in just all Asia, all over the world, regulators in Africa.
[08:32.000 --> 08:47.000]  The head regulators, millions of people marching all over the world as well, they are all demonstrating and protesting in mass all over the world.
[08:47.000 --> 09:02.000]  And you've got these regulators, the head scientist over the vaccine program at the FDA and his deputy, go public, top urologist and say,
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  children should not take this, under 16 shouldn't now boost your shots. This is insane.
[09:08.000 --> 09:19.000]  And that's with what I told you 18, 19 months ago as I was reading the documents put out by Merck and Pfizer and all the rest of them till Merck dropped out.
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  And they said, well, it's never worked to create a cold virus vaccine. You'll have to have them probably every month to two months.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  So I told you then they'll start announcing, oh, there's a booster needed. And then as soon as you give her a booster, oh, there's a fourth shot.
[09:34.000 --> 09:43.000]  And now Pfizer's head is announced five shots a year on top of the two. That's seven.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  And of course, three of these in the studies they've now done, they didn't do them prior, they've done them now, the British government did,
[09:53.000 --> 10:04.000]  show that three Pfizer shots lowers your immune system to one-sixth of what it was and turns off your killer T cells. It's the equivalent of having HIV.
[10:04.000 --> 10:13.000]  I mean, wow. So Big Pharma is erasing Europe's, the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  The rest of the world will not take this so-called vaccine.
[10:17.000 --> 10:27.000]  So you've got the regulators running to the exits. Isn't it funny that a document created that we'll be covering later?
[10:27.000 --> 10:40.000]  The SPARS 2023-2025 report remind me I got my research in there. When was SPARS? Was it SPARS in 2018?
[10:40.000 --> 10:50.000]  The 2017 and then it was public in 2018. That's right, my memory serves. It's live time. 2023 is 2020. So it's a two-year drill.
[10:50.000 --> 11:04.000]  2023 is 2020 to 2022. And in it, it says the regulators were all resigned and it says then Afghanistan will fall and the Taliban will take over.
[11:04.000 --> 11:12.000]  I'm going to show you that today. And General Flynn used to head up the Defense Intelligence Agency and it was the director for Trump National Security Advisor.
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  He read it and he said, yeah, after we pointed it out, he said, it is a war game battle plan, which it is.
[11:19.000 --> 11:30.000]  But now it's all coming true in live time. They say a year and a half into the pandemic, Afghanistan will fall and the Taliban will take over.
[11:30.000 --> 11:41.000]  I'm going to be showing you that today as well. Also, we've got all the major investigations.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  We've got India and Israel and a bunch of other countries side by side.
[11:45.000 --> 11:51.000]  Countries with 10% or less injection with COVID vaccines have basically no deaths and no problems now.
[11:51.000 --> 11:57.000]  In Israel, the highest vaccinated has the highest deaths and highest problems and the majority of the people dying have had the shot.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  So you hear them on the news saying, oh, well, the vaccine still lets you spread it and get sick.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  Just as Oscar de la Hoya took both Pfizer shots is almost dead.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  But it still makes the infection least bad, less bad.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  That's not true because they just don't count people that die who've been vaccinated as dying of COVID. That's not come out.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  I mean, the magnitude of the line is incredible.
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  And we have investigative reporter Christy Lee in studio at 5.30 today in about an hour and 20 minutes.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  She called up a certain TV station, Oklahoma.
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  I'm going to tell you about now and when we come back and she's got a breaking report that she'll be on air with live that will premiere.
[12:40.000 --> 12:50.000]  She called them up and interviewed them. Wait till you hear this CNN ABC News NBC News MSNBC CNBC.
[12:50.000 --> 13:01.000]  The young turds, their turdlet Hassan Piker, all of them, they all reported that I'm completely insane.
[13:01.000 --> 13:11.000]  They tied me to it. And then I'm causing people, they tied me into it to have mass overdoses in a hospital chain in Oklahoma.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  No other change, no other places, no video, no proof.
[13:15.000 --> 13:23.000]  They said that thousands of people are hallucinating, their livers are failing, they're dying from taking ivermectin.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  And they had a doctor on TV via Skype but didn't show any footage, didn't show any proof.
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  So people started calling the hospital. We did. And it's a whole hospital chain. The doctor doesn't work there.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  They said, no, we've not had one person here with ivermectin.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  And quite frankly, other than, you know, having some COVID patients, we're not that busy.
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  And no, we've got, and they told them, we've got like 100 plus ambulances on standby.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  And they put out a press release. Twitter is blocking the hospital's press release, so is Google.
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.000]  Because they're in a war with you and your family. You are an enemy of big tech, of big pharma, of big banks that have taken America over.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  They are a foreign takeover group.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  Well, Rolling Stone has had to retract.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  And in classic Orwellian fashion, they called an update with the hospital's message and get ready for it.
[14:12.000 --> 14:21.000]  Not one person in the huge hospital chain of dozens of hospitals has been there with ivermectin poisoning.
[14:21.000 --> 14:28.000]  Not one person. Not one person.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  I'm going to read that for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  They did not treat any patients. He said thousands.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  He said, pregnant women couldn't have babies.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  I have ambulances couldn't get in and they showed fake photos.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  I did a Google search on the photo that Rolling Stone used and the TV station used.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  People lined up wearing masks.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  And it was from another state a year ago and was also part of a fake photo op.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  We have caught them red superhanded.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  And I've got the press release right here from the hospital.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  It's on the front page of infowars.com. I suggest you share it.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  But they don't care.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  Rolling Stone retracted.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  But they didn't go in and change all their tweets and things.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  And this story is everywhere.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  And there are literally hundreds of articles now saying, arrest me, sue me.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  That because I took ivermectin live on air Friday, prescribed me by my doctor.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  When yes, everyone's asking.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  I love the national news.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  No one knows if Jones had COVID. No one knows even took ivermectin.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  It's just a two minute clip.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  Well, dumbasses, you could have gone to my actual show Friday.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  Millions of people did it in infowars.com.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  Horts last show or hundreds of radio stations and TV stations.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  And seen the whole segment where I explained it all.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  But we'll do it later.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  But I do have the actual paste as well.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  I'm going to take the whole thing. I don't recommend you do this.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  But we'll see if I die.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  Of course, I will. I'll be totally fine. I called. I checked.
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  And sisters together. And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  And it's crazier things are, I want to keep working in the future.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and put some message in your heart to support us.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[16:58.000 --> 17:27.000]  God bless.
[17:28.000 --> 17:57.000]  Thank you.

[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  So be sure and check those out today.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  But we failed.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed.
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.000]  But they are going ahead with their full operational, deindustrialization, great reset.
[19:23.000 --> 19:29.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[19:58.000 --> 20:27.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[20:28.000 --> 20:44.000]  Welcome back to the most banned broadcast in the world.
[20:44.000 --> 20:50.000]  The tip of the spear against the globalist, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[20:50.000 --> 20:57.000]  Okay, next segment, I'm going to start getting into the huge hoax story and why it's such a window into the globalist mindset.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  And why they would engage in such premeditated organized frauds on purpose.
[21:03.000 --> 21:14.000]  Through Newsweek, they got sold years ago and is now just a PR firm and this local TV station with this doctor telling 100% fake lie on purpose.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  What's really behind that?
[21:16.000 --> 21:24.000]  We'll get into it next segment and then we have an investigative report on the ground from Oklahoma coming up with our reporter.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  We're working with Christie Lee.
[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  So look for that bottom of the next hour in about 60 minutes or about 70 minutes from now.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  But right now let's get into big picture, okay?
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  How big a deal is it to have the regulators in the United States, in the UK, in Europe and a bunch of other places saying,
[21:46.000 --> 21:59.000]  do not give under 16s the Pfizer or Moderna shots or any of these other shots that Fauci and the CDC and the National Institute of Allergies created.
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  Because they're the ones that told them what they wanted done.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  These vaccines were already developed.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  These gene therapies at Wuhan lab.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  That's what Fauci's been doing.
[22:07.000 --> 22:16.000]  This is a larger plan where the pandemic, which wasn't a pandemic, then gets you to take the quote vaccines that then erase your immune system.
[22:16.000 --> 22:24.000]  So you've got to keep taking these gene therapies on a monthly basis and now Pfizer has announced pills on a daily basis.
[22:24.000 --> 22:39.000]  Two years, two shots, a booster every five months, a twice daily pill and quarantine camps for suspected cases to slow the spread.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  That's what Tim Pool had to say about it and that's what's happening.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  I have right here the head of Pfizer.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  CEO of Pfizer has now stated he will require three booster shots per year.
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  We've got the video clip.
[22:52.000 --> 23:00.000]  I wonder how people feel now about being coerced into two and now being told they're not fully vaxxed.
[23:00.000 --> 23:07.000]  Virazar calls to begin readying the fourth vaccine in Israel.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  I played you the health minister in Australia saying, oh, you'll be getting shots every few months now.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  Played that last week.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  COVID vaccine passports to start in England this month.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  This is a total rollout.
[23:20.000 --> 23:34.000]  The UN and the Journal of Nature have come out and called for carbon lockdowns and said that this was all a drill to prepare you to be controlled by apps on your phone.
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.000]  And you'll have your own carbon calories that track everything you do and tax everything you do.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  We'll be getting to that report as well.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  I've actually got the study right here.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  There it is, personal carbon allowances.
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.000]  Now, if you're a listener here, you're going, Jones, you've been talking about there for 20 years.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  I know it's in the Rockefeller Foundation.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  It's in the operation lockstep.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  It's in Klaus Schwab's books.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  But now we're living it.
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  And that's my biggest frustration before I hit all this important news.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  In fact, I meant to take this right at the start of the show.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  I'm going to do it now.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  23 minutes in it.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  I'm going to just say this.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  I'm going to be very calm about it.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  But if we don't grasp this, we have no future.
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  This is an organized global corporate takeover of not just countries, not just businesses,
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  not just other corporations, not just a vertical integration, not just a consolidation of power.
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.000]  This is a takeover of our very bodies, a takeover of our very cells.
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.000]  And Klaus Schwab isn't just the head of the Fortune 100.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  He's the former head of the UN Biological Diversity Agenda 21 Board.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  And he's the former head of the Bilderberg Group,
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  the most powerful secret group in the world that I and Jim Tucker were the first to expose.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Until about 10 years ago, the media said it didn't exist.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  Now in his own bio, he says, I had up the Bilderberg Group.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  So the Davos Group is the externalization of what they want.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  And I was at Bilderberg 10 years ago covering a town north of London, beautiful rolling hills.
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  And they brought in a statue at the Five Star Hotel because I was there days before they came.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  They threw me out.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  You've got to dig up that footage and play it.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  They brought in a sculpture of a skeleton, a human being absorbed by a machine,
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  and eaten like the movie The Thing, with its face stretching and its teeth all night,
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  marriage being gobbled up by a machine.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  And on his own bio, on the Davos Group website, he says,
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  we're going to capture your countries and capture your freedom and you won't make decisions
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  and you'll own nothing and you'll have nothing.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  There it is, capture of democracy and structures and institutions.
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  So all the liberals and all the corporates and all the leftists that claim their anti-establishment
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  and claim, oh, you know, they're censoring the right wingers because, you know, we're evil racists.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  That's all crap.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  They work for the big megabanks.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  They work for the big takeover system.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  And they're building a dystopia and a post-human world.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  So Senator Hawley, Senator Paul, Senator Grassley who claims to be good,
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  Senator Cruz, these are all smart men, as smart as I am, probably smarter.
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  And they say very little about this being a UN global corporate takeover of the planet,
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  but that's why they're censorship by big tech.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  And that's why legacy media, dinosaur media, works with big tech.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  And that's why they're taking over local governments.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  And that's how they're taking over the federal government.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  And that's how they're taking over all the institutions.
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  And they're building a horrible post-human future at the end of it.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  I mean, they're ideologies, public.
[26:41.000 --> 26:50.000]  Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Klaus Schwab say 90% reduction in humans bare minimum by 2030.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  They say that'll cure poverty all right because they're going to kill everybody.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  You're like, how are they going to get that done?
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  Back when they said it at Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  Well, they said in 2020, as into 2021, you're now in the year 2021,
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  they launch the global breakdown of society, the post-industrial world.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  Type in the UN's goal of post-industrial world.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  You'll get their white papers, their reports.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  They'll be on their website.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  You understand if you're a radio listener, you hear me saying all this.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  The crew is in there just searching whenever I say, showing you the UN website,
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  showing you the Rockefeller website.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  And this is about the UN.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  The UN now runs our policy,
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  runs what you're allowed to say, what doctors can say,
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  what Senator Paul, who's a medical doctor,
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  comes out and talks about how learned immunity,
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.000]  your body's natural immunity is better than a vaccine immunity,
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  and they censor him saying that's not approved by the UN.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  Well, who controls the UN?
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  We are being conquered by a multinational force
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  that tells us in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  that they're looking forward to the end of humanity
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  and the forced extermination, not of 90%,
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  but the voluntary extinction movement of all of us.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  But of course, it's not really voluntary.
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  And all these remaking and reboasting of Bill Gates
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  by the Vanderbilt heir, Anderson Cooper, on 60 Minutes.
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  It's disgusting.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  And then Bill Gates is underwriting all those programs
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  and paying for that because he's tax exempt.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  All right, we come back.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  I'm going to get, last second of the hour now,
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  into the biggest hoax ever that they've been caught
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  with their pants down, saying thousands dead and dying,
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  hospital lines everywhere, ivermectin Odeys everywhere,
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  and the hospital group said it's a total hoax,
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  not one ivermectin patient, and the doctor doesn't work there.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  I mean, but it's still they're going to keep putting it
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  on the news everywhere because they don't want you
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  to protect yourself.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  They want to kill you and your family.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.000]  against the globalists.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  before they went operational.
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  But we failed.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  but they are going ahead with their full operational
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  deindustrialization great respect.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  about the show because people are ready to wake up
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  and ready to hear the truth.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  and trying to stop their agenda,
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  storable food.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  We've got the best food,
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  ready to ship at very important prices
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.000]  Even more than Trump,
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.000]  Mike Lindell has been out there exposing the fact
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.000]  that the 2020 election was stolen.
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  And his symposium was amazing.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  90 plus percent of the information was accurate
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  and was damning and was groundbreaking.
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  A few poison pills, a few pieces of this info
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  were slipped in to try to discredit the whole thing.
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  Folks, I'm surprised the conference even happened.
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  They had infiltrators and others
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  that really disrupted it and tried to shut it down
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  because Mike Lindell is over the target.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  And you're over the target when you support
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  his important investigation
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  that is every American's right to do
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  to contest an election if you think that there was issues.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  Look what the Democrats have done over the years.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  And he's continuing his investigations
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  and continuing his work.
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  So it's more important than ever to support what he's doing
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  at mypillow.com and to support info wars at the same time
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  with promo code Alex.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  Up to 66% off on hundreds of amazing Made America products
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.000]  at mypillow.com, promo code Alex.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  So check it out today.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.000]  Record numbers of three humans across the planet
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  from Australia to Germany to the United States
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  to Canada to Mexico, from Brazil to South Africa
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  to understand we're under a great reset
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  human globalist attack.
[31:15.000 --> 31:18.000]  But none of our leaders other than Bolsonaro
[31:18.000 --> 31:22.000]  had trumped a little bit, seemed to understand that.
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  And so no one is addressing the fact
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  that this is a 21st century corporate economic war
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  on the general population and the conversion of the planet
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  into a high-tech technocracy with a global IB,
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  global medical system, global medical,
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  control, ID, and of course a carbon taxes
[31:41.000 --> 31:44.000]  that tied to that, the traction of every movement.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  This is their takeover.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  They admitted it, they said it.
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, is on TV yesterday
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.000]  saying this is an environmental takeover plan
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  and the whole lockdowns are just talking
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  to prepare for climate lockdowns.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  So they're announcing their takeover.
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  We've got a resistance, they know.
[32:01.000 --> 32:03.000]  Just a week ago we got a new shipment
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  and it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supplies
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  so again, it was half the order we wanted.

[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.

[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  So get that as well for your immune system.
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  It's great for women, great for children,
[32:58.000 --> 33:03.000]  but it's designed for men in infowarstore.com.
[33:03.000 --> 33:32.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:33.000 --> 33:40.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  They have been really demonizing me all over national news.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  Saying, I took ivermectin on air
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  and I'm going to hurt people and I'm a bad person.
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  Consult your own physician. I'm my own person.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  The lepers want you to be able to kill your own baby.
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  They want to be able to suicide people
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  just because they're depressed.
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  But oh, if you listen to the thousands of medical doctors
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  and hundreds of studies that it's a powerful antiviral,
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.000]  you're a bad person.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  These people don't care about you.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  They want to enslave you.
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  They want to control you.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  They want to kill you.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  So start of the next hour,
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  we're going to have something special for you on that front.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  So I've got the prescription human ivermectin
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  and I've got the insert that comes with the stuff
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  from Tractor Supply or your feed store or your veterinarian.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  And it's the same molecule.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  Horses drink water, we drink water.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  Horses breathe air, we breathe air.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  And I'm going to take some of this, start of the next hour,
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  just to illustrate it and take the fear away.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  But I'm telling you, I would go to a doctor
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  if you want to get ivermectin.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  I'm not going to give you medical advice for you and your family.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  I'm just going to illustrate that my family and I took it
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  and it was amazing and knocked out the COVID in like a day.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  Same thing for Joe Rogan and they don't want you to know that.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  They don't want you to know about the Japanese studies
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  or the Japanese government.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  They don't want you to go to the NIH website
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  and type in ivermectin study.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  On the front, they tell you, don't take it, you're not a horse.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  But when you type in and look at all the government-sponsored studies,
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  there's literally hundreds of them.
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  And the vast majority, 99% are positive.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  Okay, let's get into the meat and potatoes here,
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  what we're facing.
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  Here is the late great George Carlin
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  decades ago laying out what's really going on
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  in the media and all the germophobia.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  Here it is.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  It's just one more way of reducing your liberty
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  and reminding you that they can f*** with you anytime they want.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  As long as you put up with it.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  As long as you put up with it.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  Which means, of course, anytime they want.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  Because that's what Americans do now.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  in exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  obsessed with security and safety and crime
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and germs.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  There's another thing, germs.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from?
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  In this country.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  Have you noticed this?
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  The media constantly running stories about all the latest infections.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  Salmonella, E. coli, hankovirus, bird flu.
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  And Americans are, they panic easily.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  So now everybody's running around scrubbing this and spraying that
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  and overcooking their food and repeatedly washing their hands,
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  It's for killing germs.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  But it needs practice.
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  It needs germs to practice on.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  So, so listen.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  So listen.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  If you kill all the germs around you
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  and live a completely sterile life,
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  And never mind ordinary germs.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  What are you going to do when some super virus comes along
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  that turns your vital organs into liquid?
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  I'll tell you what you're going to do.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  You're going to get sick.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  You're going to die and you're going to deserve it
[37:07.000 --> 37:14.000]  because you're weak and you got a weak immune system.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  By the way, that's what all the science shows.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  The new Israeli study, natural immunity to COVID 13 times better.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  The shots lower your immunity each time.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  Three shots.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  No, excuse me.
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  I've said that wrong earlier.
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.000]  Two shots lowers it to one sixth of your previous immune system.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  And now they want you to take them every few months.
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  That's coming up next hour.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  I'm going to be getting into that.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  How diabolical this is.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  How Australia and Europe are building COVID camps.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  So is the U.S.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  And how nightmarish this is.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  But just in case you didn't know,
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  here's a little short clip of myself.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  Eleven years ago, in 2010,
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  reading from the Rockefeller Foundation,
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  by the way, they run the global COVID response to the U.N.,
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  that's who's above Bill Gates,
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  the Rockefeller Foundation's own operation lockstep
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  describing the future world.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  That's how I predicted this.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  The Alex Jones show.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  There is a war on for your mind.
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite,
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints,
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  the end of the family,
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  everything that's in the other documents.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  about the GMO food sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  And the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers,
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this horror
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  and to give me the strength to carry on
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  and just want to comment on the YouTube videos
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[39:35.000 --> 39:42.000]  I know why, because it's scary.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  And that's a minute and a half version of a ten minute version
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  that just goes through how they're going to slowly,
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  say first you got to take shots, then when you take the shots,
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  they still won't let you go outside.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Now it's going to be a carbon tax that's attached to that.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  It's now officially been announced by Biden and by the U.S. government
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  and by major universities.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  That's coming up next hour as well.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  But let's go to another clip here.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  Here's Klaus Schwab a few years ago,
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  the head of the Bilderberg group, the head of the Davos group,
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  the front man of this whole U.N. takeover.
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  Here he is on CBS with Charlie Rose telling you about the GMO takeover of humanity,
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  GMO humans.
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  The difference of this forced industrial revolution is
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  it doesn't change what you are doing.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  It changes you if you take genetic editing.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  Just as an example, it's you who are changing.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  And of course it has a big impact on your identity.
[40:47.000 --> 40:53.000]  And of the certain kinds of possibilities that have to be careful about,
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  when you begin to do that kind of gene editing,
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  some people worry that you are changing what it means to be human.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  That's the problem.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  And of course the new industrial revolution offers us many opportunities,
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  but it raises many fold questions on the ethical,
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  but even legal implications.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  And we have to be prepared for it.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  And that's what we want to do in Davos next year.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  Talk about technology and how the ways it can be deployed that contribute to growth
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  rather than exacerbate unemployment.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  How will that implement itself?
[41:32.000 --> 41:39.000]  It's a big question mark because there is a fear that technology, robots,
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  just to take one.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  You get connectivity from machines.
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  Exactly.
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  And it replaces maybe the workforce or jobs faster
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  than we can replace them with new jobs.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  Not everybody can be a robot polisher.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  There will be new jobs.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  Not everyone can be a robot polisher.
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  We kill you.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  Klaus Schwab later said, great reset will lead to a fusion of your physical,
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  digital, and biological identity controlled by them.
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  And now they admit, okay, these franken shots do take over your body.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Do change your DNA.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  And it erases, of course, your immune system.
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  What an assault.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  What a war.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  A modern 21st century war.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  And we're under it.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  We're in it.
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.000]  Okay, the biggest hoax where they've been caught with their pants down,
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  and you know it was paid for.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  You know it was all controlled.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  National media just ready to pounce on this story out of Oklahoma.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  Thousands in the hospital, deaths, gunshot victims,
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  pregnant women can't get in.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  They're all poisoned with ivermectin.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  Not one person was in the hospital.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  The hospitals have all gone public.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  It's all a hoax.
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  All a lie.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  But you won't see the left retract it because this is psychological warfare
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  against us.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  Who is their enemy?
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.000]  It's a globalist takeover.
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.000]  It's a war.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  collapse worldwide.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  important to have.
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.000]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of,
