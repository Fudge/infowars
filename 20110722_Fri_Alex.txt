[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:31.960]  Texas Alex Jones we are live it is Friday thank you for joining us the
[00:31.960 --> 00:36.920]  news is coming in fast and furious the good news is we'll be back live this
[00:36.920 --> 00:42.440]  Sunday as well four to six p.m. breaking Oslo blast blows out most of the windows
[00:42.440 --> 00:47.360]  of government building looks like Oklahoma City the damage Prime Minister's
[00:47.360 --> 00:52.440]  office affected at least two dead dozens wounded massive vehicle bomb report
[00:52.440 --> 01:00.560]  people trapped eyewitnesses total chaos you notice that this is happening right
[01:00.560 --> 01:07.720]  now right as Europe is completely bankrupted by design by banker
[01:07.720 --> 01:13.000]  operatives in charge of every country in the EU this will distract them from
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.760]  going into debt bondage and the outrage over the fact that they're admitting
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.760]  it's a quote banking Marshall plan to take over the EU and all the countries
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.240]  in the receivership look when they bring us in the total receivership they're
[01:27.240 --> 01:30.720]  just getting us positioned now as I told you there's gonna be shootings at
[01:30.720 --> 01:36.600]  shopping malls bombings and it will all be triggered right during the implosion
[01:36.600 --> 01:40.680]  and they're even scripting that now saying Al Qaeda will strike us during an
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.480]  economic collapse so so they're even getting you ready for the script the
[01:45.480 --> 01:50.040]  terrorist like to tell you what's going to happen so they get credibility when
[01:50.040 --> 01:53.760]  the terror attack happens I know their criminology and their game plan so I'm
[01:53.760 --> 01:57.480]  able to predict exactly what they'll do I just told you yesterday and I've told
[01:57.480 --> 02:01.520]  you in the last year over and over again the bombings will start in Europe they
[02:01.520 --> 02:05.240]  will then spread the United States but it will only happen during the banker
[02:05.240 --> 02:08.800]  receivership takeover so everyone will be distracted from that and run
[02:08.800 --> 02:14.440]  worshiping to their loving a murdering government leaders and they'll probably
[02:14.440 --> 02:18.200]  have some mentally ill patsies that were involved in this that they blame who'll
[02:18.200 --> 02:21.600]  be completely drugged up of the rest their lives in prison you'll ever see
[02:21.600 --> 02:26.520]  him in the media you'll see a fake letter put out even if the people blew
[02:26.520 --> 02:30.800]  themselves up in the cars that they will find the passports undamaged and that
[02:30.800 --> 02:34.600]  will be considered the immaculate invincible passport made out of
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.720]  antimendium steel that Thor's hammer is made out of and no one will question it
[02:39.720 --> 02:46.280]  of course and it'll it'll turn out that the muslim extremist in this case were
[02:46.280 --> 02:52.000]  helped by the government but that'll be a side issue and no big deal so eyewitnesses
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.400]  report total chaos we're gonna be breaking that down and we can go ahead
[02:56.400 --> 02:59.880]  in the background for present punna dot TV viewers if you'd like roll the 17
[02:59.880 --> 03:06.760]  second video of that continuing return of mass layoffs a grim sign government
[03:06.760 --> 03:13.640]  considers ways to rent foreclosed homes so they guarantee both the the banks get
[03:13.640 --> 03:18.600]  the money from the foreclosure and get government rent from taxpayers great
[03:18.600 --> 03:22.480]  fascist system similar to how we give the central banks trillions of dollars of
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.280]  bailout money and then pay them interest on the money we give them same deal
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.480]  here same model just absolute financial raping at every level farm thieves
[03:30.480 --> 03:37.440]  target grapes avocados even bees thieves targeting ambulances thief steal 100
[03:37.440 --> 03:44.040]  storm drain covers in Sacramento I mean it is just like locust people are
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.040]  stealing metal and I was even out in Los Angeles and heard local TV admit it's
[03:48.040 --> 03:51.000]  mainly the illegal aliens doing this this has been their business for a long
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.280]  time selling scrap metal from legal sources but it's others involved but
[03:56.280 --> 03:59.920]  there is a crime wave going on but the government tells you there's no crime
[03:59.920 --> 04:03.840]  increase while they lay off police nationwide the cops that are left are
[04:03.840 --> 04:07.640]  openly being ordered and they've been complaining about this to do nothing but
[04:07.640 --> 04:13.600]  revenue generate like I've seen cases what in New Jersey Ohio and other areas
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.760]  where the where they lay off one case 70% of the sheriff's deputies and the
[04:17.760 --> 04:21.640]  sheriff said go buy guns we can't protect you the cops we have left are
[04:21.640 --> 04:25.360]  going to be at the jail and revenue generating just to keep what we've got
[04:25.360 --> 04:32.200]  afloat so that is the new austerity system space program cancelled at least
[04:32.200 --> 04:36.600]  the public space program oldest trained system in the Western world roads
[04:36.600 --> 04:41.760]  rotting into oblivion but taxes going up more and more of everything going to

[08:27.480 --> 08:34.080]  of them has done research deeply into the level 4 bio weapons labs that are in
[08:34.080 --> 08:39.040]  level 3 facilities illegally all over the United States like Galveston Texas I
[08:39.040 --> 08:43.520]  heard the investigative reporter a few days ago and Dr. Stan Monteef's broadcast
[08:43.520 --> 08:46.800]  as I was driving through Austin and everything that she was talking about
[08:46.800 --> 08:52.080]  is what I have researched the last decade on these under the bio shield
[08:52.080 --> 08:57.840]  program it's really a bio weapon program this is weaponized Ebola other
[08:57.840 --> 09:04.360]  weaponized hemorrhagic fevers things that kill 99% of those that come in
[09:04.360 --> 09:09.120]  contact with them you know Ebola kills around 90 these are weaponized mouse
[09:09.120 --> 09:15.440]  pox for humans they are in laboratories hundreds of laboratories hundreds of
[09:15.440 --> 09:19.200]  laboratories and it's something I don't talk enough about we're going to be
[09:19.200 --> 09:23.040]  discussing that with investigative reporter coming up for part of the
[09:23.040 --> 09:30.240]  second hour today now obviously you know about the devastating explosion that
[09:30.240 --> 09:35.520]  went off in Oslo Norway their capital blast blows out most of the windows of
[09:35.520 --> 09:40.800]  the government building housing the prime minister's office massive vehicle
[09:40.800 --> 09:45.160]  bomb a bomb inside a vehicle we've got some footage that we're rolling for
[09:45.160 --> 09:49.520]  prison planet TV viewers right now also there's a report of people trapped in
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.800]  the building it looks like Oklahoma City style devastation if you haven't seen
[09:52.800 --> 09:59.200]  the video of your listening on the radio I witnesses report total chaos now I'm
[09:59.200 --> 10:02.240]  gonna be breaking this down more coming up after I get to some of the other news
[10:02.240 --> 10:05.400]  or at least let you know what's coming up and what's on info wars.com and
[10:05.400 --> 10:12.560]  prison planet.com today but I told you continually in the last year that when
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.120]  Europe went under total bankruptcy implosion by the IMF and World Bank
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.040]  operatives that have been put in place as finance ministers presidents and
[10:21.040 --> 10:28.480]  prime ministers of every country from Germany to Greece from England to Ireland
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.320]  to Norway that there would be terror attacks launched now there are different
[10:34.320 --> 10:39.960]  types of terror attacks there are real low intensity asymmetrical attacks
[10:39.960 --> 10:45.000]  launched by people in the Middle East because they believe they're occupied
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.200]  they call it fighting back against tanks and helicopters the media calls it
[10:49.200 --> 10:54.480]  terrorism regardless of what your view is it does exist then there are
[10:54.480 --> 10:59.960]  provocateur attacks and there's different sub derivatives of that there
[10:59.960 --> 11:03.400]  are cases and this has come out over and over again even in mainstream media and
[11:03.400 --> 11:07.240]  government documents we've covered it at nauseam in films like Terror Storm where
[11:07.240 --> 11:12.340]  the Pakistani government British Israeli US Russian all major governments do
[11:12.340 --> 11:19.120]  this they go hire a criminal group to then go form and recruit real unstable
[11:19.120 --> 11:25.120]  merc type psychopath terrorist to go carry out attacks and Western governments
[11:25.120 --> 11:28.760]  and major corporations fund it but the actual terrorists don't even know what
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.080]  they're doing then there's the other provocateur attacks we've seen the FBI
[11:32.080 --> 11:36.200]  carry out and again remember the last two years countless articles in the news
[11:36.200 --> 11:41.240]  admitting FBI setup patsy's FBI setup mentally ill man you've seen the
[11:41.240 --> 11:46.280]  headlines they recruit people out of prisons normally with very low IQs they
[11:46.280 --> 11:49.280]  want them to you know blow up the Christmas tree event in Portland or
[11:49.280 --> 11:56.960]  bomb the tube in England on and on and on and they will shut up a mosque recruit
[11:56.960 --> 12:00.880]  the people and command them that under Islam they must do this and so those are
[12:00.880 --> 12:04.920]  provocateur events with patsy's the first World Trade Center came out in the
[12:04.920 --> 12:08.920]  New York Times CBS News because whistleblowers inside the government
[12:08.920 --> 12:12.120]  mod salon was one of them because he thought they were gonna set him up he
[12:12.120 --> 12:16.560]  was the confidential informant he recorded the FBI ordering him and the
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.640]  tapes were released to carry out the bombing and he said but first it was
[12:20.640 --> 12:23.200]  gonna be a fake bomb then you said no it's gonna be a real bomb then it was
[12:23.200 --> 12:26.640]  fake detonators and you said no real detonators now you're seeing let it go
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.160]  forward and they found two men on welfare with below 80 IQs they were
[12:31.160 --> 12:35.280]  mildly mentally retarded and thank God they didn't park it up against the real
[12:35.280 --> 12:38.800]  column as they were trained to do or it could have really damaged and and killed
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.440]  more people in the first World Trade Center attack so there's those attacks
[12:42.440 --> 12:46.120]  so there's different types of a cathart attacks there's a tax we got real
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.080]  terrorists don't know who they're being financed by but then you also have some
[12:51.080 --> 12:56.640]  real terrorist very rare better chance of again dying from a honeybee sting we
[12:56.640 --> 13:00.040]  posted those statistics for major university studies yesterday in our
[13:00.040 --> 13:05.680]  article that went globally viral DHS says that white people are the number
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.400]  one terror threat we're gonna be breaking that down more today but then you
[13:10.400 --> 13:15.520]  have the purely staged event purely staged events like Oklahoma City and
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.600]  ATF operation we've gone over that at nauseam covered my film road to
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.800]  tyranny with the total proof and 9-11 but then they still got to have patsy
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.280]  so McVay or a Muhammad Adam a Lee Harvey Oswald type and you need to investigate
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.120]  those for yourself and find out about them and of course over 200 US government
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.520]  sponsored terror attacks with NATO have been declassified by the British and the
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.520]  Italians the US has never declassified it but it those were joint operations with
[13:45.520 --> 13:51.760]  the British German Italian governments an operation gladio and the NATO stay
[13:51.760 --> 13:58.400]  behind networks and those were bombings carried out all over western and
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.760]  central and southern Europe the majority of them in Italy Bologna bombing you
[14:03.760 --> 14:08.080]  can look that up I just type in Italian parliament declassifies that Bologna
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.000]  bombing stage by NATO and they like to target children school buses are a
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.360]  favorite and they're gonna move these systems into the United States in
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.760]  Europe now I told you this would come when the total collapse of Europe began
[14:22.760 --> 14:28.320]  next they'll move to the United States in England and right as the banks sees
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.240]  the pension funds go after the private pension funds right as they slash
[14:32.240 --> 14:37.840]  benefits but increase taxes the terror attacks will be staged so that you are
[14:37.840 --> 14:43.480]  distracted by that and rally around the government in fear they will also use it
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.920]  to knock off enemies they like to kill multiple birds with one stone and we're
[14:48.920 --> 14:56.200]  doing research right now on the leader of Norway I was already aware of this
[14:56.200 --> 15:03.640]  individual not going along with the EU takeover so they will also then not just
[15:03.640 --> 15:06.400]  get everybody to rally around the corrupt bureaucracy by staging terror
[15:06.400 --> 15:11.920]  attacks through the different variants we don't know what type this is yet but
[15:11.920 --> 15:16.360]  with the timing it's not the very rare actual terror attack I can tell you
[15:16.360 --> 15:22.520]  right now 98% chance there is a chance it could be real I would say 2% and this
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.840]  is all I do is eat drink sleep and study this I interview every global
[15:26.840 --> 15:32.960]  terrorism experts the top professors the top heads of Pentagon and CIA black ops
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.680]  by the way we got to get Steve Pachenek on he called me a few weeks ago I meant
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.600]  to call him back Jaren I want to get Pachenek on Sunday or Monday if he can
[15:40.600 --> 15:44.200]  do it and apologize I meant to call him back he's he talked about this kind of
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.200]  stuff coming up I want to get him back on Dr. Steve Pachenek former head of
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.520]  black op he wrote the book on modern black ops and staged events and he's
[15:53.520 --> 15:57.520]  gone public with the bin Laden thing and 9-11 being staged I need to get him on
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.320]  because things are quickening and he agreed with my analysis two months ago
[16:01.320 --> 16:04.600]  that these bombings would be coming during the implosion that's definitely
[16:04.600 --> 16:12.360]  one of the main cards they're gonna play so it has begun it has begun in fact if
[16:12.360 --> 16:17.320]  we could even maybe get Pachenek to pop in a little bit with Chapman as a
[16:17.320 --> 16:24.520]  prelude or as an entree an hors d'oeuvre to Sunday that might even be good but
[16:24.520 --> 16:28.200]  we'll see what happens with that today but that just popped into my mind that
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.400]  we need to get him get him on at least two killed in Oslo bombing scores
[16:33.400 --> 16:38.840]  injured explosions damaged buildings in Norwegian capital reportedly the
[16:38.840 --> 16:46.080]  prime minister was in the building chaos people trapped and we'll continue to
[16:46.080 --> 16:54.840]  cover this as it develops and unfolds also we told you this last week because
[16:54.840 --> 17:03.280]  of our sources that you could look for a criminal investigation to be open by
[17:03.280 --> 17:09.200]  the George Soros Justice Department and I'm saying there shouldn't be an
[17:09.200 --> 17:16.360]  investigation but again you have Satan in the investigating bathroom at here I
[17:16.360 --> 17:22.120]  mean this is this is this is ridiculous James Murdoch denies misleading panel
[17:22.120 --> 17:26.080]  Reuters Bloomberg News of the World workers are offered jobs in Siberia so
[17:26.080 --> 17:31.120]  the old joke will send you to Siberia or the North Pole Dow Jones outpost Justice
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.040]  Department prepares the penis and news core inquiry to feed that of course into
[17:35.040 --> 17:44.720]  Soros it continues that old allies of Murdoch are turning against them
[17:44.720 --> 17:49.480]  London Independent so we'll be looking at that meanwhile Senator Grassley and
[17:49.480 --> 17:53.200]  also Congressman Issa have been saying for weeks and there's more news on this
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.200]  today that clearly the Justice Department and Eric Holder have been caught
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.120]  perjuring themselves on not knowing about fast and furious it's now confirmed
[18:01.120 --> 18:10.720]  from California to Texas to to Illinois to Florida the FBI the DEA the ATF
[18:10.720 --> 18:13.960]  they're not just shipping guns to Mexico by the tens of thousands they're
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.120]  shipping them to drug gangs inside the United States and then blaming the
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.120]  Second Amendment at least five cops now have been killed by this in the last two
[18:23.120 --> 18:27.560]  years and three Border Patrol agents confirmed three Border Patrol agents
[18:27.560 --> 18:35.640]  five cops the Attorney General is an accessory to murder if you or I went and
[18:35.640 --> 18:39.880]  sold guns to gangs that we knew were targeting police that are very vicious
[18:39.880 --> 18:46.320]  like MS-13 Los Zetas and others you would get life in prison in fact they
[18:46.320 --> 18:51.440]  might even finagle a jury to convict you for accessory to murder which you can
[18:51.440 --> 18:57.960]  get executed for now this is serious business here we're talking about so
[18:57.960 --> 19:01.200]  remember while we're talking about hacking scandals and things and people
[19:01.200 --> 19:04.800]  are dying or associated with it and this could bring down the prime minister and
[19:04.800 --> 19:09.000]  I think there should be an investigation what about the Attorney General what
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.760]  about George Soros's media matters bragging publicly and memos going out
[19:14.760 --> 19:17.400]  political reporting we're going to infiltrate and get hired at news core
[19:17.400 --> 19:21.480]  and we're going to destroy them from within that sabotage that's just as
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.000]  illegal as what's going on here so there is a serious war going on right now
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.520]  continuing Grassley sees DOJ cover-up in fast and furious investigation a
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.840]  senior's Senate Republican has accused the Justice Department of a cover-up
[19:36.840 --> 19:40.800]  well they got caught perjuring themselves it's now confirmed they ordered it by
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.360]  limiting information to Congress about a botched gun-running program along the
[19:44.360 --> 19:51.400]  Southwest border only thing that was botched is they got caught okay it isn't
[19:51.400 --> 19:54.280]  botched that they wanted to stop guns they wanted to blame the Second
[19:54.280 --> 19:57.400]  Amendment and they don't care they've been caught staging this they're still
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.080]  going after the Second Amendment using what they did as the excuse Optics

[25:08.240 --> 25:13.080]  tax-free your boys write the tax laws we've had to head a general electric
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.360]  lately calling for tax increases on the rich they mean the person that owns a
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.600]  restaurant and drives a Mercedes the average folks think that's rich and
[25:22.600 --> 25:26.920]  don't worry they'll be destroyed and you won't ever have any jobs and a lot of
[25:26.920 --> 25:31.680]  you'll be homeless but hey it'll be fun to buy in the big government that's a
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.600]  receivership arm for the government yeah paid no tax on five point one
[25:36.600 --> 25:41.360]  billion dollar profit Boehner says they're not even close to an agreement on
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.040]  the debt ceiling Democrats outrage want more taxes Senate rejects House plan
[25:46.040 --> 25:50.920]  it takes weekend off so even that the house is paltry what two trillion or so
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.880]  and cuts over a few years that's nothing paltry cut that has been completely
[25:56.880 --> 26:02.440]  overturned pressure SNP of the ratings agencies that work for the big banks are
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.040]  threatening to downgrade the US downgrade multiple states within the
[26:07.040 --> 26:12.240]  United States if we don't again give the bankers everything we've already given
[26:12.240 --> 26:14.960]  them more than all the real assets in the world and they're just creating more
[26:14.960 --> 26:20.000]  derivatives than demanding we underwrite those so we're going to continue
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.520]  breaking all of that down but I cannot I cannot state any more clearly to all of
[26:27.520 --> 26:38.840]  you out there just how big of a deal this is just how huge it is that there
[26:38.840 --> 26:45.680]  have been bombings in Europe because nine times out of ten or more these bombings
[26:45.680 --> 26:52.600]  in Europe and the United States are completely 100 percent staged and it's
[26:52.600 --> 26:56.160]  been proven over and over again and I told you it would come during the big
[26:56.160 --> 27:04.600]  economic takeover of Europe and speaking of economic takeover states
[27:04.600 --> 27:12.120]  negotiating immunity for banks over for closures state attorneys generals are
[27:12.120 --> 27:16.400]  negotiating to give major banks wide immunity over irregularities taking
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.880]  people's houses they didn't own lying in court about owning them in handling
[27:21.880 --> 27:25.600]  foreclosures even as evidence has emerged that banks are continuing to file
[27:25.600 --> 27:30.960]  questionable documents of course they are that's out of Reuters and the same
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.480]  things going on in Europe this isn't going to go away I mean again 12 years
[27:34.480 --> 27:37.880]  ago the government signed deals with major insurance companies to steal the
[27:37.880 --> 27:42.560]  death benefits of all veterans when you die you pay into insurance you're not
[27:42.560 --> 27:48.640]  going to get it and the media doesn't care the government in fact it's
[27:48.640 --> 27:53.520]  unpatriotic it's anti-military to even mention it you're just supposed to wrap
[27:53.520 --> 27:58.080]  tyranny in a flag worship it that's patriotism well I guess we're just not
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.720]  patriotic here then we don't like the offshore banks doing this a coalition of
[28:02.720 --> 28:05.600]  50 state attorney generals has been negotiating settlements with five of
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.040]  the biggest u.s. banks u.s. banks globalist banks that would include payment
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.800]  of up to 25 billion in penalties they've stolen trillions and commitments to
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.360]  follow new rules and exchange the banks would get immunity from civil lawsuits
[28:17.360 --> 28:22.520]  by the states slap on the wrist now Wells Fargo and Wacovia launder 300 plus
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.040]  billion in two years of drug money they got a hundred million dollar fine
[28:26.040 --> 28:29.520]  lucky rob a bank for a million bucks you pay a three thousand dollar fine is the
[28:29.520 --> 28:37.120]  equivalent and it's the article goes on to say that this is all just continuing
[28:37.120 --> 28:42.680]  this is all continuing this is all going on still they're not stopping in fact
[28:42.680 --> 28:51.240]  they're intensifying their actions on this front and it just shows you the
[28:51.240 --> 28:56.320]  absolute lawlessness this is a military financial coup d'etat this is agreed
[28:56.320 --> 29:01.520]  upon by the Republican Democratic pimps that are owned by the globalist and
[29:01.520 --> 29:07.720]  this is a program that we laid out to you what happened and they are codifying
[29:07.720 --> 29:11.800]  it they are setting the precedent to be completely and totally lawless and do
[29:11.800 --> 29:15.600]  whatever they want while throwing the book of the citizens for crooked
[29:15.600 --> 29:21.480]  toenails senator Bernie Sanders has released the Fed audit a partial audit
[29:21.480 --> 29:26.880]  confirming 16 trillion in secret payments to foreign banks and private
[29:26.880 --> 29:33.400]  individuals and companies like MSNBC in the last two years 16 trillion
[29:33.400 --> 29:38.920]  dollars see this is what the heist is about this is why government's going
[29:38.920 --> 29:43.320]  along with it they're getting paid off and senator Sanders shouldn't get on
[29:43.320 --> 29:47.440]  airplanes any time soon I'll tell you that right now and when we'll tie this
[29:47.440 --> 29:51.240]  into Europe then get into the big story we haven't even covered yet we're on the
[29:51.240 --> 30:00.720]  march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very

[32:18.840 --> 32:23.960]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[32:23.960 --> 32:28.520]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal

[34:24.280 --> 34:28.160]  Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence replace it with a Stasi
[34:28.160 --> 34:33.560]  control grid let the foreign banks run everything and you'll be safe from the
[34:33.560 --> 34:38.160]  terrorist you can see Hitler gentlemen let's completely overthrow the Weimar

[34:48.960 --> 34:57.520]  lies that is what is going on my friends a new world order as George Herbert
[34:57.520 --> 35:06.200]  Walker Bush talked about now I want to continue to go through the news here and
[35:06.200 --> 35:12.160]  get back to our top story that's really expanded the DHS is denied racial
[35:12.160 --> 35:16.600]  overtones in white middle-class terrorist video and you know I tell this
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.720]  story just give an example of the power of this radio broadcast the power of our
[35:21.720 --> 35:25.840]  websites info wars comm and present planet comm and at the end of the day
[35:25.840 --> 35:32.200]  the power of this audience you are the engine sure we do a lot of the research
[35:32.200 --> 35:36.640]  you help us we write the articles we cut through the propaganda we illustrate
[35:36.640 --> 35:43.760]  with historical context our points and it has a huge effect every week or two
[35:43.760 --> 35:49.600]  now we put out stories that end up being either the top story in the country or the
[35:49.600 --> 35:58.480]  top story in a area a top story that then becomes an entire movement and
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.080]  obviously we were able to do that some in the past drudge report carrying our
[36:03.080 --> 36:10.240]  material has turbocharged turbo charge that but I know a lot of you are radio
[36:10.240 --> 36:13.040]  listeners your talk radio listeners that's why you listen so you must be
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.920]  hearing this too I got up a little late this morning 7 a.m. kids and my wife are
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.600]  already up went in drink some coffee a little breakfast and started scanning
[36:23.600 --> 36:29.600]  through the local am dial heard the local morning show on 590 talking about
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.640]  the story and plugging in full wars comm I then this morning was driving into
[36:36.640 --> 36:40.200]  work and listen to the same station heard the next show talking about it and I
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.680]  thought let me just tune into a Dallas talk station tuned over boom talking
[36:44.680 --> 36:47.760]  about it didn't have time was making some cell phone calls to listen other
[36:47.760 --> 36:55.760]  stations that ladies and gentlemen is having an effect and info wars com with
[36:55.760 --> 37:02.280]  drudge report dot com and this audience that synergy together is absolutely
[37:02.280 --> 37:11.320]  dynamic plus the news is incredible and it is a great responsibility you know
[37:11.320 --> 37:16.720]  I've got Watson writing an article and we and even the Texas power commission
[37:16.720 --> 37:20.120]  others agreed with us in our analysis the White House responded earlier in the
[37:20.120 --> 37:23.520]  year during the rolling blackouts in Texas and other states from the cold
[37:23.520 --> 37:26.120]  weather because we don't have the power plants we need for the growing
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.800]  population and we have the study showing that that EPA carbon tax policies
[37:31.800 --> 37:35.160]  that have already been in place for 10 years the increasing policies put in by
[37:35.160 --> 37:40.240]  Obama in the last two were trick were triggering that and the White House
[37:40.240 --> 37:46.800]  responded to us the White House communications director White House dot gov
[37:46.800 --> 37:53.360]  and it's the same thing with the rolling heat and the blackouts and and in Ron
[37:53.360 --> 37:58.560]  got caught doing this in California in 99 2000 2001 because they can then charge
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.600]  you more for less energy it's part of training you under austerity to pay more
[38:03.600 --> 38:09.040]  for less okay and that's their model so I'm gonna be getting into that as well
[38:09.040 --> 38:18.520]  but that's another big report we need to get out I'm going to continue to go
[38:18.520 --> 38:22.800]  over the news because I haven't scratched the surface yet of the news and I
[38:22.800 --> 38:26.760]  want to get into some inflation news as well as an article by big gold Jeff
[38:26.760 --> 38:32.560]  Clark that we've got linked and posted at info wars.com that shows better than I
[38:32.560 --> 38:36.400]  have sometimes I'll come in with a few Zimbabwe notes or old doge marks and
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.440]  say you know here's a billion dollar mark this can only buy loaf of bread at
[38:40.440 --> 38:46.040]  the end or here's a Zimbabwe trillion dollar note they show just I don't know
[38:46.040 --> 38:49.920]  it's got to be 15 or so different currencies in the last hundred years
[38:49.920 --> 38:55.240]  that had been completely devalued down to nothing and we know that's where this
[38:55.240 --> 39:00.200]  is going I mean listen we are informed politically and do make a lot of really
[39:00.200 --> 39:04.920]  complex incredible calls on what's going to happen I mean some of this is
[39:04.920 --> 39:10.240]  really nuanced and and and has so much information integrated into decisions I
[39:10.240 --> 39:15.720]  make and calls that I make on issues that I don't even know how I completely
[39:15.720 --> 39:21.600]  come to the realization of it there's so much information integrated that it
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.360]  takes hours of just sitting there in a chair with a pad of paper going over the
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.480]  points in my mind to understand how I under how I know this stuff I mean it's
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.320]  like somebody who's been driving a race car you know a NASCAR for 20 years you
[39:35.320 --> 39:39.480]  know it's just absolutely second nature and they can't tell you how they do it
[39:39.480 --> 39:44.080]  I mean you know but but but things like knowing that they are going to hyper
[39:44.080 --> 39:49.000]  inflate the currency down to nothing that is an absolute foregone conclusion
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.200]  now the question is the time frame and when you talk about the devastation
[39:54.200 --> 40:02.120]  economically financially socially the crime the the the hellishness of what
[40:02.120 --> 40:06.800]  the private central banks have maneuvered us into you see the dollar
[40:06.800 --> 40:12.960]  lost 97% according congressional budget office of its value from 1913 with the
[40:12.960 --> 40:21.800]  Federal Reserve did you know from the 1790s right through until 1913 this
[40:21.800 --> 40:27.480]  country had negative inflation sometimes it was a little inflation or then it
[40:27.480 --> 40:32.040]  was stagnant or then they would have deflation but it was basically about a
[40:32.040 --> 40:42.320]  half a point negative so so a dollar in you know 1820 was worth about the same
[40:42.320 --> 40:51.960]  as a dollar because it was golden silverbacked in 1920 100 years later okay
[40:51.960 --> 40:58.520]  now since 1913 with the Federal Reserve taking over they've now taken over all
[40:58.520 --> 41:02.440]  of society through fraud and now they want to destroy what's left of society
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.360]  so they can consolidate it they've taken over all the major institutions bought
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.640]  it all up unlimited money that we then pay interest on to give them here's
[41:10.640 --> 41:15.040]  trillions now we also pay you interest to give you trillions we're your slaves
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.320]  it's total fraud you just gotta say I'm not a slave anymore I see your fraud it's
[41:18.320 --> 41:24.440]  over Bernanke you can tell me your fiat notes debt based monetary system is good
[41:24.440 --> 41:33.080]  and in his money and gold isn't that's like telling me that you know a bucket
[41:33.080 --> 41:38.400]  of vomit is good to drink but crystal clear mountain spring water isn't okay
[41:38.400 --> 41:41.160]  well I'm gonna drink the mountain spring water Bernanke the gold the silver
[41:41.160 --> 41:44.920]  you can have the bucket of rotten vomit okay because that's way it's worse than
[41:44.920 --> 41:50.360]  rotten vomit I mean this is poison this is cyanide he's telling us a bucket of
[41:50.360 --> 41:58.640]  cyanide is good and and I'm saying no crystal clear mountain spring water and
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.040]  then the media is like well you're a conspiracy theorist she want mountain
[42:03.040 --> 42:09.280]  spring water instead of cyanide whoa whoa this guy's crazy this guy's crazy
[42:09.280 --> 42:19.800]  from 1913 until now actually in 1913 till about 2009 I guess October 2008 but
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.840]  almost 2009 97% Ron Paul's written reports on this so as
[42:24.840 --> 42:31.200]  congressional budget offices I mentioned 97% of the dollar's value was lost but
[42:31.200 --> 42:39.360]  it was done over 90 years plus and so it wasn't as easy to notice but you know
[42:39.360 --> 42:46.760]  in 1913 you can walk in with a quarter and you could go into a diner and get a
[42:46.760 --> 42:53.600]  three course meal coffee tea a piece of pie by your buddy a cup of coffee a
[42:53.600 --> 43:03.720]  quarter by the 1960s you could get the cup of coffee for the quarter now the
[43:03.720 --> 43:11.640]  cup of coffee is two bucks if you're lucky you see you see what's happening
[43:11.640 --> 43:15.360]  and that's even with companies and businesses cutting back their profit
[43:15.360 --> 43:22.400]  and in selling you the coffee and almost what it cost them because they got
[43:22.400 --> 43:25.600]  employees they got government bureaucracy to pay for the taxes are up the
[43:25.600 --> 43:30.080]  bureaucracies up and their profits less and this is across the board so the real
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.480]  free market and productivity it shrinks while the false banker parasite
[43:35.480 --> 43:39.800]  government system just grows and grows in fact it was out in the news yesterday
[43:39.800 --> 43:43.280]  government jobs exploding in the federal government not the state level oh
[43:43.280 --> 43:47.600]  that implosion has begun and they'll implode the feds later too this is a
[43:47.600 --> 43:52.760]  gradual thing but private sector jobs massive layoffs in the last month
[43:52.760 --> 43:59.320]  intensifying in fact since I got into this now jaren will you pull up the
[43:59.320 --> 44:05.800]  article it's up on info wars on prison planet a thousand pictures is worth one
[44:05.800 --> 44:11.600]  word by Jeff Clark at big gold because I want to show people are watching on
[44:11.600 --> 44:14.880]  prison planet TV if you're a radio listener go to info wars.com go to
[44:14.880 --> 44:18.600]  prison planet.com it's it's there on the main page and I'm gonna read over this
[44:18.600 --> 44:21.760]  then I'll get into our big top story that is one of the biggest stories in the
[44:21.760 --> 44:30.600]  country right now a thousand pictures is worth one word and it goes on to say in
[44:30.600 --> 44:34.560]  spite of constant headlines about debt and deficits most Americans don't
[44:34.560 --> 44:39.200]  really believe the US dollar will collapse from knowledgeable investors
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.400]  who studied the markets to those seemingly too busy to worry about such
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.520]  things most dismissed the idea of dollar actually going to zero folks if it
[44:46.520 --> 44:49.960]  even loses another half of its value in just the next few years it'll be
[44:49.960 --> 44:55.880]  absolute devastation and most economists and historians are saying it may go to
[44:55.880 --> 45:02.040]  near zero do you understand the unmitigated nightmare I mean I am
[45:02.040 --> 45:08.000]  bracing myself I'm looking at actually I'm not gonna get into it I mean building
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.160]  a fortress because like I'm not looking at it I've got to do it I'm so busy
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.640]  fighting here I know my family's not safe I've already run to the countryside in
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.440]  preparation for this and so have all the other people who are aware of what's
[45:20.440 --> 45:24.600]  going on so have government people that's on record you know rich moving to
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.320]  the country building armored compounds why do you think and then this could
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.120]  still be partially reversed you see instead it's gonna be accelerated and
[45:33.120 --> 45:38.120]  then the very people that orchestrated it they're going to be in charge of the
[45:38.120 --> 45:42.520]  next solution and being our protectors and if we get to uppity terrorists just
[45:42.520 --> 45:49.640]  blew up a building we found a passport I mean this folks if we don't wake up
[45:49.640 --> 45:54.440]  they're going to win and they are going for broke they've committed so many
[45:54.440 --> 45:58.360]  crimes that the social engineers have and the private banking cartels that
[45:58.360 --> 46:01.800]  they've got to go all the way do you understand that they've created
[46:01.800 --> 46:05.880]  conservatively hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times more derivative
[46:05.880 --> 46:15.560]  fiat fraudulent dead instruments that exist real assets in the world they did
[46:15.560 --> 46:19.640]  this to take over they have taken over but if a guy comes to your house and
[46:19.640 --> 46:23.360]  says at gunpoint I'm gonna talk you get over there I'm tying you up and I'm
[46:23.360 --> 46:26.280]  gonna rape your wife just because he has a gun and it's taken over your
[46:26.280 --> 46:30.600]  society doesn't mean he has a right to do it and we're gonna have to gut up and
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.200]  even if he ends up shooting us you know fall down and grovel and act like we're
[46:35.200 --> 46:39.040]  scared and grab the gun away by the way I'm not just talking I've actually done
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.560]  that growing up in Dallas a knife and a gun only one case I didn't grovel one
[46:44.560 --> 46:48.280]  time I did the other time I just waited and grabbed the thing away and well I'm
[46:48.280 --> 46:53.400]  not gonna get into the rest of it but it's in police files in Dallas and Rock
[46:53.400 --> 46:58.600]  Wall the point is is that is that you don't have a choice I'm not gonna sit
[46:58.600 --> 47:03.000]  here and watch my family rape okay I mean this guy's gonna get a fight and he
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.440]  may even pump around into me but I'm gonna get that gun away while I'm juiced
[47:06.440 --> 47:10.560]  up on adrenaline I'm gonna blow your head off politically I'm coming for you I
[47:10.560 --> 47:17.520]  know the stakes and I'm not backing off you understand that now continuing here
[47:17.520 --> 47:22.240]  a thousand pitchers is worth one word and I want to scroll through this for
[47:22.240 --> 47:25.640]  viewers radio listeners go go look at this article the first thing they have
[47:25.640 --> 47:31.480]  is a Yugoslavian 10 billion dinar a few years before hyperinflation struck
[47:31.480 --> 47:36.160]  there and the private central banks took over the area this is how they destroy
[47:36.160 --> 47:39.200]  you it's how they destroy wealth they come in pair for politicians to do this
[47:39.200 --> 47:42.880]  and and and as they devalue the money the bankers buy everything up then they
[47:42.880 --> 47:47.040]  hand you that the the inflated currency and all the all the horrible things that
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.920]  come with it previously 10 billion dinar was worth the equivalent of more than
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.960]  10 million dollars in the United States at the time by the time they were done
[47:57.960 --> 48:03.680]  with the 10 billion dinar you couldn't buy a weekend vacation with it and it
[48:03.680 --> 48:09.000]  goes over that so so we're giving you examples here of what happens how this
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.280]  inflation happens for while then suddenly it explodes they've announced
[48:13.280 --> 48:18.960]  they are gonna go into QE3 and that's why suddenly golden silver going up not
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.560]  because they've gone up because the dollar is going down and again we'll
[48:22.560 --> 48:27.720]  scroll scroll down in that article and I'll show you if you're watching these
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.800]  different these different currencies there's the Yugoslavian 10 billion
[48:31.800 --> 48:36.800]  dollar dinar I guess by 93 you might have been able to go on a vacation for a
[48:36.800 --> 48:42.640]  day or two with that 10 billion dinar here's another one Zaire 5 million
[48:42.640 --> 48:50.520]  Zaire's 1992 5 million Zaire's that would that would get you a dinner few

[50:45.800 --> 50:53.560]  Germany a $1 billion mark in 1923 would not buy you a loaf of bread it took a
[50:53.560 --> 50:57.640]  wheelbarrow a billion-dollar march to buy the loaf of bread there's a bunch of
[50:57.640 --> 51:01.640]  other examples of this that's where we're going by design attention gardeners
[51:01.640 --> 51:05.880]  this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just discovered a new
[51:05.880 --> 51:09.800]  bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow
[51:09.800 --> 51:12.840]  and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost
[51:12.840 --> 51:16.240]  force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like
[51:16.240 --> 51:19.920]  conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance

[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:36.680]  Alex Jones all right we're now into hour number two I want to get Janet
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.040]  failing a great investigative journalist on who I heard on Dr. Stan Monteith
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:45.200]  but she's on a cell phone it's it's it's cutting out every other word so we're
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.560]  gonna try to get a better connection and see if we can get her on but she's called
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.680]  these different bio weapons facilities all over the country we've confirmed
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:57.240]  separately that they have level four weapons development in level three and
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.360]  even level two and there's total thousands of these but hundreds of
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:08.240]  level four in level three facilities and I want to get her on but it's just an
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.320]  issue so we'll see what happens with that yeah here's one of the notes I've
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.760]  been mailed here's a hundred thousand dollar Republic of Argentina note and
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.920]  just 15 years ago there their currency was worth more than the dollar but after
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:30.280]  the private banksters came in and took over their country within just a four
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.560]  year period they devalue their currency down to almost absolute zero I mean it's
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.840]  not like Zimbabwe where you know there's a hundred trillion dollar notes try to
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.720]  get a hotel room for the night you know this is a hundred thousand dollars to be
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:49.120]  able to rent a room for a week but the hundred thousand was worth more than a
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.400]  hundred thousand dollars and you could buy a couple fancy cars for it at the
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:59.000]  time and rent a house for six months not anymore and this is where this is
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.800]  where we are going as a society and I covered some of that in the last hour
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.960]  I haven't gotten into all the big economic news yet I will get to that Bob
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:16.400]  Chapman of course with his with his weekly weekly visit joining us is gonna
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.400]  be coming up really getting into that in more detail also I want to get into
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.160]  Grassley says there's a DOJ cover-up and fast and furious investigation well
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.000]  they've been caught now the FBI and DEA have been admitted that they've been
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.120]  basically ordered to be part of this shipping guns to Mexico but also to
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.760]  cartels inside the US I mean this this makes Watergate look like Nixon was
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:46.080]  some type of choir boy I mean this is so hardcore shipping guns to gangs the
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.240]  government controls to knock out their competition of the drug trade that's
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.960]  really what's going on and as a side side dessert blaming the Second Amendment
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.000]  and they don't care they've been caught they're going ahead with it and saying
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.880]  outside of law gun shops now do whatever the ATF tells them to do you'll do
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.760]  whatever we say we'll tell you how many guns you can sell we'll tell you who you
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.360]  can sell them to we're putting we're gonna start putting people on a no buy
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.400]  list doesn't matter if there's no convictions when you called to the
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.440]  next check you're just not gonna get a gun as White House Chief of Staff now
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:22.360]  Chicago mob boss Rahm Emanuel called for two years ago so it is just absolutely
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:29.840]  stunning absolutely stunning the information that we've got on that
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:35.440]  front we're also gonna get into the heat wave and the fact that one reason
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.320]  power prices are going up all over the country in fact will you guys pull me
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.880]  that London Telegraph article where prices set to double in the next three
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.480]  years in England because of carbon prices on on power so not only the same
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.200]  thing here you're paying more for power and they won't let you build new power
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.440]  plants so when it goes to peak times in the winter or peak times in the summer
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.880]  then your power gets cut off and they have controlled blackouts and people
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.920]  dying mass I have a large stack of reports on that New York suffers rolling
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.840]  blackouts heat dome covers 1 million square miles it is true the jet stream
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.600]  is basically completely stalled over the United States and that's happened
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:18.120]  before DTE begins rotating blackouts in Detroit many summer school students
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.920]  going without AC and see people say well in the 50s we had to do that yeah but
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.160]  if you ever went were in school in Dallas in kindergarten I was in Margaret
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:38.200]  Sanger eugenics and named school there in Dallas and bad air conditioning but

[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.800]  that open completely up they put fans in there and they'd open the doors up and
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.840]  it would circulate through the building the buildings were long so they open
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.120]  windows on this side and that side center which way the wind was blowing you
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.200]  got that breeze you see but but but but no now they're in government buildings

[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.840]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.800]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.200]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.640]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.400]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.800]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:18.640]  answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:28.800]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones in England they admit it and later in the hour I'm
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.720]  gonna get into it that green initiative rules for carbon taxes in the next three
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:41.360]  years will double power prices in the UK we built three new coal power plants a
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.600]  year here in the United States China builds three a week they have cheap
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:50.720]  power they can industrialize we are rotting this is part of the post
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:55.360]  industrial world that the UN Maury strong Ted Turner all of them have talked
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.720]  about the White House science are John B. Holdren and in the process General
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:06.320]  Electric is tax-free because they write the rules just like Google and Goldman
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:14.040]  Sachs and the rest of them and they run the EPA and get waivers where they can
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:20.480]  build or service plants coal plants but all their competition can and so you're
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.840]  gonna have your prices continue to go up and you're gonna have more black houses
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.600]  like a third-world country Chilchescu and Romania could have provided power to
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.200]  the people he did it as a tool of control the Russians didn't have to have
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.920]  folks lined up begging for sausages it was about being totally dependent on
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.000]  the state Chavez has plenty of power it's come out he cuts power to train you
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.760]  that he controls your life this is what it's like to live in authoritarian
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:51.080]  society okay control freaks enjoy you not being wealthy and not being strong
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.960]  now I'm also going to get into DHS denies racial overtones and white
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.640]  middle-class terrorist video they responded to Breitbart Fox News the
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.720]  Daily Mail to our story that broke yesterday it was the number six largest
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.280]  story according to Alexa on the web yesterday it's even bigger today every
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.920]  talk radio show I've tuned into was talking about it and giving info wars
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.240]  calm credit that's great because more folks will come and find the truth of
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:23.600]  what's going on in full wars calm we're gonna be going over that report more
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:29.720]  here's Fox News DHS video characterizes terrorist as white Americans here's the
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:34.200]  mail who does homeland security think poses the greatest risk video portrays
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.840]  white middle class as the most likely terrorist here's Breitbart says they
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.680]  contacted Homeland Security that confirmed it was their video kind of
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.160]  like when we got the Mayak report saying returning veterans of the number one
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.240]  terrorist people couldn't believe it for a week even Ron Paul couldn't believe it
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.400]  in the homeland security said no Alex does have a real classified document of
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.560]  course I did you think we make anything up here now just about 40 after I'd
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.680]  let it I could have it for 10 hours but I got to get to all the other news I
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.360]  haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg here but I know truth when I hear it and
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.000]  here's the problem I do all this research late night every night everything I
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.520]  heard her say was absolutely true and more I'm driving on the highway listening
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.120]  to her a couple days ago on Dr. Stan Montief's Genesis show comes on like four
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:25.480]  or five and I'm driving around in an errand listen about 20 minutes Janet
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.080]  Phelan who's an investigative journalist and boy she's been through a lot for
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.680]  covering this but everything she said is admitted but the point is nobody's
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.200]  really put it together I remember that they set up bio shield after the stage
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.640]  anthrax attacks that were admittedly a US government super strain launched by
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.880]  them not made in a bathtub as they'd said and it's now come out they frame the
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.280]  fourth guy they killed in custody that just came out on Monday but to make a
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:58.080]  long story short there are several thousand quote level two bio labs there
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.400]  are tens of thousands of what they call level one security parameters there are
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:13.920]  reportedly hundreds of level fours but the point is you get different numbers
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.760]  from different agencies now a level four has weaponized Ebola airborne
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.560]  hemorrhagic fevers things that kill 99% of anyone that comes in contact if it
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.480]  gets out you're talking about billions of dead and I could pull up the mainstream
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.720]  news articles billions billions billions with a bee they're telling you
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.600]  about al-qaeda is gonna kill you all day got a better chance of being killed by a
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.200]  honey bee sting we posted that in our article yesterday that went viral with
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.200]  major universities breaking it down peanut allergies deer jumping in front
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.520]  of your car many more times more likely lightning strikes than being killed by
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.120]  al-qaeda let's say al-qaeda is real it isn't but the point is they're telling
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.480]  you that everybody's got to freak out and get ready for mass plagues to be
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.640]  released or al-qaeda to hit us meanwhile when the hurricane a few years ago
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.560]  destroyed Galveston destroyed more than half the city I mean buildings gone they
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.640]  have a level four bio weapons lab they call it a bio shield research defense
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.520]  facility but it's been admitted the Baltimore Center other publications a
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.560]  bio weapons lab but I'm gonna go to her and let her break down her phone calls
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.280]  and her research in her articles where she's tried to track all this down she
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.600]  gets different stories but here's the big issue at hundreds and hundreds of
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.200]  level threes that just have the regular anthrax and things and the non weaponized
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:39.880]  Ebola and things like that at the level threes they have level force and I've
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.800]  seen reports in Galveston that that the University of Texas research facility
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:50.160]  that's on the water and was really almost destroyed by the hurricane but two
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.120]  three years ago they get hit all the time that that facility is really a level
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:01.880]  two and a half folks a level three is underground with with with air seals and
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:05.920]  containment a level four is three levels down with three
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.480]  barbed wire fences around it with landmines and you have to have security
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.960]  personnel with mounted heavy weapons heavy machine guns if you enter the
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.360]  facility one level you are killed immediately electrified fences okay the
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.200]  point is the government's run by eugenicists that talk about how they
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.480]  want to kill and get rid of most of us they're making it sexy on dramas and
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.480]  TV shows everywhere about the world after humans and how great it's gonna be
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.760]  they're telling you that naturally this stuff's gonna be released that there's a
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.360]  history of governments releasing bio weapons testing stuff on kids to ski
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.680]  the list goes on and on so the point is there are level four mouse pox it'll kill
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.880]  99% of humans they come in contact with that's even mainstream is in level three
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.400]  facilities that aren't even level three and she's gone over the numbers and when
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.320]  I heard her it was like I remember that I remember that because this is something
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.960]  we don't talk more about so I give you Janet Phelan and I'll also tell you
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.080]  about her website is janetphelan.com investigative journalist whose articles
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.200]  have appeared in the Los Angeles Times the San Bernardino County Sentinel the
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.840]  Santa Monica Daily Press the Long Beach Press Telegram alley magazine the
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:21.440]  America's Bulletin Sovereign Mind she's done to countless radio shows TV I can't
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.920]  go over old bio because of time but I wanted to preface this that they're
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.240]  telling you give up all your rights Alcada may kill you meanwhile there are
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.440]  they're building up all over the country in the middle of major cities and rural
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.800]  areas among coastlines level four bio weapons labs that have been built in
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.000]  the last eight years all over the place in level threes and twos Janet you've
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.480]  got the floor for the next 30 minutes or so break down your research and what
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:54.360]  you've discovered in this area yes thank you Alex I first got interested in
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:59.720]  researching issues surrounding bio weapons because of some very strange
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:07.840]  verbiage in the US Patriot Act as we know the US Patriot Act was rushed into
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.960]  law most of Congress didn't read it following the attacks of September 11
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:21.720]  so embedded in the US Patriot Act is a very strange section which is section 8
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:29.800]  1 7 8 17 the expansion of the biological weapons statute now in this
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:37.000]  statute they the they have basically violated and nullified the international
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.800]  bioweapons treaty that the US signed in 72 and although a lot of the verbiage in
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.880]  a 17 mirrors this biological weapons convention which is the international
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:54.240]  treaty there's a caveat which basically is kind of a giving the finger to the
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.320]  international community and in the caveat they're saying and I'm going to read it
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.520]  right here whoever whoever knowingly violates this section shall be signed as
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.440]  provided in this title and prison not more than 10 years or both but the
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:13.720]  prohibition contained in this section shall not apply with respect to any
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:19.800]  duly authorized United States governmental activity so after you know
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.920]  passing into law through a 17 how you can go to jail and you can't be stockpiling
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.480]  transporting these weapons they said well if we do it you can't do anything
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:35.760]  about it now well they claim if it's for research and defense it's okay and even
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.200]  the Baltimore Sun as you know eight years ago admitted it is a weapons
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.640]  program the headline was thousands of gallons of liquid death if I remember and
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:50.680]  also US code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1520 a paragraph B that goes
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.320]  back to the mid 90s says we can't test chemical biological radiological on you
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.760]  secretly without consent unless it's for research go ahead well the research is a
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:07.360]  very is a very problematic term because what kind of research are is it
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:14.880]  defensive research or is it weapons research and how would we know now when
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:20.800]  when I spoke with the CDC a couple of weeks ago about these bio they're called
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:27.840]  bio safety lab level three isn't it for I wasn't very disturbed at what amounted
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:36.160]  to disinformation that being given by the CDC I spoke with Laurie Bain who's up
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.000]  there on the food chain and also the press officer named Von Roback and they
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.760]  tried to convince me that there were that there were six bio safety lab level
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:52.760]  fours within the United States well if one starts researching not this
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:59.240]  simply on the internet you're gonna find a whole lot more so I confronted Ms.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.200]  Bain and Mr. Roback I said well what about down with them you know what about
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:07.680]  ma'am I have the LA Times from eight years ago saying that the Bush was
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:14.760]  funded 36 of them well you know we're finding them everywhere now I found a
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:20.880]  couple on a military basis DSL fours on military bases and I found them by by
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:28.080]  by looking at the curriculum VJs of a couple of architects who say oh yeah
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.200]  I build the BSL fours Doug way I build the BSL four at Aberdeen Proving Ground
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.520]  well according to the CDC you asked them these questions they go I just don't
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.440]  feel comfortable asking that so they're insisting there's six you confront them
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.240]  with evidence there's more and they fall silent they don't Janet stay there
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.000]  we're going to break and to come back and I want you to walk through where
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.760]  these are and and your research that I've confirmed separately you're right
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.920]  they've got level fours in level threes and two and a half's we'll be right back
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:03.840]  on the other side stay with us question can functional magnetic resonance
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:09.800]  imaging be used to read our minds author Jose Calazzo answers yes in his two new
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:16.080]  books America's new slavery for more than 13 years author Jose Calazzo has been
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:20.560]  trying to prove that the US government has the capacity to read a person's
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:26.120]  thoughts with a revolutionary technology known as fMRI functional magnetic
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:31.080]  resonance imaging and there is proof that it exists America's new slavery
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.680]  explores this technology and its many possible applications in national
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.880]  security who has access to it how is it being used does America's salvation
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:46.360]  rest in this technology these and many other questions are answered in America's
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:53.200]  new slavery the new books by Jose Calazzo available on bn.com amazon.com
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:21:00.560]  and borders.com America's new slavery all Americans should be concerned they
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.680]  helped to create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new world
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.760]  order based upon collective action invisible empire is a damning indictment
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:14.240]  of the globalist through their own words and documents the new world order
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.720]  really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:23.280]  world under their control the United Nations would take over America the
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:28.040]  trilateral Commission would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:32.400]  men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.360]  oppressive world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing

[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:23.600]  car if the car senses you've done something dangerous and Google's just
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.800]  gotten approval for Google cars in Arizona to be on the roads Danny Joinko
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:32.160]  the demolition expert who concluded on national television and many programs
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.360]  that the building 7 was a controlled demolition his car magically ran off the
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:41.000]  road while coming home from church and ran into a pylon and you wait when they
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.720]  make everybody have remote control cars they can already rig them that's gonna
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:48.400]  be their favorite way of killing folks sad issue just thought I'd report that
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.840]  me might have just had a heart attack and driven off the road he wasn't that
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.960]  old though going back to Janet Phelan investigative journals written for the
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.520]  LA Times you name it this is a short segment long segment coming up with
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.800]  our guests so so I'm gonna try to sit back and shut up I just want folks to
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.880]  know what you found is true because I've done the research as well just you've
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:10.520]  been calling them and getting the run around about these level four and level
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:15.160]  threes all over the country in the middle of cities small towns and they're
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.640]  not even telling anybody what's right next to them how long until this stuff
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:27.160]  gets out please continue right well the issue really is here though there's
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:32.000]  several issues one of it the primary issues is are they doing defensive or
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.800]  offensive research now we see where this 817 of the US pay to adapt the
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.600]  expansion of the biological weapons that did essentially gave the US
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:48.400]  government a blank check they are not accountable if you look at the
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.040]  international biological weapons convention you're going to find another
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:59.360]  blank check this international biological weapons convention has no key
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:07.160]  there is no investigatory body and there is no way to basically no
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:13.640]  international bodies to assign penalties so basically the DWC folks show up
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:17.840]  in Geneva every five years they pat each other on the back great job we're
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:22.080]  containing all these biological weapons they have no way of researching if
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:29.640]  biological warfare is actually being done which is essentially what they're
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.400]  trying to inhibit through the DWC they're trying to inhibit the development and
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:39.280]  stockpiling of these weapons but they have no means whatsoever to check this
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:45.360]  out let's talk about what what level fours will do to you if they get out I
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.920]  mean these things are more dangerous than nuclear weapons and they're just
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.240]  proliferating everywhere they are proliferating and we don't know how
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.960]  many there are the CDC is actively inhibiting this information from getting
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.760]  out they actually I'll say it they lied you know they basically lied to me about
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:08.240]  these DSL fours and and I confronted them with what I found they said well for
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.440]  national security reasons we don't feel comfortable commenting whether there's a
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.680]  DSL four in Galveston we don't feel confident we don't feel you know
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:22.000]  comfortable contact commenting on whether there's a DSL four in Montana we
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.400]  just don't want to talk about it so they're inhibiting this information now
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:32.360]  the question as to whether there is offensive research being done there is
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:37.280]  a project that was established a number of years ago called the Sunshine
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:44.000]  Project that was basically attempting to provide some sort of oversight and
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:51.120]  review and investigation it's out of Austin Texas yeah yeah right so there
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.320]  was a report that came out a bit ago by Edward Hammond who was the director of
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.760]  the Sunshine Project and what he found is that the oversight mechanisms which
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.080]  means there has to be like committees there at these bio weapons labs to
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.600]  oversee what's going on the committees don't meet the committees don't review
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:16.520]  the committees are there in name only and there isn't any review going on and
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:22.000]  furthermore Edward Hammond found out that there was unauthorized research
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.320]  which select agents that had not been approved going on at these labs so we
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:35.800]  don't have anybody watching what's going on now this takes us to the issue of the
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.120]  possibility that the government is developing bio weapons and stock piling
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:45.960]  them now several years ago I was fortunate enough to be traveling across
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:53.000]  country with a truck driver who I had a delivery to make at Sierra Army Depot
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.120]  which is up in California it's about 70 miles above Reno I was not I was
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:05.120]  admitted into the base although not through any particular base but the
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:11.840]  trucker who had a security clearance told me very clearly that they used to
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.200]  have mucs there at Sierra Army Depot but now they just have these big vats of
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.840]  liquid now that would most likely be biological or chemical weapons so I
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:30.400]  started doing some more research on government military bases and whether
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:35.000]  or not there well Janet stay there I mean they admit level four bio weapons
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.200]  labs have the super weaponized stuff and all they do is label a offensive
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.160]  program as a research program again you got to put the Baltimore Sun article
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.440]  thousands of gallons of liquid death from like eight years ago we're gonna

[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.280]  speaking of chemical biological radiological weapons in the United
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:36.320]  States 70% of the population roughly has been forcibly medicated since the
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.800]  1950s they admit that sodium fluoride gives you a seven-fold increase in
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:45.200]  brain cancer and causes hundreds of other degenerative diseases part of the
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.920]  little gift that the psychopaths running things give us they also add hundreds
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.600]  of other deadly chemicals including radioactive isotopes since we've been
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:57.800]  covering that now all over the country local news is saying we did test the
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:03.200]  water there's 10 times 30 times 50 times hundreds of times safe levels of
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.440]  uranium but funny it's not in the well water we don't know where it's coming
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:13.040]  from it's mixed in with a sodium fluoride on record we've had Dr. Conant
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.080]  on and others with the footnotes in his book how they do it where they mine it
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.400]  the same place they get the fluoride in the phosphate is where they get the
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:25.400]  uranium and it's all part of just doing something so incredible you wouldn't be
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.120]  able to believe it even if they admitted it speaking of that ladies and
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:35.680]  gentlemen I filtered all of my water and when I'm on the road I filter my water
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.680]  and I don't like using the cheap plastic bottles with this phenol A and I found
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:44.800]  this ecovessel type that I think is the best out there made in America stainless
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.600]  steel got info wars.com embossed on it and your purchase supports the
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.720]  broadcast amazing made in America insulated filter what does it do like a
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:58.400]  hundred gallons or something hundred percent recyclable BPA free and made
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.520]  from the highest quality 18 slash 8 stainless steel was designed for your
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.080]  safety ease of use of convenience and is filled up with the chemical weapon
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.920]  water and it doesn't get it all out some things it gets it all out you can put
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:17.160]  swamp water in here and drink it but it reduces the chemical weapon load you
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:21.200]  wonder why folks got gray skin or green skin you know people really look
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.680]  unhealthy and why folks are zombies and cancers doubled the last 10 years and
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.320]  things the biggest it's not just the GMO food and the vaccines it's the water
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.360]  it's in the water don't drink the water and this is a great portable unit

[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.680]  materials your support of the sponsors does make this broadcast and what we're
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.240]  doing here possible September 1st we will be launching the new nightly TV
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.080]  show we're looking at 7 p.m. streamed at prison planet TV it's gonna be focused
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.880]  power pack for 30 minutes we're gonna start having probably weekly special
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.960]  hour-long reports as well at prison planet TV and many other things are
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.280]  nearing completion here thanks to your support we are intensifying the effort
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.640]  against the globalist. Going back to Janet Phalen. Janet I know you're a
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.600]  journalist right for the LA Times you have telegram you name it you see you're
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.720]  very conservative you know about what you cover but I'm just telling you that's
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.680]  what I heard you on radio I knew it was all true what you were saying and I
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:23.120]  really wanted to get you on that because you've been calling them getting names
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:26.840]  getting different stories different runarounds from them my point is it's
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:32.160]  actually under Bush and bio shield announced in 2002 it said 36 level 4
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:37.120]  bio weapons labs it mentioned Galveston it mentioned San Antonio they're moving
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.160]  Plum Island what into Missouri right so I mean I mean you know it's all
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.560]  semantical yeah I mean it's like Obama calls Libya says it's not a war but it
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:53.040]  is a war so they say bio weapons research for defense but they're brewing
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.760]  it up and developing the worst of imaginable so let's talk about from
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:01.320]  your research what's in a level 4 where we know they are because I heard you on
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:06.200]  Monteef's going right through you know the different numbers of the thousands
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.520]  of total labs how many are level 3 how many are level 4 where some of these
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:16.160]  are where they're building new ones right well the CDC maintains that there
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:24.000]  are around 250 level 3's however according to documents that were filed in
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.840]  terms of a lawsuit that was fronted by tri-ballet cares which is an anti-nuclear
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:35.320]  group out in California the DOJ and the Department of Energy have admitted to
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:42.080]  over 1,300 of these level 3's so who's telling the truth here this is the
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:47.160]  important issue I think if you translate what's going on in the lab
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:55.480]  stockpiles on military bases we are only doing defensive research why do we
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:01.160]  have Aberdeen Proving Ground we have a biological chemical command there we
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.960]  have one at Bluecraft we have another one at Jefferson Proving Ground we have
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.160]  another one here at Rock Island site Rocky Mountain Arsenal it goes on and
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:17.120]  on so the question becomes how can they maintain that there's defensive
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.200]  research going on when we have military bases that are stockpiling these things
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:28.240]  it's obviously if they're on military bases we're assuming that we've got a
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:33.480]  weapons stash well of course it's a weapons program the US has the biggest
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.040]  biological chemical weapons program on earth dwarfing the Russians that's
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.440]  always been on record they just claim as you point out since that treaty that now
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.800]  it's all defensive research but they call the Defense Department the Defense
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:51.240]  Department we all know I mean obviously it's the Imperial Banker Army but but
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:55.960]  looking at this we saw Fukushima and Tepco in the Japanese government we now
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:00.160]  know five of the six reactors blew up three completely melted down each one
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:05.120]  bigger than Chernobyl massive radiation raining down EPA just raises the level
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.800]  of isotopes in some cases 100,000 times they now say is safe what they
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:14.360]  previously did and that's all on record and so we see a Fukushima you know who
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:20.960]  builds a six reactor complex on a huge fault line where where tsunamis come in
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:26.520]  and then stores the spent fuel rods 644,000 on top the reactors which were
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.240]  then ejected up to a mile and a half away well forget Fukushima we've got
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:36.960]  level four in level three facilities all over the country and where hurricanes
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.640]  come in like Galveston I mean what is going on with the ruling class what what
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:46.080]  is the issue with these people because it's only a matter of time until not just
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:49.320]  our government but the Israelis the South Africans the Chinese the Russians
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:53.040]  they're all doing it what was it six years ago they put out online a
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:58.080]  university in Australia how to design a human mousepox that kills 99% of humans
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.720]  and they put the easy recombinant calculation online I'm sure you saw
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.800]  that I mean I think they're just getting ready to to claim that there's an
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.520]  accident for their population reduction well I think that there may be
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.360]  something else at play here Alex I want to mention very briefly that I have
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:22.720]  applied to the United Nations for press credentials to attend the BWC the
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.800]  biological weapons convention which takes place only every five years so
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:32.160]  this December in Geneva Switzerland the guys are meeting again just slap each
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.200]  other on the back saying aren't we doing such a good job in freeing the world
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.760]  from biological weapons and I want to make sure that they are advised as to
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:48.000]  the multiple violations going on by the United States now what concerns me I'm
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.120]  sure they don't know I'm sorry I'm sure they well you know I applied for these
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.840]  press credentials two months ago they haven't responded yet so I'm going to
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.760]  have to become a little more insistent here so what really concerns me what
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:06.560]  basically do you think you know if we have an quote-unquote accidental release
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:13.440]  and something like Marburg or Ebola for which there is no known cure then we
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:21.600]  have you know a an international crisis another scenario is that there is going
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.320]  to be an intended and selective release now I'd like to bring up very briefly
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:34.000]  ABC News just carried the story that Janet Napolitano over at the
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.200]  Department of Homeland Security is concerned that these dangerous
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:45.800]  terrorists have infiltrated the water department and she is fighting the
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:49.880]  possibility of an attack through the water system that's right the right
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:54.160]  al-Qaeda she says anyone writing he actually said writing on paper taking
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:59.400]  photographs talking on a cell phone or typing on a blackberry or iPhone who is
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:05.680]  white and this is now national news is it shows women in shopping malls running
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.720]  in terror if you're writing on a piece of paper you just run screaming but I'm
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.600]  so but let's not worry about the 36 level 4 bio weapons labs well I just
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.400]  wanted I just want to bring it bring to life here because Janet Napolitano is
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:25.880]  basically releasing now concerns that I have been stating for years are
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:32.560]  absolutely valid I wrote the article water at the weapon back in 2007 and
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:36.240]  I've written some other issues concerned concerning this and and without
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.480]  going into a whole lot of detail because people can find this article online
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:46.120]  what our government the dangerous terrorist that Janet Napolitano is
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:51.240]  fighting within our government has done is to put mixing capabilities on the
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:55.560]  main lines in water systems throughout the United States and what these people
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.520]  look at the blueprints online you can go to home down that's another article I've
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.960]  seen this myself they put little jackports in where they can selectively
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.800]  hit certain neighborhoods I talked to a pretty high-level Republican he agreed
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.600]  to come on he's actually been on over a decade ago but then he got freaked out
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.000]  and got threatened he worked in Singapore and talked about how they
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.240]  selectively drug and and and chemical-wise certain neighborhoods in
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.000]  test and then he wouldn't come on the show and talk about it yes they do but
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.980]  the way they have this set up Alex has taken selectively hit particular houses
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:36.040]  through this double-line water system now you know I asked anyone who's
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.680]  listening to the show to look at the article water the weapon look at home
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.880]  work down and explain to me what is the necessity to have mixing capabilities
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:48.600]  on the main line because this way we're not talking about an
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:53.080]  accident put a foot accidental release that might kill you know I'm told
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:58.320]  millions of people we are talking about an intentional and selective program now
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:04.920]  I went ahead and called after I saw this little segment on ABC news I went ahead
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:08.680]  and called the Department of Homeland Security last night and I said you know
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.560]  miss the politics on it was absolutely right you were able to get you were able
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:18.560]  to get on the phone we've tried wow well I I didn't get through to somebody
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.840]  in in in a position of power it was it was a little bit late in the day but I'm
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.280]  going to call back after this show because she's absolutely right there
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.040]  are dangerous terrorists anti-americans inside the water department they are
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:37.520]  engineers they are contractors and they are the people who have fed up this
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.040]  double-line water system and I would be glad to give her some names because I
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.440]  have been reading this for a number of years I have had contact with the with
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:53.000]  water a lot city water engineers with I've had contact with the city of
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.280]  Ernie and I've been named on names of people who are independent ma'am your
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.040]  phone is your phone is muffled there for just a moment you know the issue here is
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.760]  it came out with the Shah of Iran and others one of their favorite things to
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.600]  do is throw a couple of plutonium pellets in your seat your car they'll
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:17.000]  sew them in it'll fry you in just a few months then they go in and remove them
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.240]  later or they just ignore it no one ever finds them this is called a soft kill
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:25.960]  weapon and they're already putting things in our water are you familiar with
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:31.840]  the fact that they mine all the major sodium fluoride deposits out of
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.720]  phosphate mines where they mine the uranium and that every major water
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.000]  supply that has fluoride has uranium added absolutely I think the slide
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:47.240]  issue you know needs to be seen for exactly what it is fluoride bells the
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:52.040]  hip of campus it makes people sort of dazed and confused and I look at this
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:57.160]  as sort of a one-two punch then you daze them the sodium fluoride and then you
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:05.800]  come in for the kill now in in Germany in the 30s and 40s where the concentration
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:11.800]  camps the resident of the concentration camps got fluoridated water
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.680]  occurred is the evicted carbon that was in the Nuremberg trials and then our
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:19.960]  government said this is great bringing over here that is mainline history but
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:24.880]  the Nazis put fluoride in the water absolutely so now we not only have it in
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.800]  the water a lot of the soft drinks have sodium fluoride a lot of the psychiatric
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:35.760]  medicines like pro that are absolutely are you kidding powdered eggs can have
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:41.160]  300 parts per million under law they're adding it to thousands of foods so we
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:45.880]  have our thinking our rational thinking capabilities are our emergency
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.480]  response system is so to speak individually has been disabled through
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:54.240]  these programs and it makes people you know like well we don't see people
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:58.040]  rising up too much people keep saying what's wrong with Americans why do they
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.800]  put up with why do the vets put up with a deal to take all of their death
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.920]  benefits on record and no one gets in trouble why are the banks why are the
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:09.600]  states announcing the banks are allowed to now steal houses they don't own
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.640]  that's in Reuters today because they've drugged us with a chemical weapon and
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:20.680]  now they're brewing up airborne Ebola for us well we don't know you know I'll
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:25.600]  tell you actually Dr. Aaron Pionka UT said that the airborne Ebola will be out
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:30.240]  soon he looks forward to him and his family dying at UT and then I had his
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.720]  graduate students send me hateful emails so I later learn working bio weapons
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:36.680]  because I would look their name up seeming a white lab coat working at
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:40.280]  government bases and they'd say the doctor is too liberal humans will all
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:45.000]  be exterminated how dare you scum I'm telling you they've got their people
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.840]  everywhere it's like 12 monkeys I agree with that and I think we specifically
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.040]  have to look at collective medicine mechanisms because you know these people
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:57.960]  don't really want to kill themselves we have to look at that scene we have to
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.560]  look at any sort of pharmaceutical that you know it's selective in terms of you
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.800]  get that prescription and you get something else we have to look at the
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:11.400]  possibility of an attack as Ms. Napolitano so nicely clue that into the
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:18.040]  water system we have to understand that there are populations at risk and this
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:22.800]  is basically the message that I'm trying to bring here so in the
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:28.280]  meantime I when I get off this call I'm going to call again to the Department
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:33.080]  of Homeland Security and I'm going to ask them to basically set up a meeting
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:36.280]  with an agent I'm going to turn over the blueprints that I have to multiple
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:39.600]  cities I'm going to turn over the information that I have because I'm
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:45.680]  sure Homeland Security doesn't know well you know I don't mean it's good
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.280]  because there are a lot of low-level agents who aren't operatives and they'll
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.880]  get slapped down but they may start investigating on their own Alex you
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.080]  could call them right now from your show and we could make this report on the
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.640]  air and it would be a little harder to say oh that's Janet Bayland she's a
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:08.600]  conspiracy theorist well I know that there's I mean I know that there's they
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:12.840]  said eight years ago they were going to build 36 level four bio weapons labs and
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:17.600]  they built them and now we learn they've got at least 150 or more in level
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.560]  threes and now they've got level threes and level twos and then they've got
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.920]  level twos they call threes that they've got fours in I mean we're talking

[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:29.320]  all right well Janet I'm glad that you're looking into the bio weapons labs we
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:34.440]  should have a larger national debate about this but but from the different
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:37.480]  answers you got from government we only got about a minute left here the
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.520]  different answers you got from different branches of government of people you
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.680]  talked to you definitely got to run around but do we know how many level
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:51.800]  fours there are we don't know they won't tell us and when you ask them directly
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.880]  they give you a day being the center for disease control who is in charge of
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:03.560]  tracking these they give you false information so you know I think that we
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:08.760]  do have dangerous people inside our government who mean us harm and I think
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:16.280]  they are at pulse points of positions of power and we need to basically this
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.080]  needs to be reported to the people in Geneva Switzerland which is what I'm
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:25.360]  trying to do by getting credentials and we also need to put a report on the
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:29.480]  record to the Department of Homeland Security absolutely thank you so much
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:37.720]  for joining us yeah I would just say this here and it's that that looking at
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.120]  this I mean it's a fact they're building these they have built them all over the
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:45.360]  country they're moving Plum Island to the Midwest which you know created
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:50.520]  Lyme disease and released it West Nile I mean these people are eugenicists and
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:55.680]  they're into death and we need to be aware of this is going on this is the
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:01.280]  real threat to America this is the real threat to the world not that we're
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.560]  being told all day that Al Qaeda is going to get get us so you know give your
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:08.160]  rights up and of course coming up the next hour we're going to have an
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:13.800]  absolute cornucopia of important news and information the latest on the Oslo

[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.640]  blast has not yet been ascertained they're saying it's a car bomb seven
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:29.080]  people killed by the bomb blast to seriously injured police are saying
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:33.880]  they believe the person responsible the bomb to be a foreigner according to BBC
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:40.200]  they arrest you over there every criticize foreigners but the attacker in

[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:28.800]  Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we're into the third hour I'm multitasking on
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:35.680]  air I'm calling Paul Joseph Watson right now in fact if I know Watson he's
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:39.960]  probably already on it they've announced that white al-qaeda is running around
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:44.360]  shooting people in Norway you've got the bombing coinciding with it right as
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:47.920]  they had the rollout of white al-qaeda in the last week and told you they were
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.400]  going to hit you right as the bankers implode Europe and get ready to implode
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.520]  the United States they staged these provocative events to make you rally
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:02.480]  around and worship them Watson hey Watson are you there buddy okay I'm
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:08.200]  live on air right now you're not punched up I called you on my globalist
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:14.440]  tracking slave device iPhone that we're using a jack-in-the-matrix here but
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:18.640]  obviously look we don't have the crew but I'm asking listeners now as I ask
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:23.000]  you because this is what really impresses people that aren't awake who
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.920]  don't know the research they do get impressed by precision predictions
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:30.520]  remember I said white al-qaeda would strike right as they fully imploded
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:34.920]  Europe and that they would have a rollout of white al-qaeda starting with soft
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:39.520]  target shootings and bombings in Europe that would then move to the United
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:43.720]  States and I've been predicting this I don't know for over a year now with
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:47.800]  exact precision because I was gauging their propaganda their their their
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:54.240]  preparatory gal lighting of the public so this is an absolute emergency white
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:02:02.880]  al-qaeda attacking shooting people in Norway coinciding with the car bomb I
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:07.720]  mean this is just absolutely off the charts this is I believe this is the
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:12.320]  beginning of their beta testing the rollout of white al-qaeda and they're
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:16.360]  also you know gonna have the rollout of Muslim extremists linking up with the
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:19.800]  white al-qaeda they teach police that's returning veterans they have all these
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:23.920]  TV shows like Homeland and others they're all about the vets are gonna join
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:27.280]  al-qaeda the blonde-haired blue-eyed vets anybody believes that it's just it's
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.200]  just it's it's it's just beyond ridiculous but the psi-op is launching
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.440]  right as they get ready to fully implode the depression you know I've always
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:40.640]  laid that out to you I think I'll put you on speaker here Watson Watson do you
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:48.000]  have any comments on that yes you're on the air go ahead
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.400]  of course they are look look I want to talk to you right now in there we're
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:04.280]  gonna call you back and put you up right as we had a Chapman okay but this is
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:10.880]  full red-level emergency here I mean I just wish I was wrong oh man I tell you
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.160]  this is bad news and they've got actuaries on all of this they probably
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:18.360]  even had computer algorithms knowing that there'd be responses to their white
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:24.440]  al-qaeda and they pull this I tell you we're in trouble Watson I'm gonna call
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:30.120]  you back right now I'm gonna go to you and Chapman on the other side okay we
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:36.840]  got to go full tilt buggy on this Watson all right good job I'll see you get him
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:39.600]  on the line I'm going to Bob Chapman here we're going to break in about a
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:44.200]  minute and a half Bob Chapman former US intelligence a big silver and gold
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:49.040]  broker biggest newsletter until he retired now he's back Bob white al-qaeda
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:53.080]  has hit and hit hard right after DHS rolled out that white al-qaeda is gonna
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:58.600]  start attacking I predicted they would hit soft targets in Europe first and then
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.160]  move to the United States while the bankers implode things as the White
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.440]  House advisors admit terror attacks will help people rally around the bankers
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:14.960]  while they gang rape us I agree with that and that is the reason why they
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:19.560]  have those kind of things are you speaking of what happened in Oslo yeah
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:24.160]  there's been a bombing by a white al-qaeda Easter Bunny he had the lucky
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.360]  charms elves with him but also they're reporting a soft target shooting at this
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:32.760]  day camp they love to target kids folks that's that it's its operation glad to
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:43.160]  go that blonde hair at al-qaeda hit hard well it's obviously another faint in the
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.360]  direction which will allow them to do the things that they want to do and maybe
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:51.760]  it's a cover for the bankers you know the situation in Europe with Greece stay
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:55.520]  there next you're gonna tell me that the bin Laden video wasn't real even though
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:59.840]  they now admit the story was fake about the situation room and everything else
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:04.000]  but this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:12.520]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.560]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:20.440]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:24.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously

[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:15.160]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Okay ladies and
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:25.360]  gentlemen my gut told me this morning when the Oslo when the Oslo bombing took
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:30.960]  place that they were gonna play a wide alkyde card and again I'm so close to
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:35.040]  this I studied this so much I've learned to watch their preparatory brainwashing
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:40.720]  that's designed for unconscious very dumb down Prozac fluoride heads and so
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:44.400]  they always prep alkyde is gonna hit you what do you do when they hit we give
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.040]  our rights up and that was going on before 9-11 and I was able to call I
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.000]  was able to even call the target they were going to hit and who they would
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.760]  blame it on on record in fact I taped it two months before 9-11 I did it live
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:03.000]  and taped it and I re-air it on access because it had been turned back into
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.880]  randomly play and it aired on the afternoon of September 11th and we
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.080]  always had positive comments to the station they had hundreds of threats
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:13.160]  because it was a two-and-a-half hour show where I said the government's gonna
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:16.560]  blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on bin Laden you imagine folks on a
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:20.760]  two-hour show four to six p.m. in Austin watching a TV show where I'm saying the
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.320]  government's going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on bin
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:27.960]  Laden they thought it was live reporting I was showing the World Trade Center
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:31.960]  saying they're gonna blow this up I don't know how to explain I just get
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:37.720]  thousands of data points and stream them in together and God's supercomputer we've
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:42.520]  all got one and I'm able to predict what they're gonna do now I don't have the
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.560]  crew the energy of the time only because this will wake people up for over a
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:51.120]  year I've said why don't actually about five years but in the last year I said
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:55.000]  now's the time they're gonna watch white al Qaeda attacks in Europe against soft
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.160]  targets car bombs shopping malls that they love to target kids it like
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.600]  Operation Gladio when the US government blew up school buses and shot up
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:08.680]  schools and blamed it on the communist I said they're gonna target kids and I've
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:12.600]  said it over and over and it will come when they're in the final phase of
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:17.800]  imploding each region well even Sarkozy was in Reuters last night saying this is
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:23.200]  a Marshall plan and IMF takeover of Europe this is great they have designed
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:26.880]  this whole thing to actually set up a euro and then implode it into a new
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.960]  corporate receivership and then they're only riding off the debts of smaller
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:35.680]  banks that aren't part of the big six and that I shot a special video at
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:39.680]  midnight last night about this on the Alex Jones channel now Bob Chapman's
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.160]  riding shotgun with us I haven't asked him yet I've been going to overdrive
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:46.480]  which again the main AM and FM's will be off with us in the next hour some do
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:50.400]  carry the fourth but we'll be internet only at prisonplanet.tv and info war
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:54.920]  streams still you know hundred thousand people over the hour listening and
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:03.080]  millions later watching the videos of it and some stations do carry it so so
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:07.960]  we're going to get Bob Chapman on with us throughout the hour Paul Watson's
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.080]  waiting in the wings correct but I'm told that we have a we got a news
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:18.120]  contact from Norway who was in Oslo and was 200 feet away from this is named
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:26.160]  Robert Robert tell us about yourself tell us what you witnessed sir thanks
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:31.440]  Alex so I just called you because I wanted you know to tell sort of what
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:39.880]  happened I worked my office is just by the the government building so I was
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:45.840]  out having a coffee and walking back towards my office there's a big open
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:51.720]  square that was just coming into the square and then you know you just got
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:58.320]  bastard a bit back and windows was flying out glass behind me in front of me
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:06.760]  and then all of the city just went totally quiet so we stopped towards the
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:11.240]  government building since smoke was coming out so started walking towards
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:19.080]  the government building and then people was coming you know out of the building
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:24.160]  and out of the square people bleeding people carrying other people telling
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:33.040]  don't go up there there's people lying dead on the square and just I just stopped
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:38.760]  and you know waited for the police and ambulances and things to come by the way
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:43.600]  we've checked your number you are in Norway right now now sir you told our
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:47.240]  office specifically appreciate your courage after being shook up by this
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:52.680]  just as Kurt Haskell and his wife were in Amsterdam and saw the disheveled
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:56.480]  appeared to be drugged underwear bomber Christmas Day bomber being gotten on the
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.800]  plane by a sharp dressed man with an American English accent and then they
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.240]  saw the whole firecracker bomb the men filming it on board the fake bomb
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.160]  threat once they landed the government said that was alive for a month and a
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:12.280]  half then in the State Department had to admit indeed they were ordered by a
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:17.480]  unnamed US intelligence agency to get mutalib on the plane so we have info
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:22.640]  warriors everywhere at every event now you are that man you told our crew
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:27.840]  something about men in black uniforms sweeping the area the night before we've
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.000]  tell us about that and if we find out there was a drill in the area just like
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.920]  Mumbai just like Bali it's always the same it came out Chicago Tribune the
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:43.240]  Bali thing was connected to the CIA so sir you've got the floor then we'll have
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:46.240]  Bob Chapman and Paul Watson ask you questions Robert do you want to put
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:51.320]  your full name on air so we can get a report out on this or do you not want
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:56.720]  to put your full name out it just adds a lot of credibility if you do I'll give
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:01.880]  you my full name and you know addresses so I live in the center of us I live I
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:06.000]  guess one and a half kilometers from the blast so everything's just quite around
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:13.160]  here and I'm also just called into the civil defense so I don't you know want
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:20.320]  to expose my whole name and I sort of have to be there a bit soon but the
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:23.960]  thing with the uniform I know about the underwear bomber I know what falls like
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:30.680]  operations and so on so I've been by our guidance just following what's going on
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:36.440]  and then things there's been talk about more chatter things happening in Norway
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:44.600]  and so on on the internet maybe terrorists and on these things so I'm
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:53.880]  sort of shook enough I get my things from the office and then go back home then I
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.240]  start switching between TV channels and then one of the channels that oh there's
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:07.520]  an unconfirmed report that yesterday or last night men in in black on market
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:16.360]  uniforms was searching the area around the media building they get a big
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:21.680]  newspaper in Norway and the government building just around the area where the
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:31.640]  blast was so then they switched to of course the other news I don't know have
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:36.080]  you have you gotten anything what's happened Alex yes we're getting Paul
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:39.760]  Watson's tracking it Kurt Nemo's tracking it but specifically you're
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:44.880]  saying on Norwegian television they did report there was some type of bomb sweep
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:48.640]  last night in the area can you can you remember I know you're a little shook up
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:53.520]  after the bombing that you were witness you live in the area Robert can you give
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:16:01.480]  us the name of the TV station yes it was the TV to TV to so that's state-run
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:07.440]  media isn't it no NRK is the state-run media TV to commercial okay commercial
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:15.160]  yeah but you know they did the same guys I guess got it okay so TV to commercial
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:18.640]  channel specifically because we're gonna look into this Paul Watson's listing
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:23.600]  right now specifically exactly what did they say about the men in the black
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:30.360]  uniforms no they just said that they had had reports that that someone was
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:38.560]  sweeping the area yesterday not very detailed just as a by-sentence that's
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:43.720]  why but but I have to elaborate on on that there's not only a terror bombing
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:48.680]  here in Oslo a terror shooting a blonde-haired al-Qaeda which you know we've
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:52.760]  been talking about I'm rolling out to now flip it from the Muslims to the white
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:56.640]  people are of the al-Qaeda no one is safe we've got a report on everybody yes
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:02.840]  sir tell us about the summer camp and the white al-Qaeda yeah because the
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:06.720]  government has this youth camp every year is quite popular they always have
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:11.200]  newscasters and stuff are showing on TV because you know it's just by far the
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:19.120]  biggest single party and you know they the last report now said that this guy
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:24.960]  was the gathering them telling that holding a gun he said because of what
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:29.080]  happened in Oslo and it was he had a machine gun not just a pistol but he had
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:33.960]  a machine gun and then he just started started masquerading them to just start
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:39.600]  shooting and we've now had a renaji hadi group with intelligence connections
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.320]  take the credit so and the government's now saying correct as I've got British
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:48.000]  news on this it's up on the drudge report they're saying that that they are
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.400]  that the white al-Qaeda is connected to the other renaji hadi group that
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:58.640]  supposedly is involved in this is that what Norwegian television is saying no
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:03.840]  they're saying that they don't have their naming names they're saying could be
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:12.440]  connected sort of it looks like al-Qaeda operation because it's happening two
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:16.560]  places at the same time the New York Times is reporting that it's the helpers
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:21.560]  of global jihad now they'll they'll use a message board somewhere I could go on a
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:25.520]  message board to say Santa Claus took credit and and and they would print it
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:35.400]  but they also have named their naming a muller here and saying specifically it
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:43.640]  looks like because I was watching CNN following the 9-1-1 happening live and
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:49.320]  they within you know a very short amount of time they were saying oh this is
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:56.400]  a lot okay yeah from the grave bin Laden yeah and they've got the million pages
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:59.680]  of stuff they found where they can always make up new plots out of that and
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:04.080]  of course he's in the ocean down there with with saving Nemo and everything's
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:10.960]  fine blast and gun attack in Norway seven dead how are the Norwegians taking
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.240]  this and why do you think the globalist because this is clearly staged
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:19.440]  ladies and gentlemen I mean I'd say 98% chance I mean I see this is right as the
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:24.040]  banking cartel tries to make Europe shine on to pay everything of the
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.160]  bankers coffer this is a way to unify people around unpopular government
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.640]  programs I don't know if you say you're a listener have you not heard me predict
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:35.080]  exactly this would happen and that Western Europe would be the first target
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:43.200]  of the soft-target attacks I've been following you every day and I know this I'm
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:49.880]  been an extra observed on the news and I'm seeing where things are going on I
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:55.360]  was thinking maybe Berlin maybe even Stockholm and you know we're outside the
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:05.400]  EU where we have six planes in Libya we're you know just got message from from
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:11.760]  this folks mission telling oh yeah they're gonna try to blame Gaddafi exactly
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:14.400]  as a pretext for the ground invasion we also talked about that being a
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:17.240]  possibility that that needs to go in the hopper because they want the ground
[02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:21.800]  invasion September October you're saying this either could be Gaddafi or it
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:26.240]  could be being blamed on him but now you have the blonde-haired guy involved that
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:31.680]  that that is it really really pushes it into the realm of government staged
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:35.920]  what is your gut I mean you're somebody who just survived this you're somebody
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:39.720]  who was you know felt the blast you were somebody who was right there 200 feet
[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:47.360]  away from it what is your gut tell you this is as I told you sir I was thinking
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:54.880]  because you know there's an election coming up the government is losing
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:21:02.280]  voters and I was thinking yeah you know we're sort of free and it's a perfect
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:09.840]  opportunity to you know restrict our freedoms and I was just actually
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:16.220]  waiting for something to happen I'm sorry to say but you know well still we've
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:20.080]  got seven people dead you still got a better chance there of dying from being
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:24.120]  struck by lightning and even if thousands were dying you don't give your
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:28.880]  freedoms up to terrorists you don't give into it even if it was real what's
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:32.160]  your timing you just survived you said you were 200 feet away how did the blast
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:40.040]  affect you I was sort of I was sure I was my body was moved and the windows
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:44.400]  exploded one right behind me one right beside me I was just stepping onto the
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:51.320]  boardwalk and then the windows just came alarms started going and you know
[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:57.920]  they were debris all over the square I have pictures from right where I was
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:04.960]  standing so I can send them if you want to see it was just sort of but then
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:10.720]  everything was just calm and then chaos they evacuated center of Oslo I don't
[02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:16.840]  know from it's so quiet well sir going back if you would have left a minute
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:19.840]  earlier you might have were you going in the direction of the blast when it
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:25.960]  happened yes I was I was working towards my office again and my office is just by
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:32.440]  the building is the building you know next to one that was blown up you had a
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:36.240]  chance to talk to any of your friends so well I mean to go back so you were
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:42.960]  going in the direction of it yeah wow I had a clear view straight up to the
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:47.800]  building where the explosion was I saw the smoke coming up straight in front of
[02:22:47.800 --> 02:23:00.080]  me Wow incredible now expanding on this so there you have it the government in
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:06.600]  trouble government approval ratings down magically this happens have you had a
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:12.880]  chance to talk to any other Norwegians and get their view of what they think is
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:21.720]  going on well we've sort of texted you know people are okay and so on so I'm
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:28.560]  just saying the stage and people saying this is just strange and people say
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:34.760]  I staged but you know not everyone understands that these things can happen
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:41.920]  I mean statement I don't know for certain of course not but it's so strange
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:50.200]  they were also saying that they saw four men in the black Mercedes and shooting
[02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:55.640]  away from somewhere the incident site just before it happened some car was
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:23:59.400]  blocked at the airport is just a strange message going everywhere but I guess
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:03.560]  it's a chaos also right after the explosion well they'll find some
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:08.920]  patsies do we know what happened to the blonde haired Al Qaeda who shot up the
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:13.960]  summer camp and we know who he killed there well they say they had they have
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:19.000]  arrested one person I mean this was an island and people were just swimming
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:24.200]  away from the island people were calling and texting people on land that
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:30.240]  they were running away just hiding they don't don't call him I find that he was
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:35.360]  running around island trying to find people and shoot them yeah you just
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:39.680]  joined us we're talking to Robert who is in Oslo Norway a listener of the show
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:43.480]  and we've called him back there he is there in Oslo and we appreciate him
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:47.480]  joining us I want to bring Bob Chapman up who worked in US intelligence against
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:51.880]  the Russians to ask you a question then Paul Watson then we'll let you go but
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.320]  stay in contact with you in the next few days and perhaps get you on Sunday after
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:00.400]  you've had time to really so call this in we're glad you survived sad for the
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:04.960]  seven that are dead that now we're 30 seriously wounded but devastating attacks
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:10.120]  there are more they they dragged that people into the building to do
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:14.360]  reconnaissance and you know that number is going up so oh so there's more than
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:19.960]  seven dead from what you saw yeah and then there's a lot of people killed
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:24.520]  after the shooting I'm watching as a TV2 live broadcast all right now they're
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:29.560]  saying the shooting killed a lot more people yeah the shooting they don't
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:33.920]  they don't have any numbers because they don't show on this bad weather and but
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:38.280]  the blonde-haired Alcada right on time as Jen de Paulitana rolls out or white
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.040]  Alcada is gonna get you I mean can you see the scripting of how they roll these
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:52.760]  things out I mean it's ridiculous the sort of perfect timing because people
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:57.760]  that have just gone from work and some people were going past the government
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:05.600]  borders and most people are on holiday here I guess almost everyone so so there's
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:13.200]  not much collateral damage but enough to you know make it a big event incredible
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:17.280]  incredible Bob Chapman's with us every Friday he seems to always be on the
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.880]  news is breaking and and then it gets cut short I want to Bob may have to leave
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:25.880]  at the end of the hour but we're going in to the fourth hour for prison planet
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:29.640]  TV viewers and in fours audio stream listeners of stations want to carry it
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:33.800]  it's on the satellite they can get it if they want live coverage of this but Bob
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:38.280]  look I need listeners not to toot my horn but to get all the videos where I
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:43.360]  lay out exactly how this would start and and if it turns out they say it's white
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.360]  Alcada you know folks they're dropping the hammer they're gonna start the
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:50.840]  arrest the roundups I mean we this means they're getting ready to start a
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:55.440]  World War 3 scenario and use it to crack down on domestic groups Bob Chapman do
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:01.360]  you have any comments or questions for Robert who narrowly survived the blast
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:11.120]  well as I see it if Robert had been 20 seconds to a minute earlier he might
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:17.440]  have been really caught in the blast I have a question do you know what
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:26.320]  participation Norway took in the recent meetings which involve the bailout of
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:34.160]  Greece if any I can hear Bob perfectly the networks telling me they can't
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.000]  hearing yeah I can hear him fine too I mean I'm getting full audio piped in but
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:46.120]  they say they can't hearing did you hear that question Robert yes I did sir he
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:53.240]  asked whether our participation in in the EU the bailout of Europe and they're
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:59.360]  calling it a Marshall plan for Europe a new Marshall panel means you know almost
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:07.480]  a new plan economy where we support we give more money to the EU every year I
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:14.920]  think that most of the country because my participation we we inherit every law
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:23.740]  we don't signal to any of the laws they passed so we're as incorporated as you
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:31.400]  know it's possible to be without having the currency and the benefits of being
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:39.960]  in the halls of Brussels so and you know our economy is being in comparison
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:48.240]  we're small country but big in oil so I'm sort of told an educated guest saying
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:58.080]  that we have at least influences with with the decision to bailout please I
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:02.320]  mean Bob Bob Chapman I mean look at the timing of this and now they're telling us
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:08.160]  hey it's a blonde-haired Al Qaeda I mean this this is incredible scripting Bob
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:15.960]  well what I'm getting at here is the bankers were extremely irate that they
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:21.160]  had to come up with 21% of the value of the bonds that but they were holding in
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:25.120]  other words they took a 20% loss in their bonds and they're gonna have to go in
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:30.600]  and back up the market to the tune of about 500 billion dollars stay there so
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:34.040]  now it's time to turn the judge jihad he's loose on Europe to teach him to
[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:38.400]  lick banker boots better exactly stay there stay there we'll see if Robert
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:42.160]  would stay there Paul Watson's coming in this is all breaking ladies and gentlemen

[02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:25.400]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:35.400]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:48.920]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic

[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:36.920]  we're on them folks we got it we know the enemy attack pattern the six big mega banks bob chavin rides a shotgun with us so busy during the breaks that it asks him to stay in the next hour to take your calls
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:50.920]  we'll watch and join us via video skype at him holding for 20 minutes i need to punch him out of here quick so you can write articles so they can go out to the forewinds of the web it is important we get on top of this story now i also want to get into the economy later in the next hour
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:34:04.920]  let me ask bob Chapman before we let robert go because i know he's got to get to a civil defense he's part of the defense system there just i guess like switzerland a lot of those countries have that bob can you ride shotgun in the next hour
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:15.920]  okay good because we need to talk to you but obviously this is breaking right now but you are particularly suited for 50 years talking about stage terror and stage crises and don't let a good crisis go to waste
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:33.920]  finishing up with robert i want to illustrate that even though terrorism is incredibly rare and in most cases it is stage there are real attacks they're never coordinated they're never multiple events i mean they do go on there are real people that hit soft targets
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:52.920]  they see it as a military operation because they don't have abrams tanks and f-16s you can call them terrorists you can call them freedom fighters the point is is that they do exist now the bigger issue here is most events are provocateur pat seed or purely staged
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:35:06.920]  this is has the hallmarks of a purely staged event just as a snapshot look at it and the key time when it's happening i said as the implosions happen they will try to menace people into gathering around the government changing the subject from the banksters
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:25.920]  we have predicted it with total precision soft targets white al-qaeda because of the pre scripting again they think you're dumb but robert even though it's incredibly rare still it shows how it could happen to anybody here you are a listener here you are researching false flag and how important it is to the geopolitical strategy
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:39.920]  and strategies and gambits of the controllers and here you are barely surviving it but thank god you survived and are able to report to us just like kurt haskell and his wife who saw the u.s. government get mutalib on the plane
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:36:06.920]  i'm getting chills right now and the fbi came and visited him tried to get him to change the story and a month and a half later it came out that everything he said here was true i'm getting chills i wish it was some guy from africa that's not scary statistically but that the government would be doing this is scarier than you know what robert do you have any comments on this you know on the on the fact that how weird it is that you're a listener in this
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.920]  what happened i guess we have listeners everywhere
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:39.920]  i mean watching the news now they say four at least at least four five people shot at the youth innocent political camp you know there's no marching in banners they're just having tents and just like a festival and then some guy you know dressed up as police officer goes and you know just close them down with a machine gun
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:43.920]  yeah let's not forget that he was reportedly dressed as a policeman
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:37:12.920]  he lost his cap so that they could clearly see who he was oh of course the blonde hair and for folks that don't know how this works they can have a special ops deep cover guy like mcvay tell him to do it and then set him up later or they can have a lookalike like lee harvey oswald and this stuff has come out this is how bob Chapman you worked in black ops we're going to get dr steve pacenick on that is
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:25.920]  absolutely needed for sunday you worked in black ops i mean this is on record that they operate like this is a snapshot bob Chapman what do you say looking at this right now
[02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:44.920]  well it's hard to tell their objective because we don't know really where they're going with this but because of what's going on in europe i see it through that lens and and that is the bankers have had to capitulate first they were going to take
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:38:01.920]  all of the things that grief had then they were going to take a couple of things now they're not going to take anything and in the meantime the german public has demanded that the german government make the bankers participate
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:18.920]  they're the ones that caused the problem and they're the ones that are sitting on a good part of the bonds so the bankers are going to have to come up and this is a menial amount as far as i'm concerned but they don't like it and that's about 21% of their participation
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:33.920]  which means they're taking a 20% haircut on what they already own and probably will own the future with this refunding of grease and i think they're furious about it and some of this stuff is open-ended
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:56.920]  we have this european monetary fund which says the bankers are going to have to come up with 20 billion immediately by exchanging bonds which would mean they take the old bonds in and let the greeks put out new bonds that have a 15 or 30 year life
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:09.920]  but what's even more interesting is that the buyback program is still to be outlined by the governments and that means that they're going to have to come up with a lot more money
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:19.920]  we're in the first place that thought they were going to loot the country grease and so i think that could be part of what's going on
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:28.920]  okay we're going to talk more about that in the next hour with Bob Chapman and your calls if you want to join us on air it's 1-800-259-9231
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:38.920]  1-800-259-9231 Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.com or when the Paul Watson editor of prisonplanet.com in just a moment
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:53.920]  going back to Robert a survivor anything else you'd like to add before i have Paul ask you a question and we'll let you go but i definitely want to check in with you again coming up in 48 hours or so on the Sunday 4-6 broadcast
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:40:08.920]  i think that's very important we'll know a lot more by then i pray this is real terrorist that's a lot less scary than state sponsored and someday we may find that for leaf clover because you know it's terrorism is bad but i really wish it was
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:23.920]  alone not muslims and not the military industrial complex that's a lot more frightening and so please god let it be muslim extremists please but we may find that unicorn here now anything else robert you'd like to have before
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:40.920]  i would just like to say that i totally agree with you i just hope that this is done by terrorists but i have a very sneaking suspicion that it's not and i also thank you for
[02:40:40.920 --> 02:41:01.920]  taking this call and keeping on you know presenting the message because so many people don't know what's going on here and you know everywhere else but when things like this happen and there are so many coincidences you know
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:14.920]  the prime minister on on some summer tv show last night talking about the future and saying father they had a plan and so on and this happens now it's just
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:20.920]  oh so he's been on tv talking about we're going to protect you from terrorists and then they hit
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:32.920]  well not about terrorists but against financial terrorism or against just protecting Norwegian people against you know all the
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:45.920]  threats i had seen at some blurbs that that actually some of the bankers have been mad at him for not wanting or them your government to contribute more money but but i mean was that disinfo you're saying your leader is
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:42:01.920]  pretty bad news i'm not sure but you know they're they have i guess the same leaders as your leaders and that's the way it seems anyway yeah no it's unified fraud
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:16.920]  you know films do you have i recognize Norwegian politicians from the building board meetings and so on so you know you know how it is absolutely let's bring paul watson in
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:26.920]  then we'll get more of a report from bob Chapman and paul let paul get back to writing big breaking news at presentplanet.com paul watson joining us via video skype do you have any questions for robert a
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:37.920]  survivor a narrow survivor blown back by the blast 200 feet away walking towards it when it happened he's got to be thinking his lucky stars his guardian angel in fact robert are you
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:52.920]  thinking your guardian angel right now or i mean there are no atheists and foxholes are are are you feeling blessed right now that you're alive well yes certainly so yes my guardian angels are getting traced at the moment
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:43:05.920]  oh wonderful paul watson any comments for robert or questions yeah well it was reported by both the daily mail and a norwegian commenter who left a comment on our article that
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:20.920]  and this is what pops out is the fact that you know if terrorists want to kill as many people as possible which is presumably their motive then apparently it's today is a public holiday in Norway so that building was mostly empty
[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:24.920]  yeah why bomb a government building on a holiday
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:33.920]  that is the middle of vacation i mean people are are back before two weeks for one week back i mean there's no one here the city is empty
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:53.920]  the government building is empty it was just sitting on tv telling about how everyone's on vacation so i mean why would a terrorist not i won't you know but yeah it's strange it's very unnerving
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:44:08.920]  paul watson continue with questions well i mean there's three very good reasons why norway would be in line for a slap on the wrist from these globalists i mean it's a country that's not in the EU so it's not part of that
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:27.920]  build a burg in a circle number one two months ago they froze a 42 million dollar payment to greece saying that they're not going to give them any more money that would have upset the people organizing the bailout number two they supported the palestinian state which is going to be up for a vote at the
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:41.920]  UN in september so the Arabs attack them i mean give me a break but number three they had set to pull out of libya on august the first which they announced a couple months ago so three very good reasons why the globalists would be angry with them
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:58.920]  as usual total precision from watson i want you to continue on that with bob Chapman finishing up with robert what are your comments on that that that was what i was talking about earlier that your government had been getting really crosswise with the establishment with every move they were making
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:21.920]  there's they 99% of the time they follow the plan but now there's an election coming up and you know you divert a bit from the plan maybe for a while and then so i'm not sure if it was a punishment as much as you know this had to happen somewhere to just you know
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:29.920]  continue stating what they want to say so they look like they just chose so slow this time
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:46.920]  unfortunately and i've got intel but also gut feeling austin's one of their targets so is dallas chicago houston because gary hart said that on fox one time giggling about it they love to brag beforehand robert anything else you'd like to add
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:55.920]  if you think it's coming to us and i'm just praying for you guys that this is not good
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:04.920]  this is no fun so now i think i have to go help rescue some people and do some volunteer cleaning up
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:18.920]  all right sir well if you'd like to take any photos or anything to that you see we're gonna put you on hold and give you my producers internal email will also give you a give him errands email to case you're gone later tonight jaren i'll have errands
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:30.920]  stay late he loves to anyways can't get him out of here he's such a hard worker but jaren does a great job as well over the weekend he helps us get the sonny show produced so send it to jaren because he's on the ball and Aaron
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:41.920]  i'm gonna put you on hold and give you both those internal emails please any write ups any intel any photos we won't use your name please get them to us robert thank you so much
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:42.920]  thank you sir
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:46.920]  all right put him on hold please and give him your email jaren and errands
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:57.920]  okay incredible paul watson again more statements recap those points you just made then i want bob Chapman to comment on those points you made
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:12.920]  um well just just to add as well royters are now saying that it's probably an alliance between islamists and right wing extremists of course the guy you're supposed to carry carried out the shooting was a blond haired norwegian
[02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:21.920]  and that's the script okay that's it that came out in Reuters absolutely i told you i saw it in the tea leaves from all the data i integrate i could see the scripting
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:36.920]  ladies and gentlemen right wingers in europe absolutely hate the muslims and try 24 7 to kick them out and are tried in by government tribunals for saying route the muslims if you think right wing militia groups and people are working with the muslims
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:46.920]  ladies and gentlemen i got a bridge i want to sell you okay paul now i'm getting freaked out you gotta admit paul did i not absolutely 100% call this
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:53.920]  well yeah i mean we were talking about it in relation to libya and gladio because that was very active before in europe
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:59.920]  cartman's story last week saying will they run operation gladio in europe to demonize libya
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:05.920]  give me the reuters headline paul they're now saying white al-qaeda white whitey working with al-qaeda
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:16.920]  they're saying security experts say suspicion is likely to fall on both islamist and right wing extremists following the deadly bombing and that's in snap analysis
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:23.920]  no clear pointers in norway twin attacks is the headline but that's what so-called security experts are saying
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:37.920]  but also there's a comment left by a norwegian on prison planet and his father is a dynamite expert and he's saying that the evidence appears as if the explosion came up from underneath
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:48.920]  and apparently there was road and sewer work going on in the days before so it looks like something's come up from underground just as in the case of 777 London bombings
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:57.920]  and later being blamed on this car bomb we should have asked robert that question that's important now here's reuters snap analysis no clear pointers in norway twin attacks
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:06.920]  but then the first line says suspicion is likely to fall on both islamist and right wing extremists following a deadly bombing and a shooting at a political gathering in tranquil norway
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  why would a real right wing group bomb something knowing it would destroy their credibility why would muslims do that bob Chapman your take on what watson just covered
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:31.920]  well as i said just earlier whatever their goal is we don't know yet we can guess the general goals but this will go far beyond just one issue
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:39.920]  they never do anything for one issue there's always three or four things that they're trying to accomplish when they make a move like this
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:58.920]  and i think the groundwork as just a watson pointed out was all there the pulling of troops out freezing of funds going to greece because i guess they didn't like the way the EU or the IMF or whomever was handling it
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:16.920]  and uh... one of the things that most people don't know in relation to greece is that they are and have been for many many years pro-palestinian and so i think that in order to hold the money up from going to greece that they were supposed to contribute
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:32.920]  must have been a monumental thing for that government because they also are pro-palestinian too but as far as getting to the points of light as to where this is all headed
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:45.920]  we're going to have to go over this more and more to find out exactly what they were up to because it's a government operation as you pointed out and we're going to find out where they're going with it
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:53.920]  Bob Chapman stay there, paul watson final second with him coming up then it'll be Bob Chapman, Alex Jones and your calls as we go into overdrive

[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:20.920]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:28.920]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:35.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages

[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:12.920]  all right Paul Watson in this segment we're gonna let him go let him get back to work with these breaking reports at prismplanet.com
[02:54:12.920 --> 02:54:21.920]  and the whole next hour I'm in a whole hour of overdrive with Bob Chapman and your calls 800-259-9231 and I'll be back live on the
[02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:31.920]  FM dial this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. live for the Sunday transmission Bob waiting in the wings till we start the next hour the international forecaster.com
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:39.920]  gold is above $1,602 silver above 40 continuing we'll look at the economics as well next hour with Bob
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:46.920]  I did three hours for many years then went to four hours got the TV show coming soon and then I'm addicted to doing four hours
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:51.920]  but when the TV show launches there will be no more overdrive except when there's these big breaking events
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:56.920]  which other stations do too but we're a network it's just the information is absolutely key here
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:01.920]  Paul Watson we got four or five minutes left in this segment break down everything you've covered
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:10.920]  you've really given us a lot of key clues and tidbits then the fact this is a multiple event attack it stinks to high heaven
[02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:19.920]  you throw the blonde hair into it it follows the scripting for White Al Qaeda reaching a fever pitch in the preparation
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:28.920]  well what they're saying now is that it's pretty clear that this shooting that happened after the bombing is the main event
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:38.920]  they're talking about 25 dead and remember that this is being pinned on this six foot three blonde Norwegian who dressed up as a policeman
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:47.920]  tricked his way into this island complex dressed as a police officer by saying he was checking security after the bombing
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:57.920]  and then started this massacre and now they're saying that 25 dead are on the shore there so it's definitely going to fall on the White Al Qaeda by the looks of it
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:12.920]  but on the flip side you've got this claim of responsibility from helpers of G had which has been reported by the New York Times but has also been contradicted by others who were saying that this claim was never made
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:16.920]  that's like helpers of Santa Claus I mean this is incredible
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:40.920]  but the actual group that the New York Times is pinning it on is this group called headed up by Muller Krekkar called Ansar Al Islam and Kurt Nemo's posted a story on Infowars.com which points out that the leader of this group Muller Krekkar was approached in 2005 to work with the CIA
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:46.920]  and that's he refused at the time but there's definite intelligence connections to this group
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:56.920]  well that's like a swat running the 7-7 and being MI6 and being protected that's even Fox News and MSNBC admit that
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:15.920]  actually the Economist which is a big globalist publication is also speculating that left wing renegade environmentalist angry at Norway's Arctic oil program may be involved so I mean the kaleidoscope is still in a flux and they're talking about all these different groups
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:31.920]  judging from the fact that 25 are now dead with this confirmed massacre by a blonde Norwegian man I mean it looks clear who this is going to fall on and it's going to be white al-Qaeda again and as I said before the break
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:43.920]  three very good reasons for Norway to receive a slap on the wrist one they're backing the Palestinian path to statehood at the UN big vote which is set to take place at the start of September
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:57.920]  number two they announced they were pulling out of Libya on the 1st of August so that obviously upset some people with NATO preparing this massive bombardment because it looks as if Gaddafi is now going to refuse to step down
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:20.920]  and on that token I know that Anders Rasmussen has vehemently come out condemning this he's become very public in the hours after it and also this $42 million that they refused to send to Greece back at the end of May so three very good reasons for Norway to get a slap on the wrist from the globalists with this bombing and shooting today
[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:29.920]  all right or give them the political cover to get back under the globalist command base thank you so much Paul Watson we're coming back with a full hour of overdrive

[02:59:51.920 --> 03:00:01.920]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:21.920 --> 03:00:46.920]  there are attacks in Norway at an island with people on the beach reporting 20 plus dead a empty or quasi empty government building on a holiday attacked at least seven dead there we had an eyewitness on who narrowly survived was actually knocked back by the explosion 200 feet away on Robert he's going out as part of civil defense to help with things and it's going to be back on with us Sunday perhaps sending us photos and things
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:01:08.920]  this is a short segment we'll give Bob Chapman the floor to continue to break down the terror attack when to come back take calls and then get back into the economy the main reason Bob Chapman of the international forecaster joins us every Friday Bob Chapman again with this whole situation going on what's your take on it
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:30.920]  Well I think at the bottom of it all is the terrible thrashing the banks have taken in this Greek episode and beyond that and they're going to have to come up with an awful lot of money that they're going to have to spend in the process of renewing Greek bonds
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:52.920]  of course those bonds will be backed by fully collateralized by triple A rated a zero coupon securities with a 30 year maturity and they will be backed by the European monetary fund which is something I haven't even heard of before and so they're very very
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:02:14.920]  disturbed about that and of course behind it were the German people and we saw that in the elections in the Hamburg area about three months ago when the CDU which is Mrs. Merkel's party got thrashed really badly because the people don't want any more money going into countries that
[03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:34.920]  have made those kind of mistakes and they're sick and tired of being buried in debt and they just went out of the whole thing and that was followed up by commentary which came out several days ago by Finland in fact I'll tell you something
[03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:59.920]  interesting Harleys Lange with the La Roche people was in Brussels at the meeting that they had and when he came back he was talking to Erskine and he asked them what he thought of the whole thing and they said well they answered him this Dutch group and they said we're sick and tired of it as well
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:18.920]  and he said well how do you get all your information and they said well we listened to Bob Chapman's broadcasts which kind of threw me but and the Finns are in the same boat they don't want to continue this and so what's happening is the bankers are barely hanging on here
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:38.920]  by their fingernails and it would be a good opportunity for them to instruct their minions to create a false flag attack like this or in an incident like this in Oslo doing all the things that you've described and why they do them
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:56.920]  well said Bob we're going to learn more obviously in the hours and days to come but I mean the bankers every time they get cornered or get in trouble they stage terror and maybe they'll rally around the governments they've bought and paid for but I mean I don't see this working I don't see them
[03:03:56.920 --> 03:04:11.920]  I mean take my story yesterday Paul Watson's story at the present planet that's one of the biggest stories in the country right now I mean every talk radio show I turn into is talking about the rollout of the white Al Qaeda TV ads that the white people are going to get you and the minorities are reporting them
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:27.920]  first they demonize brown folks over just taking their rights to get some racist whites to go along with it now they're flipping to the other side I mean this all this scripting together this looks like we're going to try to roll this out but I don't see people buying it
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:47.920]  well I agree with you I don't think they're going to it's just like crying wolf you only can do it so many times and all of a sudden nobody's going to come and the wolf comes and he gobbles you up and that's the concept they're going to the well too often and people are realizing
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:05:00.920]  because of what's happened before in other operations and listening to your program they get the truth absolutely stay there Bob the wolf comes and gobbles them up

[03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:25.920]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[03:06:25.920 --> 03:06:35.920]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[03:06:35.920 --> 03:06:41.920]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to

[03:08:00.920 --> 03:08:15.920]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network all right Bob Chapman riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour I've got a lot of economic news I want to go over the news course scandal
[03:08:15.920 --> 03:08:26.920]  I want to get Bob Chapman's take on mysterious death there this new UN green army to invade countries that don't submit to the environmental tyranny of the banksters
[03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:38.920]  but but yesterday Paul Watson wrote an article off a new DHS nine and a half minute video there put a bunch of these out where out of dozens and dozens of terrorists in and almost all of them are white
[03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:52.920]  and they have the blue eyes glowing and it's all minorities reporting the white people clearly this is designed just like they've had TV ads and things to make all Muslims look like terrorists or all people with brown skin can't be trusted
[03:08:52.920 --> 03:09:07.920]  they sell white folks on giving up their liberties because oh you know it's the scary brown people and then we pointed out now they're flipping it as I said the articles I wrote to oh my minorities it's the white folks they're about to start terror attacking you
[03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:18.920]  and I have all the internal documents and memos where the Homeland Security says we're not worried about Al Qaeda we just sell the public on that it's really the returning veterans the Ron Paul supporters the bullion gold owners
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:31.920]  and now in this new video it's do you write on pieces of paper do you type into a phone do you have a cell phone do you have a camera you know this is what they push clearly that's what they're doing
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:55.920]  and on one video we shot we have 495 likes on YouTube 28 dislikes big sis says whites are terrorists 33,000 views shot this yesterday and I see comments here shame on Alex Jones by bringing up irrelevant topics like white people he has discredited himself as a racist
[03:09:55.920 --> 03:10:09.920]  I bet the next thing he tries to convince his listeners of is that black people intend to kill all white people in America and that that's a straw man and that because of that we should not vote for Barack Obama this is an idiot Obama supporter
[03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:19.920]  I'm telling you not to vote for Rick Perry either moron but for white Ron Paul no not because he's white because he's a principal person who knows the issues and and and and understands the banksters
[03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:35.920]  I can't believe that people are still listening to this guy Alex you bleep and then there's there's a bunch of those comments and and it's you know if you don't support government run health care you hate black people Chris Matthews said it's not even it doesn't
[03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:50.920]  have sense it's nonsensical they clearly are have been saying now in the last few years white Al Qaeda is about to hit the militias and Ron Paul supporters are with Al Qaeda I've had them say it about me that I secretly work for Al Qaeda because
[03:10:50.920 --> 03:11:08.920]  I point out it was created by Zbigniew Brzezinski and the U.S. government on record and have former heads of black ops like Dr. Puchenek on to document that's the case ladies and gentlemen they first they demonize a minority that it's more kosher to go after like
[03:11:08.920 --> 03:11:22.920]  Hitler did then they go after everybody that's what I'm saying it's what the video says and it shows how fixated people are on race that there are black folks in these comments can go to their channels and you know see the videos they post and they
[03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:40.920]  say they're black saying you're racist because you say this ad targets white people listen I get accused of sticking up for LC I Ada when I say that you know it's it's it's a scapegoat and a stereotype to say Muslims are terrorist okay so I'm tired of it
[03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:53.920]  I'm telling you they're shifting all this over to white people and if you don't know that the establishment attacks whatever group is seen as wealthy and strong you don't know what you're talking about white people are under attack in this country
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:12:03.920]  everybody's under attack just like black folks are under attack and I did shows on that this week I stand for justice and truth and reality okay and you need to grow up
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:16.920]  okay I'm against national health care because let's the government decide what care you get and the insurance companies wrote the plan not because I hate black people stop being idiots Bob Chapman do you have any comments on this
[03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:38.920]  yes this is diversion tactics and it's to separate groups it's to cause chaos eventually it's been going on for years and years the communists use it effectively and now we're having it used upon us as Americans and it's not going to let up this propaganda
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:54.920]  machine is in high gear and it will remain there and of course people who are out front telling the truth trying to back into the answers to things that happen or things that might happen
[03:12:54.920 --> 03:13:10.920]  they are branded as people that have to be silenced or done away with and if you're on radio and you're doing what Alex is doing and I'm doing you've got to expect it and you can't get disturbed about it
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:30.920]  but you handle it just like another problem quietly and objectively which Alex has done and you just beat them back with the truth and they go away and they find another attack and they come back and attack you again so it's a never ending process
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:43.920]  and some of these people are working for the United States government and that's admitted they even have fake robo blogs and then the Pentagon doing it my issue is I'm not upset that I'm being attacked
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:55.920]  I'm upset that some of these are probably real people that are this dumb down who really believe if you don't want government health care you're a racist I mean it's just insane Bob
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:07.920]  well it's understandable even though it is insane because the government the people who control government from behind the scenes have been working on this since the 1930s
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:19.920]  I mean you saw it during the Second World War and thereafter and they've done it through the school systems and the children grow up not learning very much
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:31.920]  and they're easy prey for these people who create propaganda sending them off in the wrong direction giving them wrong ideas and they're gullible
[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:50.920]  and they probably have never had their brain taxed so to speak in doing difficult problems such as figuring out that the media belongs to the people who want to shape our minds
[03:14:50.920 --> 03:15:01.920]  and they don't get into that because there's nothing that they've done in education that would prepare them for that and so they're real victims
[03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:22.920]  they are and they just they just buy into like simple minded one liners that you have no effect on reality and then they discount being real participants in the world and just become spectators I want to go to Luke, Sean, Nick, Randy, Andrew and others coming up we're going to get into the economy and a bunch of other issues that's why Bob's here
[03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:26.920]  Luke in South Korea you're on the air welcome
[03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:31.920]  Oh hi Alex how are you going? Good what's your view on all this?
[03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:47.920]  Oh it's just shocking what's happening around the world now. My matter is actually not as big but it does unlock lots of Australian minds because in the Australian scene we don't have, as I said before we don't have enough terrorists or demonizing motorcycle gangs
[03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:58.920]  The public were woken up to find out Australia's first gang law was used against an 18-year-old Aboriginal boy and not against any of these bikeies because he called somebody who was gay gay he's been arrested
[03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:12.920]  and now in England just last week they arrested somebody for their Facebook making a mild racial comment about a football player this is the new secret police free speech attacking system Luke
[03:16:12.920 --> 03:16:22.920]  I've learned a lot more about it I've learned that the officer in charge of the investigation is the officer that's accusing the Aboriginal boy of the crime of obtaining true personal information about police
[03:16:22.920 --> 03:16:35.920]  60 C Crimes Act I've talked to his mother the boy's been hit across the head with the yellow pages and I just found out the government board cast has done this most bizarre hit piece against him you could probably put some of it up to air later
[03:16:35.920 --> 03:16:44.920]  Obviously the gay people are being persecuted so it's okay to beat the black kid up with a phone book that'll teach him
[03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:57.920]  Well what the ABC News has done is before the kids trial they're accusing him of being stupid and lacking etiquette there's two stories that put online called Learning Online Etiquette on the ABC News for the Mid-North Coast
[03:16:57.920 --> 03:17:05.920]  and Facebook harassment charge because if you don't have the right etiquette we're going to put you in jail
[03:17:05.920 --> 03:17:11.920]  No free speech I'm aware of the stories thank you Luke Bob Chapman they are galloping forward
[03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:21.920]  I had a national TV host in here yesterday who was involved in advocating for gay and lesbian groups fine that's his issue I don't even get into those things
[03:17:21.920 --> 03:17:31.920]  but he had to hesitate I said should I be arrested if I criticize these groups is what England and others are doing and they had to hesitate and say well no I guess that's free speech
[03:17:31.920 --> 03:17:34.920]  See this is where this is going Bob Chapman
[03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:53.920]  Well not particularly on that issue but we were talking about the people who don't understand so to speak and all I can say to that is that the other half of the people do understand and have the ability to understand
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:18:14.920]  and you and I and others like us have been given a gift where we can communicate with people on an intelligent level but very simply so and it's up to us to use the equipment that we've been given so that we can help these people understand
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:21.920]  and that's our job so there is a flip side to all the people who don't understand we're here to help them
[03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:31.920]  Absolutely let's jam in another Sean in Australia just hung up a lot of calls from Australians Nick in California you're on the air go ahead
[03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:33.920]  Hi can I have a minute?
[03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:34.920]  Yes go ahead
[03:18:34.920 --> 03:18:52.920]  Jerry Farwell came in on 9-1-1 also because he said he was blaming the gays and the hijackers were so ugly they got in through our tolerance for that
[03:18:52.920 --> 03:19:17.920]  Well they did circle the White House before they hit the Pentagon so now it's White Ikea so Bob blinks the banks and I agree because the banks are doing things like in a secret meeting and they're killing the children
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:24.920]  and it's secretly fed by the banks that's the mentality that these people are matching with
[03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:33.920]  I hear you Nick very interesting points we've got to go to break I want to take a bunch of calls I want to move quick we're going to go to Randy, Andrew, Tim and others the toll free number to join us

[03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:16.920]  It's called protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions
[03:21:16.920 --> 03:21:27.920]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time

[03:21:39.920 --> 03:21:42.920]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can

[03:21:59.920 --> 03:22:06.920]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years
[03:22:06.920 --> 03:22:14.920]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:22.920]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:27.920]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island
[03:22:27.920 --> 03:22:32.920]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power

[03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:12.920]  And we're going to get into a whole plethora of news with him before he leaves us on Gold, the economy
[03:24:12.920 --> 03:24:14.920]  I want to give this take on a host of issues
[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:18.920]  But Randy in Illinois, you are on the air with Bob Chapman. Welcome
[03:24:18.920 --> 03:24:29.920]  Hi Bob, hi Alex. I just wanted to point out on the DHS video
[03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:36.920]  There's something that I found that's rather cryptic it looks like
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:44.920]  At 6 minutes, 5 seconds, the black security guard
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:53.920]  Pat in glasses with mustache who's watching, who's observing people breaking into a shed
[03:24:53.920 --> 03:25:01.920]  Behind him on the wall, on the wall of the truck trailer or something
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:06.920]  It looks like there's a pyramid shaped eye drawn on it
[03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:09.920]  Yeah, saying we're the all seeing eye we're watching
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:15.920]  You're talking about the 10 minute DHS video, why he's going to get you, he's the new Al Qaeda
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:17.920]  Right, yeah
[03:25:17.920 --> 03:25:19.920]  And I just wanted to point that out
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:26.920]  6 minutes, 6 seconds, we'll look into that. What's your take on the Oslo situation?
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:30.920]  Well I think it's very disturbing
[03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:37.920]  You know, I'd certainly like to see what eventually transpires concerning that
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:42.920]  I don't really have an opinion, I mean I'm listening to you guys now
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:47.920]  So, you know, it's just very disturbing
[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:52.920]  Thank you so much, Bob coming on that
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:59.920]  No, I think you've got to look into the all seeing eye
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:05.920]  And yes, it's disturbing, I'm looking at reports coming in for the Washington Post right now
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:09.920]  And I'm trying to do three different things at once
[03:26:09.920 --> 03:26:14.920]  But it's really disturbing and the gentleman summated it all
[03:26:14.920 --> 03:26:20.920]  We have to try to, as time goes on here, find out really what's behind it
[03:26:20.920 --> 03:26:24.920]  Absolutely, and the globalists love to put their little gang signs all over everything
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:26.920]  I'm going to check that during the next break
[03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:30.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Canada, you're on the air, Andrew, welcome
[03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:34.920]  Hello Mr. Jones, my question is simply Al Qaeda has been
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:38.920]  Their original concept was to get occupation out of their homeland
[03:26:38.920 --> 03:26:44.920]  I'm curious how Norway has basically over the years been in any way trying to occupy
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:46.920]  Or diminish any other country
[03:26:46.920 --> 03:26:49.920]  My father just returned from Norway visiting his best friend
[03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:54.920]  And the picture he depicted was they barely have enough money to occupy their backyard
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:26:57.920]  Well, no, it's because they haven't been for the occupation
[03:26:57.920 --> 03:27:03.920]  That now Al Cida is going to strike them to teach them that they need to be part of these wars
[03:27:03.920 --> 03:27:06.920]  That's what PNAC wrote, that's what Dick Cheney wrote in 2000
[03:27:06.920 --> 03:27:10.920]  He said we need giant Pearl Harbor events that kill 3,000 people
[03:27:10.920 --> 03:27:13.920]  Pearl Harbor killed 3,000 to help launch these new wars
[03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:15.920]  And get rid of people's liberties and freedoms
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:17.920]  Bob Chapman
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:20.920]  Absolutely, and that's what it's all about
[03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:23.920]  And they try to herd people in the right direction
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:26.920]  Half the time they're not successful, half the time they are
[03:27:26.920 --> 03:27:29.920]  And it's the exposure that comes right after it
[03:27:29.920 --> 03:27:34.920]  Like you're covering right now that's going to bring in a lot of intel
[03:27:34.920 --> 03:27:38.920]  From people who normally would not be subject to bring
[03:27:38.920 --> 03:27:41.920]  That's a good point, we know about the underwear bombing
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:44.920]  Because we woke up the Haskells to false flag
[03:27:44.920 --> 03:27:48.920]  We have now people on the ground in Norway, a guy almost killed by the bomb
[03:27:48.920 --> 03:27:53.920]  Giving us intel, because they're aware now to not just believe the first story
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:27:57.920]  They understand Kibono, who benefits, who stands to gain
[03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:00.920]  Thank you, Andrew. Tim in Michigan, you're on the air with Bob Chapman
[03:28:00.920 --> 03:28:01.920]  Go ahead
[03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:03.920]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:04.920]  Good
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:06.920]  Yeah, it's been a long time
[03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:11.920]  I just got a few little quick updates
[03:28:11.920 --> 03:28:15.920]  And then I do have a definite something I'd like to speak about
[03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:17.920]  Right, we got about a minute and a half, go ahead
[03:28:17.920 --> 03:28:23.920]  Yeah, okay, well first off, I want to get to your opinion
[03:28:23.920 --> 03:28:28.920]  And Bob's opinion on a theory I have about the birth certificate thing
[03:28:28.920 --> 03:28:30.920]  I know it's kind of been in the background
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:32.920]  That's fine, give us your question
[03:28:32.920 --> 03:28:34.920]  Okay, this is what I'd like to know
[03:28:34.920 --> 03:28:37.920]  I have my personal birth certificate sitting in front of me
[03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:47.920]  There are three different safety devices to prove whether birth certificate is fake or not fake
[03:28:47.920 --> 03:28:52.920]  One of them is an imprinted actual stamp into the paper
[03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:56.920]  Yeah, there's no stamp on the one he had and it appears to be a composite
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:28:58.920]  Is that your question?
[03:28:58.920 --> 03:29:06.920]  No, if you cannot reproduce a scan to have texture, I mean that's obvious
[03:29:06.920 --> 03:29:10.920]  It also has watermarks that you can see through the paper
[03:29:10.920 --> 03:29:16.920]  It also has these disappearing ink stamps of the Michigan symbol on the back
[03:29:16.920 --> 03:29:21.920]  As far as I know, none of this stuff was ever brought out
[03:29:21.920 --> 03:29:26.920]  We've brought it out sir, we've made videos about it, watch millions of times
[03:29:26.920 --> 03:29:28.920]  What's your theory?
[03:29:28.920 --> 03:29:30.920]  Here's my theory
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:32.920]  Okay
[03:29:32.920 --> 03:29:40.920]  That the Illuminati misjudged the longevity of Obama's staying power
[03:29:40.920 --> 03:29:44.920]  And I think personally, they might have even threatened him and said
[03:29:44.920 --> 03:29:47.920]  Barry, you better take and...
[03:29:47.920 --> 03:29:51.920]  Alright, alright, alright, we gotta get to more callers now
[03:29:51.920 --> 03:29:55.920]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[03:29:55.920 --> 03:29:58.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[03:30:02.920 --> 03:30:04.920]  Hey Bill, pick up line three, it's Brian
[03:30:04.920 --> 03:30:06.920]  Hey Brian, what's up?
[03:30:06.920 --> 03:30:09.920]  Thanks, hey Bill, I just received my shipment of the safety net
[03:30:09.920 --> 03:30:12.920]  Our full year emergency food system
[03:30:12.920 --> 03:30:16.920]  I can't tell you how great it feels to personally not have to worry anymore
[03:30:16.920 --> 03:30:20.920]  Especially with the growing threats to our everyday food supply
[03:30:20.920 --> 03:30:26.920]  Brian, not only are you getting 4,320 nutritionally dense, delicious food servings
[03:30:26.920 --> 03:30:30.920]  But the individual serving price is just $1.43 per meal
[03:30:30.920 --> 03:30:33.920]  It's truly great tasting food and amazing prices
[03:30:33.920 --> 03:30:39.920]  The variety is also a huge bonus bill, it's like having access to a full menu of impressive food
[03:30:39.920 --> 03:30:42.920]  Well it really is a safety net for those worried about the coming food shortages
[03:30:42.920 --> 03:30:44.920]  And how their families can prepare
[03:30:44.920 --> 03:30:48.920]  It's great knowing I'm covered for the future, but I gotta go Bill and get all this food unloaded
[03:30:48.920 --> 03:30:51.920]  With scorching heat, devastating US cropland
[03:30:51.920 --> 03:30:55.920]  There's never been a better time to visit safetynetsavings.com
[03:30:55.920 --> 03:30:57.920]  That's safetynetsavings.com
[03:30:57.920 --> 03:31:18.920]  Visit safetynetsavings.com today
[03:31:28.920 --> 03:31:32.920]  4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[03:31:32.920 --> 03:31:36.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[03:31:36.920 --> 03:31:41.920]  5. A solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[03:31:41.920 --> 03:31:44.920]  Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science
[03:31:44.920 --> 03:31:46.920]  One of my oldest sponsors
[03:31:46.920 --> 03:31:50.920]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[03:31:50.920 --> 03:31:52.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[03:31:52.920 --> 03:31:57.920]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[03:31:57.920 --> 03:32:00.920]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[03:32:00.920 --> 03:32:03.920]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification
[03:32:03.920 --> 03:32:07.920]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet
[03:32:07.920 --> 03:32:11.920]  And even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress
[03:32:11.920 --> 03:32:16.920]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals and drugs?
[03:32:16.920 --> 03:32:18.920]  It is glutathione
[03:32:18.920 --> 03:32:22.920]  It can master any oxidant used to detoxify your entire body
[03:32:22.920 --> 03:32:26.920]  It stops free radicals, keeps sales young and reduces inflammation
[03:32:26.920 --> 03:32:32.920]  One-world-way protein powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more
[03:32:32.920 --> 03:32:36.920]  One-world-way is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market
[03:32:36.920 --> 03:32:39.920]  Because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows
[03:32:39.920 --> 03:32:46.920]  All other, quote, cold processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more
[03:32:46.920 --> 03:32:48.920]  They are very delicious flavors
[03:32:48.920 --> 03:32:51.920]  Call 888-988-3325
[03:32:51.920 --> 03:32:54.920]  That's 888-988-3325
[03:32:54.920 --> 03:32:56.920]  Or visit 1worldway.com
[03:32:56.920 --> 03:33:19.920]  www.1worldway.com
[03:33:27.920 --> 03:33:31.920]  If you want to get a free copy, either hard copy or email copy of this powerful newsletter
[03:33:31.920 --> 03:33:33.920]  A new one comes out tomorrow
[03:33:33.920 --> 03:33:37.920]  You can simply call Midas Resources and they will put you in the hopper to get it
[03:33:37.920 --> 03:33:45.920]  And it's 800-686-2237-800-686-2237
[03:33:45.920 --> 03:33:48.920]  Ted also has a deal where you can get two silver dollars
[03:33:48.920 --> 03:33:51.920]  That's an $80 value in the market or more
[03:33:51.920 --> 03:33:55.920]  I've got a challenge you to get two silver dollars for 80 bucks with silver above $40 an ounce
[03:33:55.920 --> 03:34:00.920]  And you get a documentary film that is animated called American Dream
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:04.920]  Which is incredibly well done about the bankers and how to stop them
[03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:08.920]  It's only 35 minutes long so great to wake up novices out there
[03:34:08.920 --> 03:34:12.920]  And the book, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice
[03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:15.920]  A book and a DVD free with free shipping
[03:34:15.920 --> 03:34:17.920]  Free shipping, free book, free film
[03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:22.920]  That's $40 off
[03:34:22.920 --> 03:34:26.920]  So you pay for the cost of the coins and get $40 free stuff
[03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:27.920]  It's a loss leader
[03:34:27.920 --> 03:34:30.920]  Give Midas Resources a call and tell them it's the Alex Jones special
[03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:31.920]  We'll take advantage of that
[03:34:31.920 --> 03:34:33.920]  That's key or it will cost a little bit more
[03:34:33.920 --> 03:34:34.920]  So very competitive
[03:34:34.920 --> 03:34:41.920]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237
[03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:45.920]  And while you're at it, ask him about the other radio specials and other silver and gold coins
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:48.920]  To get prices when Ted bought this golden silver months ago
[03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:52.920]  He is about to run out of the stuff he bought during that dip
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:54.920]  And the prices will go up, they'll still be very competitive
[03:34:54.920 --> 03:34:57.920]  800-686-2237
[03:34:57.920 --> 03:35:05.920]  You know, that caller was getting into theories of what the Illuminati might be doing with Obama
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:07.920]  I don't really get into a lot of theories
[03:35:07.920 --> 03:35:12.920]  If I see a pattern that they're saying why Al Qaeda is about to hit you when they hit
[03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:13.920]  What do we do?
[03:35:13.920 --> 03:35:14.920]  We spy on everybody
[03:35:14.920 --> 03:35:15.920]  Everybody's Al Qaeda
[03:35:15.920 --> 03:35:19.920]  You know, and the point is, is they introduce it first, it's the Muslims and it's everybody
[03:35:19.920 --> 03:35:21.920]  That's how tyrants work
[03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:23.920]  You know, I use the Hitler example a lot
[03:35:23.920 --> 03:35:25.920]  First, he went after unpopular minority groups
[03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:29.920]  Set the precedence and then it was a free-for-all going after everybody
[03:35:29.920 --> 03:35:35.920]  Bob Chapman, do you have any comments on that or the birth certificate issue before we go back to calls?
[03:35:35.920 --> 03:35:37.920]  No, I don't
[03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:42.920]  Let's talk to dangerous in California than J, Ed, JR and Chris
[03:35:42.920 --> 03:35:45.920]  We're getting into news, dangerous, you're on the air
[03:35:45.920 --> 03:35:49.920]  Hi Alex, hi Bob, how are you doing? Thank you for taking my call
[03:35:49.920 --> 03:35:50.920]  Thank you
[03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:54.920]  I wanted to talk, I wanted to bring up something, I don't think it's been mentioned on the program before
[03:35:54.920 --> 03:35:56.920]  It's perfect for Bob here
[03:35:56.920 --> 03:36:01.920]  It has to do with the central banking system and potentially one of the biggest threats to it
[03:36:01.920 --> 03:36:05.920]  And it's called Bitcoins and I was wondering if you were familiar with it
[03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:17.920]  It's a peer-to-peer encrypted digital currency that's inflation-proof and counterfeit-proof and control-proof
[03:36:17.920 --> 03:36:22.920]  But if it's inflation-proof, it's got to be then denominated into currencies
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:24.920]  Sorry Bob, go ahead
[03:36:24.920 --> 03:36:30.920]  How is it denominated? Dan, say, Alex's question
[03:36:30.920 --> 03:36:36.920]  Well, a certain amount of them are mined over a period of time through the computer network
[03:36:36.920 --> 03:36:40.920]  And they're the single...
[03:36:40.920 --> 03:36:44.920]  How do you buy them and begin with? How do you monetize them?
[03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:50.920]  There's a couple of exchanges currently, they're currently, they were 6 cents each only a few months ago
[03:36:50.920 --> 03:36:52.920]  Now they're trading it over 15, about...
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:56.920]  But see, then they're not inflation-proof, they're already inflating
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:36:58.920]  They're based on currencies
[03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:03.920]  But there's only a certain amount of them that can ever be mined and in a certain period of time
[03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:07.920]  That number will be mined and it won't be for a long time
[03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:09.920]  Only there's a...
[03:37:09.920 --> 03:37:15.920]  A lot of people are picking up on this, it's becoming extremely popular
[03:37:15.920 --> 03:37:19.920]  And a lot of people that are looking at it are saying, wow, this is really amazing
[03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:23.920]  This actually could be one of the biggest potential threats to the central banking system
[03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:28.920]  I've seen a lot of new alternative digital currencies out there, a lot of them actually put out by the establishment
[03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:33.920]  I might say that's what this is, I've heard the term before, how do you spell it?
[03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:39.920]  Bitcoin, B-I-T-C-O-I-N, like a digital bit
[03:37:39.920 --> 03:37:44.920]  And you can find out a lot more about it at forum.bitcoin.org
[03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:48.920]  And that's where most of the information and the people are discussing it, Tom
[03:37:48.920 --> 03:37:53.920]  There's been a lot of anti-Bitcoin propaganda in the news lately
[03:37:53.920 --> 03:37:57.920]  But as well, there's been some positive information that's been put out as well
[03:37:57.920 --> 03:38:02.920]  So I wanted to bring it to people's attention because it's definitely a good alternative
[03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:06.920]  And something that people should look into and I was wondering if you guys were familiar with it or not
[03:38:06.920 --> 03:38:09.920]  I'm familiar with digital, new digital competing private currencies
[03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:13.920]  I know they're even going after gold and things now that are original
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:18.920]  Hey Bob, what do you think of Bernanke saying gold is not money? That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:25.920]  Well, he had no other choice because if he said gold was money, then he would have to explain what the dollar was
[03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:29.920]  And that's a fiat currency produced by the Federal Reserve
[03:38:29.920 --> 03:38:33.920]  So he was between the rock and the hard place, so he had the lie
[03:38:33.920 --> 03:38:39.920]  Yeah, well listen, we'll look into the Bitcoin thing, I've heard of it before, I'm looking at bitcoin.org
[03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:42.920]  Right now we'll research it more, sir
[03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:44.920]  Alright, thank you very much
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:47.920]  Thank you so much, who's up next here, John?
[03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:50.920]  Jay and Missouri are on the air with Bob Chapman, go ahead
[03:38:50.920 --> 03:38:52.920]  Hey Bob, hey Alex, how you doing today?
[03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:53.920]  Good
[03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:57.920]  Yeah, first off, I gotta tell you, you are the news, Alex
[03:38:57.920 --> 03:39:03.920]  I mean, you had an eyewitness from Oslo within, you know, 12, 6 hours on the ground
[03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:08.920]  I mean, multi-million dollar operations out there can't compete with you, it's amazing
[03:39:08.920 --> 03:39:13.920]  Well, it's because we've got a great crew and great listeners everywhere, so thank you
[03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:14.920]  Most definitely
[03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:23.920]  Just an aside, personally, it was weird, I had a hack into my personal debit card over the last two days
[03:39:23.920 --> 03:39:30.920]  And the only transaction was from Oslo, Norway, which was very odd to me
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:39.920]  Just a crazy coincidence, and you know, I'm online at the AlexJonesInfoWars.com and all the sites
[03:39:39.920 --> 03:39:49.920]  And I don't know, I'll have to look into it a bit more, but I kind of freaked my bones out when it hit me with a terrorist attack in Oslo
[03:39:49.920 --> 03:39:54.920]  I had a question for you, and Bob, concerning the debt ceiling at home
[03:39:54.920 --> 03:40:01.920]  I haven't heard much coverage, Ron Paul did an interview, I believe, last week on Fox, where he basically stated that
[03:40:01.920 --> 03:40:09.920]  The Federal Reserve could technically write off the $1.6 trillion in U.S. Treasury that they've purchased
[03:40:09.920 --> 03:40:18.920]  Since it's kind of the revolving door circle of corruption, and we wouldn't have to raise the debt ceiling at all, and we, you know, wouldn't have to raise taxes
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:23.920]  But then they've bought them, the private banks have bought them, they wouldn't get that interest, correct, Bob Chapman?
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:30.920]  That's correct, but I think, you know, those are really asides
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:40.920]  What we have to get at here is the corruption in the banking system and the methods which they use to execute those things
[03:40:40.920 --> 03:40:50.920]  And the entire nature of the fiat system, that has to be changed, and that's really what Ron is after
[03:40:50.920 --> 03:40:58.920]  Well, look, as he said, and the Chinese have said, they've already been monetizing it for years, now it's what, 70-plus percent?
[03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:06.920]  Bob, some estimates over 80, so they're already devaluing it, as you said three or four months ago, you said he hasn't said they're not doing QE3
[03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:14.920]  They will do QE3, and so what does that signify? That's a good question right there as we start getting into monetary issues
[03:41:14.920 --> 03:41:23.920]  Well, what it means is that they can't stop until they are stopped, and the only thing that will stop them is hyperinflation
[03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:33.920]  And so we're kind of guaranteed that we have to head in that direction unless something really unusual happens, like credit unstalls or something like that
[03:41:33.920 --> 03:41:42.920]  But the point here is that they're going to go along and do what they want to do as long as they can, and if they can't extricate themselves
[03:41:42.920 --> 03:41:53.920]  Maybe they'll have another war or a series of wars, or maybe they'll try to dump the problem where they might be able to survive
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:42:00.920]  Because they started the whole thing by doing something like getting Ron Paul elected
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:07.920]  Well, I mean, at a certain point, what's happening is a lot of people that are high level in the power structure but aren't at the top elite level
[03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:16.920]  They realize that they're not going to be part of the top of the pyramid, and that the people running things really are a bunch of power tripping anti-human lunatics
[03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:21.920]  Who are so decadent and out of touch that they just hate humanity, and we need to get rid of these people
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:27.920]  I mean, we need to get them out of the power structure, we need to lock them up, we need to write off all the fraud they've created
[03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:36.920]  Instead of them wetting us to their fraud, I mean, their system is a post-industrial world and they've come to terms with their parasitic system
[03:42:36.920 --> 03:42:44.920]  If it's good what they're doing to society and that wrecking things and creating poverty is some type of favor to humanity
[03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:52.920]  And there is a group mind, a collective mind, in that a lot of people who are corrupt still care about their children at a certain level
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:43:01.920]  And we've got to have a change, and the globalists more and more, as I've said in the last three years, are not as arrogant as they used to be
[03:43:01.920 --> 03:43:08.920]  That's why they're trying to hide and play in view now, be more and more open, you know, they tried to deny this stuff was going on before
[03:43:08.920 --> 03:43:13.920]  Now that it's there, they're just trying to kind of flood us with the info now, hoping we just become acclimated
[03:43:13.920 --> 03:43:20.920]  But I don't see that happening, Bob, I mean, I just, I don't see things going well for the New World order crowd
[03:43:20.920 --> 03:43:26.920]  Well, as you said about a month ago, we're breathing down their collar and they don't know what to do about it
[03:43:26.920 --> 03:43:33.920]  And every day something happens in my world with my publication and all the programs I'm on
[03:43:33.920 --> 03:43:42.920]  Something new comes up that shows me that we're really, really getting close to them and turning this thing around
[03:43:42.920 --> 03:43:49.920]  What'll happen to make that happen? I don't know as yet, but we are being extremely successful
[03:43:49.920 --> 03:43:56.920]  And by the way, you know their mega ace in the hole is stage terror attacks so they can run around in grandstand in Fairmonger
[03:43:56.920 --> 03:44:03.920]  But now every event, my listeners, it keeps being my listeners, it's kind of a creepy power we have
[03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:08.920]  I don't like this much power, folks, I don't like being this much in the spotlight, but I guess the danger is the safety
[03:44:08.920 --> 03:44:14.920]  You know, it's both dangerous and the prayers are important, but it's also a measure that we're so public
[03:44:14.920 --> 03:44:19.920]  But whether it's Oslo or 777, whatever it is, or underwear bombing, whatever
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:25.920]  We have eyewitnesses now that turn out to be accurate and real months before it's finally forced down
[03:44:25.920 --> 03:44:32.920]  And so the message of the globalist is we've got military, we've got police, we've got bureaucrats, we've got general citizens
[03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:38.920]  We've got the street sweepers, we've got the school teachers, we've got the auto mechanics, we've got the hot dogs stand guy
[03:44:38.920 --> 03:44:45.920]  We've got everybody and they're watching and now they can't just stage an event and put out their official story now
[03:44:45.920 --> 03:44:49.920]  And you know, do it in a shoddy way, they know we're watching
[03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:55.920]  And that's really freaking them out and they can't prop up their false flag terror paradigm anymore
[03:44:55.920 --> 03:45:00.920]  They keep trying to counter 9-11 truth and things, but all that does is get more people to look into it
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:05.920]  You know, it's like George Washington, he said, look, we're losing these battles, but we're going to wear them out
[03:45:05.920 --> 03:45:16.920]  As long as we keep fighting in the long run, it's like in THX 1138 when the police state agents are, you know, following, you know, the
[03:45:16.920 --> 03:45:22.920]  Savoyd slave worker and Robert DeValls climbing towards the surface into the superstructure
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:30.920]  And it's under an economic system and the police get a call, we're over budget, you got to break off the, you know, the pursuit
[03:45:30.920 --> 03:45:35.920]  They had to give up no matter how much fake money they've got once we're aware of the fraud and call it
[03:45:35.920 --> 03:45:43.920]  And once we all just start sabotaging them with the truth at every little level, none of us have to charge them head on
[03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:47.920]  Like Bob and I have been doing as an example, sure, you'll really hurt them that way
[03:45:47.920 --> 03:45:51.920]  But you don't have to stab deep each time, just a little cut, cut, cut
[03:45:51.920 --> 03:45:56.920]  And just a little cut and sneak up a little mosquito bite like a bunch of bees stinging them
[03:45:56.920 --> 03:46:02.920]  And just get your sting in, get your sting in and just keep hitting them, hitting them, hitting them, hitting them, discrediting them
[03:46:02.920 --> 03:46:05.920]  And never stopping, you know, I get all these calls and see these emails, Bob
[03:46:05.920 --> 03:46:08.920]  I want you to speak to this and we're going to hit some other news and go to calls
[03:46:08.920 --> 03:46:15.920]  But constantly, over and over and over again, I see people on YouTube and Google and most of them are operatives
[03:46:15.920 --> 03:46:19.920]  But some are, you know, just idiots who don't believe in their own power
[03:46:19.920 --> 03:46:23.920]  Alex couldn't be real, he couldn't be this successful, he couldn't still be alive
[03:46:23.920 --> 03:46:26.920]  You know, humanity's powerless, we can't do anything
[03:46:26.920 --> 03:46:32.920]  When history shows humanity is power, that's why the system teaches us we don't have power because a small group's taken over
[03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:42.920]  They know that because a small group, like them took over for bad, a small group can wake folks up
[03:46:42.920 --> 03:46:48.920]  And 30 years ago, sure, they tried to plant hand grenades in your house because there weren't many Bob Chapmans then
[03:46:48.920 --> 03:46:54.920]  They used to kill people routinely and they still do, but now this idea, this idea that's bulletproof is so prolific
[03:46:54.920 --> 03:46:58.920]  That they can't get us all, they don't want to turn us into martyrs now
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:03.920]  We're gaining the momentum, as Brzezinski said, as Hillary said, they're losing the Info War
[03:47:03.920 --> 03:47:07.920]  Folks, believe in victory, believe in resistance, it is victory
[03:47:07.920 --> 03:47:11.920]  Well, I've got some breaking news in a moment, Bob, but I want you to comment on that
[03:47:11.920 --> 03:47:21.920]  All I can say is that I get stories, probably once a week now, of things happening that I never expected to happen
[03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:28.920]  That wasn't too long ago, I got a phone call on one of the shows from someone who worked in the State Department
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:36.920]  It says that your publication, the minute it's produced, not only goes to anybody in the Beltway that wants it
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:44.920]  And the most plagiarized around, it goes to all the embassies and councilates and from there, goodness knows where it goes to
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:52.920]  I say that because I want people to understand that this message is getting out all over the world
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:57.920]  It's not only Americans who are helping here, it's humanity
[03:47:57.920 --> 03:48:03.920]  Absolutely, same thing on our front, and that worries the system, they can't pull their games
[03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:12.920]  Now, you notice more evidence this thing in Norway has staged in Oslo, WikiLeaks constantly putting out echo chamber propaganda
[03:48:12.920 --> 03:48:17.920]  They have a few jewels in there to shell the poison, the candy coating
[03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:25.920]  But conveniently, with George Soros of course funding it, WikiLeaks files show Norway unprepared for terror attack
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:32.920]  Norway's intelligence service had previously been criticized for its failure to keep track of suspected terror cells
[03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:40.920]  And the country was felt to be complacent about the prospect of terror attack, secret cables from WikiLeaks files reveals
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:46.920]  This is just out today from the line of telegraph, how convenient is that Bob?
[03:48:46.920 --> 03:48:50.920]  See, you guys didn't have a police state, well now you'll learn
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:58.920]  They do what they want to do as long as they're in control and we're going to take control away from them by letting the people know what they're doing
[03:48:58.920 --> 03:49:11.920]  Absolutely, well said Bob Chapman, I want to tell folks that I will be live this Sunday 4-6pm, but I'll also be updating the YouTube channel with these little upload blurbs that had 5 of them yesterday
[03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:17.920]  Throughout the weekend as things develop, and then we'll be posting those on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[03:49:17.920 --> 03:49:23.920]  And I also want to add here that they do have the technology set, we do have it, we're building the pages
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:31.920]  I wanted it to be this week, it should be next week, we're hired even more IT guys, my whole crew is great, they work on average 60 hours a week
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:40.920]  But we are going to have, instead of the YouTube, these live updates are going to be daily, sometimes multiple times daily including special reports, not just the new TV show
[03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:46.920]  For myself, Paul Watson, Aaron Dykes and others, to prisonplanet.tv on a page
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:49.920]  We're doing that because YouTube can't be trusted and has been trying to shut us down
[03:49:49.920 --> 03:49:56.920]  So you'll still get a lot at the YouTube page for free, but the subscribers will get that immediate development and intelligence
[03:49:56.920 --> 03:50:01.920]  People are shocked and I'm uploading stuff at 2 o'clock at night, I've always done research till 1-2 at night
[03:50:01.920 --> 03:50:08.920]  Just now I'm there shooting videos of myself while I do research, this is full spectrum analysis that we're engaged in
[03:50:08.920 --> 03:50:16.920]  And once you get addicted to reality, you cannot ever go back to the sitcoms and the dramas and the garbage, Bob Chapman
[03:50:16.920 --> 03:50:22.920]  I've got the same experience, my wife tells me what's on the news because I never watch it
[03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:28.920]  Well, it's just incredible the amount of great intel we get from our listeners as well
[03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:32.920]  I want to come back and jam in a few calls from Ed J, our Chris Garrett, Steve if we can
[03:50:32.920 --> 03:50:42.920]  It's all coming up, and of course I'll be back with us, Lord Will and next Friday, but I'll be back this Sunday, 4-6pm, back next Monday, 11am central
[03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:47.920]  And if more terror attacks start popping up, more soft target hits, over the weekend
[03:50:47.920 --> 03:50:54.920]  We'll come in here and do a special report, watchinfullwars.com and the guest area to know if we're doing a special report at PrismPlanet.tv
[03:50:54.920 --> 03:51:00.920]  We'll be right back for the final segment of this special 4-hour transmission, Chair Oslo

[03:53:06.920 --> 03:53:12.920]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away
[03:53:12.920 --> 03:53:17.920]  Number one, study the past. History really does repeat itself
[03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:21.920]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends
[03:53:21.920 --> 03:53:29.920]  Number three, take decisive action. A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis
[03:53:29.920 --> 03:53:34.920]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves
[03:53:34.920 --> 03:53:38.920]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history

[03:53:59.920 --> 03:54:12.920]  Well, it looks like they're gonna go with white al-Qaeda or white terrorist period
[03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:14.920]  You claim they're right-wingers or whatever
[03:54:14.920 --> 03:54:18.920]  And they're in Reuters saying the whities are working with al-Qaeda now
[03:54:18.920 --> 03:54:23.920]  I mean, this is all you good old boys that love giving up freedoms because it's only for them brown people
[03:54:23.920 --> 03:54:28.920]  You're gonna find out it's for everybody. What's done to any group is gonna end up being done to everybody
[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:31.920]  That's why we all hang together or surely hang separate
[03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:36.920]  Ed in Arizona, you're on the air with Bob Shatner and Alex Jones. Go ahead
[03:54:36.920 --> 03:54:44.920]  Hi, Alex and Bob. I wanted to let you guys know that the telegraph has reported that Jen Stoltenberg, the prime minister of Norway
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:49.920]  Had at one point been scheduled to attend the event on Utoya Island, which was a rally for his labor party
[03:54:49.920 --> 03:54:53.920]  But he did not go for, quote, some reason
[03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:58.920]  Very suspicious. I'm sure that's already on prison planet. That is big news
[03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:01.920]  What's the headline so I can pull it up?
[03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:06.920]  Well, this is just a live coverage at the Telegraph Oslo Explosion live coverage
[03:55:06.920 --> 03:55:11.920]  And it reminded me you reported a 9-11 certain key people did not go on
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:17.920]  ABC News, the Joint Chiefs of Staff canceled trip week before on 9-11 to New York
[03:55:17.920 --> 03:55:21.920]  And Mayor Willie Brown was warned not to fly the morning of September 11th to New York
[03:55:21.920 --> 03:55:25.920]  He was warned the night before. San Francisco Chronicle
[03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:30.920]  I got to this link simply through the dredge report. It's just a live coverage at telegraph.co.uk
[03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:34.920]  That the prime minister did just for some reason did not show up, just some magical
[03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:40.920]  Okay, I see live coverage, BBC Reuters. Where is the telegraph live coverage?
[03:55:40.920 --> 03:55:45.920]  It just, let me go, if you go to the dredge report, it was the top link, let me go there
[03:55:45.920 --> 03:55:50.920]  It's Oslo Explosion live coverage, the telegraph.co.uk
[03:55:50.920 --> 03:55:56.920]  I got to hit refresh, it's not on mine. Well, I'll call Watson, we'll get that up
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:56:02.920]  on infowars.com. Well, isn't that just magic, Bob Chapman, that the
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:08.920]  that the prime minister was targeted at his quote,
[03:56:08.920 --> 03:56:12.920]  office on a day he wasn't going to be there, and the island where he was at
[03:56:12.920 --> 03:56:18.920]  This could this be some kind of EU attempted coup too? I mean, what is this?
[03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:23.920]  Well, I'm looking at the other side, I always try to balance things
[03:56:23.920 --> 03:56:29.920]  and maybe the gunman was there to kill him.
[03:56:29.920 --> 03:56:34.920]  I mean, we don't know. Then why would the gunman shoot and kill 25 people?
[03:56:34.920 --> 03:56:39.920]  Probably because he was told to make a major incident.
[03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:45.920]  He looked at what happened in Tucson. They shot several people.
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:49.920]  It's the same thing there. You shoot several people.
[03:56:49.920 --> 03:56:53.920]  The PM happens to be there when you do him too.
[03:56:53.920 --> 03:56:57.920]  Because that's one of your prime targets, if not the prime target.
[03:56:57.920 --> 03:57:01.920]  So it could go either way.
[03:57:01.920 --> 03:57:07.920]  Well, that's big news. Sir, I'm at the telegraph and I don't see that link on the dredge.
[03:57:07.920 --> 03:57:10.920]  What is it? Their live news feed?
[03:57:10.920 --> 03:57:16.920]  Yeah, it's telegraph.co.uk and then Oslo explosion live coverage.
[03:57:16.920 --> 03:57:22.920]  I see Norway at 2X7 dead in Oslo, nine dead. Where is it?
[03:57:22.920 --> 03:57:26.920]  Well, I got it from the dredge for like half an hour ago, so they could have changed it since then.
[03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:30.920]  Alright, thank you so much. I appreciate that call.
[03:57:30.920 --> 03:57:33.920]  That is, this is really starting to stink to high heaven.
[03:57:33.920 --> 03:57:35.920]  I'll continue to track it. Thank you, Ed.
[03:57:35.920 --> 03:57:39.920]  JR in Ohio, last caller, sorry to the others.
[03:57:39.920 --> 03:57:43.920]  What's your take on all this, JR?
[03:57:43.920 --> 03:57:47.920]  Yeah, first time caller. It's an honor to talk to yourself and Mr. Chapman.
[03:57:47.920 --> 03:57:50.920]  I just had an observation that I wanted to point out.
[03:57:50.920 --> 03:57:55.920]  Hillary Clinton, the outfit that she's wearing today in Bali, Indonesia,
[03:57:55.920 --> 03:58:00.920]  she's wearing the same outfit in the Greta Van Susteren interview where she said that we,
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:05.920]  the U.S. funded and created the Mujahideen, which became Al Qaeda.
[03:58:05.920 --> 03:58:10.920]  I don't know what that means, but I know he's a leader into the occult, so I just wanted to point that out.
[03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:14.920]  Yeah, it might be just a coincidence, but it could be something with these fruit cakes.
[03:58:14.920 --> 03:58:19.920]  Thank you so much. I will continue to track all of this throughout the weekend at prismplanet.com
[03:58:19.920 --> 03:58:23.920]  and prismplanet.tv and, of course, mfolwars.com will be doing live video reports.
[03:58:23.920 --> 03:58:26.920]  Great job. Great week to the crew.
[03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:31.920]  I'm going to go now and work on the TV show development that we're going to launch
[03:58:31.920 --> 03:58:36.920]  on 1st of September at 7 p.m. nightly at prismplanet.tv
[03:58:36.920 --> 03:59:02.920]  and we'll continue to track all of this. Thank you, Bob Chapman.
