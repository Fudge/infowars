[00:47.480 --> 00:56.120]  a home visit on national TV live this morning senator Spector would bow his arms out and
[00:56.120 --> 01:02.040]  getting people's faces that disagreed with with him while he was lying to them and then one
[01:02.040 --> 01:08.000]  old man gets up and says I'm sick of your lies so a big thug twice a size jumps up grabs him
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.880]  starts shoving him into the aisle the videos of them beating up women beating up men punching

[02:39.900 --> 02:46.920]  homes there's no death education with a dignity and dying counselor by law for all seniors

[03:03.240 --> 03:07.000]  up and lie and say there's none of that in the bill and the people stand up with the
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.560]  bills and say here it is in subsection this this and that and then specter goes okay well
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.000]  I don't support that but he supports the bill and the people are getting mad they're tired
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.560]  of going to meetings and having some criminals that they're in line to him look the globalist
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.560]  in agenda 21 in the sustainability treaty in the cap and trade treaty in the global

[03:53.280 --> 03:58.320]  mortgage and then really they said oh the law changes it where your interest rates 30%
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.240]  now and where you can't declare bankruptcy like you could before and where you can basically
[04:03.240 --> 04:06.920]  go to debtor's prison and you can't fly if you've got got bad credit and can't have a
[04:06.920 --> 04:14.600]  job if you got bad credit and we give 23.7 trillion and growing to foreign banks and
[04:14.600 --> 04:20.920]  then they give you no bailout they don't even give you a loan just like health care there's
[04:20.920 --> 04:26.680]  this is liability protection for the insurance companies and the banks that own them so you're

[08:05.240 --> 08:25.160]  on the gcn radio network we're gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv in the second third and fourth
[08:25.160 --> 08:34.040]  hour today we've got webster griffin tarbly popping in in the third hour because he predicted a year
[08:34.040 --> 08:41.560]  and a half ago that obama was going to play the race card that he was being put into office
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.840]  to energize racial division and if you didn't go along with the corporate takeover of the united
[08:46.840 --> 08:52.600]  states you would be called a racist and again i've read the book we sell both of them now
[08:54.120 --> 08:58.280]  and you know i respected like tarbly but i thought this is hard to believe i mean that
[08:58.280 --> 09:03.560]  that obama is really this bad i mean i knew that he was going to be bad because he's a puppet and
[09:03.560 --> 09:10.600]  financed by the big money and the establishment was behind him but uh to imagine that they they
[09:10.600 --> 09:22.680]  are now saying on cnbc cnn msnbc abc news cbs news i jogged for 45 minutes on the treadmill
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.440]  this morning and flipped around through all the channels and every channel was parroting except
[09:28.440 --> 09:38.600]  for fox was parroting that you are a racist if you use the word socialist now remember newsweek
[09:39.320 --> 09:45.880]  told us six months ago that we're all socialists now with that famous headline and cover with the
[09:46.440 --> 09:52.520]  red hand and the blue hand shaking hands the message was socialism will save the economy
[09:52.520 --> 09:59.320]  i guess that was actually eight months ago that was in but december
[10:01.800 --> 10:12.040]  wasn't it but um i mean this they know cold bloodedly this has no foundation in reality
[10:12.040 --> 10:24.680]  they do it cold bloodedly took to ignite a race debate and to cause a race war that may be their
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.960]  false flag is to try to get some type of riots going in this country
[10:33.000 --> 10:33.960]  in fact the last
[10:33.960 --> 10:41.560]  five six seven eight times i know it's more than five or six times the last few months
[10:42.120 --> 10:48.200]  where at universities people are spray painting swastikas or making racist phone calls to black
[10:48.200 --> 10:53.800]  organizations they've all been caught staging it and this black congressman i saw in the news this
[10:53.800 --> 10:59.000]  morning about who's in all this trouble for screaming people down at town halls suddenly
[10:59.000 --> 11:07.640]  somebody painted a swastika at his office gee i wonder who did it 90 chance one of his constituents
[11:07.640 --> 11:14.120]  did it to give him cover he may not have even been involved but my money is on it being staged
[11:16.760 --> 11:24.120]  i mean nine times out of ten it is or it's some methamphetamine white trash person who's got like
[11:24.120 --> 11:31.000]  one tooth uh who the feds buy drinks for at the bar and say let's take over america let's
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.840]  go after the white house and the guy goes yeah let's do it and it comes out in court every
[11:36.840 --> 11:41.160]  time that it was just totally made up and they find some mentally ill person to say it
[11:45.320 --> 11:51.880]  they want us fighting with each other and it is so despicable i mean chris mathews every night
[11:51.880 --> 11:58.760]  says it hall watson's posting three or four clips i see and i'm not even reading all the prison
[11:58.760 --> 12:09.720]  plan and i'm so busy three or four clips a day with them saying you are racist period
[12:09.720 --> 12:21.240]  if you oppose anything that obama is pushing through
[12:25.240 --> 12:30.920]  it doesn't matter if on gun control they say these are racist lies made up because people
[12:30.920 --> 12:36.280]  don't like our black president as they have 15 separate bills last time i counted them up
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.960]  that are each one of them the most draconian gun bill ever seen compared to previous gun
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.240]  legislation anti-gun legislation and we've read them all on air and written articles and had
[12:47.240 --> 12:53.400]  governors of america on and it's just off the charts bad though the attorney general can ban
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.560]  any guns he wants with the stroke of a pen it's giving him the dictatorial power to ban whatever
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.280]  he wants and so they sit there and say your liars no such thing exists just like the new
[13:02.280 --> 13:07.560]  talking point the last week is there is no health care bill so why are you complaining
[13:08.120 --> 13:13.160]  and the people go to these meetings and they they have the bill and the printouts and the
[13:13.160 --> 13:22.840]  synopsis in their hands and they get mad and in pennsylvania with our inspector today i watched
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.520]  30 minutes of the hour long situation i saw it happen live
[13:28.520 --> 13:34.040]  live where they started manhandling some old man because he was told come to the town hall
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.680]  he'll be able to speak he gets there our inspector just talks at him telling him there's none of
[13:38.680 --> 13:45.400]  this there's no rationing care there's no lying and i'm sitting there getting hot while i'm jogging
[13:45.400 --> 13:49.800]  on the treadmill tell you really helped me put the treadmill up to like level eight and really
[13:49.800 --> 13:56.840]  start running i was getting so mad so just jogging at level six and i'm sitting there getting mad
[13:56.840 --> 14:01.240]  and people you could see him wiggling around in their chairs getting mad you can see black people
[14:01.240 --> 14:03.960]  wiggling around in their chairs getting mad you can see them yelling at him
[14:05.080 --> 14:08.600]  you know sitting there mumbling see i mean people know this is a scam they know whatever the
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.440]  government does is for some foreign corporation to rip us off the insurance companies are actually
[14:14.440 --> 14:20.760]  behind all this see the federal reserve in 1913 ran ads in newspapers saying they were against
[14:20.760 --> 14:26.440]  the federal reserve act trying to fool people and people didn't get fooled then they still
[14:26.440 --> 14:33.400]  passed it in a quorum without a quorum on two nights before uh it was actually the night before
[14:33.400 --> 14:38.680]  christmas when all through the house on a creature was stirring with three senators
[14:41.800 --> 14:48.760]  and along came the wicked grinch this wasn't a visit from Santa Claus and it's the same tricks
[14:48.760 --> 14:54.520]  they sit there and say oh big insurance companies they don't want this are you kidding this is just
[14:54.520 --> 15:08.040]  like the banker bailout they swore and they promised and they guaranteed that it was going to fix
[15:08.040 --> 15:11.960]  your mortgage you know just a small amount of mortgages that were in trouble and we looked at
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.360]  it said folks it isn't even mortgages that are in trouble the banks just aren't lending this is
[15:16.360 --> 15:21.480]  about derivatives and they're going to actually hoard the money and freeze the money and not use
[15:21.480 --> 15:26.200]  it to pay for the mortgages to get the markets going again and you notice it's now come out in
[15:26.200 --> 15:36.920]  congress and they admit that the federal reserve paid banks not to lend
[15:36.920 --> 15:52.840]  so it's just basically everything is a lie i was watching cnn it was all deception
[15:52.840 --> 15:57.080]  they had some british guy on there this morning about how we need socialized health care like
[15:57.080 --> 16:02.120]  england at some clinic for the homeless implying that people that need medical care aren't taking
[16:02.120 --> 16:09.080]  care of it's just citizens aren't told that my law everything is paid for through the charity system
[16:09.640 --> 16:15.320]  through the state laws the illegal aliens know that that's why they line up and get the full care
[16:16.040 --> 16:20.440]  and so yeah they they they turn away ignorant u.s citizens i've had people in my office
[16:21.640 --> 16:26.280]  were seriously debilitating things they need serious surgeries one of them crone's disease
[16:26.280 --> 16:31.880]  and he didn't believe me we got in a big argument as he was literally you know even
[16:31.880 --> 16:36.840]  when he'd had insurance it was fake insurance and they wouldn't pay for his is what he had
[16:36.840 --> 16:39.320]  was you know one of these things where you pay for it and you get an aspirin
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.480]  and i explained i said look my dad's an oral surgeon and a dentist i know these rules and
[16:45.480 --> 16:51.080]  i explained it and i got on the phone with the austin doctors and we ended up getting the best
[16:51.080 --> 16:59.720]  doctor in new york city 50 plus thousand dollar medical care surgery intestines removed and he's
[16:59.720 --> 17:05.240]  98 percent better four years later and he didn't believe me when i told him i said no that they
[17:05.240 --> 17:10.760]  will do it all doctors are supposed to do a third of their medical care for free
[17:12.600 --> 17:18.200]  that's the Hippocratic oath and that's why you've got the brother of the white house chief of staff
[17:18.200 --> 17:24.280]  mr. Emanuel on tv saying we need to get rid of the Hippocratic oath which they don't give anymore
[17:24.280 --> 17:30.520]  because this is about doctors and the insurance companies not having liability and they got
[17:30.520 --> 17:35.320]  all these stupid dumb people i mean maybe 10 percent of the public like they have with the
[17:35.320 --> 17:40.360]  banker bailout and maybe that much who they put on the news going i want free health care i want
[17:40.360 --> 17:46.200]  my i want my mortgage paid for you're not gonna get any good health care out of this they're just
[17:46.200 --> 17:50.600]  going to take over the good health care that was there for people and take more out everybody's
[17:50.600 --> 17:54.760]  checks let me ask you this when you lose your job do you get the six months of unemployment
[17:54.760 --> 17:58.360]  insurance you're supposed to get that you and the employer been paying in for four years
[17:59.640 --> 18:05.560]  no you don't get it you don't get it everybody i know i don't even challenge people we have to
[18:05.560 --> 18:10.840]  let go here they're unemployment and they get it for a month or so and then the government kicks
[18:10.840 --> 18:20.040]  them off of it if they even get that you're not gonna get it that's that's what this is all about
[18:20.040 --> 18:24.200]  you understand that you're not getting anything you paid in all you're getting is a boot stomping
[18:24.200 --> 18:35.320]  on your face it all goes to the offshore banks now and these pimps these race pimps that's what
[18:35.320 --> 18:40.840]  obama did was run racial strife and infighting in chicago to keep everybody under control
[18:40.840 --> 18:44.360]  that's what the annenberg foundation is what the bill and melinda gates foundation do
[18:44.360 --> 18:50.280]  do you can ask tarply about this you wrote two books on it he's an expert he's absolutely right
[18:50.280 --> 18:54.440]  i've since reverse engineered what he wrote and he's he's it's right it's accurate you gotta buy
[18:54.440 --> 18:59.160]  the two books he wrote about obama and info wars dot com learn how to read and learn how this works
[19:01.880 --> 19:07.000]  these people don't want us getting along that's how chicago in new york and la work

[25:19.400 --> 25:21.400]  It's illegitimate it's rogue
[25:23.840 --> 25:26.240]  It's controlled by foreign offshore banks
[25:26.240 --> 25:34.000]  And they're not backing off they're not quitting they think they broke in our spirit
[25:38.840 --> 25:40.840]  They think they're gonna win and they're gonna fail
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.600]  Okay, look next segment I'm going to your phone calls 1-800-259-9231
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna be honest with you. I read I
[25:53.440 --> 26:00.640]  Don't know five or six in the last couple months different subsections of different versions of the bill as it went through committee
[26:01.640 --> 26:04.920]  And I read sections from Bloomberg on air of
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.480]  Dashel's book where he said yeah, if you're over 60 you don't deserve health care the young dude
[26:10.480 --> 26:13.840]  You know the rationing and how they're gonna force you to
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.080]  Take money out of your check and fine you
[26:17.080 --> 26:22.840]  But I have in the last two days actually gotten into the latest bill what s3
[26:23.400 --> 26:25.400]  220
[26:25.400 --> 26:31.240]  I even printed it off and then of course left it in the printer at home this morning. I was highlighting it parts of it
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.360]  But I do have some of the subsections and and ladies and gentlemen, it's worse than I was even saying see while we're busy debating
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.520]  Whether or not there's even a health care bill cuz I'm sure you've seen that on the news seen it in the web post
[26:44.520 --> 26:49.520]  Why are you guys complaining? There's not even a bill to read shut up when we have the bills
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.160]  Just like when they're burning down Waco. They're saying this is not an assault. This is not an assault
[26:54.160 --> 26:58.760]  You know, there are no gun control bills. There is no cap and trade bill. I mean, I've got Rothschild
[26:59.480 --> 27:04.160]  Air to the Rothschild fortune in in-game saying there's no plan for a cap and trade tax
[27:04.160 --> 27:07.880]  And then two and a half years later, they've passed it in the house. I mean
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.240]  They will never seem safe at Private Ryan and you know, that's really based on a kind of a
[27:13.240 --> 27:15.240]  combo of different true stories
[27:16.960 --> 27:23.560]  When they're fighting hand-to-hand in a bombed-out building and one of the American soldiers
[27:25.480 --> 27:27.480]  Is winning and has the momentum
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.440]  To stab
[27:31.440 --> 27:33.040]  the German
[27:33.040 --> 27:38.960]  They both got knives at each other and the Germans is oh, no, no, I'm your friend stop. We're friends and
[27:38.960 --> 27:46.920]  As soon as the guy gives up for a second the German just slides the knife right into him. That is a military tactic
[27:47.760 --> 27:55.040]  World War one they'll broadcast stand down the war is over. We're friends truce and then just open up on you and
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.920]  That's what they do and so we're always so busy just debating going no
[27:59.920 --> 28:05.080]  No, they really are trying to pass a health care bill and it really does have this and they really are trying to pass a cap and trade and their
[28:05.080 --> 28:10.520]  Own documents say it'll double energy prices and they really are saying it's the shut-down industry. I mean
[28:11.560 --> 28:16.240]  I've got the quotes from 96 on C-span. We've been grabbing all this for the film of
[28:17.240 --> 28:22.880]  Holdren saying we want to shut down US industry. I really have Maury strong at the
[28:24.360 --> 28:30.240]  92 Rio de Janeiro UN summit saying we've got a shut-down US industry to bring in world government
[28:30.240 --> 28:35.080]  Folks, this is real. I mean this isn't a game and
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.800]  Still so much of the public was told there is no world government. There is no bank of the world
[28:40.800 --> 28:46.460]  There is no plan for carbon tax. So I'm still trying to get these stupid yuppies up off their big fat butts
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.440]  To just understand. Yes, there is a world government. Yes, it's run by eugenicist
[28:52.440 --> 28:56.800]  And then the whole health care bill is about how you're gonna get CPS visits at your house
[28:56.800 --> 29:03.480]  I told you that months ago. The whole health care bill is about how seniors get end-of-life death education
[29:03.480 --> 29:05.480]  That's finally mainstream news today
[29:06.600 --> 29:13.120]  But I'm finding sections I can't even believe I can't even believe this in England
[29:15.320 --> 29:18.760]  22,000 homes when you have a baby cameras go in your home
[29:19.360 --> 29:21.360]  Guilty first until you're proven innocent
[29:21.360 --> 29:29.040]  Anything's wrong, baby cries too much CPS takes your kids. They're raising dormitories. That's in eco science
[29:29.400 --> 29:35.240]  White House wants it. Guess what? It's in the bill. It's in the bill. It's in the bill for America
[29:35.240 --> 29:41.520]  We're all getting in viral carbon tax police CPS senior visits
[29:41.520 --> 29:48.600]  They're gonna come and take you in a white van in euthanasia. They are the Soviets. They mean business. They are murderers
[29:48.600 --> 29:57.460]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.440 --> 30:03.240]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions
[30:03.240 --> 30:06.920]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle in a sidearm
[30:06.920 --> 30:13.880]  How much ammunition do you want my answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[30:13.880 --> 30:20.000]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.400]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.400 --> 30:28.760]  Will there be any food will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[30:28.760 --> 30:34.760]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply?
[30:34.920 --> 30:40.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know

[31:00.800 --> 31:03.840]  In the New World Order's war against humanity
[31:04.480 --> 31:06.480]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[31:06.960 --> 31:09.840]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of
[31:09.840 --> 31:14.440]  World Order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception
[31:14.720 --> 31:21.520]  Completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging
[31:21.520 --> 31:28.120]  Yeah, but since day one of this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[31:28.120 --> 31:35.040]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs? That's fascism
[31:35.040 --> 31:44.360]  It's not about left-to-right. It's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the lies
[31:44.360 --> 31:46.680]  He is told and his real agenda
[31:47.360 --> 31:55.400]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at info wars.com or downloaded the super high quality at present planet TV
[31:55.560 --> 31:58.680]  The Obama deception the people strike back
[31:58.680 --> 32:05.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[32:05.840 --> 32:10.680]  Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[32:10.680 --> 32:16.280]  It's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[32:16.280 --> 32:21.320]  So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[32:21.320 --> 32:27.880]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[32:27.880 --> 32:34.120]  Nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[32:34.120 --> 32:37.880]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[32:37.880 --> 32:47.440]  So visit them today at survival seed bank comm that's survival seed bank comm or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[32:47.760 --> 32:51.720]  That's 877-327-0365
[32:51.720 --> 32:59.560]  Remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survival seed bank comm
[32:59.560 --> 33:25.720]  Ladies and gentlemen these control freaks want in your house. They want to get their hands on your kids
[33:25.720 --> 33:32.880]  They want to kill old people dead or in a hammer. That isn't rhetoric. We know what they do in Europe
[33:33.520 --> 33:40.920]  We know that they time magazine had an article in an issue. Hold on. It's right here
[33:41.960 --> 33:44.480]  Just randomly in my parents two weeks ago
[33:46.240 --> 33:51.640]  And I pick up time magazine Nancy Gibbs last article in it August 3rd
[33:51.640 --> 34:00.000]  2009 first thing I open up is the grim reaper and it says an elderly British couple suicide pack is beautifully romantic
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.400]  Act oh, it's so romantic and then I randomly turn on drudge report that night when I get home
[34:06.400 --> 34:08.880]  And there's an article about how they're killing people in Oregon
[34:09.760 --> 34:11.760]  Who don't even want it?
[34:11.760 --> 34:18.280]  And I remember the Wesley Smith articles in the Wall Street Journal years ago where he would go where the people were under government
[34:18.280 --> 34:23.960]  control when the government was the guardian and they would be begging talking begging for food and water and they would say no
[34:23.960 --> 34:28.520]  You're paralyzed. We're gonna kill you like Robert Wendland. They murder people every day
[34:28.520 --> 34:36.240]  But the stupid moron public dumber than dirt that sucks their thumb each cheeseburgers drinks beer and watches TV all day
[34:36.240 --> 34:38.240]  while gobbling Prozac and
[34:38.480 --> 34:42.160]  Watching porno movies has no idea what's going on
[34:42.160 --> 34:47.200]  And in this stinking article it goes oh well in Europe
[34:47.200 --> 34:54.160]  It's showing a large percentage of old people are killed without their will by the government and that doctors decide to kill you
[34:55.240 --> 34:57.240]  Is this good?
[34:57.560 --> 35:02.320]  They go oh, we know it's beautiful that these old people killed themselves even though one of them wasn't sick
[35:02.440 --> 35:04.440]  We know that's beautiful
[35:04.640 --> 35:07.720]  See they said a false dichotomy. Oh, we know that's beautiful
[35:07.720 --> 35:15.480]  But see as if everybody's for that, but should the doctors kill you? I mean read it for yourself
[35:17.360 --> 35:19.920]  Every day there's articles in the New York Times
[35:19.920 --> 35:25.720]  I mean every day saying families are bad and kids are bad you understand a couple years ago
[35:25.720 --> 35:31.280]  I got on air and I said I remember a textbook I covered on TV where they said the family belongs to the age of barbarism
[35:31.280 --> 35:37.320]  It must be eradicated and all families are bad and all parents are mentally ill and I got these callers saying I was a liar
[35:37.320 --> 35:41.560]  So people went crazy on the prisonplanet.com forum and posted
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.960]  Scores, I mean it had to be more than 50. I quit counting
[35:45.360 --> 35:52.360]  Textbooks and links where the government says this look. I know it's crazy. Okay. I'm not the one that writes this stuff
[35:52.360 --> 35:56.680]  I'm not the one running things. All I know is these bastards got to be stopped
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.380]  China signed a treaty with the UN and the United States in
[36:02.380 --> 36:08.180]  1975 to set up the one-child policy and taking the kids and raising them in dormitories. I
[36:09.020 --> 36:12.020]  mean this stinking stuff came from us and
[36:13.580 --> 36:15.580]  England is now implementing it
[36:16.140 --> 36:23.060]  They're now doing it. They're now taking upwards of 15% of the kids and raising them from birth and government facilities
[36:23.580 --> 36:25.580]  And what do they do in England and here?
[36:26.100 --> 36:30.800]  68% and growing they put on more than seven psychotropics apiece
[36:30.800 --> 36:33.520]  These are government numbers
[36:38.040 --> 36:43.480]  Here's the headline under Obamacare government would indoctrinate your kids and Paul Watson has the section
[36:43.680 --> 36:49.480]  It's in the bill and it says all homes will get CPS visits even if you don't take the health care
[36:49.920 --> 36:53.080]  See now if you get head start you get three CPS visits a year
[36:54.280 --> 36:59.800]  Then most people they just get you to oh you did something wrong sign this form go to parroting classes to get you in the system
[36:59.800 --> 37:01.440]  And it's like a form of probation
[37:01.440 --> 37:08.320]  These bastards they want to run your life. They love it. They're contesting disgusting degenerate control freaks
[37:10.640 --> 37:15.980]  We're gonna get Chuck Norris back on Chuck Norris slams Stalinist home intrusion indoctrination program
[37:16.680 --> 37:23.680]  TV star and commentator Chuck Norris points out in an editorial today that under the Obamacare legislation currently being
[37:23.680 --> 37:29.640]  Borosously opposed in town halls across the country the government would empower itself to carry out home
[37:30.600 --> 37:36.720]  Intrusions and state reeducation of children under a Stalinist indoctrination program and you can go read the bill. We have a link to it
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.040]  I've got another one here another subsection. We're gonna go over after we take some calls
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  Where it says all seniors
[37:45.480 --> 37:51.760]  Above the age of 65 will be forced to get home visits by elder care
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.280]  And you will be given quote death with dignity
[37:56.760 --> 37:59.400]  Talks and explained how you need to commit suicide
[37:59.400 --> 38:07.160]  I mean literally instead of Soylent Green where you go kill yourself at the sanitarium watching some classical listening to some classical music
[38:07.160 --> 38:13.840]  Watching pastoral scenes they come and grab your butt like Logan's run folks. This is happening all over northern Europe
[38:14.160 --> 38:20.680]  And northern Europe is dying. There's all these disgusting New York Times and Washington Post articles. The West is dead
[38:20.680 --> 38:22.680]  one point three
[38:23.720 --> 38:28.000]  One point three for every two people. They're having one point three children. It's dead
[38:28.760 --> 38:31.440]  You can't even replace with that number. It's over
[38:32.120 --> 38:34.120]  This is nihilistic sickos
[38:35.040 --> 38:37.040]  there meanwhile
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.600]  Slaughtering and trying to call the third world as fast as they can these people have lost their life force
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.520]  Let me tell you these sicko globalist though. They've all got four five six seven eight kids. They're obsessed with it
[38:48.520 --> 38:54.160]  That bastard Ted Turner that calls us useless feeders has five kids scores of jet airplanes
[38:54.920 --> 38:56.920]  millions of acres he owns
[38:56.920 --> 38:58.920]  scores of houses
[38:59.480 --> 39:03.600]  He's nothing but a greedy murdering bastard and he is a murderer
[39:03.640 --> 39:09.600]  He supports and has given over two billion dollars to eugenics programs for sterilization
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  Obama has taken the funding freeze off and radically expanded what it was before the freeze for forced abortion and
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.560]  Phantasy in China and Africa. These are
[39:19.560 --> 39:21.560]  murderers
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.240]  Go read the quotes
[39:29.840 --> 39:35.120]  With Margaret Sanger talking about how they had to hire blacks as their fronts to kill the black scum
[39:36.160 --> 39:41.600]  See if you talk about murdering black scum and walk around being liberal you get praised by Time magazine
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.200]  I just we've got to figure out a way to get rid of these weeds these black weeds. Oh
[39:47.160 --> 39:50.680]  Hitler, I love you. Oh, you're liberal. Oh, you love Hitler
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.080]  It's just sickening degenerate filth everywhere running everything
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.800]  Look what the great society and great leap forward and
[40:01.440 --> 40:08.400]  All this crud is done to countries and societies look what it's done to your black communities from 10 percent illegitimacy
[40:08.400 --> 40:11.280]  To 92 percent illegitimacy
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.320]  They've got the black communities literally back to the caveman age now and they're doing it to everybody else's communities now
[40:18.520 --> 40:23.320]  Just wrecking everything so that you can be orderly put in prison and then euthanized
[40:29.600 --> 40:31.960]  All right, I'm gonna take your calls. It's just I
[40:31.960 --> 40:37.400]  Watch CNN and I flip back and forth and channels and CNN
[40:40.400 --> 40:42.400]  They randomly handed out
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.880]  30 cards made a big scene of it being random and
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  29 questions were against the healthcare
[40:50.720 --> 40:55.440]  29 of 30 to that magic bullet proponent Arlen Specter
[40:58.440 --> 40:59.920]  29 and
[40:59.920 --> 41:05.400]  They said I'm not left. I'm not right. I'm tired of foreign corporations raping us. We know this is another scam
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.680]  This is a way to take all our health care and that's what it is
[41:10.320 --> 41:15.600]  Every person I was just my soul was buoyed and then you cut to the little witch
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.880]  On CNN outside and she said well, there's 50 50 out here
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.760]  Some for the health care others against helping the poor and giving them health care
[41:25.760 --> 41:32.080]  Now let's cut to California where they're helping the poor that these people are against
[41:36.920 --> 41:39.520]  Unbelievable ladies and gentlemen
[41:42.240 --> 41:49.760]  I then flipped to other channels and ran in and looked and local news admitted that they couldn't find anyone for the health care there
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  30 questions were allowed to be asked
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.560]  29 were against
[41:58.520 --> 42:04.880]  But it mattered CNN and Fox and all of them and Fox was even on there going oh, it's you know
[42:04.880 --> 42:08.320]  Their thing is oh, it's good to go protest and good to go be part of this
[42:09.040 --> 42:10.960]  but
[42:10.960 --> 42:12.960]  Don't yell
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.640]  So see they make it all about gilding everybody it's just amazing
[42:17.640 --> 42:22.360]  All right, I want everybody to sound off and I got a guess for like 15 minutes to the next hour
[42:22.360 --> 42:25.000]  but then after that continual open phones and tarp Lee because I
[42:25.560 --> 42:27.560]  ended up getting contacted
[42:29.840 --> 42:34.680]  By Kevin Burton who's with this CEO of BAM
[42:36.320 --> 42:42.840]  Think BAM.com he got massive emails and calls to emergency management private corporation works with the FBI and others
[42:42.840 --> 42:48.640]  For the whole flu thing coming up and and he did an audio conference calling us crackpots nuts or whatever
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.040]  And now he says he wants to come on and clarify what he meant by that
[42:52.800 --> 42:59.120]  So he's popping in for like 20 minutes or so and that's fine if he wants to clarify. That's great. We'll be friendly towards him
[43:00.280 --> 43:03.800]  but I am gonna take calls on this all day today all day tomorrow because
[43:04.520 --> 43:08.360]  This is the revolution and they're calling into C-span and they're calling into their talk radio
[43:08.360 --> 43:11.000]  And if you're getting blocked out and censored the town halls
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.480]  Calling to talk radio go to city council go to county commissioner
[43:15.960 --> 43:20.080]  Anything that media is that letters to the editor start your own blog put up flyers
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.040]  In fact, I'm gonna ask Paul Watson to create a one-page flyer
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.440]  That just has like five bullet points about health care in bold letters and then info wars calm under it
[43:33.440 --> 43:42.360]  And then I'll have one of my guys maybe Curtis somebody create a photoshop of some image about health care
[43:42.360 --> 43:47.040]  See so you can have one page you put on top and the bullet points under to put up places
[43:47.040 --> 43:49.280]  I mean or you can do it yourself
[43:49.280 --> 43:54.720]  I mean, you know people come up with ideas come up with the five bullet points the one image graphic designers idea people
[43:54.720 --> 43:57.600]  We're all work to the edge of just insanity here
[44:00.440 --> 44:02.440]  I mean I I
[44:02.440 --> 44:08.440]  Can barely make myself leave at 2 3 in the morning and I've but I've got to stop I got to see my family
[44:08.960 --> 44:14.960]  The issue is it's all happening now. This is the time of the revolution and the enemy. I mean again
[44:16.160 --> 44:17.920]  There's a father
[44:17.920 --> 44:24.640]  With his son he has cerebral palsy and in the subsection he reads the subsection where they won't be given care and Dingell admits
[44:24.640 --> 44:27.960]  Yeah, we're gonna have to amend that because it says you just go home and die
[44:27.960 --> 44:35.360]  I mean Dashiell who wrote the bill wrote a book saying it. This is eugenics people. I've seen Tony Blair when he was
[44:37.040 --> 44:39.040]  When he was
[44:40.640 --> 44:49.440]  The prime minister will ever forget watching prime minister's questions and they got up and said I have constituents waiting 16 to 18 months for brain surgery on
[44:49.560 --> 44:50.920]  operable
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.640]  cancers that have to be operated on three months and it has a 90 plus percent cure rate
[44:54.640 --> 44:58.760]  But you've got to have the surgery and Tony Blair said yes, I know people are waiting
[44:59.360 --> 45:01.360]  16 18 months
[45:01.960 --> 45:07.200]  But that's just the way it is and and some of them are elderly and you know, they come at the back of the line and
[45:09.520 --> 45:15.120]  Or they have bad histories meaning the government has a file on you if you smoke and drink or ever did and so
[45:15.440 --> 45:19.040]  You know, that's just the way it is. I mean this this really goes on folks
[45:19.800 --> 45:21.900]  We're not you know, this isn't a game
[45:21.900 --> 45:29.900]  They're gonna wreck and they want control of every sector of the economy the illegal aliens
[45:29.980 --> 45:33.260]  God bless them because they're coming from a hellish place of tyranny
[45:33.820 --> 45:37.020]  They need to be made to stay down there and have a real revolt and take their country back
[45:37.260 --> 45:40.380]  The globalists have a deal to not do that. They don't get any health care
[45:40.380 --> 45:46.180]  So they come up here and get full health care full, you know, five six seven babies everything paid for that's bankrupting all the states
[45:46.180 --> 45:51.460]  The feds know that they create the crisis and offer the solution and in this bill the illegals get all the free care
[45:51.460 --> 45:56.460]  It's just gonna break rubbed everything and we'll have total socialist care, which will then be eugenics
[45:58.580 --> 46:00.940]  Obama cares about government coming into homes and
[46:01.860 --> 46:07.700]  You're serving parental rights over child care and development rights Norris in an outline sections of 440 and
[46:09.660 --> 46:13.460]  Section 1904 of the House bill pages 8 3 8
[46:13.940 --> 46:19.700]  Under the heading home visitation programs for families with young children and families expecting children the program
[46:19.700 --> 46:25.820]  Provide via grants to states would educate parents on child behavior and parenting skills the bill says the government agents will
[46:26.220 --> 46:34.060]  Be trained and competent staff would provide parents with knowledge and age appropriate child development and cognitive language and social emotional and motor
[46:34.740 --> 46:38.300]  Domains because he suddenly kids can't walk and talk as they watch TV and they're on
[46:39.340 --> 46:43.660]  Sodium fluoride and they're drinking Coca-Cola and eat nothing but crap. I mean, they're the brain damage
[46:43.660 --> 46:46.300]  I went to a restaurant with my family last night just a
[46:46.300 --> 46:53.820]  Lower-middle-class type restaurant and I was in a room of people and they all looked retarded. I mean they acted retarded
[46:53.820 --> 46:59.260]  They were good. I mean, I wanted to videotape, but I was freaked out folks. I feel like I entered the dimension of hell and
[47:00.740 --> 47:02.740]  Then they weren't chromosomally
[47:03.340 --> 47:09.180]  It mean it was they were drugged out the kids looked retarded. We're fried. We're under total chemical attack
[47:09.260 --> 47:13.180]  God help us. We got eugenics psychos running everything. I
[47:13.180 --> 47:15.180]  Just can't handle it anymore
[47:17.180 --> 47:24.580]  Everybody's like drugged out zombies. They're chemtrailing us and admitting it was about to rain in Austin the jets came in and chemtrailed and knocked them all out
[47:24.740 --> 47:28.860]  I'm living in a science fiction nightmare people. You got to wake up. I
[47:31.300 --> 47:35.700]  Was looking at these families I was looking at people in the parking lot and the people that worked there. They were all retarded
[47:35.700 --> 47:42.700]  They were chemically lobotomized
[47:47.300 --> 47:50.620]  Those of us that would have been exceptionally intelligence fight through it
[47:50.620 --> 47:55.780]  But we're still frustrated and things get foggy sometimes and but knowing you're under chemical attack a lot
[47:55.780 --> 47:57.500]  You know the body can
[47:57.500 --> 48:01.300]  Get over it and you start trying to avoid the sodium fluoride you start avoiding the GMO
[48:01.300 --> 48:05.260]  Let's just go to calls. It's just I don't even wanna
[48:08.140 --> 48:14.940]  It's just to sit there and watch him deny it all and act like we're lying and act like we're bad
[48:15.940 --> 48:17.940]  It's just unbelievable
[48:17.940 --> 48:30.700]  And my I am from Minnesota with my callers just crashed just give me a good. Give me a caller verbally John

[50:16.980 --> 50:21.100]  It has to be with her teacher certification and that she bought this to my attention
[50:21.100 --> 50:25.060]  Here's a little a blip from the book. It says in the mid 90s
[50:25.060 --> 50:31.180]  For instance value training not to be confused with that values clarification emphasis in the 1970s
[50:32.580 --> 50:39.060]  Since the home and community may have lost effectiveness as a strong value support system. Yeah, stay there stay there

[54:51.980 --> 54:56.220]  They use the symbols of patriotism to make us stand down and go along with them
[54:58.740 --> 55:06.140]  And we do have the seizure of every sector of our economy they want to destroy the economy and take over health care
[55:07.140 --> 55:12.060]  To make you dependent on them so they can fully domesticates you period
[55:12.060 --> 55:18.980]  Everything they're doing is unconstitutional. It's all criminal. They always do it in the name of they're taking care of you and loving you
[55:18.980 --> 55:22.140]  And I think they've overreached reached with this racism thing
[55:23.140 --> 55:30.860]  They're now saying and these clips are coming up later in the next hour to play the video for prisonplanet.tv viewers audio for the radio folks
[55:31.580 --> 55:38.060]  All over TV. They're saying if you say socialism you're racist everything is code now
[55:38.060 --> 55:44.980]  You don't want to give your whole paycheck up the main people are working-class folks who hardly get anything now
[55:44.980 --> 55:51.860]  They're going you mean you're gonna take 25 30% more of my paycheck and find me to give me some government health care
[55:51.860 --> 55:53.860]  That's an aspirin
[55:53.940 --> 55:58.140]  No, I don't want it and they're saying you're a racist then
[56:00.340 --> 56:03.780]  All right going back to Jim in Texas your wife's a school teacher and
[56:03.780 --> 56:09.300]  And you were trying to read out of the handbook. Give us the name of the handbook again and read from it
[56:09.700 --> 56:15.460]  It's the Texas examination of educator standards. It's a chapter called
[56:16.100 --> 56:22.260]  Competency sub chapter the teacher as a curriculum worker and and what it says down here is a
[56:22.900 --> 56:27.900]  Since the whole community have lost effectiveness as a strong value support system
[56:27.900 --> 56:33.700]  The school has automatically been selected as the agent to maintain the values for society
[56:35.060 --> 56:41.460]  So that was just that started her when she was studying for her test and notice this notice this though. Hold on
[56:42.300 --> 56:46.260]  Because I've seen that and I've seen that in a hundred different ways and all their documents
[56:46.260 --> 56:50.220]  I mean they come right out and I've read the quotes and say we're all degenerates families are bad
[56:50.380 --> 56:54.460]  That families are like a cancer that families are mentally ill. They've got to be eradicated
[56:54.460 --> 57:01.260]  But notice society didn't fall apart till we got big government and these social engineers
[57:01.620 --> 57:04.540]  So see they it's like a drug dealer
[57:05.100 --> 57:11.620]  They get you on heroin and then say the reason you're having trouble going to work is they haven't sold you enough heroin
[57:11.620 --> 57:14.220]  You haven't robbed enough stereos. Go ahead
[57:15.100 --> 57:19.620]  right and like I mentioned earlier if you are a non-commissioned officer you're up at Fort Hood and
[57:19.620 --> 57:25.780]  And you know I need to talk a lot about the water system and I googled our water report here in Colleen
[57:25.780 --> 57:30.100]  And it contains high amounts of fluoride, barium, chloroform and
[57:30.660 --> 57:33.820]  Atrazine which is banned in several countries around the world
[57:34.180 --> 57:37.260]  So and this is what the soldiers are drinking every day
[57:37.820 --> 57:41.100]  And it just it makes me sick that we're we're actually
[57:41.820 --> 57:43.820]  Continuing to put this stuff in our water system
[57:43.820 --> 57:52.020]  And it's all an official government documents that we've put in the endgame and my other films that they're doing it on purpose
[57:52.020 --> 57:58.580]  I mean have you told the other people at the base and given them the PDF file of the White House science arts admitting
[57:58.580 --> 58:02.420]  They're drugging our water. I haven't done that yet Alex, but you know
[58:02.420 --> 58:05.260]  Because the nature of my job I have to be careful about what I do
[58:05.660 --> 58:08.500]  But I do study the Constitution with my soldiers
[58:08.500 --> 58:15.700]  We we go over that kind of stuff. We understand the Bill of Rights. We understand our sort of like a gentleman was speaking about earlier
[58:16.340 --> 58:20.060]  We understand that you know, yes, follow the orders from higher
[58:20.340 --> 58:24.060]  But we also have a responsibility to protect the Constitution and Bill of Rights
[58:24.540 --> 58:26.460]  So well, God bless you, sir
[58:26.460 --> 58:33.100]  Do me a favor scan that in email it to us and we'll get it up on the web or posted on the Prison Planet Forum keep it up

[58:49.500 --> 58:54.420]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food

[1:00:04.620 --> 1:00:07.380]  Launch it. Let's go mainstream media
[1:00:08.140 --> 1:00:10.660]  Government cover-ups you want answers?
[1:00:11.180 --> 1:00:19.620]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:22.260]  Alex Jones
[1:00:22.260 --> 1:00:28.380]  Coming up in 20 minutes or so after a guest leaves us
[1:00:30.380 --> 1:00:33.180]  Today I am gonna break down
[1:00:33.780 --> 1:00:39.460]  More and more horrors being found in the official house and Senate bill CPS visits to everyone's homes
[1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:48.020]  Old people have to go get death education learn great basically how to be euthanized and how their health care is gonna be rationed
[1:00:48.020 --> 1:00:50.020]  That's in the bill
[1:00:50.020 --> 1:00:56.740]  We're just gonna read the quotes from the bill for all these lying criminals that get up on TV and lie and say none of this is in there
[1:00:58.060 --> 1:01:00.060]  Now remember with our own specter
[1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:05.940]  They gave out 30 cards randomly 29 of the people questioned at his stupid town hall
[1:01:06.540 --> 1:01:10.780]  Where they tried to beat up an old man. It's all on video. It's all over the country
[1:01:10.780 --> 1:01:13.580]  It's coming up when we go live at prison planet TV in the next segment
[1:01:13.580 --> 1:01:21.420]  These thugs do this everywhere even though they tried to intimidate people 29 of the 30 questioned of the 30
[1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:23.420]  They allowed to speak word against this
[1:01:26.260 --> 1:01:30.380]  And this is what the eugenicist control freaks want they want government to control your life
[1:01:30.380 --> 1:01:34.700]  And I just mentioned governors oppose DOD power grab
[1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:40.500]  Defense Department openly announcing that its main enemy is returning veterans gun owners
[1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:45.700]  This is any official DHS report. We broke governors are now speaking out. I'm gonna go over that mainstream news article
[1:01:46.540 --> 1:01:50.460]  That is coming up the governors are now looking at North comm saying well
[1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:53.740]  The Tennessee governor told the army not to run checkpoints two months ago
[1:01:53.740 --> 1:01:58.140]  And we had state reps on about it in the army said we're gonna stop cars on your highways
[1:01:58.700 --> 1:02:03.340]  Sit down and shut up. This is the new America offshore banks rule
[1:02:04.100 --> 1:02:06.380]  So that's coming up. We're gonna break that down
[1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:13.140]  It's amazing Johnny calling from the Republic, USA Johnny you're on the air go ahead
[1:02:14.420 --> 1:02:19.060]  Hey, first of all, how about that last caller man? That guy was awesome. That's older from Texas
[1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:26.980]  Absolutely from Fort Hood just one. Yeah, man. Just want to thank him for speaking out and hopefully more military guys will start calling in
[1:02:26.980 --> 1:02:31.740]  We are you kidding Ron Paul got more donations than any other Republican or Democrat?
[1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:39.300]  They're awake a bunch of chicken-necked communist murdering eugenicists think they're gonna run this country in the ground and and they did
[1:02:39.300 --> 1:02:42.460]  They're gonna run a Soviet call here. They got another thing coming
[1:02:43.980 --> 1:02:48.260]  Go ahead and I have a prediction. I have a prediction. I want to run through the Jones filter
[1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:52.380]  He's together from stuff. I hear on your show and of course my own research
[1:02:52.380 --> 1:02:54.380]  Hopefully all your listeners are doing a lot of research
[1:02:54.940 --> 1:02:57.860]  but I think I can predict the collapse of the dollar and
[1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:03.660]  And the release of Barry's long-term birth certificate not specifically of this in terms of time
[1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:08.940]  But I think they're gonna coincide that way they can distract us and the what do you think?
[1:03:08.940 --> 1:03:10.420]  Well, that could be a false flag
[1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:14.460]  I mean, I hope he was born in the US and I've never really been on either side of it though
[1:03:14.460 --> 1:03:19.860]  We've looked at it and been called birthers for even looking at it and talking to the people that say he was you know
[1:03:19.860 --> 1:03:25.140]  We talked to both sides like Mike Rivera on one side and then Phil Berg on the other but
[1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:31.980]  But yeah, I know that comes out. It's gonna be that would probably cause nationwide riots, but go ahead
[1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:34.140]  Yeah, that's kind of my question
[1:03:34.140 --> 1:03:40.020]  Do you think maybe they're they know that Obama wasn't maybe born here and then they're gonna release that and that'll be a false flag
[1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:46.460]  And because of the riots, I mean he'd be the only thing past these people, but I'll tell you Barack Obama is the false flag
[1:03:46.460 --> 1:03:54.740]  I mean you criticizing they say he's a racist then that actually creates the perception of racism and gets everybody fighting with each other
[1:03:54.740 --> 1:03:57.860]  It's so cold-blooded what these poverty pimps are doing
[1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:02.340]  Yeah, well people people were right in the streets for Obama
[1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:04.340]  They won't ride in the streets over the Patriot Act
[1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:10.180]  But they with there's something if Obama goes down these people will protest this naked emperor and that's I I'm always looking for the
[1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:11.100]  martial law angle
[1:04:11.100 --> 1:04:13.300]  I you know, I think if they can collapse the dollar and
[1:04:13.660 --> 1:04:18.500]  Take Obama's feet out from under him and make everybody crazy. That's when they want to smack us
[1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:19.540]  Well, let's be clear
[1:04:19.540 --> 1:04:23.660]  It's kind of like if you inject somebody with cyanide and you know in two minutes, they're gonna be dead
[1:04:23.660 --> 1:04:27.220]  We're dead already the Republic is dead now. I can rise again
[1:04:28.060 --> 1:04:34.340]  Stealing twenty three point seven trillion in ten months. We're dead. We were injected with cyanide now
[1:04:34.340 --> 1:04:39.460]  Is there a cure? Is there an antidote certainly, but we don't have long to get it in us and
[1:04:41.820 --> 1:04:45.740]  It's kind of like Rafa Khan when Spock's been radiated and they want to go in there and save him
[1:04:45.740 --> 1:04:48.460]  They said he's dead already the country's dead already
[1:04:48.460 --> 1:04:54.700]  You can be absolutely assured has been overrun by a bunch of corporate criminals with a bunch of control freak socialists
[1:04:54.700 --> 1:04:57.660]  That want to come in and run our lives and they mean business

[1:08:20.660 --> 1:08:22.660]  Alex Jones
[1:08:25.860 --> 1:08:29.220]  The last two hours and 52 minutes today
[1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:35.020]  We're going to continue to have open phones and we're simulcasting now at prison planet dot TV
[1:08:35.020 --> 1:08:41.740]  We're watching later on the web somewhere like YouTube live TV or at prison planet dot TV in the higher quality
[1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:47.380]  Where this originates from you can always listen live 11 a.m. To 3 p.m.
[1:08:47.820 --> 1:08:52.740]  Central standard time Monday through Friday web-subdiffin Tarpley's joining us in the next hour
[1:08:53.780 --> 1:08:55.780]  We're gonna talk about eugenics
[1:08:56.100 --> 1:09:02.460]  But also part two of that discussion we had last week get into these town halls the people on the edge of revolution and
[1:09:02.460 --> 1:09:04.780]  And remember Tarpley is
[1:09:05.660 --> 1:09:13.460]  More of a big government interventionist, but he's against Obama and this healthcare saying it's eugenics because he's a scholar and economist and a doctor
[1:09:14.860 --> 1:09:18.980]  Of a history and he can break it down for you. So that is coming up. I
[1:09:19.780 --> 1:09:26.380]  Never really covered this headline on air. It's up on info wars calm headline disaster recovery CEO
[1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:30.340]  characterizes info wars as group of crazies on flu pandemic and
[1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:36.420]  And I've since talked to him. This was just an audio clip. We were sent of the conference. I
[1:09:37.580 --> 1:09:43.460]  Do understand that there's a lot of people out there who are unstable and this type of wild stuff that's happening
[1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:46.260]  There are some unstable people out there
[1:09:46.580 --> 1:09:51.740]  So I understand his point on this and how that could have been seen out of context
[1:09:51.740 --> 1:09:57.100]  So we're here to hear his his perspective his side of this but since I never really talked about it
[1:09:57.100 --> 1:10:03.220]  We'll go ahead and play the original audio here from the audio conference with these doctors and emergency managers there
[1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:06.980]  And then we'll make sure that the audio file of this new interview
[1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:10.820]  And a clarification gets posted in the original
[1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:15.660]  article because he got a lot of heat for this and he wants to clarify and
[1:10:15.660 --> 1:10:25.740]  Which is is understandable, but let's go ahead and play this short audio clip here it is. I want you to know that in the past decade
[1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:34.300]  We've really tripped past the point for more public safety practitioners are safe when they're following best practice guidelines for
[1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:36.380]  the
[1:10:36.380 --> 1:10:38.380]  response
[1:10:39.380 --> 1:10:41.380]  In fact
[1:10:41.380 --> 1:10:46.260]  Because of world-wide connections like the internet or what we're on right now
[1:10:46.860 --> 1:10:52.580]  YouTube is probably more viral than the H1M1 virus. I just want to point out
[1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:57.380]  Some interesting studies that we're doing here at Burnt Nassan Management that will really illustrate
[1:10:58.180 --> 1:11:03.580]  Exactly what I'm talking to you. If you search H1M1 conspiracy on YouTube, you'll get about
[1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:06.100]  630 video results
[1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:13.860]  One of these is a study report by a man named Dr. Leonard and he's been viewed 180,000 times
[1:11:14.300 --> 1:11:16.300]  As of August 1st
[1:11:16.460 --> 1:11:24.380]  He's been telling people that the nefarious outcome of the inoculation will be a massive genocide attack in North America
[1:11:24.940 --> 1:11:28.980]  Perpetuated by white supremacists, okay? Now, I know that sounds totally crazy
[1:11:28.980 --> 1:11:38.220]  but you need to understand that there's 632 videos out there that say that this flu is a conspiracy and that
[1:11:38.660 --> 1:11:39.940]  another
[1:11:39.940 --> 1:11:49.820]  YouTube video by a company called InfoWars, or a group of pretty easy to call InfoWars, has been viewed 5,814 times since August 1st
[1:11:50.700 --> 1:11:56.740]  I have to tell you that overall when we just looked at H1M1 conspiracy on YouTube
[1:11:56.740 --> 1:12:03.300]  We found that 2.15 million people in the US have watched these homespun
[1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:14.020]  Psychotic tales of genocide and government conspiracy relative to each one H1M1 virus and I don't know how many of those 2.15 million people believe
[1:12:14.540 --> 1:12:16.180]  That that's what's happening
[1:12:16.180 --> 1:12:19.380]  But what scares me is all you need is one
[1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:25.500]  Psycho to believe that and you're gonna have a bigger problem on your hands in your workplace
[1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:27.500]  Than what to do with sick people
[1:12:27.740 --> 1:12:32.380]  There was only one Ted Wozinski, there was only one Michael McVeigh
[1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:41.220]  All right was Tim McVeigh, but let's go ahead and go to Kevin Burton CEO of BAM thinkbam.com and
[1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:48.460]  Why don't you it's a long bio for your company, but but describe the company and you're saying that's out of that's out of context
[1:12:50.300 --> 1:12:52.380]  So break it down for us
[1:12:52.380 --> 1:12:58.460]  Well, you know, first of all, I want to thank you to all the info warriors that reached out to me directly via email
[1:12:58.980 --> 1:13:02.020]  we run a very open small business and
[1:13:03.260 --> 1:13:05.260]  especially to Terry who
[1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:10.220]  Reminded me that you know at the end of the day you have to search your soul and talk to God about
[1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:16.140]  What's right and what's wrong about what you're saying and boy listening that clip myself just now Alex as you played it I
[1:13:17.140 --> 1:13:19.140]  Sound like a raging asshole
[1:13:19.140 --> 1:13:21.140]  Oh, wow, what's that?
[1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:27.460]  Right out the gate. I have I want to apologize to all your listeners because the key thing
[1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:33.220]  Understand about that conference is that it was attended by some emergency managers
[1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:42.260]  and a big swath of Americans who are going to be caught in the middle of this thing unexpectedly and
[1:13:43.740 --> 1:13:46.700]  The point I make at the end of that quote and you know
[1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:50.620]  We can go back and play it again, but the point isn't that all your listeners are crazy
[1:13:50.620 --> 1:13:55.700]  In fact, God bless your listeners for doing the right thing and really asking the right question
[1:13:55.700 --> 1:13:57.700]  I believe that
[1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:00.100]  info warriors has
[1:14:00.780 --> 1:14:05.220]  All of this very very close if not dead spot on right. I
[1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:11.700]  Personally wouldn't allow my daughter or my family to be forcibly inoculated against anything
[1:14:12.420 --> 1:14:14.420]  and had been advised by
[1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:18.620]  People in the right position. They can't get such advice
[1:14:19.820 --> 1:14:23.100]  You're clear of any type of an oculation again
[1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:29.220]  That's why the feds tried to order an oculation as you know in 2002 2003 model states help the emergency powers act
[1:14:29.220 --> 1:14:34.260]  But it all collapsed when the smallpox vaccine killed some people and then Tommy Thompson
[1:14:34.260 --> 1:14:36.300]  Health and human services secretary wouldn't take it
[1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:43.220]  But I mean have you had a conversion or was just that short clip not showing fully what what you were saying
[1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:50.500]  Well, because look I mean I mean I mean are you Saul of Tarsus who's had a complete conversion or were you already partially awake?
[1:14:50.500 --> 1:14:54.100]  Did people educate you or was this taken completely out of context?
[1:14:54.100 --> 1:15:01.260]  I was already fully awake and I invite your listeners to spend some time in our thinking section at think ban dot com
[1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:03.260]  Where we've published papers on
[1:15:04.020 --> 1:15:11.500]  You know don't let our nation become a surveillance nation like Great Britain has become or at our blog at fan intel dot com
[1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:15.540]  Uh, fan intel. It's a blog that talks about don't let
[1:15:16.180 --> 1:15:20.860]  The DOD take away our ability to look at now
[1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:26.020]  Okay, so you were saying then what Horowitz dr. Horitz and I and I and other doctors we've had on have been saying
[1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:33.820]  Could be warped into people really looking for confrontation or I'm trying to understand this
[1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:37.500]  Yeah, yeah, you're right and what I'm worried about is the innocent
[1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:42.020]  First in who's dedicated as I have their life to the well-being of others
[1:15:42.060 --> 1:15:46.500]  You know we go into the work of emergency management military service
[1:15:47.420 --> 1:15:53.780]  healthcare emergency safety with the best of intentions and the people who pull our strings
[1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:56.300]  The public masters if you will
[1:15:56.620 --> 1:16:04.660]  Put us directly in harm's way and allow us to be put a deterrent. So this was really a loud cry
[1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:12.780]  I directly into that community of occupational health and safety professionals who work for the government and the public school systems and
[1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:17.340]  Municipalities at the federal and the federal and the state level saying listen
[1:16:17.900 --> 1:16:23.020]  You can't put people and I'm talking about one one nutcase here
[1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:27.860]  Not a lot of that cases not all of everybody to listen to Alex Jones including me, right?
[1:16:27.860 --> 1:16:37.140]  I'm talking about one person who could do harm and the thing that really concerns me Alex is that we we keep talking about in
[1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:39.300]  the areas that I work
[1:16:41.060 --> 1:16:42.900]  Transparency around
[1:16:42.900 --> 1:16:45.380]  What can we expect for our school children?
[1:16:45.380 --> 1:16:52.140]  What can we expect in the workplace and it's not happening? It's not happening public but then let me break this down for you
[1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:58.420]  But it is happening. See see just like the health care bill has all the horrible stuff in it
[1:16:58.860 --> 1:17:05.780]  But then the politicians come out and lie and say we don't know we're gonna do just let us pass it and conure says you can't read it
[1:17:05.780 --> 1:17:08.980]  Well, the bill's public we can go read it. I
[1:17:10.060 --> 1:17:13.780]  Don't know which one's worse the House or Senate. They're both are filled with pure evil
[1:17:14.780 --> 1:17:20.260]  But so so so it's the same thing on the flu. We know what level six is under World Health Organization rules
[1:17:20.260 --> 1:17:27.020]  We know what it is under the executive order of Bush that Obama's continuing and it's forced inoculations quarantine of cities
[1:17:27.020 --> 1:17:30.420]  We've got the North comm meetings where they're saying forced inoculations
[1:17:30.420 --> 1:17:34.380]  We've had the emergency managers on and them and in the internal documents
[1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:39.580]  I've gotten with phone numbers where they're getting all the big cemeteries ready now whether this is real or not
[1:17:40.340 --> 1:17:47.500]  The issue is they are really getting ready for a massive crackdown and with the history of black men and syphilis and Tuskegee and
[1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:54.700]  The radiating foster children to death and nerve-gassing our own troops with project shad on and on on for 10 hours
[1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:59.260]  Mr. Burton, that's why people are saying over my dead body. You're not shooting me up with that
[1:17:59.260 --> 1:18:05.340]  You know the swine flu vaccine in 76 killed a bunch of people so so I know this sounds crazy
[1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:08.020]  Look, it sounds crazy to have the White House science are
[1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:12.980]  Right an 1100 page book saying they're drugging the water and want to break up the family
[1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:18.460]  But that's in this new bit. Look, I look. I'm sorry that the government's completely psychopathic
[1:18:18.460 --> 1:18:22.460]  No, I agree with you and I and everything you just said is
[1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:25.420]  very very real and
[1:18:25.420 --> 1:18:33.460]  What the point that I did my apology to your listeners is really about not casting disparagement upon
[1:18:33.900 --> 1:18:37.700]  All the points that you just made because they're accurate but casting
[1:18:37.700 --> 1:18:45.620]  Casting a word of warning to people who could in a split innocently be used in this nefarious scheme
[1:18:46.220 --> 1:18:49.960]  And find themselves doing work that they're not comfortable doing
[1:18:50.460 --> 1:18:54.940]  Now as an emergency management professional who's consulted with some of these bad guys
[1:18:54.940 --> 1:19:02.460]  I can tell you that I have many sleepless nights where I feel like I'm spiritually caving in under under pressure
[1:19:02.460 --> 1:19:10.380]  And we've walked away from business because it's just bad news. Well, that's a good reason to have you here then
[1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:13.820]  We're about to go to break but when we come back
[1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:19.180]  Specifically because you're in the middle of this and your company works with the FBI and FEMA and many others
[1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:26.620]  Tell us specifically then from kind of the inside and your little quadrant of this compartmentalized system
[1:19:26.620 --> 1:19:32.580]  What you're seeing and what's happening and and and and I certainly understand your concern?
[1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:37.860]  It's just that when you research more about Theodore Kaczynski L.A. Times. He was CIA
[1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:44.340]  I believe he did run off the reservation was actually real though. He was so freaked out by
[1:19:45.700 --> 1:19:50.780]  The elites plans that he did some things he shouldn't have now Tim McVeigh is another story
[1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:56.740]  That was run by one of the so-called liberal anti-racist groups
[1:19:57.540 --> 1:19:59.860]  It was done to crack down on the American people
[1:20:01.140 --> 1:20:03.140]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse
[1:20:03.540 --> 1:20:10.220]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year

[1:21:08.540 --> 1:21:11.660]  World government is known as the Builder bird
[1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:14.980]  Put their objective the world domination
[1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:18.020]  For thousands of years their dark order grew

[1:21:58.980 --> 1:22:06.180]  On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years
[1:22:06.860 --> 1:22:14.380]  Unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[1:22:14.380 --> 1:22:17.540]  Is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit?
[1:22:17.540 --> 1:22:22.660]  We call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:27.740]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book the creature from Jekyll Island
[1:22:27.740 --> 1:22:32.940]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power a

[1:24:16.860 --> 1:24:38.860]  So Kevin tell us what it is. It's upsetting you when you talk about
[1:24:40.620 --> 1:24:42.620]  these forces that want to
[1:24:42.700 --> 1:24:44.700]  give us these injections and your concern is
[1:24:44.700 --> 1:24:50.780]  The conflagration that could come as they try to do it. You say it's not forthcoming. You're right. They keep lying saying
[1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:56.300]  Yeah, we're not coming to give you shots. We're just getting ready to forcibly inject you
[1:24:56.620 --> 1:25:02.300]  So so there is a lot of their classic deception where they deny what they're doing even as it's happening
[1:25:02.700 --> 1:25:05.340]  But I mean specifically what is it an emergency management?
[1:25:05.900 --> 1:25:07.900]  That's uh concerning you
[1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:15.580]  So, you know, we're gonna step back from that the H1N1 inoculation program just for a second here
[1:25:15.820 --> 1:25:21.500]  and talk about the broader landscape when it comes to the emergency management the private sector and
[1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:29.500]  The first thing that really upsets me about this Alex is that it is a completely monopolized system
[1:25:29.980 --> 1:25:33.020]  where the private sector companies in America
[1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:39.660]  That's free enterprise and the notion of being able to set up and run your own small business is one of the rights that that
[1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:43.980]  Is why why we love our country. Yeah, so it's a no-bid contract
[1:25:44.460 --> 1:25:49.980]  Right. So what happens here is all your data gets into a truck to a company called iron mountain
[1:25:50.460 --> 1:25:53.980]  Um, that if you do some research or look at our website, we have a
[1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:59.740]  Detailed report on what's called the history of this continuity. I was behind an iron mountain truck today
[1:25:59.740 --> 1:26:02.380]  Hey, yeah, so you see them all over the place, right?
[1:26:02.860 --> 1:26:05.900]  And the first, you know, that iron mountain was built
[1:26:06.380 --> 1:26:08.300]  initially by the
[1:26:08.300 --> 1:26:14.140]  DIA and Sun Oil Company and the big disaster recovery company that stepped into
[1:26:15.100 --> 1:26:18.300]  backing up everybody's computer files and having all of your
[1:26:18.860 --> 1:26:20.860]  private information
[1:26:20.940 --> 1:26:27.980]  Backed up and and on tape or on abs today on on this and then virtually able to pop these machines on very quickly
[1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:34.380]  Um, is owned and run by a company or at least was founded and run by a company that
[1:26:35.180 --> 1:26:41.260]  Manages 98 percent of all the competing systems for all the trades that happen in agdax and wall street
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:45.260]  And what does that tell you about the relationship between big money and your privacy?
[1:26:45.580 --> 1:26:48.380]  Well, you know, it's funny. I knew iron mountain was data systems
[1:26:48.860 --> 1:26:54.940]  Do you know iron mountain is a secret government report that decades later was confirmed to be accurate
[1:26:54.940 --> 1:26:59.500]  But where they have a world government to carry out eugenics against the population
[1:27:00.060 --> 1:27:05.820]  And and and then now we have a public iron mountain report written by the white house science are
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:09.420]  And we have all these other documents. They're really doing this
[1:27:09.900 --> 1:27:14.460]  And so that's why we're saying this whole flu thing even if they don't launch a pandemic now
[1:27:14.780 --> 1:27:17.100]  We're not saying that's happening. They're saying it's going to happen
[1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:22.060]  That this is to set the precedent for total federalization
[1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:26.300]  The united states under un control and all of this hysteria is going to happen
[1:27:26.620 --> 1:27:29.580]  Right when they're trying to ram through federal health care
[1:27:29.820 --> 1:27:33.900]  So the excuse will be if we had more federal power over health care, we could have helped you
[1:27:34.460 --> 1:27:35.980]  right and so
[1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:41.180]  on on the monopolization of emergency management and first responders
[1:27:41.660 --> 1:27:48.060]  Any small company like mine that sets out to tell the truth and publishes a paper in our thinking section like
[1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:54.620]  The history of business continuity disaster recovery to clearly outline how your personal data
[1:27:54.860 --> 1:28:01.340]  From wherever you work from mcdonald's mcdonald's ugly is being trucked off in these little trucks
[1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:03.900]  uh, so that after
[1:28:03.980 --> 1:28:10.540]  Uh, whatever the nefarious thing goes down and we can talk about that a lot more
[1:28:11.180 --> 1:28:15.260]  Because it's a multi-pronged root goldberg construction
[1:28:15.260 --> 1:28:20.140]  Uh, listen listen mr. Burton. It's clear that what you said was taken out of context
[1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:24.460]  But you can understand why folks were upset. I want to schedule you for a full hour in the near future
[1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:30.460]  Okay, the website is think bam.com. Thank you so much. We'll get it updated on the story
[1:28:30.700 --> 1:28:36.300]  So you don't get these hundreds of mean emails and again. No check out that blog too because but sir, there's breaking news
[1:28:36.380 --> 1:28:39.420]  That's the only problem. We've been predicting false flags
[1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:43.500]  Against obama in the name of demonizing the protesters
[1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:49.020]  It's now happened raw story protesters seen with gun outside obama town hall
[1:28:49.260 --> 1:28:53.820]  We'll have key analysis on this coming up after the break. Sir. Thank you so much. We'll talk to you
[1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:56.460]  Pleasure listeners. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you. Yeah
[1:28:56.460 --> 1:29:01.420]  I want to talk to you as we do more shows about the flu and emergency management really pick your brain
[1:29:01.740 --> 1:29:03.740]  So, uh, maybe it's for
[1:29:03.900 --> 1:29:07.420]  A good cause that you ended up, you know saying something that sounded
[1:29:07.980 --> 1:29:11.020]  Bad and then later you I've done the same thing before so I
[1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:15.580]  I mean, I'm I understand it's kind of a peer pressure thing. You're in an atmosphere with people
[1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:22.300]  You're extrapolating out what a crisis could be you're trying to get some business contracts and uh, you say things you don't uh
[1:29:23.020 --> 1:29:25.020]  Don't agree with later
[1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:27.100]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen
[1:29:27.180 --> 1:29:29.180]  this is huge
[1:29:29.260 --> 1:29:33.580]  Protesters seem with gun outside obama town hall. We'll play the video cover it all
[1:29:34.460 --> 1:29:39.500]  This is to hype it up and make him the victim. I told you last week this week. You're gonna see stuff
[1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:46.860]  Now they're gonna bust some meth head you watch. I told you you watch. We'll be right back. Stay with us
[1:29:50.940 --> 1:29:54.060]  We're on the march the empire's on the run
[1:29:54.860 --> 1:29:57.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:00.380 --> 1:30:06.220]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer number one
[1:30:06.220 --> 1:30:10.220]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:30:10.380 --> 1:30:15.340]  Our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:30:15.580 --> 1:30:21.260]  It's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[1:30:21.580 --> 1:30:24.780]  In some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:30:24.940 --> 1:30:30.620]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:30:30.620 --> 1:30:37.420]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:39.500]  Backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:44.700]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science a long time sponsor of ours
[1:30:44.860 --> 1:30:46.860]  You can get more information at

[1:31:03.820 --> 1:31:07.260]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[1:31:07.420 --> 1:31:09.180]  How much ammunition do you want?
[1:31:09.180 --> 1:31:14.220]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[1:31:14.540 --> 1:31:20.220]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[1:31:20.220 --> 1:31:24.780]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[1:31:25.020 --> 1:31:29.020]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[1:31:29.100 --> 1:31:35.020]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[1:31:35.420 --> 1:31:41.020]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know

[1:32:06.380 --> 1:32:10.860]  Julian New York writes I love this product. I feel great. It worked immediately
[1:32:11.100 --> 1:32:15.900]  You can feel the cleansing right away other products don't work right away like this one does
[1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:23.500]  Mrs. Luella from Missouri writes My daughter has lost 27 pounds. She loves the tea and David from Tennessee writes
[1:32:23.740 --> 1:32:27.740]  My wife has a lot of digestive problems and the tea really helps her a lot

[1:32:34.060 --> 1:32:41.500]  No, I I mean it really works. No, I mean it really works be one of the many testimonies that we receive every month

[1:32:52.060 --> 1:33:00.060]  You know the number 928-308-0408 be our next testimony. You love us and we love you
[1:33:04.700 --> 1:33:10.540]  Okay, we have more details on this you got demonstrations down the street somebody's on his own property
[1:33:10.540 --> 1:33:13.980]  With a gun strapped to his leg may end up being a provocateur
[1:33:14.780 --> 1:33:19.340]  Their favorite thing to do though is going to find meth heads drug addicts get them at a bar to
[1:33:19.980 --> 1:33:23.500]  Hey, we ought to go after the president. Yeah sounds good more drinks
[1:33:24.140 --> 1:33:29.180]  And months later in court the cases always get dropped and it comes out. It was staged
[1:33:30.380 --> 1:33:33.660]  Same thing's happening with these muslim terrorists, you know white al-qaeda
[1:33:34.460 --> 1:33:39.580]  The same thing happened with the black al-qaeda in new york new jersey pennsylvania florida
[1:33:39.580 --> 1:33:41.580]  Michigan
[1:33:41.660 --> 1:33:43.340]  Case after case
[1:33:43.340 --> 1:33:48.140]  They do this where they just provocateur somebody to shoot their mouths off and then bust them
[1:33:49.420 --> 1:33:51.420]  Now the same reporters on
[1:33:52.940 --> 1:33:57.580]  MSNBC are saying if you say the word socialism, that's racist
[1:33:58.780 --> 1:34:04.540]  You're not allowed to say that now just like our youtube videos are getting banned for having this obama socialist poster
[1:34:04.540 --> 1:34:11.820]  Not allowed to talk bad about him to lampoon the president any other president you can you can't them and it's racial politics
[1:34:11.900 --> 1:34:13.900]  and a lot of these reporters
[1:34:14.140 --> 1:34:18.220]  I noticed they're even always making sure it's black reporters that say it's racist
[1:34:18.940 --> 1:34:22.140]  And I think that's so whites get insulted and do become racist
[1:34:22.380 --> 1:34:29.500]  It's really meant to get tension and fighting going on. It's very very clear. This is divide and conquer or tribal warfare
[1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:31.740]  The great game balkanization
[1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:36.940]  That's how the british controlled india where you'd have one brit for every thousand indians in some areas
[1:34:36.940 --> 1:34:38.940]  Some areas one brit for every hundred
[1:34:39.100 --> 1:34:47.420]  Uh, and gondi had to go around for 20 years as I said yesterday just getting the people to come together against the offshore empire
[1:34:48.540 --> 1:34:53.340]  We have to first identify that an offshore empire of private banks dominates america
[1:34:54.220 --> 1:35:00.620]  And so I did you suddenly notice when obama got elected? I mean, I don't care if it's a white black chinese mexican asian doesn't matter
[1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:02.860]  Uh, it could be
[1:35:02.860 --> 1:35:06.540]  You know somebody with green skin for all I care as long as they care about freedom these reporters
[1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:09.340]  But suddenly like half the reporters are black now
[1:35:10.380 --> 1:35:13.500]  And there's some psi op going on there so that it
[1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:17.100]  It's very strange something's going on there. Why is
[1:35:17.980 --> 1:35:22.060]  13 of the population represented on some of these shows as half
[1:35:23.100 --> 1:35:27.260]  It's like an over representation. It's like meant to make a backlash and I've been noticing
[1:35:27.260 --> 1:35:35.020]  TV ads ads for the Shriners and ads for coca-cola and ads for because I'm watching more tv these days to analyze this
[1:35:35.580 --> 1:35:39.420]  It'll just show people saying mean things like I'm just in timberlake and I want to help burn victims
[1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:41.980]  Shut up. You stupid young punk, you know
[1:35:42.780 --> 1:35:47.100]  John elway says and then he he looks at him and says shut up old man. You filth
[1:35:47.900 --> 1:35:52.780]  And and it's like all to get us all fighting with each other. I'm seeing that in almost every ad now
[1:35:52.780 --> 1:35:58.540]  Like they're trained. They know we're angry. So they want to turn us against each other. This is a psi op folks
[1:35:58.780 --> 1:36:02.700]  This is conditioning now. I'm going to go to your calls for this hour of the next and into the fourth
[1:36:03.260 --> 1:36:07.180]  Matthew shame chris chris keith and others
[1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:12.780]  But details on this protesters seem with gun outside obama town hall now every day
[1:36:12.780 --> 1:36:17.180]  I see articles where they arrest people at their home because a neighbor sees them walking in with a rifle
[1:36:17.180 --> 1:36:22.140]  And the cops say they had two guns and 50 rounds. That's an arsenal. There's no law
[1:36:22.220 --> 1:36:24.380]  But we're arresting him in charging him and he's going to present
[1:36:27.020 --> 1:36:33.020]  President obama traveled to port smith new ham shirt to his D for what could be a rowdy town hall style meeting
[1:36:33.340 --> 1:36:38.140]  At the time when some foes of the health care overhaul have shouted down lawmakers holding similar events around the country
[1:36:38.460 --> 1:36:43.420]  You mean like specter gives out the cards randomly to 30 people on tv and 29 are against it
[1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:47.820]  And an old man gets up and said I came here to tell you I don't want this so a thug jumps up and grabs even
[1:36:47.900 --> 1:36:48.620]  You know
[1:36:48.620 --> 1:36:53.900]  Or or the father with a kid in the wheelchair that people come to his house and threaten to kill him because he dares stand up
[1:36:54.060 --> 1:36:56.940]  This is chicago mafia tactics nationwide
[1:36:57.100 --> 1:37:04.140]  And if we bend over and get pimped and get punked and become whores on the mac daddy's chain
[1:37:04.620 --> 1:37:06.300]  It's over folks
[1:37:06.300 --> 1:37:09.340]  Me i'm not getting in the pimps hoopty. It's over
[1:37:09.340 --> 1:37:16.300]  I'm not going along with david rockefeller in his pimp game obama is just a an enforcer for the new world order
[1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:23.500]  The following live videos from msnbc earlier msnbc ron allen reports that cameras filmed a protester
[1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:26.300]  With a handgun strap to his leg
[1:37:26.460 --> 1:37:31.260]  Before the meeting before obama arrived. This is down the street. The man was seen carrying a sign saying
[1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:34.220]  It's time to water the tree of liberty
[1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:35.900]  The man's tree of liberty by the way
[1:37:35.900 --> 1:37:39.740]  I have a shirt that says that on the back our gas and flag shirt. Let's put it up on screen
[1:37:40.060 --> 1:37:45.580]  The sign is revered to thomas jefferson who said the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time the blood of patriots and tyrants
[1:37:45.980 --> 1:37:50.300]  allen says portman police chief told him the man's gun is legal see because it is
[1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:53.820]  The only gun laws in this country originally were against concealed
[1:37:55.180 --> 1:37:59.900]  Because a criminal or a thug you were to carry arms openly is the sign of a freeman
[1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:05.020]  Only with treachery. So that's why they have a permit for a concealed carry
[1:38:05.020 --> 1:38:10.540]  They trick you with a lawyer mind game to go. Oh carry your gun get a permit for it concealed
[1:38:11.740 --> 1:38:16.220]  Because they have to under common law give you a permit for something that is illegal
[1:38:16.540 --> 1:38:18.940]  Thus setting the precedent that all gunnerships illegal
[1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:20.620]  This is part of them
[1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:24.460]  They the the law is actually a codified religion
[1:38:25.020 --> 1:38:27.180]  And the court law school will actually teach you this
[1:38:27.740 --> 1:38:31.660]  It's a roman civil law that they're moving us on to off the mosaic and off the
[1:38:31.660 --> 1:38:34.940]  Of the germanic anglo-saxon common law
[1:38:36.220 --> 1:38:40.220]  allen says that portman's police told him the gun was legal because he's on private property
[1:38:40.220 --> 1:38:43.500]  He is on the grounds of a nearby church police said his gun is registered
[1:38:43.580 --> 1:38:46.700]  And he can keep it on him as long as it is not concealed. So then the
[1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:49.820]  The message is it's registered you don't need to be registered there
[1:38:50.060 --> 1:38:52.300]  The police are obviously keeping a close eye on this man
[1:38:52.460 --> 1:38:56.860]  And i suspect he won't be there when the president arrives a few hours time allen told viewers
[1:38:56.860 --> 1:39:02.700]  So we're going to go over that and the secret service towed away from the scene of the president's town hall
[1:39:02.700 --> 1:39:06.860]  Portsmouth for security reasons after a bomb-stiffing dog circled the vehicle several times
[1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:11.660]  You know the dog that's fat and gets a biscuit and it'll you know the cops have been caught on video laughing
[1:39:11.660 --> 1:39:15.900]  These they got a dog that'll alert to a fire hydrant that is marijuana
[1:39:16.460 --> 1:39:20.700]  You know they get flash out and he always says there's pot even if it's a truckload of nuns
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:26.700]  Officials said secret service bomb had hit on the truck, but they did not say whether or not there was specific threat
[1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:28.860]  See it's all color of law
[1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:35.660]  So you're going to see more and more of this and you're going to see people this guy may not be a provocateur
[1:39:36.460 --> 1:39:39.100]  That people are getting mad. They're saying they're ready for revolution
[1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:44.940]  So because the globalists are committing revolution against us. They're overthrowing our country our bill of rights our constitution
[1:39:44.940 --> 1:39:52.140]  But look for them to bust methods or thugs or or some provocateurs or stage something. I'm telling you it
[1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:57.420]  It's everybody is waking up to the lies. Everybody knows everything. Obama says is a lie
[1:39:57.900 --> 1:40:00.540]  They hoped he wouldn't be a liar like bush. They found out he is
[1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:04.940]  Kurt Nemo, we need more stories from you and watson's and from erin that
[1:40:05.740 --> 1:40:07.900]  analyzing this play by play because
[1:40:08.620 --> 1:40:13.900]  Because it's now here the people know they're under tyranny. They're waking up ron paul's done his job
[1:40:13.900 --> 1:40:16.700]  We've done our job many others have done their job
[1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:18.700]  but
[1:40:18.700 --> 1:40:22.380]  I really don't want this to get violent because if we can keep it peaceful. We're going to beat them
[1:40:22.780 --> 1:40:25.180]  Violence is only on the side of the establishment
[1:40:25.980 --> 1:40:29.180]  Though I will tell you more people start walking around with guns on their side
[1:40:29.260 --> 1:40:33.260]  It may just completely intimidate the bankers and they may shut down for a few years again
[1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:37.180]  Uh, I don't know six one way half a dozen the other regardless
[1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:39.100]  I got chills
[1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:46.300]  From the time I wake up the time I go to bed Kurt Nemo writer for info wars.com the webmaster the the the main editor for info wars.com
[1:40:46.620 --> 1:40:48.620]  Are you getting the same chills?
[1:40:48.780 --> 1:40:51.260]  Yeah, definitely. Um, you've covered this pretty well
[1:40:51.420 --> 1:40:56.540]  I'm not sure if this is a sci-op or just a concerned citizen going out there and expressing his constitutional right
[1:40:57.340 --> 1:41:05.020]  Regardless msnbc, which is totally opposed to any kind of debate in the health care or obama care
[1:41:05.500 --> 1:41:07.340]  debate is um
[1:41:07.340 --> 1:41:09.340]  Exploiting this news story big time
[1:41:12.540 --> 1:41:15.420]  I have to say msnbc is worse than cnn
[1:41:16.620 --> 1:41:17.980]  It is
[1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:19.980]  Every show I see they say
[1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:27.340]  Any criticism of obama is racism now now remember newsweek had the headline we're all socialists now remember that
[1:41:27.660 --> 1:41:28.380]  Oh, yeah
[1:41:28.380 --> 1:41:34.140]  But I mean you're not that they're taking our videos down kurt. We're not allowed to call them socialists
[1:41:34.140 --> 1:41:39.340]  Well, of course not because they want to dominate the discussion and they've got the corporate media in their pocket
[1:41:39.580 --> 1:41:43.820]  But there's no doubt now that they want to restrict free speech the hate crime bill that passed the house
[1:41:43.980 --> 1:41:45.740]  We've read the subsections on air
[1:41:45.740 --> 1:41:50.940]  It says that if you say anything and that someone for seven years ever acts on it
[1:41:51.740 --> 1:41:57.340]  Then you federal felony they have the cyber bullying act that says if you hurt someone's feelings you go to prison
[1:41:57.500 --> 1:42:02.620]  I mean these people really mean to take over our government. I mean have you seen the uh
[1:42:02.620 --> 1:42:09.580]  The sections of the bill where cps will visit all parents and all old people all seniors
[1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:12.380]  Must go visit elder cps and be enrolled
[1:42:12.700 --> 1:42:18.860]  Well, I mean this is total takeover the carbon bill that passed the house says you get yearly carbon inspections
[1:42:19.020 --> 1:42:21.980]  I mean, we're gonna have these scumbag filthy bureaucrats
[1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:25.420]  Literally urinating all over us and sucking off of us
[1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:29.100]  Yeah, and you know, it's interesting that john connor's would say
[1:42:29.100 --> 1:42:34.620]  Oh, you know, we don't have time to read these bills that they're doing this precisely because they don't want the people to look at this
[1:42:34.620 --> 1:42:37.980]  Stuff or they don't want to say that that's the talking point. You're right
[1:42:38.140 --> 1:42:42.540]  They even said on seeing in and the white house says it's key that this be done quickly or they're not going to get it
[1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:44.940]  They admit they're bum rushing us go ahead
[1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:50.300]  Exactly they're bum rushing us and they've got the corporate media in their hip pocket and especially msnbc
[1:42:50.540 --> 1:42:53.420]  This is going to be chris mathews and the whole team over there
[1:42:53.420 --> 1:42:59.340]  Rachel maddow and the rest are going to go crazy on this news story later today. You bet your bottom dollar on that and they're
[1:42:59.340 --> 1:43:01.340]  Going to continue to try to characterize
[1:43:01.980 --> 1:43:09.660]  Concerned americans patriotic americans as gun wielding nutcases because they are poverty. These people aren't really liberals in the sense
[1:43:10.380 --> 1:43:16.380]  I've met some of them. They are cold blooded. They know it's about dominating. They know they're a criminal class
[1:43:16.620 --> 1:43:20.060]  They love the swat teams the fema camps the militarization
[1:43:20.060 --> 1:43:26.860]  I mean look at the dailies the mafia family. They want total gun bans. Of course the mafia wants you disarmed
[1:43:29.420 --> 1:43:31.180]  Right
[1:43:31.180 --> 1:43:36.780]  Well, they've they've tried to gild us and the gun culture is taken back over the liberals are buying guns now
[1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:39.420]  They're they're losing on every front cart
[1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:45.980]  Do you agree with me that they're going to have to stage something or provocateur something like this in the next few weeks or
[1:43:45.980 --> 1:43:52.620]  It's it's just curtains for them. Well, it's critical this month now that congress is in in recess and this uh
[1:43:53.260 --> 1:44:00.620]  You know these these people are protesting against obama care are really getting you know a lot of exposure and people are beginning to
[1:44:00.620 --> 1:44:03.820]  Join them they're going to have to do something in the next couple weeks here
[1:44:03.980 --> 1:44:07.660]  Otherwise this bills is going to flounder in congress because people aren't going to let it go through
[1:44:08.140 --> 1:44:12.140]  And the cap and trades dying but notice they plan to pass all this in october
[1:44:12.140 --> 1:44:16.140]  That's when they say they plan to pass it the gun control the open borders
[1:44:16.940 --> 1:44:24.620]  The new war funding the the socialist health care the eugenics health care not even socialist the scam health care the looting health care
[1:44:26.140 --> 1:44:28.140]  They have got to have a stage crises
[1:44:29.020 --> 1:44:33.500]  And I think it's going to be the flu hysteria or do you think it could be something else curt?
[1:44:34.300 --> 1:44:39.820]  I think the flu is right on I think it's spot on it's precisely what they're going to use that this autumn to uh
[1:44:39.820 --> 1:44:44.780]  Bring in their martial law. I really believe that's it as far as this this incident goes
[1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:49.100]  This is going to set the stage for the uh debates that are coming up in the next couple weeks
[1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:52.460]  You know they're going to they're going to tighten security of these town hall meetings
[1:44:52.540 --> 1:44:57.260]  They're going to use this as a as a pretext to clamp down on people, you know, um, you know
[1:44:58.060 --> 1:45:00.060]  Getting at these meetings and and protesting
[1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:05.020]  Exactly and they're saying it's unamerican pelosi your astroturf your nazis
[1:45:05.020 --> 1:45:10.460]  To go out and they're saying it's all staged. It was so telling though. They randomly give out
[1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:14.220]  30 cards 29 are against the health care outside
[1:45:14.300 --> 1:45:18.380]  It's 10 to 1 against it and seeing in Lydon said it was 50 50
[1:45:18.780 --> 1:45:22.060]  Right. Well, even a big poll states more than 50 percent or close to 50 percent
[1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:25.100]  We know that it's it's closer to 70 percent of people are opposed to this
[1:45:25.500 --> 1:45:27.660]  But you I'm talking about at the events, but I mean
[1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:30.060]  I mean
[1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:35.260]  Kurt this bill's even worse than I thought we're finding new stuff in this 1300 page behemoth
[1:45:35.660 --> 1:45:40.780]  Well now more than what 2000 page. I mean this it's it's it's even freaking me out kurt
[1:45:41.180 --> 1:45:46.140]  Everybody gets a cps visit even if you're not on government government trough
[1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:51.820]  I mean, I'm not letting the cps or the home inspectors or any of these communists in my house
[1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:59.100]  And they're not even communists. They're banker thieves. They're bank robbers. I'm not letting the parasites you get enough off of me
[1:45:59.100 --> 1:46:04.620]  I think of all the lazy dumb hordes this country's produced. They're just going to turn all this scum loose on us, Kurt
[1:46:05.260 --> 1:46:07.260]  I don't think hard working people can put up with it
[1:46:07.580 --> 1:46:13.100]  Even if we have 10 percent of people we resisting the cps visits and the bureaucratic intrusions in our lives
[1:46:13.500 --> 1:46:18.140]  That's a major problem for them. They can't they can't stop that and um, they're gonna have big time problems
[1:46:18.380 --> 1:46:22.860]  But they're engineering the economy where the only jobs are going to be parasite jobs. Yeah
[1:46:22.860 --> 1:46:28.300]  Well, I'm gonna tell the parasite something you got your job cut out for you
[1:46:30.140 --> 1:46:34.780]  Well at this point, you know, we've got millions of americans that have handguns and weapons that they cannot
[1:46:35.580 --> 1:46:40.700]  Expect to come to people's houses and just barge in without some kind of problems. You know, it's just not gonna happen
[1:46:41.180 --> 1:46:47.100]  Um, you know, like you say that most people are dumbed down and they'll allow this but the the minority is not gonna allow it
[1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:48.780]  And it's gonna be a big time problem
[1:46:48.780 --> 1:46:54.140]  That's right. The majority's gonna hate it, but they're gonna bend over to take it. They admit the feds admit in 2000
[1:46:54.140 --> 1:46:57.580]  And now today the census where they demand that you fill out
[1:46:57.980 --> 1:47:02.380]  You know, they have different forms. Some people get a 200 questions. Some get a 49 some get a nine questions
[1:47:02.380 --> 1:47:04.540]  Some get a four questions. Some get two questions
[1:47:05.340 --> 1:47:07.420]  They're they can only ask under the fifth amendment
[1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:12.940]  How many people live here to apportion the members of congress for your state? That's it
[1:47:12.940 --> 1:47:19.420]  And in addition to that, they've got this irs bill where they want to uh, tax your handguns. You they send you a form and
[1:47:19.740 --> 1:47:23.580]  You've got to indicate how many guns you have and they want to tax them and fingerprint you
[1:47:23.820 --> 1:47:26.220]  But that was the issue i'm making curt is that
[1:47:27.100 --> 1:47:30.220]  They came to my door in 2000 and said you didn't fill all this out
[1:47:30.620 --> 1:47:34.540]  And I said I told you two people live here me and my girlfriend now my wife
[1:47:35.100 --> 1:47:39.020]  And I said leave and the guy got smart with me with those little badge and I said listen
[1:47:39.020 --> 1:47:44.140]  And I mean, I'm not going to say what I said, but I said get off my porch right now
[1:47:44.700 --> 1:47:47.980]  And he understood and left and he said the constitution says
[1:47:48.700 --> 1:47:52.700]  All they need to do is all they can do is is find out how many people live in a residence
[1:47:52.780 --> 1:47:57.500]  It's it's for you know, the census is for that. It's not for you know, anything here's the deal
[1:47:57.580 --> 1:47:59.580]  I could barely control myself then
[1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:05.100]  And that's the thing is that I just can't lick their boots. It's not that I won't give in and suck their boots
[1:48:05.100 --> 1:48:08.860]  I can't do it. I can't put up with it anymore
[1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:11.580]  Last one was in the airport
[1:48:11.820 --> 1:48:15.260]  Meetings are an example of you know thousands of people
[1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:21.820]  Uh with the exact same attitude. They don't want to be told by the government what they can and cannot do and what they will do
[1:48:23.020 --> 1:48:26.380]  We're not alone. There's there's thousands millions of us out there
[1:48:26.380 --> 1:48:29.580]  Well, you posted the articles about governors opposed the department of defense
[1:48:29.980 --> 1:48:33.980]  Emergency powers and you read it they say the pentagon is taken over the states
[1:48:33.980 --> 1:48:37.100]  I mean, it's not out. Let's don't say in this five years ago now
[1:48:37.260 --> 1:48:38.380]  It's governors folks
[1:48:38.380 --> 1:48:44.620]  This is really happening and every governor that says no better not have a mistress better never achieve on their wife
[1:48:44.860 --> 1:48:50.220]  Better never have taken a questionable donation because they are having the fbi go after every one of them
[1:48:50.380 --> 1:48:55.660]  Well, robert gate said it back in october that they were going to roll the uh, the state's national guards into the
[1:48:55.980 --> 1:48:56.860]  department of defense
[1:48:56.860 --> 1:49:02.540]  But what they plan to do and this is and it's amazing to me that the governors are standing up and resisting this
[1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:08.700]  Most of them are a bunch of wimps, but um, you know, it's uh, that's what's happening. People are starting to resist
[1:49:11.100 --> 1:49:12.460]  Well
[1:49:12.460 --> 1:49:15.180]  it's on because the offshore bankers can sit off in
[1:49:15.740 --> 1:49:18.140]  paris and uh, switzerland
[1:49:19.100 --> 1:49:23.820]  and uh in in in england and and in places like that and televieve
[1:49:24.620 --> 1:49:26.620]  and saudi arabia
[1:49:26.620 --> 1:49:35.580]  Riyadh they can sit back and order the takeover of the united states, but it's not going to work unless the false flag is the revolution
[1:49:35.900 --> 1:49:39.420]  Unless they want the revolution. I got to tell you kurt from every indicator
[1:49:39.500 --> 1:49:42.060]  I see I think they want as i've been saying for years
[1:49:42.220 --> 1:49:48.620]  But now i'm sure of it a giant bloody shooting war where where the public choose up the police and the government and like that
[1:49:49.820 --> 1:49:52.300]  argentinian professor of economics said here
[1:49:52.300 --> 1:49:56.380]  They want you to riot for a year because after a year you're totally give up
[1:49:56.620 --> 1:50:00.860]  Yeah, but the people in the people in argentin down there don't don't have guns
[1:50:01.500 --> 1:50:03.500]  And they do some but yeah
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:08.700]  You know, it they mostly will fill the streets of pop and pans and and made their voices known
[1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:12.860]  But in this country, we've got a large number of people at our arms, so it's not going to work
[1:50:12.860 --> 1:50:17.020]  They try to do this. It's just going to fall flat. Um, like you said, I don't think it's well, I agree
[1:50:17.020 --> 1:50:19.660]  It's not going to go well, but it's going to be murderous kurt
[1:50:19.660 --> 1:50:23.340]  I mean, could you imagine what this is going to look like because people are finally just going to go?
[1:50:23.420 --> 1:50:27.740]  Oh, that's it. You know walk and load. Let's just you know, I mean come on. You want it. Let's go
[1:50:28.780 --> 1:50:35.980]  I mean, I mean people understand that I mean this country's made up of pirates and killers and adventures all our ancestors were
[1:50:36.380 --> 1:50:38.380]  insanely vicious
[1:50:38.380 --> 1:50:42.460]  And all the fluoride and all the prozac isn't going to stop that spirit from rising up
[1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:45.580]  I mean, it's just I mean, it's going to I mean, it's going to be wild
[1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:51.900]  The average american's spoiling for a fight once you get them unmesmerized from the mind control people are like
[1:50:52.380 --> 1:50:56.220]  What? I'll go to bog guns. That's what's been happening the last year
[1:50:56.860 --> 1:51:00.380]  And I mean the government is out of their minds. Well, they're right back
[1:51:00.940 --> 1:51:06.860]  Would you give someone a hundred dollars for a ten dollar bill if you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form?
[1:51:06.860 --> 1:51:11.020]  That's exactly what you're doing. Hello. My name is dr. David Friedman
[1:51:11.020 --> 1:51:17.260]  According to the physician's desk reference many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed
[1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:22.380]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every hundred dollars you spend on these pills
[1:51:22.540 --> 1:51:27.100]  You're flushing 90 dollars down the toilet start absorbing the nutrients you swallow

[1:52:01.580 --> 1:52:04.220]  In the new world order's war against humanity
[1:52:04.780 --> 1:52:06.940]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:52:06.940 --> 1:52:10.220]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of
[1:52:11.100 --> 1:52:14.780]  World order that I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception
[1:52:15.180 --> 1:52:19.740]  Completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[1:52:19.980 --> 1:52:24.380]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one of this election

[2:08:18.620 --> 2:08:23.100]  okay i'm trying to shake the transmission up we're gonna have webster tarpley with us
[2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:30.060]  a half hour into the next hour so that's an hour and 22 minutes or so i had him coming on this week
[2:08:30.060 --> 2:08:35.340]  for part two of eugenics he didn't even scratch the surface of of his analysis of ecoscience this
[2:08:35.340 --> 2:08:41.340]  compendium this bible this blueprint of everything we see in the united nations biological diversity
[2:08:41.340 --> 2:08:49.020]  treaty the club of rome analysis the agenda 21 and the carbon tax carbon credit treaty
[2:08:50.700 --> 2:08:55.580]  we are starting in the next hour we're going to do 30 pure minutes on this with webster tarpley
[2:08:55.580 --> 2:09:03.980]  so 30 minutes on eugenics part two today but i must shift gears because i've read both his books
[2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:09.820]  on obama will put them up on screen they're both available at info wars dot com and i respect tarpley
[2:09:09.820 --> 2:09:14.060]  and and i that's who we have on here routinely people that have been right year after year decade
[2:09:14.060 --> 2:09:19.260]  after decade who have real foresight over the horizon understanding but i gotta be honest you know
[2:09:19.260 --> 2:09:26.220]  10 months 11 months before obama gets elected tarpley puts out this book saying they're gonna
[2:09:26.220 --> 2:09:30.700]  have thugs beating people up and they're gonna say you're a racist if you criticize any of his
[2:09:30.700 --> 2:09:35.580]  policies and he's bringing eugenics health care in the name of uh you know because i'm not even
[2:09:35.580 --> 2:09:39.500]  in a socialist world i'm against it but if you're gonna have it really have the people get it no
[2:09:39.500 --> 2:09:44.460]  no this is eugenics and it's in there and tarpley said that and just everything he said was right
[2:09:44.460 --> 2:09:52.460]  and now it's coming true with revelations level accuracy i mean it it makes nostradamus look
[2:09:52.460 --> 2:09:58.780]  ridiculous because he studied obama and how he works and but i want to take your calls first
[2:09:58.780 --> 2:10:02.780]  we're gonna do this different we're gonna take calls right now that at the bottom of the hour
[2:10:02.780 --> 2:10:07.020]  we'll continue with calls he's gonna break down but bottom line tarpley we're gonna go calls in
[2:10:07.020 --> 2:10:11.340]  three minutes but i want to just throw this question out the revolution is happening the
[2:10:11.340 --> 2:10:16.460]  left right all these callers emails the town halls i'm addicted to watching them online
[2:10:16.460 --> 2:10:21.740]  the clips i'm addicted to listening to c span every other caller says i'm not left or right
[2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:27.340]  i didn't like bush i thought obama would fix it he's a liar this is a this is liability protection
[2:10:27.340 --> 2:10:32.220]  for insurance companies and doctors to totally rip people off and carry out eugenics here's the
[2:10:32.220 --> 2:10:37.340]  subsection where cps visits all families here's the subsections where they give death education to
[2:10:37.340 --> 2:10:43.020]  the old you go look it up it's there obama says no it's boogeyman it's not there conure says how
[2:10:43.020 --> 2:10:47.260]  dare you read the bill uh his approval ratings plunging like you said it would be worse than
[2:10:47.260 --> 2:10:53.820]  carter or bush you were right when he was this messianic leader at 84 points now below 50 but
[2:10:53.820 --> 2:11:01.420]  they're gonna counter strike and so i see it in the next week or two i don't see them being able
[2:11:01.420 --> 2:11:07.980]  to stop total cratering and i mean physical revolution which i don't want because that's
[2:11:07.980 --> 2:11:14.620]  what they want but i don't see i see peaceful physical revolution being inevitability they're
[2:11:14.620 --> 2:11:20.220]  going to try to make it violent with provocateurs or what briefly do you agree with me that we are
[2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:28.380]  now entering true revolution we are now in it this is it this is 1776 1775 where it really started
[2:11:28.380 --> 2:11:33.740]  we are now entering it but the red coats are probably going to get a more abusive just today
[2:11:33.740 --> 2:11:39.500]  death threats to quadriplegics confirmed by the michigan state police uh old men getting up and
[2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:44.780]  asking a question thugs grabbing them a black men who are against obama being punched in the nose
[2:11:46.460 --> 2:11:53.340]  the news saying saying obama's for big government any criticism is racist he is now like hitler
[2:11:53.340 --> 2:11:58.780]  no one can criticize him i mean this i have never seen anything like this webster i am
[2:11:58.780 --> 2:12:04.540]  absolutely on the edge of my seat do you concur that we are entering the vortex i would not want
[2:12:04.540 --> 2:12:09.500]  to be premature with that but certainly entering it uh i think what we've got is the politics of
[2:12:09.500 --> 2:12:16.300]  weimar germany in other words germany between 1920 and 1930 and you can hear all the references
[2:12:16.300 --> 2:12:21.420]  going back to this each side is accusing each other of essentially being the uh the national
[2:12:21.420 --> 2:12:27.100]  socialist or the or the nazis i would call this a mass strike of the american people
[2:12:27.820 --> 2:12:35.260]  against genocidal wall street austerity obama is the bringer of wall street genocidal austerity
[2:12:35.260 --> 2:12:41.420]  budget cuts gouging of medicare in some ways it's a defense of the new deal institutions
[2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:45.100]  against the onslaught of obama because the centerpiece of what he's trying to do
[2:12:45.100 --> 2:12:49.900]  is to destroy medicare which is the great fruit of the late and he doesn't well here's the thing
[2:12:49.900 --> 2:12:53.500]  he does it with left cover and i'm watching the town hall that's another key that's another key
[2:12:54.220 --> 2:13:00.700]  about 40 percent or so get up and say i'm a democrat i'm sick of your wars and you're actually
[2:13:00.700 --> 2:13:06.540]  gutting health care people are actually reading it he really is a fascist like you said i think
[2:13:06.540 --> 2:13:11.900]  it's the fascist corporate state i think that's the only uh accurate term for this i wouldn't
[2:13:11.900 --> 2:13:17.820]  want to hasten too far into germany in the 1930s i would stick with my musolini comparison
[2:13:17.820 --> 2:13:24.460]  a somewhat softer version but still fascism the american people are rejecting this idea that they
[2:13:24.460 --> 2:13:29.820]  should be euthanized and indeed become the victims of genocide to save the bottom line
[2:13:29.820 --> 2:13:34.620]  of a private health plan or indeed of a government health plan they're rejecting the bailouts because
[2:13:34.620 --> 2:13:40.220]  that is where all the money went and they're also rejecting the spirit of oligarchy and elitism
[2:13:40.220 --> 2:13:46.940]  that that comes out of every pore of obama his disdain his hotar his effete snobbery
[2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:51.100]  that he inflicts on the people i also expect something to happen on the left that's what
[2:13:51.100 --> 2:13:57.500]  i've been working on this week right now you can say obama combines the worst aspects of carter
[2:13:57.500 --> 2:14:03.820]  he's got the economics of carter he's got the lost war of lbj of the lindenby johnson that would
[2:14:03.820 --> 2:14:10.540]  be vietnam today afghanistan and nixon with this stuff about indefinite detention state secrets
[2:14:10.540 --> 2:14:14.540]  that's right exactly webster you said he was going to have enemy lists you said he was going to
[2:14:14.540 --> 2:14:19.980]  release tattletale squads and i saw the preparation but it's you think this is america you know even
[2:14:19.980 --> 2:14:26.300]  alex jones has trouble manifesting seeing it you know manifest it's kind of like native americas
[2:14:26.300 --> 2:14:31.820]  when they first saw sailing ships couldn't even register them because they never had any context
[2:14:33.020 --> 2:14:38.780]  the the white house openly says tattle on your neighbors report any criticism thugs going to
[2:14:38.780 --> 2:14:45.980]  people's houses and death-threading them beating people up i mean they really are scum now this
[2:14:45.980 --> 2:14:50.780]  week i think is going to be critical for the emergence of some kind of opposition to obama's
[2:14:50.780 --> 2:14:56.460]  left if you will uh... the washington post here of sunday publishers and analysis from general
[2:14:56.460 --> 2:15:02.620]  mccrystal the current commander in in afghanistan this is one of the protagonist of torture he was
[2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:08.380]  one of the big torturers in iraq and now he's been named by obama handpicked by obama and the word
[2:15:08.380 --> 2:15:13.900]  is that the u.s is taking on security commitments and political commitments that will last at least
[2:15:13.900 --> 2:15:20.700]  a decade ten years and will cost more than the iraq war and everybody knows that mccrystal behind
[2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:26.620]  the scenes is demanding a doubling of the current u.s troops forty four thousand extra on top of
[2:15:26.620 --> 2:15:31.980]  the forty thousand just got added to the thirty thou so you'd be up to iraqi level he seems to be
[2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:37.020]  carrying out essentially a soviet strategy the soviets went for ten years with about a hundred
[2:15:37.020 --> 2:15:42.860]  and twenty or a hundred and thirty thousand i expect that the peace movement the peace movement
[2:15:42.860 --> 2:15:47.900]  has essentially been a wall right they've been uh... you know hiding because their foundation because
[2:15:47.900 --> 2:15:52.540]  they were bought and paid for by the ford and rockefeller and anberg yeah from the beginning
[2:15:52.540 --> 2:15:57.980]  so they're trying to be nice to obama but i think at a certain point the the anti-war base
[2:15:57.980 --> 2:16:02.460]  is also going to come into the picture so you'll have obama under under attack from different
[2:16:02.460 --> 2:16:06.780]  ideological directions and i think probably the best we can hope for in this situation
[2:16:06.780 --> 2:16:12.940]  is gridlock i think the forces arrayed in the congress right now are so evil on both sides
[2:16:12.940 --> 2:16:17.900]  that the best we can hope for is absolute gridlock they should fight each other to a standstill
[2:16:17.900 --> 2:16:23.180]  and give us a chance to really work out some issues economic program uh... how you put an
[2:16:23.180 --> 2:16:28.220]  end to these imperialist wars and also how you roll back this domestic police state which obama
[2:16:28.220 --> 2:16:33.820]  is pushing uh... as much as bush or some cases more than four no unlimited wiretapping of all
[2:16:33.820 --> 2:16:39.820]  internet no free speech tracking everyone no fly list for people with bad credit then you
[2:16:39.820 --> 2:16:45.100]  can't own a gun secret list i mean this out partly i mean this is off the chart
[2:16:45.660 --> 2:16:49.580]  it's it's uh... it's a new low in american history but again
[2:16:49.580 --> 2:16:53.580]  when the pendulum swings so far the the countervailing forces
[2:16:53.580 --> 2:16:58.140]  come into play and of course that's us so we better make sure that we come into play
[2:16:58.140 --> 2:17:01.020]  and and and get out there and and do something about it
[2:17:01.020 --> 2:17:05.420]  i am calling on leftist in particular who have not been doing their share of the fighting
[2:17:05.420 --> 2:17:09.900]  they've been they've been lying low and being nice to barky they've got to get out there and
[2:17:09.900 --> 2:17:15.100]  provide some leadership and that means we need large-scale peace demonstrations in washington
[2:17:15.100 --> 2:17:20.060]  dc this year in september in october before the weather turns bad we're going to need
[2:17:20.060 --> 2:17:25.740]  challengers running as democrats or greens or independents or whatever they are challenging
[2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:30.300]  obama in the two thousand and ten elections those people need to defend to declare now
[2:17:30.300 --> 2:17:33.340]  and we're going to need a primary challenge to obama
[2:17:33.340 --> 2:17:38.700]  uh... similar to what uh... eugene mccarthy and robert kennedy did to lindenby johnson
[2:17:38.700 --> 2:17:43.100]  back in nineteen sixty eight or similar to what teddy kennedy did to carter
[2:17:43.100 --> 2:17:48.060]  uh... in order to to contain this this presidency which is you say is running a
[2:17:48.060 --> 2:17:51.660]  muck it's uh... it's an anti-constitutional monstrosity
[2:17:51.660 --> 2:17:56.220]  we're gonna go to break come back and take calls for most of this hour and then and then get into eugenics but
[2:17:56.220 --> 2:18:00.460]  but webster
[2:18:00.460 --> 2:18:05.580]  you know the issue is what do you see them doing the order of false flags
[2:18:05.580 --> 2:18:09.660]  or will they just engage in the false flag of playing the race card
[2:18:09.660 --> 2:18:13.820]  saying all these people that oppose obama are clan members they're now
[2:18:13.820 --> 2:18:20.300]  saying that invoking race and really scaring a lot of kind of dumb down liberals
[2:18:20.300 --> 2:18:25.500]  who now really believe that if you have any political view in america outside
[2:18:25.500 --> 2:18:29.100]  the dogma of obama's handlers you are a clan member
[2:18:29.100 --> 2:18:32.620]  i mean this is outrageous poverty-pimping isn't it
[2:18:32.620 --> 2:18:36.300]  it is and it's of course this is what obama has done through his entire
[2:18:36.300 --> 2:18:38.940]  campaign if you if you dare to criticize him
[2:18:38.940 --> 2:18:42.300]  you would be labeled not by him directly but by his his minions his
[2:18:42.300 --> 2:18:46.460]  mermidans his axle rods and fava rose and poops
[2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:49.820]  and these people and now we've got these walk the white house websites we've got
[2:18:49.820 --> 2:18:52.780]  organizing for america we've got fight the smears
[2:18:52.780 --> 2:18:56.460]  we've got the uh... the flag website we've got the uh...
[2:18:56.460 --> 2:18:59.100]  reality check website we got a proliferation
[2:18:59.100 --> 2:19:02.060]  of websites and we'll have as many websites as ours
[2:19:02.060 --> 2:19:05.500]  uh... this is this is i would call this ideological terrorism
[2:19:05.500 --> 2:19:08.620]  that's that's what that's already terrorism and of course
[2:19:08.620 --> 2:19:14.060]  the door to fall flag wide open uh... with obama now in in difficulty
[2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:17.980]  and remember we're approaching the nine eleven point in obama's first term we
[2:19:17.980 --> 2:19:21.580]  are now where we were with bush back in august of
[2:19:21.580 --> 2:19:26.540]  2001 as a matter of fact the anniversary of the bin laden determined to strike
[2:19:26.540 --> 2:19:31.020]  in u.s. cia briefing was just a couple of days ago so we are now in that
[2:19:31.020 --> 2:19:35.820]  geometry so people who are looking at drills should continue to look
[2:19:35.820 --> 2:19:39.500]  well that's the other issue is they have the nine month rule that stayed some
[2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:43.900]  terror so we're entering that quadrant the next two months
[2:19:43.900 --> 2:19:49.500]  starting now and i'm having my youtube video shut down and youtube says
[2:19:49.500 --> 2:19:53.340]  that the that the hive says they're racist so

[2:24:24.620 --> 2:24:28.140]  and they said criticism of obama is now racism
[2:24:28.140 --> 2:24:32.060]  and they commented and bragged and youtube said yes when the commissariat
[2:24:32.060 --> 2:24:36.700]  when the political police or the Gestapo or the SA
[2:24:36.700 --> 2:24:39.820]  that's more akin to them the thugs in the streets say you're bad

[2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:03.900]  this is the quick question before i get my question here um about these
[2:25:03.900 --> 2:25:08.860]  documents like the sar statements and uh obama's health care plan
[2:25:08.860 --> 2:25:12.940]  the sar statements yeah well you know like the things that the sar says that
[2:25:12.940 --> 2:25:16.300]  if uh whatever you said earlier about the sar making the
[2:25:16.300 --> 2:25:19.340]  statement that anything said against obama would be
[2:25:19.340 --> 2:25:23.660]  you know likened as uh you know anti-obama
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:27.100]  racism yeah no no uh we we broke the news
[2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:30.780]  week and a half ago because a listener sent us said look the white house is
[2:25:30.780 --> 2:25:34.540]  announced report on anybody criticizing obama
[2:25:34.540 --> 2:25:37.980]  uh you know report us to authorities reported to us
[2:25:37.980 --> 2:25:41.580]  and now they've got them out doing this and then we've linked to the different
[2:25:41.580 --> 2:25:45.660]  bills we've linked to tom daschle's quotes who helped write it
[2:25:45.660 --> 2:25:51.420]  uh i mean go read it i mean we've we we've posted a whole bunch of articles
[2:25:51.420 --> 2:25:54.780]  that then have links to the subsections
[2:25:54.780 --> 2:25:59.180]  um page ends i mean we have an article right now about cps visiting
[2:25:59.180 --> 2:26:03.340]  all parents homes uh you can go read the bill or like when they had national
[2:26:03.340 --> 2:26:07.100]  compulsory service in the bill it said national compulsory service people
[2:26:07.100 --> 2:26:11.900]  couldn't believe it in another bill or how they
[2:26:11.900 --> 2:26:16.300]  people couldn't believe that he won a national service even when he gave speeches
[2:26:16.300 --> 2:26:19.980]  and his chief of staff gave speeches and those are in the obama deception
[2:26:19.980 --> 2:26:23.980]  people didn't believe me that obama was the key person getting the votes
[2:26:23.980 --> 2:26:27.660]  for the banker bailout but we have nancy pelosi bragging and obama
[2:26:27.660 --> 2:26:31.260]  bragging and him on the senate floor saying you've got to pass this
[2:26:31.260 --> 2:26:34.700]  uh webster do you want to tell him about the health care bill about the rationing
[2:26:34.700 --> 2:26:40.780]  and all this well the the bill itself uh i think it does not
[2:26:40.780 --> 2:26:44.380]  spell a lot of these things out i would just note that that some of the things
[2:26:44.380 --> 2:26:49.420]  that are most dangerous were already passed in the stimulus in particular
[2:26:49.420 --> 2:26:52.860]  there was two billion dollars in the stimulus for something called
[2:26:52.860 --> 2:26:57.180]  national coordinator for health information technology
[2:26:57.180 --> 2:27:00.300]  at the national institutes of health i take it here in
[2:27:00.300 --> 2:27:03.980]  in Bethesda so national coordinator for health information
[2:27:03.980 --> 2:27:08.140]  technology um you have to realize that the people who are going to staff these
[2:27:08.140 --> 2:27:11.980]  boards are uh malthusians right in the same way that holdren is
[2:27:11.980 --> 2:27:16.220]  and they believe that's obama's brother is involved in it and he says
[2:27:16.220 --> 2:27:19.260]  no health care for old people but i mean webster what are you saying
[2:27:19.260 --> 2:27:23.100]  i mean i've scanned over the bill i actually i actually have a rundown here
[2:27:23.100 --> 2:27:27.260]  with the pages and i've checked it this is so nightmarish i can't even
[2:27:27.260 --> 2:27:31.420]  describe it you're saying there's some of these boards that are neutral that
[2:27:31.420 --> 2:27:34.220]  don't spell out what they're going to do for i'll give you an example what it
[2:27:34.220 --> 2:27:37.900]  says the boards will decide and people gone and looked at who's on the
[2:27:37.900 --> 2:27:41.340]  boards they're all making eugenics statements yes precisely
[2:27:41.340 --> 2:27:45.100]  there's one called med pack on steroids med pack is something that's been
[2:27:45.100 --> 2:27:49.420]  around for a while it has generally been blocked by congress so med pack on
[2:27:49.420 --> 2:27:53.580]  steroids means essentially the death panel like what people call the death
[2:27:53.580 --> 2:27:58.220]  panel would be med pack on steroids and this would be a bureaucracy similar to
[2:27:58.220 --> 2:28:02.060]  the british one that denies you care saying the calculation is if you're
[2:28:02.060 --> 2:28:04.780]  seventy five years old and overweight and you smoke
[2:28:04.780 --> 2:28:08.620]  then you'll have no value to society and there's no doubt and there's no doubt
[2:28:08.620 --> 2:28:12.220]  these bioethics boards are set up for that but you hear them on the news with
[2:28:12.220 --> 2:28:17.020]  the code words they say well uh there are too many
[2:28:17.020 --> 2:28:20.940]  you know useless test and then they won't even do the test on your heart
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:24.700]  to tell you you've got the blockage i mean i mean people say we're lying
[2:28:24.700 --> 2:28:29.020]  about england england admittedly rations care massively
[2:28:29.020 --> 2:28:32.300]  certainly i also think you've got to look at the people the part of the stuff
[2:28:32.300 --> 2:28:35.660]  is who's going to be carrying this out i mean you look at obama
[2:28:35.660 --> 2:28:40.140]  you look at the fact he was asked uh my mother is 75 years old and she wants
[2:28:40.140 --> 2:28:43.340]  to live this was back in june she wants to live
[2:28:43.340 --> 2:28:47.180]  so his answer to that was we can't make public policy based on subjectivity
[2:28:47.180 --> 2:28:51.100]  meaning the fact that you want to live is of no consequence to me
[2:28:51.100 --> 2:28:55.100]  and therefore he said he didn't know if he should keep his grandmother alive
[2:28:55.100 --> 2:28:59.260]  precisely he's got stories about that and then this is the famous uh if the
[2:28:59.260 --> 2:29:03.340]  operation is not suitable maybe just a pill will be good now that means
[2:29:03.340 --> 2:29:06.700]  essentially you'll be put into a hospice and given pain pills
[2:29:06.700 --> 2:29:10.460]  and and you'll die there um i think it's extremely
[2:29:10.460 --> 2:29:13.580]  uh a sinister the other story of course about his mother is
[2:29:13.580 --> 2:29:17.820]  that he had an ethical crisis because she had a hip replacement operation
[2:29:17.820 --> 2:29:22.460]  during the time she was battling cancer and he thought that this was a dubious
[2:29:22.460 --> 2:29:26.940]  ethical virtue this is the same man who has shoveled 24 trillion dollars
[2:29:26.940 --> 2:29:31.020]  across the room into the hands of these zombie bankers derivatives artists to
[2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:35.020]  hedge fund hyena let me ask the caller does that answer your question chris
[2:29:35.020 --> 2:29:38.300]  that question yeah but i wanted to get on to one quick thing

[2:33:40.380 --> 2:33:43.820]  hospital according to what i know but we can ask him the
[2:33:43.820 --> 2:33:47.180]  the issue is that's nothing i get emails every day going you liar
[2:33:47.180 --> 2:33:51.180]  there's no plan to forcibly inoculate there's no plan to make people take
[2:33:51.180 --> 2:33:54.700]  shots and i'm reading what the world health
[2:33:54.700 --> 2:33:57.980]  organization says i'm reading what the pentagon
[2:33:57.980 --> 2:34:02.060]  saying i'm reading what north com saying this is even on tv
[2:34:02.060 --> 2:34:05.660]  but then people go well they won't say if i've got to take shots or not
[2:34:05.660 --> 2:34:09.100]  all the nurses and doctors i know have been told you got to take it there's no
[2:34:09.100 --> 2:34:12.620]  law they're just saying you have to take it
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:16.940]  there's an executive order and then a un law a un treaty
[2:34:16.940 --> 2:34:20.620]  and so yes they are attempting just like with a smallpox shot
[2:34:20.620 --> 2:34:24.940]  six years ago to order all these first responders to take it 14 million of them
[2:34:24.940 --> 2:34:28.300]  roughly in the u.s nurses doctors county workers federal
[2:34:28.300 --> 2:34:33.420]  workers police uh sheriffs deputies firemen
[2:34:33.420 --> 2:34:38.140]  key infrastructure folks they're even trying to tell bank people they got to
[2:34:38.140 --> 2:34:41.020]  take it and is this just a boondoggle to sell
[2:34:41.020 --> 2:34:45.580]  tens of billions of a worthless vaccine or is it something worse but go
[2:34:45.580 --> 2:34:48.060]  ahead and make your point about the vaccine sir you've been told you've
[2:34:48.060 --> 2:34:51.580]  got to take it yes um basically what happened was
[2:34:51.580 --> 2:34:56.460]  i work with the union and um we had a big fight with the commander
[2:34:56.460 --> 2:34:59.660]  and higher authority whoever that may be
[2:34:59.660 --> 2:35:03.660]  that they were trying to inoculate a thing anybody who has comes in contact
[2:35:03.660 --> 2:35:06.540]  with the these injured soldiers are the really
[2:35:06.540 --> 2:35:11.820]  sick need to take these inoculations and uh i came up with the point why the
[2:35:11.820 --> 2:35:16.540]  heck should i be taken an inoculation or why should i take an inoculation
[2:35:16.540 --> 2:35:19.900]  for something if these people are so sick what the heck are they doing out of
[2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:22.300]  their hospital rooms in the first place
[2:35:22.300 --> 2:35:26.140]  and it's too to get in the story real quick
[2:35:26.140 --> 2:35:30.780]  we won and they didn't force it but i'm afraid now with this uh swine flu
[2:35:30.780 --> 2:35:33.500]  uh thing coming out that they're going to come at us again
[2:35:33.500 --> 2:35:36.700]  but see that's my point they tell you it's the law you've got to do it when
[2:35:36.700 --> 2:35:39.180]  there's no law you say no you don't have to
[2:35:39.180 --> 2:35:43.980]  webster um let me just comment on that alexa the big problem with walter
[2:35:43.980 --> 2:35:47.100]  reed army hospital that that overraches all of this is
[2:35:47.100 --> 2:35:51.580]  it's being shut down uh the side of the health care debate that gets
[2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:55.020]  i think left out is where are the doctors supposed to come from
[2:35:55.020 --> 2:35:58.380]  and where are the hospitals that you're going to need because you do need them
[2:35:58.380 --> 2:36:01.740]  walter reed is being shut down now if you go by bifesda
[2:36:01.740 --> 2:36:04.940]  on the naval center side they're building something there
[2:36:04.940 --> 2:36:09.100]  that they claim is going to replace walter reed but i am skeptical i see
[2:36:09.100 --> 2:36:11.820]  all of this as a project of cutting uh here in
[2:36:11.820 --> 2:36:15.100]  washington dc we've lost two or three hospitals
[2:36:15.100 --> 2:36:19.100]  over the last uh ten years or so and it's getting to be a real drama
[2:36:19.100 --> 2:36:23.580]  where's the nearest hospital and you you and others have pointed out
[2:36:23.580 --> 2:36:29.660]  that uh that's what this banker system is nothing for the people
[2:36:29.660 --> 2:36:34.380]  everything paid as interest on imaginary fiat black hole
[2:36:34.380 --> 2:36:39.340]  of debt they create to swallow up the world and i want to make the point
[2:36:39.340 --> 2:36:42.620]  cognor says he can't read the multi-thousand page bill and then it's
[2:36:42.620 --> 2:36:46.060]  bad to read the bill now they've gone from lying and saying they read them to
[2:36:46.060 --> 2:36:49.980]  saying it's bad to read them if they can't read a bill
[2:36:49.980 --> 2:36:53.100]  but then they tell us we're liars about what's in it when i have scanned it and
[2:36:53.100 --> 2:36:56.220]  i have it here then how can they administer
[2:36:56.220 --> 2:37:02.380]  government health care if obama seven months ago first thing he did in office
[2:37:02.380 --> 2:37:05.420]  and he said this on tv was they were going to make vets
[2:37:05.420 --> 2:37:10.780]  pay for their own insurance and health care i mean that shows who they are if
[2:37:10.780 --> 2:37:14.780]  the troops don't get health care and and they're making them pay for their
[2:37:14.780 --> 2:37:19.740]  lunches at romstein in germany when their legs are blown off these aren't old men
[2:37:19.740 --> 2:37:24.300]  if they're breaking the contracts with the troops folks none of you are getting
[2:37:24.300 --> 2:37:27.580]  anything you're getting an aspirin you're getting euthanized
[2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:32.220]  this is what the white house science are says now they're getting rama manuals
[2:37:32.220 --> 2:37:36.460]  brother that put that salon article up for folks in the white house who openly
[2:37:36.460 --> 2:37:43.020]  calls for killing the old i mean you can't make this stuff up people if they
[2:37:43.020 --> 2:37:46.460]  can't read the bill they're not gonna be able to
[2:37:46.460 --> 2:37:51.100]  oh i'm sorry alex let me just add in terms of congressman conures
[2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:55.820]  uh if you go to the black agenda report that the fine website of glenn ford
[2:37:55.820 --> 2:37:59.820]  they have quotes from conures there where he says i am very disappointed with
[2:37:59.820 --> 2:38:03.180]  obama obama's health care plan is junk
[2:38:03.180 --> 2:38:06.700]  now i wonder if they're going to accuse conures of being a racist
[2:38:06.700 --> 2:38:12.060]  because he criticizes obama yeah we had that up on info wars dot com
[2:38:12.060 --> 2:38:16.220]  right now but what conures is saying he wants the power of the democratic party
[2:38:16.220 --> 2:38:19.660]  to stay there uh obama is for the globalist
[2:38:19.660 --> 2:38:23.100]  so he knows he's he's gonna discredit his own system
[2:38:23.100 --> 2:38:25.900]  that's his job is to carry the ball down the field
[2:38:25.900 --> 2:38:31.020]  um conures is more of just a punk uh politico and yeah conures says we're
[2:38:31.020 --> 2:38:33.820]  going to play the clip coming up conures says
[2:38:33.820 --> 2:38:38.220]  that he's going to destroy us and that we're all going to get thrown out
[2:38:38.220 --> 2:38:41.820]  so i mean conures is doing that from a slimy perspective
[2:38:41.820 --> 2:38:44.860]  webster let me just add the the other thing here is
[2:38:44.860 --> 2:38:48.620]  what is actually going on i'm afraid people say obama wants that the
[2:38:48.620 --> 2:38:52.540]  government take over health care i i don't think that's the goal at all
[2:38:52.540 --> 2:38:57.180]  what i see is that obama is in bed with the insurance companies he had 25
[2:38:57.180 --> 2:39:00.380]  insurance executives this gives them liability protection
[2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:04.140]  it gets pushed over to the government right it gives them a bailout above all
[2:39:04.140 --> 2:39:08.220]  we we should never forget most of these insurance companies are bankrupt
[2:39:08.220 --> 2:39:13.180]  because of derivative speculation a i g was what an insurance company it's
[2:39:13.180 --> 2:39:17.100]  bankrupt a million time because it set up a hedge fund in england exactly what
[2:39:17.100 --> 2:39:20.780]  the heart for the heart for it got 3.5 billion off the bailout their
[2:39:20.780 --> 2:39:24.380]  bankrupt metlife just reported 1.5 billion losses
[2:39:24.380 --> 2:39:28.380]  from derivatives in the second quarter the obama plan is this
[2:39:28.380 --> 2:39:31.260]  talk about single payer well not even talk about it
[2:39:31.260 --> 2:39:35.020]  talk about a government option but when push comes to shove
[2:39:35.020 --> 2:39:39.740]  you give up the government option but you keep the individual mandate the
[2:39:39.740 --> 2:39:44.700]  individual mandate means you are coerced to buy insurance
[2:39:44.700 --> 2:39:48.060]  from a for-profit private insurance company that's
[2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:51.740]  deregulated that's got you know rapacious executives
[2:39:51.740 --> 2:39:55.740]  you can't sue them and your life depends on it let me just tell you the
[2:39:55.740 --> 2:39:59.100]  scenario was in the washington post here last
[2:39:59.100 --> 2:40:03.900]  friday we have a guy called henry aran of the brookings institution this is a
[2:40:03.900 --> 2:40:07.100]  this is the left-wing uh... the sort of democratic party think tank
[2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:11.340]  he says my advice to obama is this put up a bold front
[2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:14.860]  of wanting a public option and at the end of the day
[2:40:14.860 --> 2:40:20.460]  say senator grassley senator nz in the name of unity and republican support
[2:40:20.460 --> 2:40:23.900]  i will give up the public option if you climb on board
[2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:27.820]  which is really the corporate fascist bailout that republicans want
[2:40:27.820 --> 2:40:31.180]  and then the and then the republican horde will feel like they've won
[2:40:31.180 --> 2:40:34.780]  and then the democrats will all suck their thumbs patheticly and that that
[2:40:34.780 --> 2:40:37.980]  is the fascist corporate statement which what that talks about then
[2:40:37.980 --> 2:40:42.540]  is a government sponsored compulsory cartel for the benefit of the private
[2:40:42.540 --> 2:40:46.300]  companies to drive down care to cut your life short
[2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:50.540]  but to pop up the derivatives debt of these private insurance companies by the
[2:40:50.540 --> 2:40:53.580]  way scenario by the way they're saying that so
[2:40:53.580 --> 2:40:57.420]  so what happens is everybody gets cruddy health care basically now
[2:40:57.420 --> 2:41:00.700]  and the insurance companies just stop providing it and no longer have
[2:41:00.700 --> 2:41:04.780]  liability because in this bill if they're involved in any way
[2:41:04.780 --> 2:41:08.460]  with the government program they're now given liability protection the worst
[2:41:08.460 --> 2:41:12.300]  possible thing we could imagine and so now health care even goes
[2:41:12.300 --> 2:41:16.060]  to hell faster in fact deaths from avoidable medical error
[2:41:16.060 --> 2:41:19.100]  more than doubled in the past decade investigation show
[2:41:19.100 --> 2:41:24.460]  this is out of the scientific american just cutting off the wrong legs leaving
[2:41:24.460 --> 2:41:28.460]  knives and scalpels inside people just hellish
[2:41:28.460 --> 2:41:32.300]  400 plus thousand dying a year from bad drug interactions
[2:41:32.300 --> 2:41:37.420]  all of that just like vaccine makers now all of big pharma now all of big
[2:41:37.420 --> 2:41:41.180]  medicine now taken over by the by the hedge funds as you said webster
[2:41:41.180 --> 2:41:45.100]  is now can just walk away and as you as we said
[2:41:45.100 --> 2:41:48.380]  off air you were we're no longer an industrial nation
[2:41:48.380 --> 2:41:52.620]  we're falling apart we can't support the high tech system we build
[2:41:52.620 --> 2:41:56.780]  and so now it just all goes down the drain and the elites jet off to switzerland
[2:41:56.780 --> 2:41:59.260]  for health care right the clinic in Zurich
[2:41:59.260 --> 2:42:03.260]  here's the other thing uh medicare will be looted and destroyed so what what
[2:42:03.260 --> 2:42:06.300]  johnson was able to put in place at the end of the new deal
[2:42:06.300 --> 2:42:09.820]  will be destroyed by obama so really the fight against obama
[2:42:09.820 --> 2:42:14.060]  is a fight to defend the existing new deal institutions which are vital for
[2:42:14.060 --> 2:42:18.060]  the for the survival of old people the other thing is obama's made a deal
[2:42:18.060 --> 2:42:22.060]  with big pharma but let's not forget them the pharmaceutical companies
[2:42:22.060 --> 2:42:26.140]  and he says i guarantee you that there will be no cheap prescriptions coming
[2:42:26.140 --> 2:42:28.940]  from canada and i guarantee you that we will not
[2:42:28.940 --> 2:42:32.620]  haggle we will not use the buying power of medicare
[2:42:32.620 --> 2:42:36.540]  to get the prices down on the prescription that guaranteed is cold
[2:42:36.540 --> 2:42:40.220]  bloodedly going to kill millions of people over the next decade who are
[2:42:40.220 --> 2:42:44.460]  surviving on those cheap drugs that in many cases are one third or less
[2:42:44.460 --> 2:42:49.260]  the price because americans pay the most because we're known as the smucks
[2:42:49.260 --> 2:42:53.260]  so therefore uh with obama he's going to get a hundred and fifty million dollars
[2:42:53.260 --> 2:42:57.100]  of income television advertising with harry and louise
[2:42:57.100 --> 2:43:00.780]  harry and louise the shields for the insurance company are now back supporting
[2:43:00.780 --> 2:43:03.580]  obama because that's the secret it's not
[2:43:03.580 --> 2:43:07.500]  at what when pelosi comes out and says the insurance companies of villains
[2:43:07.500 --> 2:43:11.340]  this is pure demagogy she's in bed with the private insurance company she's
[2:43:11.340 --> 2:43:14.700]  gotta make it look otherwise because you gotta remember
[2:43:14.700 --> 2:43:18.060]  62 percent of the democratic party wants a single payer
[2:43:18.060 --> 2:43:21.260]  and they're wondering why the hell they don't get anything and of course they
[2:43:21.260 --> 2:43:25.180]  will get nothing because because it's obama that's the ultimate answer
[2:43:25.180 --> 2:43:29.420]  is the reason that this exactly is the corporate fraud and
[2:43:29.420 --> 2:43:32.460]  that's what's so insane webster all these years we fought bush and his
[2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:36.700]  agenda we're now being called racist i want to go to calls right now but i
[2:43:36.700 --> 2:43:41.980]  briefly just wanted to have you uh they're erasing my videos and not videos
[2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:45.180]  where i'm yelling and screaming or not spoof sided to promote a
[2:43:45.180 --> 2:43:52.060]  joker t-shirt contest but they are racing very calm collected videos where i
[2:43:52.060 --> 2:43:55.500]  talk about how they want republicans and democrats to fight with each other
[2:43:55.500 --> 2:43:59.900]  to dissipate the awakening the revolution the general strike against
[2:43:59.900 --> 2:44:03.340]  government against both parties they want to make it partisan
[2:44:03.340 --> 2:44:07.740]  to divide and conquer to balkanize they will not let those videos go out on
[2:44:07.740 --> 2:44:10.460]  youtube every time they go viral they're erasing
[2:44:10.460 --> 2:44:14.460]  them calling them racist and the message is let us come together
[2:44:14.460 --> 2:44:18.380]  and now if that doesn't show and prove they are pimping race
[2:44:18.380 --> 2:44:22.140]  and that they this is so cold-blooded webster
[2:44:22.140 --> 2:44:27.260]  you can ask uh bill clinton who said that they played the race card on me in
[2:44:27.260 --> 2:44:31.180]  south carolina so uh this is simply the the obama
[2:44:31.180 --> 2:44:35.100]  method and it's deplorable and i'm sure there are many in the black community
[2:44:35.100 --> 2:44:38.380]  again the people over at black agenda report don't fall for that for one
[2:44:38.380 --> 2:44:40.860]  minute and i'm sure lots of people don't this is
[2:44:40.860 --> 2:44:44.780]  essentially i would call this ideological terrorism where you brand
[2:44:44.780 --> 2:44:48.940]  somebody as a racist because you can't refute them right it's like being
[2:44:48.940 --> 2:44:52.220]  told that you know if you were interested in nine eleven truth you were
[2:44:52.220 --> 2:44:57.820]  subversive or uh or or al-qaeda or whatever it was so uh this is just we've
[2:44:57.820 --> 2:45:02.540]  gone through a period of uh the war on terror the the the
[2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:05.740]  aftermath of nine eleven that was the great
[2:45:05.740 --> 2:45:08.300]  uh covert operation of the first part of the decade
[2:45:08.300 --> 2:45:12.220]  now we've got obama being used in an attempt to keep a lid on the entire
[2:45:12.220 --> 2:45:16.540]  situation but i don't think so i think as you say the power of the mass strike
[2:45:16.540 --> 2:45:19.980]  which is what you're seeing that's a mass strike movement among old people
[2:45:19.980 --> 2:45:23.180]  saying we don't want to be euthanized we don't want to become
[2:45:23.180 --> 2:45:27.100]  cannon fodder for genocide for these insurance companies and ultimately for
[2:45:27.100 --> 2:45:31.180]  the derivatives right so we're saying no to austerity no to cuts
[2:45:31.180 --> 2:45:35.020]  uh and we deserve but once we understand all that the bigger discussion
[2:45:35.020 --> 2:45:39.580]  here is how are they going to counter people saying no no no
[2:45:39.580 --> 2:45:43.260]  at every front they're booing republicans off the stage everywhere we've
[2:45:43.260 --> 2:45:45.900]  played the videos here the media won't touch that
[2:45:45.900 --> 2:45:50.060]  i'm saying it's like garlic or a cross or holy water
[2:45:50.060 --> 2:45:54.140]  to a vampire to show that republicans and democrats are being booed off the
[2:45:54.140 --> 2:45:59.500]  stage we see a real populist revolution of constitutional
[2:45:59.500 --> 2:46:05.180]  rebellion forming to really unseat the corporate criminals looting us
[2:46:05.180 --> 2:46:07.980]  and the media is trying to turn us on each other
[2:46:07.980 --> 2:46:11.260]  i'm saying the maximum effort has got to be unity
[2:46:11.260 --> 2:46:15.980]  against the bankers ought at the fed bring them to justice
[2:46:15.980 --> 2:46:19.260]  and they are really manifesting their tyranny
[2:46:19.260 --> 2:46:23.580]  by racing our videos by beating people up by going to people's houses and
[2:46:23.580 --> 2:46:27.180]  death-threading them i'm just confirming what you wrote in your book from
[2:46:27.180 --> 2:46:30.300]  studying him they really do want to turn america
[2:46:30.300 --> 2:46:34.460]  into a chicago mob run system and i don't think it's going to work i think
[2:46:34.460 --> 2:46:38.540]  it's going to have explosive ramifications right and i i think
[2:46:38.540 --> 2:46:42.700]  what what i personally try to do is to intervene in this with a program because
[2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:45.500]  you can have a mass movement but if you wish to
[2:46:45.500 --> 2:46:49.340]  get to the government if you want to govern if you want to take power
[2:46:49.340 --> 2:46:53.420]  include terms you've got to be able to solve these problems and i think that's
[2:46:53.420 --> 2:46:58.220]  going to require an economic program which uh would need to be discussed and
[2:46:58.220 --> 2:47:01.500]  therefore i hope if we can get to gridlock at the moment and there was a
[2:47:01.500 --> 2:47:04.940]  beacon simply block block this so-called health care
[2:47:04.940 --> 2:47:09.100]  reform but also block the cap and trade that's extremely important
[2:47:09.100 --> 2:47:12.300]  i would think that in the in the middle of all the troubles that obama is having
[2:47:12.300 --> 2:47:16.380]  it would also be possible to prevent the senate from passing
[2:47:16.380 --> 2:47:20.220]  this cap and trade monstrosity that the the house has already passed
[2:47:20.220 --> 2:47:23.580]  that's got to be stopped too because that's another stop we're going to cover
[2:47:23.580 --> 2:47:26.620]  that next hour i want to go back to calls but breaking news
[2:47:26.620 --> 2:47:30.220]  nimo has identified the supposed guy with the gun strapped on his hip
[2:47:30.220 --> 2:47:34.620]  the cops let pace around for the media which they wouldn't let anybody else do
[2:47:34.620 --> 2:47:39.660]  they would violate your rights he's got a i fb earpiece like i have
[2:47:39.660 --> 2:47:44.620]  only people in tv are only secret service type people
[2:47:44.620 --> 2:47:47.980]  law enforcement would have that only tv people
[2:47:47.980 --> 2:47:51.820]  this model is a professional grade because we know these we've got a bunch of
[2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:57.020]  them he's got a a professional grade one blow that up for folks who's please if
[2:47:57.020 --> 2:48:00.780]  you can he's got a professional grade one in
[2:48:00.780 --> 2:48:05.260]  that does not go with telephones and he looks just like a cop
[2:48:05.260 --> 2:48:09.260]  webster boy that sounds like provocaturing doesn't it
[2:48:09.260 --> 2:48:12.700]  and again that's why i say that with with obama you're getting the worst of
[2:48:12.700 --> 2:48:17.100]  nixon as well you're getting enemies lists uh nixon called it preventive
[2:48:17.100 --> 2:48:20.620]  detention now remember nixon wanted to bomb the uh
[2:48:20.620 --> 2:48:23.900]  the the the political convention and blame it on his enemies that's that's
[2:48:23.900 --> 2:48:27.100]  declassified right and and of course you know breaking
[2:48:27.100 --> 2:48:31.500]  into somebody's uh psychiatrist to try to find out what he was up to you know
[2:48:31.500 --> 2:48:35.260]  the olsberg psychiatrist breaking anyway he
[2:48:35.260 --> 2:48:39.420]  essentially secret intelligence agents running all over the place and in the
[2:48:39.420 --> 2:48:43.580]  obama case they're sometimes privatized right there sometimes foundation
[2:48:43.580 --> 2:48:47.980]  operatives but it's the same thing obama is the worst of carter the worst of lbj
[2:48:47.980 --> 2:48:51.820]  and the worst of nixon i think it's going to be almost impossible for him to
[2:48:51.820 --> 2:48:56.220]  stave off some kind of a rebellion inside his own party and i i would urge
[2:48:56.220 --> 2:49:00.380]  you get leftists the leftists have to get out there and do some heavy lifting
[2:49:00.380 --> 2:49:05.420]  uh it's it's important they just want to drink tea and feel important

[2:52:22.860 --> 2:52:26.540]  yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue

[2:53:59.820 --> 2:54:04.860]  the chief of police says that he he's he's it is legal for him to have the gun
[2:54:04.860 --> 2:54:08.220]  as long as it is not concealed it's a registered weapon and what's more the
[2:54:08.220 --> 2:54:11.420]  man is on private property a church ground there at the end of the the
[2:54:11.420 --> 2:54:14.540]  roadway and the church has apparently given him permission to be there
[2:54:14.540 --> 2:54:17.580]  the police are obviously keeping a close eye on this man and they're not going to
[2:54:17.580 --> 2:54:20.700]  get anywhere near the president and i suspect that he won't be here by the
[2:54:20.700 --> 2:54:23.340]  time the president gets here in just a couple of hours time
[2:54:23.340 --> 2:54:26.620]  but again for the most part things are very peaceful the police are keeping
[2:54:26.620 --> 2:54:30.220]  him on a second but to be really clear we're seeing the
[2:54:30.220 --> 2:54:34.140]  pictures right now you're seeing a guy has a gun in the open
[2:54:34.140 --> 2:54:37.580]  where we already know their concerns about every president's safety but
[2:54:37.580 --> 2:54:41.660]  certainly uh this historic president the 44th president of the united states
[2:54:41.660 --> 2:54:47.260]  and there's there's no uh the guy's just being allowed to stay there
[2:54:47.260 --> 2:54:51.580]  i've never been with anything you know you notice that in
[2:54:51.580 --> 2:54:55.340]  iraq sit on to walk around with 10 000 people with machine guns and he was
[2:54:55.340 --> 2:54:58.460]  fine and even till the 30s americans would take
[2:54:58.460 --> 2:55:02.780]  guns on their sides to court hearings in major cities
[2:55:02.780 --> 2:55:08.380]  famous linberg case he wore a sidearm into that
[2:55:08.380 --> 2:55:12.540]  this is how they operate oh my god the slaves have guns but this guy
[2:55:12.540 --> 2:55:17.420]  has got an i fb that only television people it's the professional flesh
[2:55:17.420 --> 2:55:21.260]  colored clear one flesh color down here clear up
[2:55:21.260 --> 2:55:26.380]  here that is hooked in for law enforcement he looks like secret service
[2:55:26.380 --> 2:55:30.860]  he looks like secret service i saw at the bill deberg group in virginia
[2:55:30.860 --> 2:55:34.380]  or he could be some private murk or he could be a listener who knows but he's
[2:55:34.380 --> 2:55:37.820]  got it's time to water the tree of liberty
[2:55:37.820 --> 2:55:41.740]  and you know we sell t-shirts and hats that say don't tread on me with a gas
[2:55:41.740 --> 2:55:45.820]  and flag and then it has the thomas jefferson quote on the back saying
[2:55:45.820 --> 2:55:49.260]  the blood of patriots and tyrants must water the tree of liberty
[2:55:49.260 --> 2:55:51.980]  from time to time
[2:55:52.940 --> 2:55:56.540]  just amazing that this is going on and we need to track down
[2:55:56.540 --> 2:56:00.860]  listeners who is that guy do you recognize him is he federal marshal
[2:56:00.860 --> 2:56:03.980]  because when because they're now saying ban protest
[2:56:03.980 --> 2:56:07.660]  because the citizens are evil number one threats gun owners
[2:56:07.660 --> 2:56:11.900]  number one threats the veterans just amazing we've got more video clips
[2:56:11.900 --> 2:56:15.100]  coming up next hour as they say any criticism of obama
[2:56:15.100 --> 2:56:20.140]  is racist and that if we were all given sodium pentothal or truth serum we
[2:56:20.140 --> 2:56:23.340]  would admit we were racist it's not that we don't want to turn our guns in
[2:56:23.340 --> 2:56:25.500]  it's not that we're against the government health care it's not that
[2:56:25.500 --> 2:56:29.980]  we're against cap and trade it's that we are racist
[2:56:29.980 --> 2:56:33.900]  and it's not going to work uh let's talk to i'm not talking to steven
[2:56:33.900 --> 2:56:38.700]  chicago he calls every day every day so steve you have a nice day i told you

[2:56:42.460 --> 2:56:46.380]  i guess there is there a uh provision
[2:56:46.380 --> 2:56:51.100]  in the health care bill that you know out for genocide
[2:56:51.100 --> 2:56:55.660]  uh yes it has provisions about rationing care limiting test
[2:56:55.660 --> 2:57:01.020]  uh and uh hospice and uh let me scan over this i've actually got the bill
[2:57:01.020 --> 2:57:04.460]  or it's uh i've got the sections boiled down that's 200 pages long the actual
[2:57:04.460 --> 2:57:09.020]  bills thousands and thousands and constantly changing but yes it does
[2:57:09.020 --> 2:57:12.700]  have well i mean take obama's brother let's put salon
[2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:16.620]  salon's not some right-wing publication we know with the headline obama's
[2:57:16.620 --> 2:57:20.860]  brother dr death there it is i mean this is the guy
[2:57:20.860 --> 2:57:24.620]  uh who your former writing partner has actually confronted and that got
[2:57:24.620 --> 2:57:28.380]  millions of views online or hundreds of thousands i saw in one video alone
[2:57:28.380 --> 2:57:31.900]  tell us about azekiel immanuel obama's
[2:57:31.900 --> 2:57:35.820]  dr death and that's not me saying that that's that's uh
[2:57:35.820 --> 2:57:40.700]  that's uh so long what's your tarp like well what i know about azekiel immanuel
[2:57:40.700 --> 2:57:45.420]  is that he's a he's a professor of bioethics now bioethics is a very very
[2:57:45.420 --> 2:57:50.300]  suspect uh academic specialty because essentially what it has to do with is
[2:57:50.300 --> 2:57:54.300]  making decisions about the end of life it's a eugenics board it's going to be
[2:57:54.300 --> 2:57:57.580]  it's going to be in favor of the insurance companies i regarded also as
[2:57:57.580 --> 2:58:01.500]  economic austerity in other words they want you to die early
[2:58:01.500 --> 2:58:04.700]  for the bottom line they say why are we spending so much money
[2:58:04.700 --> 2:58:08.780]  at the end of life when if people simply accepted the idea of death
[2:58:08.780 --> 2:58:12.620]  we could save all this money so we could speculate in more derivative so there's
[2:58:12.620 --> 2:58:16.940]  a there's a eugenics motivation and there's an economic austerity he's also
[2:58:16.940 --> 2:58:20.620]  said people with Alzheimer's and dementia should get no medical care
[2:58:20.620 --> 2:58:24.220]  whatsoever and he says that in speeches and on top of
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:28.060]  that and that's genocide right there
[2:58:28.060 --> 2:58:32.300]  having the health care gives people jobs in the economy it's this idea that
[2:58:32.300 --> 2:58:36.780]  that that having nice things hurts everybody and that the pie is only one
[2:58:36.780 --> 2:58:43.340]  size it's it's a classic oligarchal view

[3:01:01.180 --> 3:01:05.500]  and he didn't deny that the quadriplegic you know the guy who's paralyzed
[3:01:05.500 --> 3:01:10.380]  uh was going to get no no health care dingle says yeah we need to amend that
[3:01:10.380 --> 3:01:15.580]  i mean this is in there folks and the people at these town halls are informed
[3:01:15.580 --> 3:01:19.100]  uh i guess curts garner's he's still there
[3:01:19.100 --> 3:01:21.820]  kurt did that answer your question about the genocide
[3:01:21.820 --> 3:01:25.980]  uh yes i heard it on msnbc the fellow saying
[3:01:25.980 --> 3:01:28.940]  just exactly what you read there and then last night
[3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:34.540]  keith oberman totally denied it and of course then he said there wasn't any
[3:01:34.540 --> 3:01:39.340]  concentration camp either that was all just theory
[3:01:39.340 --> 3:01:43.980]  uh thank you for everything you've done thank you for the obama
[3:01:43.980 --> 3:01:47.420]  deception you bet god bless you if i could just add
[3:01:47.420 --> 3:01:52.140]  uh they talk about savings out of medicare now think what this means
[3:01:52.140 --> 3:01:56.540]  the the entire population over 65 is benefiting from what i think is a good
[3:01:56.540 --> 3:02:02.940]  program it's underfunded it has been gouged and chiseled and looted by bush
[3:02:02.940 --> 3:02:06.620]  uh methodically right mercilessly they're in the whole
[3:02:06.620 --> 3:02:10.540]  decade that's now coming to an end obama says he thinks he can squeeze
[3:02:10.540 --> 3:02:15.180]  another 500 billion out of medicare now
[3:02:15.180 --> 3:02:18.700]  where in god's name is that going to come from that's going to mean you're
[3:02:18.700 --> 3:02:22.220]  going to wait longer to get to see the doctor you're going to wait longer for
[3:02:22.220 --> 3:02:25.580]  the procedures they're going to try to convince you not to do it they're going
[3:02:25.580 --> 3:02:29.340]  by the way i've been watching the congressional hearings they admit it
[3:02:29.340 --> 3:02:32.380]  and say we have to do this or you don't get health care
[3:02:32.380 --> 3:02:36.540]  i mean that's the incredible thing webster is it's all admitted
[3:02:36.540 --> 3:02:40.220]  but then they'll admit it to sell you on it but then say it's not really in there
[3:02:40.220 --> 3:02:44.300]  i mean i think the level of lying and twisting and spinning
[3:02:44.300 --> 3:02:47.660]  is what's leading people to revolution because they're reading the bill
[3:02:47.660 --> 3:02:53.260]  webster and finding out the truth the most of obama is that 80 percent of
[3:02:53.260 --> 3:02:56.620]  what he wants the republicans also want yes they do
[3:02:56.620 --> 3:03:00.940]  the republican method is well let me go with obama's method is that you're
[3:03:00.940 --> 3:03:04.860]  told to die by the death panel in the woods there's some board
[3:03:04.860 --> 3:03:09.020]  of malthusian bureaucrats who say it's time for you to die for the sake of the
[3:03:09.020 --> 3:03:13.660]  bottom line the republican method is to destroy these programs no medicare no
[3:03:13.660 --> 3:03:17.420]  medicaid no nothing you get a health savings account with a few thousand
[3:03:17.420 --> 3:03:20.460]  dollars in it just enough money to purchase your
[3:03:20.460 --> 3:03:24.700]  cancer diagnosis or your heart disease diagnosis and after that you're on your
[3:03:24.700 --> 3:03:27.260]  own and if your procedure is a hundred thousand
[3:03:27.260 --> 3:03:31.020]  and you've got two thousand in your health savings account then you're also
[3:03:31.020 --> 3:03:34.940]  told to go and die in the republican method it's done as the market in the
[3:03:34.940 --> 3:03:39.260]  woods it's not a bureaucrat telling you it's the impersonal action of the market
[3:03:39.260 --> 3:03:42.860]  so that might be easier to hide under certain circumstances with the
[3:03:42.860 --> 3:03:47.260]  democrats it's all out in the open it's all the genocidal intent in their own
[3:03:47.260 --> 3:03:50.620]  it's just disgusting it's disgusting let's go ahead and take another call
[3:03:50.620 --> 3:03:54.780]  here uh... let's talk to thomas and marylon you're on the air with uh...

[3:04:09.980 --> 3:04:12.700]  ninety nine percent of the people were against the bill
[3:04:12.700 --> 3:04:16.540]  although they only let in about five hundred people into the the town hall
[3:04:16.540 --> 3:04:19.900]  there is over two thousand people out there protesting this
[3:04:19.900 --> 3:04:24.220]  and uh... yeah but cnn goes out there and says most the people here actually
[3:04:24.220 --> 3:04:29.020]  agree with it there's a few haters and clan members here
[3:04:29.020 --> 3:04:33.660]  uh... propaganda that's why nobody believes the cnn anymore more people
[3:04:33.660 --> 3:04:38.060]  are pushed towards your movement well it's not my movement but uh...

[3:08:01.820 --> 3:08:09.260]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:08:10.700 --> 3:08:15.340]  renowned bioethicist brother ronamanual is the man behind the infamous death
[3:08:15.340 --> 3:08:20.300]  panels he's been hired by the white house now
[3:08:20.300 --> 3:08:26.780]  and uh there are quotes in salon
[3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:30.060]  by him saying medical care should be reserved
[3:08:30.060 --> 3:08:37.980]  for non-disabled participating members of society and again
[3:08:37.980 --> 3:08:41.580]  the yuppies already don't visit their parents or grandparents society's already
[3:08:41.580 --> 3:08:45.500]  falling apart if you don't take care of your family
[3:08:45.500 --> 3:08:48.780]  folks nobody's going to take care of you
[3:08:48.780 --> 3:08:51.900]  if you don't have the compulsion to take care of your family
[3:08:51.900 --> 3:08:55.500]  you're not a human being something's wrong with you you're screwed up you're
[3:08:55.500 --> 3:08:58.300]  sick it's not that you're some goody two shoes
[3:08:58.300 --> 3:09:04.140]  you're supposed to want to take care of people it's very uh
[3:09:04.140 --> 3:09:10.860]  demonic dirty sickening greedy mentally twisted to believe that oh if we give
[3:09:10.860 --> 3:09:13.820]  people health care then that means we lose something
[3:09:13.820 --> 3:09:16.620]  let's see once they create this big government model everybody's competing
[3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:19.980]  with each other and that fundamentally is the
[3:09:19.980 --> 3:09:23.820]  problem with any socialist model tarply probably would argue
[3:09:23.820 --> 3:09:27.740]  and i know this isn't socialism because it doesn't exist it always becomes
[3:09:27.740 --> 3:09:34.780]  elite sucking the trough dry uh but but regardless fundamentally we've all
[3:09:34.780 --> 3:09:38.300]  been turned into these well i guess that was an article written a
[3:09:38.300 --> 3:09:45.500]  short story by uh the late great um
[3:09:45.500 --> 3:09:48.620]  kurt vonnegut who actually sent me some of his artwork one time and
[3:09:48.620 --> 3:09:50.940]  about before he died and said he appreciated my work that's something i
[3:09:50.940 --> 3:09:54.940]  treasure at my house but it's that issue of an of a world where everybody's
[3:09:54.940 --> 3:09:57.340]  got to be made equal so tall people have their legs
[3:09:57.340 --> 3:10:01.340]  chopped off and smart people are given lobotomies and
[3:10:01.340 --> 3:10:05.580]  this is the system and these control freak eugenicists want to dumb down
[3:10:05.580 --> 3:10:08.620]  intelligent people to make us more manageable
[3:10:08.620 --> 3:10:12.700]  but uh there's no doubt these are sick us and there's no doubt these death
[3:10:12.700 --> 3:10:21.500]  penalties are real and he wrote for atlantic monthly
[3:10:21.500 --> 3:10:26.620]  which again is just sick and he has these quotes about
[3:10:26.620 --> 3:10:29.660]  doctors shouldn't be so obsessed with the hypocritical
[3:10:29.660 --> 3:10:32.300]  tarply i want to go back to calls here in a moment we're going to keep you to
[3:10:32.300 --> 3:10:35.900]  the end to cover uh eugenics coming up at the bottom of the hour
[3:10:35.900 --> 3:10:40.380]  part two on your analysis from last week but
[3:10:40.380 --> 3:10:43.420]  i think the reason they're able to get away with some of this is
[3:10:43.420 --> 3:10:48.140]  it's so hard for people to come to grips with the mindset so before we go back
[3:10:48.140 --> 3:10:52.220]  to calls is it that these these bureaucrats these
[3:10:52.220 --> 3:10:56.620]  control freaks these oligarchs get off on denying people care
[3:10:56.620 --> 3:11:00.380]  is it that they did that they disdain having to eat at restaurants with the
[3:11:00.380 --> 3:11:02.620]  general public or stand in line with the public
[3:11:02.620 --> 3:11:07.740]  i mean why do they have such an instinct to kill and abuse and do wickedness i
[3:11:07.740 --> 3:11:10.860]  don't understand it well it's the mentality of oligarchy and
[3:11:10.860 --> 3:11:14.540]  elitism and we have the historical examples going back as far as
[3:11:14.540 --> 3:11:17.020]  civilization certainly to the greeks and
[3:11:17.020 --> 3:11:20.620]  and and the egyptian priesthoods in many ways represent
[3:11:20.620 --> 3:11:25.100]  an oligarchy uh the modern group of course as we've seen with holdren
[3:11:25.100 --> 3:11:29.740]  their malfeasance they believe in zero growth at the limits of growth
[3:11:29.740 --> 3:11:33.340]  that the planet is overpopulated they think that people
[3:11:33.340 --> 3:11:37.580]  pollute that the average human being is a threat to nature or to their favorite
[3:11:37.580 --> 3:11:40.940]  hobby be it the the polar bear the spotted owl the snail
[3:11:40.940 --> 3:11:45.420]  daughter or some other exotic species right some kind of orchids that they
[3:11:45.420 --> 3:11:49.260]  may cultivate the oligarch needs to view
[3:11:49.260 --> 3:11:53.180]  the mass of humanity as subhuman or somehow inferior
[3:11:53.180 --> 3:11:56.380]  the problem of the oligarch is always to justify
[3:11:56.380 --> 3:12:00.140]  the irrational domination and with why should the oligarchy rule
[3:12:00.140 --> 3:12:03.900]  and not somebody else are the oligarchy more competent are they more
[3:12:03.900 --> 3:12:07.020]  intelligent are they more humane no they're none of these things their
[3:12:07.020 --> 3:12:10.380]  failures look at barry summers he's a fool he's a failure
[3:12:10.380 --> 3:12:13.340]  he destroyed the harvard university endowment with his
[3:12:13.340 --> 3:12:17.100]  economic i agree with you i think it's fundamentally they're diseased and
[3:12:17.100 --> 3:12:21.420]  ugly and bent uh generally when i see these elitists they're really
[3:12:21.420 --> 3:12:25.020]  physically horrifying and and and and very disgusting and spit
[3:12:25.020 --> 3:12:27.980]  dripping and i and and i've read some of their
[3:12:27.980 --> 3:12:31.500]  writings they hate seeing a family with a good looking husband and wife and
[3:12:31.500 --> 3:12:34.860]  happy kids they hate flying over our swimming pools and
[3:12:34.860 --> 3:12:39.340]  houses and cars and barbecues and they just like the wicked witch
[3:12:39.340 --> 3:12:44.540]  uh you uh in uh oh you know what's the fairy tale about sleeping beauty
[3:12:44.540 --> 3:12:47.740]  sleeping beauty they just want to come ruin the party
[3:12:47.740 --> 3:12:51.580]  i would also let's keep a more concrete example right rationing of care was the
[3:12:51.580 --> 3:12:54.540]  question before let's look at michelle obama
[3:12:54.540 --> 3:12:59.260]  now uh we've had this interesting uh proposition i write about it in my book
[3:12:59.260 --> 3:13:04.540]  uh a man can hide what he believes but the choice of women especially the
[3:13:04.540 --> 3:13:08.220]  choice of a wife often reveals a great deal about one's own
[3:13:08.220 --> 3:13:12.460]  character so obama has chosen michelle obama as his wife
[3:13:12.460 --> 3:13:17.820]  well what was her business she worked for the university of chicago hospital
[3:13:17.820 --> 3:13:21.740]  she was in health care now this is a very modern state-of-the-art world class
[3:13:21.740 --> 3:13:25.740]  hospital that happens to be separated by just a few blocks
[3:13:25.740 --> 3:13:29.820]  from one of the worst inner city ghettos where there are a lot of poor black
[3:13:29.820 --> 3:13:34.140]  people who don't have any health care so the problem that the the problem that
[3:13:34.140 --> 3:13:36.780]  as they thought the university of chicago saw
[3:13:36.780 --> 3:13:40.380]  was that poor black people were coming out of the inner city
[3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:44.940]  ghetto and coming into the university of chicago hospital emergency room
[3:13:44.940 --> 3:13:49.820]  and asking for treatment so they needed to hire what amounts to a bouncer
[3:13:49.820 --> 3:13:54.140]  they in they created a patient dumping scheme
[3:13:54.140 --> 3:13:57.660]  and the head of the patient dumping scheme was michelle obama
[3:13:57.660 --> 3:14:01.900]  just like margaret sanger said we gotta have blacks to kill these animals
[3:14:01.900 --> 3:14:04.940]  we gotta have a black to lead them to their death
[3:14:04.940 --> 3:14:09.180]  and so she drives them over to the to the euthanasia or to the hospice or to
[3:14:09.180 --> 3:14:12.460]  the scum facility and again that's what she does and you and they
[3:14:12.460 --> 3:14:17.100]  enjoy pimping they enjoy hurting people they enjoy scamming
[3:14:17.100 --> 3:14:20.940]  they enjoy it i mean and you just see her eyes you just
[3:14:20.940 --> 3:14:25.420]  i mean she just radiates evil and hoard them no i'm serious but let's also add
[3:14:25.420 --> 3:14:29.580]  that in order to do this michelle hired david axelrod
[3:14:29.580 --> 3:14:33.740]  to do a brainwashing campaign essentially to dupe all the people
[3:14:33.740 --> 3:14:37.340]  so the idea was that she was in charge of community relations
[3:14:37.340 --> 3:14:41.340]  and community relations meant deploying a screen of bouncers
[3:14:41.340 --> 3:14:44.780]  to keep people out but she had to smooth over the ruffled feelings
[3:14:44.780 --> 3:14:48.140]  of these poor people one of their favorite methods was you'd go into the
[3:14:48.140 --> 3:14:51.580]  waiting room of the emergency room and if you were black and you look
[3:14:51.580 --> 3:14:55.900]  poor they'd make you wait four or five hours they simply ignore you
[3:14:55.900 --> 3:15:00.700]  and hope that you would walk out so this is the mentality and i think these
[3:15:00.700 --> 3:15:04.780]  these examples i think what's in the bill is important but the mentality of
[3:15:04.780 --> 3:15:08.860]  the people carrying it out how about or sag right the bean counter the pointy
[3:15:08.860 --> 3:15:12.860]  headed bureaucrat the head of the office of management and budget
[3:15:12.860 --> 3:15:16.380]  this person who has no medical credentials whatsoever
[3:15:16.380 --> 3:15:20.060]  is of the opinion that an MRI a CAT scan an ultrasound
[3:15:20.060 --> 3:15:24.940]  an echocardiogram an x-ray this is too expensive you know these are the useless
[3:15:24.940 --> 3:15:29.020]  tests i mean i mean the last 50 years the most important devices they've got
[3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:34.380]  saved tens of millions of lives a basic test you don't get it but we see more
[3:15:34.380 --> 3:15:37.500]  more examples of this notice he promised everybody all this free stuff as soon as
[3:15:37.500 --> 3:15:41.180]  he got in the speech he won that night he said it's going to be austerity
[3:15:41.180 --> 3:15:45.740]  it's going to be rough it's going to be tough he is
[3:15:45.740 --> 3:15:49.740]  how do you but i mean exactly how does he have half brothers and brothers
[3:15:49.740 --> 3:15:53.580]  who are living in shacks on one dollar a week he won't help him i mean i help my
[3:15:53.580 --> 3:15:56.140]  family that some of my family that doesn't have money
[3:15:56.140 --> 3:16:00.540]  i mean how would he not ever see his family i mean who is this obama you've
[3:16:00.540 --> 3:16:05.180]  studied his his psychology from watching him he seems to really revel
[3:16:05.180 --> 3:16:11.980]  in in in in in conning people and lying to him he just he just a cost
[3:16:11.980 --> 3:16:15.820]  just a classic scam artist i would call him a narcissist
[3:16:15.820 --> 3:16:19.260]  and a megalomaniac now it's interesting because we did have this
[3:16:19.260 --> 3:16:22.060]  interesting a book a bush on the couch by
[3:16:22.060 --> 3:16:25.660]  dr justin frank i think of of george washington university
[3:16:25.660 --> 3:16:30.060]  which correctly diagnosed bush as a megalomaniac somebody with delusions of
[3:16:30.060 --> 3:16:34.380]  grandeur i think we have another case of megalomania
[3:16:34.380 --> 3:16:39.900]  in this case with the left-wing ideology obama as a narcissist obama
[3:16:39.900 --> 3:16:43.340]  who constantly refers to himself in his speeches
[3:16:43.340 --> 3:16:47.020]  in the third person he always says as i've said repeatedly or
[3:16:47.020 --> 3:16:52.060]  i've said consistently that uh... this complete uh... of fascination with
[3:16:52.060 --> 3:16:55.660]  himself he's now going to go to martin's vineyard
[3:16:55.660 --> 3:17:00.140]  to stay on a thirty million dollar estate for the month of uh... of august
[3:17:00.140 --> 3:17:04.700]  cavorting with the rich oligarchs the famous uh... new england boston
[3:17:04.700 --> 3:17:09.420]  brahmins and and uh... and hedge fund operators you couldn't pay me to do that
[3:17:09.420 --> 3:17:12.060]  i mean just nightmarish all of the world
[3:17:12.060 --> 3:17:18.940]  the fraud claims are good and my my uncle used to live on kip card so i i i got
[3:17:18.940 --> 3:17:22.860]  something in favor of this but the the idea now in the narcissism
[3:17:22.860 --> 3:17:28.140]  uh... he is obviously addicted to adulation he expects adulation and you
[3:17:28.140 --> 3:17:32.700]  can see that into his mentality now a moment of irritability is creeping in
[3:17:32.700 --> 3:17:36.700]  if you saw the summit with uh... with the harper and uh... and uh...
[3:17:36.700 --> 3:17:40.700]  and uh... calderon there they call it no he's looking more and more angry now
[3:17:40.700 --> 3:17:42.860]  when somebody doesn't answer what he wants
[3:17:42.860 --> 3:17:46.380]  he tries to dominate he tries to cut in like specter did today
[3:17:46.380 --> 3:17:49.100]  they just are like i'm gonna make you love me
[3:17:49.100 --> 3:17:53.180]  and i'm gonna make you love eugenics you little piece of trash i would say that
[3:17:53.180 --> 3:17:57.420]  we we we're seeing the beginnings perhaps of the psychological disintegration
[3:17:57.420 --> 3:18:01.420]  of obama in other words the the idea that he might lash out in rage we
[3:18:01.420 --> 3:18:06.060]  we've had guys there with the temper tantrum chewing the carpet on friday
[3:18:06.060 --> 3:18:10.060]  in a dispute with other regulators fighting with bernanke and sheila bear
[3:18:10.060 --> 3:18:13.500]  and the rest of them now in in that uh... press conference in mexico
[3:18:13.500 --> 3:18:17.900]  obama did this thing where he said you know i'm somebody who always plays
[3:18:17.900 --> 3:18:21.820]  you know uh... a risky game over how did he say it i i don't i don't go with the
[3:18:21.820 --> 3:18:25.500]  probabilities i i i you know i i shoot the works because
[3:18:25.500 --> 3:18:29.580]  if i had to calculate my chances of being here i never would have been here so
[3:18:29.580 --> 3:18:32.140]  i'm the kind of guy that that's willing to uh...
[3:18:32.140 --> 3:18:34.940]  you know to do something that's that's not guaranteed
[3:18:34.940 --> 3:18:37.740]  of success and it seemed to me that that he was somehow
[3:18:37.740 --> 3:18:41.340]  asserting himself right that i'm really this great guy who came out of nowhere
[3:18:41.340 --> 3:18:44.940]  and i did it all myself yeah yeah he's a maverick when really the new
[3:18:44.940 --> 3:18:47.900]  world or stork delivered him out of the bowels of hell
[3:18:47.900 --> 3:18:51.500]  a white house front poor it could be very specific goldman fax jp
[3:18:51.500 --> 3:18:56.300]  morgan chase city bank uh... these are the midwives of the the obama
[3:18:56.300 --> 3:18:59.980]  miracle i think we can we could be very very specific we can even
[3:18:59.980 --> 3:19:03.580]  you know calculate the sums of money involved so
[3:19:03.580 --> 3:19:06.780]  i think that's going to be a problem forum of the the um...
[3:19:06.780 --> 3:19:10.220]  the town hall the so-called town hall in port smith to hampshire
[3:19:10.220 --> 3:19:14.460]  to the extent i've been able to follow it at all seems to have been screened in
[3:19:14.460 --> 3:19:18.700]  the best tradition of bush remember that if you were an anti-war demonstrator
[3:19:18.700 --> 3:19:22.380]  and you wanted to get into a bush event you were likely to be arrested i don't
[3:19:22.380 --> 3:19:23.580]  know what happened
[3:19:23.580 --> 3:19:27.260]  in uh... manchester uh... sorry port smith to hampshire that's why they had the
[3:19:27.260 --> 3:19:29.900]  cop come up probably a cop with the gun
[3:19:29.900 --> 3:19:33.660]  was a way to intensify screening and only bring in minions
[3:19:33.660 --> 3:19:37.180]  so uh... it's obviously was not a fair selection i think it was it was
[3:19:37.180 --> 3:19:40.460]  thoroughly screened and therefore worthless and i think people will realize
[3:19:40.460 --> 3:19:44.860]  that all right let's jam calls and we get back
[3:19:44.860 --> 3:19:48.700]  let's uh... go to uh... robert

[3:23:16.300 --> 3:23:19.580]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[3:23:19.580 --> 3:23:23.820]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all

[3:25:33.260 --> 3:25:36.860]  to him about it about perry and hutcheson going in there and then he uh
[3:25:36.860 --> 3:25:40.300]  he hung up on me really quickly it's pretty cool and i did post the video up
[3:25:40.300 --> 3:25:45.020]  so people can watch it and i also have a list of numbers to radio shows um radio
[3:25:45.020 --> 3:25:48.940]  talk shows on my youtube channel for people to use if they can call in it
[3:25:48.940 --> 3:25:53.580]  helps a whole lot you know it makes a big difference getting a message out there
[3:25:53.580 --> 3:25:56.860]  okay thank you for the call i appreciate it yeah keep it up great look
[3:25:56.860 --> 3:26:00.940]  let's take back the airwaves um you never have to figure
[3:26:00.940 --> 3:26:05.980]  that there's nothing you can do there are these big talk radio shows broadcast
[3:26:05.980 --> 3:26:10.700]  nationwide if you're patient enough and clever enough if you can put some time
[3:26:10.700 --> 3:26:14.380]  into it plan a question you can do something you can get on the scoreboard
[3:26:14.380 --> 3:26:17.980]  with hundreds of thousands of people so that's a way to get into politics and
[3:26:17.980 --> 3:26:21.500]  the more people do that the better it's going to be and the more capable you're
[3:26:21.500 --> 3:26:25.580]  going to be the more more often you do it
[3:26:25.580 --> 3:26:32.300]  absolutely webster and that's where the revolution is is coming out saying no
[3:26:32.300 --> 3:26:35.100]  and that's why they're trying to demonize anybody who's racist i want to
[3:26:35.100 --> 3:26:41.180]  play a clip here the first one he's doing this every show the last few weeks
[3:26:41.180 --> 3:26:45.260]  uh this of course uh is the msnbc minion
[3:26:45.260 --> 3:26:49.740]  chris matthew saying we've got to give sodium penithal
[3:26:49.740 --> 3:26:53.740]  to all these anti-healthcare people because they're all secretly racist here
[3:26:53.740 --> 3:26:59.340]  it is the npr the npr poll last week of those 25
[3:26:59.340 --> 3:27:02.700]  percent of the public strongly supported so they strongly supported what obama
[3:27:02.700 --> 3:27:06.540]  is trying to do in health care 39 percent strongly opposed right now
[3:27:06.540 --> 3:27:09.340]  there does seem to be more energy and the opponents and the supporters although
[3:27:09.340 --> 3:27:12.380]  the proponents are trying to gear up and i think it would be a mistake to
[3:27:12.380 --> 3:27:15.660]  simply read what's happening as just a kind of racial reaction
[3:27:15.660 --> 3:27:18.460]  there is an indication here of the problem that i'm going to any one of
[3:27:18.460 --> 3:27:21.580]  these rowey's these the people they feel that it was like acorn on the right it
[3:27:21.580 --> 3:27:25.180]  was running acorn taking off tipo nails ops put all these hundred people in a
[3:27:25.180 --> 3:27:28.220]  room strap them into gurney's jet ejecting with sodium penithal
[3:27:28.220 --> 3:27:31.100]  a how many would say i don't like the idea of having a black president or
[3:27:31.100 --> 3:27:35.500]  percentage oh i'm just guessing this is just off
[3:27:35.500 --> 3:27:39.580]  the cuff i think 45 to 65 percent of the people who are
[3:27:39.580 --> 3:27:43.580]  pure at these groups are people who will never become okay with the idea of
[3:27:43.580 --> 3:27:46.620]  okay you want to give an intro guess i would not go that okay let me ask you
[3:27:46.620 --> 3:27:48.860]  another question i would not go that how many of them would say i would really
[3:27:48.860 --> 3:27:55.020]  like the idea of sarah this is hitlerian hitler use racial politics
[3:27:55.020 --> 3:27:59.820]  and he said these groups racially are coming after you they want to get you
[3:27:59.820 --> 3:28:04.940]  so not just racism but trying to create race war and and they're doing this on
[3:28:04.940 --> 3:28:09.340]  all the channels webster as you know this is just outrageously criminal in
[3:28:09.340 --> 3:28:14.220]  my view to take big groups of people clashing
[3:28:14.220 --> 3:28:18.860]  and to say the majority group is all basically racist
[3:28:18.860 --> 3:28:24.220]  or 65 percent of them uh i mean that is injecting race that is making
[3:28:24.220 --> 3:28:28.060]  something racial that isn't this is outrageous
[3:28:28.060 --> 3:28:31.420]  what they're doing and then and then and then getting rid of my videos that call
[3:28:31.420 --> 3:28:34.940]  for unity these people know what they're doing webster
[3:28:34.940 --> 3:28:41.100]  this is this is the class consciousness of the u.s. oligarchical elite and in
[3:28:41.100 --> 3:28:44.780]  particular of the left with the sort of center left wing of it
[3:28:44.780 --> 3:28:48.380]  which is focused on the world of the foundation in other words it's the
[3:28:48.380 --> 3:28:51.900]  national public radio public broadcasting system
[3:28:51.900 --> 3:28:56.060]  uh bill moyer's uh charlie rose this kind of world
[3:28:56.060 --> 3:29:01.420]  their class consciousness is a hatred of blue collar workers in the united
[3:29:01.420 --> 3:29:05.900]  states and they base this on the idea they their cover story is
[3:29:05.900 --> 3:29:10.220]  that blue collar workers are racist and patriotic they support
[3:29:10.220 --> 3:29:13.020]  wars and therefore they they voted for bush but
[3:29:13.020 --> 3:29:20.460]  the underlying purpose of this is to uh crush economically these same blue
[3:29:20.460 --> 3:29:24.380]  collar workers so in other words it's it's a class hatred that they express
[3:29:24.380 --> 3:29:28.140]  in this characteristic way and the big foundations
[3:29:28.140 --> 3:29:32.460]  you mentioned are the big eugenics foundations so they really hate the blacks
[3:29:32.460 --> 3:29:36.380]  so they've got their two enemies they got their two enemies trying to make us
[3:29:36.380 --> 3:29:40.140]  kill each other while they sit there just going i can't wait to murder these
[3:29:40.140 --> 3:29:43.500]  blacks they're like oh i'm liberal oh i'm liberal i'm christ
[3:29:43.500 --> 3:29:48.460]  mafios oh let me inject racism i'm winning i'm the big

[3:33:21.100 --> 3:33:24.140]  i was just stretching if my hamstrings were tight and i looked down i had two
[3:33:24.140 --> 3:33:29.740]  here for shoes on now they are black shoes but
[3:33:29.740 --> 3:33:32.540]  you're on the closet put the wrong shoes on your feet
[3:33:32.540 --> 3:33:36.060]  look at this show people on tv
[3:33:43.020 --> 3:33:47.500]  they do look similar though right now i did get the right feet on i don't have
[3:33:47.500 --> 3:33:53.500]  like two left feet or two right feet on but you gotta love that lady
[3:33:53.500 --> 3:33:57.500]  what percentage do you think are racist out there oh i'm 40 to 60 percent
[3:33:57.500 --> 3:34:00.940]  you know
[3:34:00.940 --> 3:34:05.500]  you know you think there's life on that planet uh 10,000 light years away oh
[3:34:05.500 --> 3:34:08.700]  yeah there's little purple aliens with green eyeballs on it you know
[3:34:08.700 --> 3:34:11.980]  oh scientific purple aliens with green eyeballs are
[3:34:11.980 --> 3:34:15.420]  you know on that planet 10,000 light years away
[3:34:15.420 --> 3:34:18.540]  uh webster terribly we're gonna blitz through some calls and hit some eugenics
[3:34:18.540 --> 3:34:22.060]  right now but what did you just think of that last clip
[3:34:22.060 --> 3:34:26.220]  well uh i think some of the stuff you have to remember is what
[3:34:26.220 --> 3:34:29.980]  what the obama campaign looked like in the iowa caucuses
[3:34:29.980 --> 3:34:34.220]  and in the uh the texas caucuses they used goons
[3:34:34.220 --> 3:34:38.380]  they used trickery they used strong arm they used threats
[3:34:38.380 --> 3:34:42.220]  uh if you were a puma democrat if you were part of the
[3:34:42.220 --> 3:34:46.300]  opposition to obama inside the democratic party
[3:34:46.300 --> 3:34:50.300]  the death threats would come down on your head if you look at the puma blogs
[3:34:50.300 --> 3:34:53.660]  the leading puma bloggers all received death threats the whole time
[3:34:53.660 --> 3:34:58.380]  none of this was was of any interest to the uh to the people at msnbc
[3:34:58.380 --> 3:35:02.220]  because chris matthews of course had that thrill creeping up his leg
[3:35:02.220 --> 3:35:06.860]  i mean this guy is so discredited he's such a uh a psychopath i would say
[3:35:06.860 --> 3:35:10.540]  that uh i think what what he says is is of absolutely no interest
[3:35:10.540 --> 3:35:14.460]  let me just add it was a real pleasure shutting down his tv show for a full
[3:35:14.460 --> 3:35:18.220]  hour one time what is that you know we took his tv show
[3:35:18.220 --> 3:35:22.300]  over and no i'm not aware of it cue it up
[3:35:22.300 --> 3:35:27.500]  sorry go ahead webster the the answer uh in in terms of the economics of health
[3:35:27.500 --> 3:35:31.580]  here is simply this you can realize savings only one way
[3:35:31.580 --> 3:35:35.020]  and that is to find cures you have got to put
[3:35:35.020 --> 3:35:38.060]  i would say about a hundred billion dollars right now
[3:35:38.060 --> 3:35:42.140]  into a research program for cancer a research program for heart disease
[3:35:42.140 --> 3:35:46.060]  diabetes stroke all the obvious threat diseases
[3:35:46.060 --> 3:35:49.580]  uh and begin to cure them then you can realize savings
[3:35:49.580 --> 3:35:53.100]  i think the one thing we cannot have the rationing of care
[3:35:53.100 --> 3:35:56.940]  is absolutely unacceptable the idea that people are going to be encouraged to
[3:35:56.940 --> 3:36:00.700]  die is absolutely crazy people with a will to live
[3:36:00.700 --> 3:36:03.820]  that has to be respected that subjective thing that obama
[3:36:03.820 --> 3:36:07.340]  holds in contempt is is i think a very important human
[3:36:07.340 --> 3:36:12.540]  uh desire so realize savings by having a crash program something like the
[3:36:12.540 --> 3:36:16.620]  manhattan project in world war two to find cures to these diseases and then
[3:36:16.620 --> 3:36:20.460]  you'll begin to save money in some very important ways so i would say
[3:36:20.460 --> 3:36:25.340]  medicare for all if you want it fully funded and the way you pay for it
[3:36:25.340 --> 3:36:28.780]  is a token tax on wall street tax that wall street turnover
[3:36:28.780 --> 3:36:33.580]  don't tax individuals tax the huge flows of derivative stocks bonds
[3:36:33.580 --> 3:36:36.540]  um foreign exchange commodities and all the rest of it
[3:36:36.540 --> 3:36:40.700]  sure tax the parasites tax the parasites what you're having a parasite
[3:36:40.700 --> 3:36:44.540]  and then we're gonna get back on the dime there's no taxation on that
[3:36:44.540 --> 3:36:48.060]  that means it's actually being encouraged it's being encouraged because it's the
[3:36:48.060 --> 3:36:53.340]  only thing left under the sun that's not taxed so tax that too
[3:36:53.340 --> 3:36:57.020]  uh we're gonna play a little bit of this and then go to calls here is uh us
[3:36:57.020 --> 3:37:02.460]  taking over chris mathews during the dnc uh a real pleasure here it is
[3:37:02.460 --> 3:37:10.780]  las angeles mayor antonia via regosa how are you thank you sir you know uh i
[3:37:10.780 --> 3:37:15.740]  guess it's the old question of character stick last night i never saw
[3:37:15.740 --> 3:37:19.900]  somebody carry uh the charm of michelle obama
[3:37:19.900 --> 3:37:23.580]  she was downright fetching as a family member as a mother
[3:37:23.580 --> 3:37:27.020]  the children were divine the father was fatherly
[3:37:27.020 --> 3:37:30.540]  it was father knows best or rather it was the huckstables
[3:37:30.540 --> 3:37:34.220]  uh also there was a great sentimental moment with senator kennedy
[3:37:34.220 --> 3:37:38.380]  who's now sort of post-political tonight is it time
[3:37:38.380 --> 3:37:42.620]  to throw the red meat to this crowd and remind them why they're democrats mayor
[3:37:42.620 --> 3:37:46.460]  well i think it's time for us uh to remind
[3:37:46.460 --> 3:37:50.860]  then our party and the nation that there's nothing more important than change
[3:37:50.860 --> 3:37:55.260]  and hope yesterday we had an opportunity to hear from
[3:37:55.260 --> 3:37:59.260]  soon to be first lady michelle obama and i'll tell you i was inspired
[3:37:59.260 --> 3:38:02.620]  but i'll be i think we'll all be inspired by another first lady
[3:38:02.620 --> 3:38:08.460]  hillary clinton tonight she's gonna reach out uh to everyone uh in the
[3:38:08.460 --> 3:38:12.860]  convention uh reach out by the way folks speaks to
[3:38:12.860 --> 3:38:16.620]  some people for the hour plus we did this with us being attacked them cutting
[3:38:16.620 --> 3:38:19.340]  cords with knives said why didn't you give a long speech
[3:38:19.340 --> 3:38:22.940]  i've done this before a long speech people don't understand it
[3:38:22.940 --> 3:38:27.180]  notice i'm saying info wars dot com you gotta hear it like five six seven ten
[3:38:27.180 --> 3:38:33.500]  times before you even know then i go nine eleven is an inside job
[3:38:33.500 --> 3:38:36.780]  but this is another form of protest whenever they do these fake outdoor
[3:38:36.780 --> 3:38:40.540]  things to act like the public's for them you've got to go take them over
[3:38:40.540 --> 3:38:43.740]  webster that was then copied by others around the country
[3:38:43.740 --> 3:38:47.260]  throughout the election what do you think of that congratulations uh that's
[3:38:47.260 --> 3:38:51.420]  a grassroots democracy right there now they didn't like it
[3:38:51.420 --> 3:38:54.540]  let me tell you they got mad let's play one more clip then go to calls
[3:38:54.540 --> 3:38:59.900]  here's another clip of msnbc with the same reporter putting out the gun story
[3:38:59.900 --> 3:39:03.180]  stuff today here he is saying oh yes well you can say
[3:39:03.180 --> 3:39:07.020]  socialism but some people it's code for racism so
[3:39:07.020 --> 3:39:10.220]  i guess newsweek with the headline we're all socialists now
[3:39:10.220 --> 3:39:15.740]  is racist that was cold that obama is bad so so here is the boil down
[3:39:15.740 --> 3:39:19.980]  mindlessness you walk outside and say i think i want to have a cup of coffee
[3:39:19.980 --> 3:39:22.780]  they say that's racist or if you want to tie your shoe
[3:39:22.780 --> 3:39:27.740]  breathing is racist uh it's just a total religion by the eugenics elite
[3:39:27.740 --> 3:39:30.940]  that see blacks as subhumans that must be killed in their own writings
[3:39:30.940 --> 3:39:34.220]  here it is when in some of those town hall meetings including the one that we
[3:39:34.220 --> 3:39:38.060]  saw in missouri recently where there were jokes made about lynching etc
[3:39:38.060 --> 3:39:41.740]  you start to wonder whether in fact the word socialist is becoming
[3:39:41.740 --> 3:39:46.220]  a code word whether or not socialist is becoming the new n-word for
[3:39:46.220 --> 3:39:50.220]  frankly for some uh angry upset birthers and others
[3:39:50.220 --> 3:39:53.900]  i hope that's not the case but it sure does say to you what david brook said
[3:39:53.900 --> 3:39:58.380]  the other day on tv which is that more credible conservatives have to stand up
[3:39:58.380 --> 3:40:00.780]  and say that there's a line that has to be drawn that there's a line of
[3:40:00.780 --> 3:40:04.620]  responsibility that's okay listen to this desperateness like like
[3:40:04.620 --> 3:40:07.580]  oh it's embarrassing for republicans what's happening no
[3:40:07.580 --> 3:40:10.780]  obama's falling like a stone all credibility's been lost
[3:40:10.780 --> 3:40:15.020]  people are circulating all his lies the obama deception has gone mega total
[3:40:15.020 --> 3:40:18.700]  super viral uh and and and they're now desperate saying oh
[3:40:18.700 --> 3:40:22.220]  you know like in a sword fight they're losing going oh don't you want to quit
[3:40:22.220 --> 3:40:26.780]  i'm beating you webster tarpley but i would say there are two sides to this
[3:40:26.780 --> 3:40:30.860]  uh i i don't think there's anything socialist about obama i think this is
[3:40:30.860 --> 3:40:34.300]  a total misnomer uh this is this is something that's
[3:40:34.300 --> 3:40:38.460]  launched by the limbaugh's and and the hanity's uh the correct term and i'm
[3:40:38.460 --> 3:40:42.060]  sorry about this but it's the fascist corporate state
[3:40:42.060 --> 3:40:46.620]  in my book obama the unauthorized biography i have a whole chapter towards
[3:40:46.620 --> 3:40:49.500]  the end where i go through scholarly literature from
[3:40:49.500 --> 3:40:53.340]  historians and political scientists and sociologists
[3:40:53.340 --> 3:40:57.100]  they've come up with what is what is defined as a fascist minima in other
[3:40:57.100 --> 3:41:02.620]  words if you take all the european and indeed us fascist groups of the 1920s
[3:41:02.620 --> 3:41:06.300]  and 30s you can take uh salazar in portugal
[3:41:06.300 --> 3:41:09.420]  franco in spain saraswold mosley in britain
[3:41:09.420 --> 3:41:13.260]  uh the uh french movement of this guy dorio
[3:41:13.260 --> 3:41:16.700]  you can go to uh the Baltic states you can go to the
[3:41:16.700 --> 3:41:20.940]  iron guard in rumania with codriano you go to musolini's idly
[3:41:20.940 --> 3:41:24.140]  and then and then hitler's germany you can you can add in the uh
[3:41:24.140 --> 3:41:28.620]  i think the silver shirts here in the u.s there are uh blue shirts i think or
[3:41:28.620 --> 3:41:32.860]  green shirts in ireland so what is it that all these groups have in common and
[3:41:32.860 --> 3:41:37.260]  they come up with about 10 or 12 points in terms of the ideology
[3:41:37.260 --> 3:41:41.020]  the role of the charismatic leader the dynamics of the movement
[3:41:41.020 --> 3:41:46.140]  uh the anti-woman the anti-feminism that's typical of these movements
[3:41:46.140 --> 3:41:50.780]  uh and if you then compare that to obama which i do in some detail
[3:41:50.780 --> 3:41:55.020]  you find that obama actually tests positive
[3:41:55.020 --> 3:41:59.260]  and his movement they test positive on a very alarmingly high number
[3:41:59.260 --> 3:42:03.100]  of these points so that's one side the movement the other one then is
[3:42:03.100 --> 3:42:06.860]  the corporate state in other words what did musolini do
[3:42:06.860 --> 3:42:09.980]  to reorganize the italian economy in the 1920s
[3:42:09.980 --> 3:42:14.060]  he created a series of government sponsored compulsory cartels
[3:42:14.060 --> 3:42:18.060]  where labor was forced to participate in the same way that the united order
[3:42:18.060 --> 3:42:20.540]  workers are being forced to cut their own
[3:42:20.540 --> 3:42:24.700]  throats in the detroit uh takedown that the american federation of
[3:42:24.700 --> 3:42:27.260]  teachers is being forced to cut their own throats
[3:42:27.260 --> 3:42:30.780]  with merit pay and charter schools and all the rest of it so you force
[3:42:30.780 --> 3:42:34.460]  government and labor and and the bosses management
[3:42:34.460 --> 3:42:39.580]  into one entity and then you use that as a compulsory cartel you're going to
[3:42:39.580 --> 3:42:43.740]  drive down wages drive down production but crop up
[3:42:43.740 --> 3:42:48.140]  fictitious capital in other words the the bloated bubble prices of stock
[3:42:48.140 --> 3:42:52.220]  spawns and today derivative so we can say that
[3:42:52.220 --> 3:42:56.380]  the accurate term is indeed this reference to no i understand that
[3:42:56.380 --> 3:42:59.980]  regardless it's not racist to say he's a socialist
[3:42:59.980 --> 3:43:03.180]  no it shows that they're cold bloodedly doing this let's
[3:43:03.180 --> 3:43:06.460]  let's play some man handling and then take calls let's have you back up for
[3:43:06.460 --> 3:43:10.220]  part two next week on the eugenics because this is topical and happening now

[3:43:23.340 --> 3:43:26.940]  death care and that's what it is i've read it now

[3:46:15.100 --> 3:46:19.020]  but we have them beating up black people who are against it
[3:46:19.020 --> 3:46:22.780]  or appear to be against it we have them beating up women we have them going to
[3:46:22.780 --> 3:46:26.220]  people's houses and death writing on the police have now confirmed this
[3:46:26.220 --> 3:46:31.420]  they come to your house folks and then they accuse you of being rowdy and bad
[3:46:31.420 --> 3:46:37.980]  here's this man with his son uh whose peril you know uh has a serious illness

[3:47:00.700 --> 3:47:03.500]  health care he just says oh we're gonna amend that
[3:47:03.500 --> 3:47:06.940]  so i gotta give it to him at least he admitted it was real usually they just
[3:47:06.940 --> 3:47:12.380]  lie and say there is no bill you're this is no town hall you're ill we have a
[3:47:12.380 --> 3:47:16.140]  white van for you now let's go ahead and play it here it is
[3:47:42.380 --> 3:47:47.020]  on behalf of
[3:47:47.020 --> 3:47:51.020]  under the obama health care plan which you support
[3:47:51.020 --> 3:47:56.460]  this man would be given no care whatsoever because he has a cerebral
[3:47:56.460 --> 3:48:01.020]  palsy handicap person oh yes that's true all right
[3:48:01.020 --> 3:48:06.700]  shout out to the doctor to see if you know what i mean sir
[3:48:06.700 --> 3:48:10.620]  arrest us right now i think somebody in the staff will find
[3:48:10.620 --> 3:48:19.020]  that page for you all right you know the video we found
[3:48:19.020 --> 3:48:22.060]  was some angle i hadn't seen so the audio is not very good
[3:48:22.060 --> 3:48:25.500]  i i saw it on the news this morning and last night cut up
[3:48:25.500 --> 3:48:28.620]  and that's the one we have up on infill wars and prison planet you can hear
[3:48:28.620 --> 3:48:31.900]  dingle say no no yeah we're going to take that out of the bill
[3:48:31.900 --> 3:48:35.180]  so see no health there's the congressman admitting
[3:48:35.180 --> 3:48:38.060]  that they were not going to give his son any health care
[3:48:38.060 --> 3:48:41.180]  uh... webster tarpley comments on this
[3:48:41.180 --> 3:48:45.340]  i think it's a very important movement it is a it's a mass strike against
[3:48:45.340 --> 3:48:49.660]  against genocide against euthanasia against austerity
[3:48:49.660 --> 3:48:53.180]  uh... but now we've got to think what's the next step you can already see the
[3:48:53.180 --> 3:48:55.900]  republican vultures hovering around we've got
[3:48:55.900 --> 3:48:59.660]  the competitive enterprise institute going in the heartland institute
[3:48:59.660 --> 3:49:03.580]  we've got freedom works which is dick army the sidekick of
[3:49:03.580 --> 3:49:07.980]  newt gingrich from the from the 1990s the way the
[3:49:07.980 --> 3:49:11.420]  uh... political system in this country works is if you don't prepare an
[3:49:11.420 --> 3:49:15.740]  alternative the beneficiary of all this in the end
[3:49:15.740 --> 3:49:20.380]  might well be somebody like mit romney mit romney the hedge fund hyena
[3:49:20.380 --> 3:49:23.820]  mit romney it turns out to be the guy who put in place
[3:49:23.820 --> 3:49:27.180]  in massachusetts a plan which i think is very similar
[3:49:27.180 --> 3:49:31.020]  to what obama is really aiming at which is in massachusetts
[3:49:31.020 --> 3:49:36.540]  you are forced you are obliged to buy insurance from private insurance companies
[3:49:36.540 --> 3:49:39.500]  there is no government option there is no single payer
[3:49:39.500 --> 3:49:43.500]  it's all private and i think it's not working well at all i think people are
[3:49:43.500 --> 3:49:46.700]  extremely uh... disappointed and unhappy and
[3:49:46.700 --> 3:49:51.100]  enraged with this thing so the question is if you don't want the ultimate
[3:49:51.100 --> 3:49:54.380]  beneficiary of all this to be somebody like mit romney
[3:49:54.380 --> 3:49:57.340]  then you're going to need a program and you're going to need some kind of
[3:49:57.340 --> 3:50:00.860]  organizational concept because otherwise as i say the republican
[3:50:00.860 --> 3:50:05.500]  the republican vultures feel that they could ride this movement back into
[3:50:05.500 --> 3:50:09.740]  power and ultimately they are just as bad or maybe no that's how it works
[3:50:09.740 --> 3:50:12.620]  what we got now left right paradigm they just
[3:50:12.620 --> 3:50:15.980]  alternate between i want to come back and take
[3:50:15.980 --> 3:50:20.220]  at least the call from hawaii and christian florida
[3:50:20.220 --> 3:50:23.900]  who knows uh... and will continue with calls on all this tomorrow it's just too
[3:50:23.900 --> 3:50:27.500]  insane and what i'm sure you're always chomping at the bit for solutions
[3:50:27.500 --> 3:50:31.340]  but we have to beat this even before we sit there
[3:50:31.340 --> 3:50:34.380]  and and and over solutions i mean i can't even get
[3:50:34.380 --> 3:50:37.500]  people to realize that the that the white house science are
[3:50:37.500 --> 3:50:40.460]  wants to put sterilants in the water and we know they're already been caught
[3:50:40.460 --> 3:50:45.100]  doing it we need good luck good luck no exactly i would
[3:50:45.100 --> 3:50:47.740]  just be glad to beat the cap and trade and all this
[3:50:47.740 --> 3:50:53.260]  because as bad as things are right now what they want is 10 times worse so
[3:50:53.260 --> 3:50:57.180]  i'm just trying to get past this phase and survive

[3:56:38.620 --> 3:56:43.580]  because i believe the solutions are just exposing these people and i believe
[3:56:43.580 --> 3:56:48.140]  solutions are gridlock and i and i don't want to put the cart before the horse
[3:56:48.140 --> 3:56:51.260]  but it is good to show you have solutions i don't know if i agree with all
[3:56:51.260 --> 3:56:55.420]  of your ideas but i respect you because i know there's so much corruption that
[3:56:55.420 --> 3:56:59.500]  anything put out through a collectivist model will turn into evil
[3:56:59.500 --> 3:57:03.500]  at least in my experience i know you think the rosa veltean thing was great
[3:57:03.500 --> 3:57:06.860]  but look what it's today grew this big mega state
[3:57:06.860 --> 3:57:10.940]  that allows the extraction and theft so we'll have a debate next week

[3:57:14.140 --> 3:57:18.540]  a nice uh you bet now i sell both your books we won't have time for calls i
[3:57:18.540 --> 3:57:22.060]  apologize we're out of time but plug the books so folks can get them
[3:57:22.060 --> 3:57:25.660]  at info wars dot com tell folks what's in your two great books on obama
[3:57:25.660 --> 3:57:29.420]  and then the new book on the cataclysm in a minute and a half
[3:57:29.420 --> 3:57:32.860]  okay wonderful uh surviving the cataclysm your guide to the greatest
[3:57:32.860 --> 3:57:37.340]  financial crisis in human history is uh a book which i believe the
[3:57:37.340 --> 3:57:40.780]  successfully diagnosis why we have a world depression
[3:57:40.780 --> 3:57:45.580]  uh it's derivatives it's the casino economy it's the deindustrialization
[3:57:45.580 --> 3:57:49.900]  of the united states and what a lot of people are responding to today with so
[3:57:49.900 --> 3:57:53.580]  much anger we've had a two-thirds decline in the american
[3:57:53.580 --> 3:57:57.420]  standard of living the the middle class has been completely looted
[3:57:57.420 --> 3:58:01.580]  over the past 30 years so we've also got obama the postmodern coup the making of
[3:58:01.580 --> 3:58:04.940]  a manchurian candidate and we've got barrage obama
[3:58:04.940 --> 3:58:09.260]  the unauthorized biographies so irish people to stock up on all three
[3:58:09.260 --> 3:58:13.340]  because this is sort of the playbook for uh for the political battles that we're
[3:58:13.340 --> 3:58:16.940]  going into now and soon the media will say it's a conspiracy
[3:58:16.940 --> 3:58:20.220]  theory that there were ever families or that people ever read books and i'm not
[3:58:20.220 --> 3:58:23.340]  joking uh i mean they openly saying and
[3:58:23.340 --> 3:58:28.540]  they want to abolish families get the books keep reading alive it's not illegal
[3:58:28.540 --> 3:58:32.140]  yet great job webster tarpley i'm gonna put you on hold set
