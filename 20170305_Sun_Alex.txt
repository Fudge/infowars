[00:00.000 --> 00:11.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:11.720 --> 00:15.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:15.920 --> 00:21.040]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.040 --> 00:22.560]  It is Sunday.
[00:22.560 --> 00:28.200]  Owen Schreuer filling in for Alex today, but we will have plenty of original content for
[00:28.200 --> 00:32.280]  you from Alex Jones here on this Sunday.
[00:32.280 --> 00:33.560]  All kinds of great stuff coming up.
[00:33.560 --> 00:39.000]  Of course, the biggest story right now is the Obama deep state and everything that's
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.400]  going on inside of the White House and the former White House administration.
[00:44.400 --> 00:50.680]  As far as trying to bring Donald Trump down, bring his administration down and delegitimize
[00:50.680 --> 00:52.000]  his presidency.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.840]  The attacks are in full force.
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.360]  Trump's broke that down earlier today, and we will be going to those clips in the first
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.360]  hour.
[01:00.360 --> 01:01.360]  You will be hearing from Alex Jones.
[01:01.360 --> 01:03.000]  That's not all we've got today.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.840]  I was at the March for Trump yesterday here in Austin, and this was actually a March for
[01:08.840 --> 01:13.440]  Trump that was around the United States at least.
[01:13.440 --> 01:16.600]  And we'll talk about what happened at the March for Trump yesterday.
[01:16.600 --> 01:22.960]  We've also got some news coming out of illegal immigrants and some sad news, but real news
[01:22.960 --> 01:26.120]  that needs to be covered because they'll tell you Donald Trump is lying about it or he's
[01:26.120 --> 01:27.960]  racist.
[01:27.960 --> 01:33.520]  And again, folks, this is the biggest story right now.
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.480]  And a lot of people can't really comprehend the seriousness of it because they've been
[01:38.480 --> 01:47.120]  living in La La Land for so long, or they've been numbed by sports or television entertainment.
[01:47.120 --> 01:52.640]  The reason why Donald Trump is under attack from the establishment, from the Democrats,
[01:52.640 --> 01:58.080]  from the GOP even, the reason he's being undermined by the media, undermined by every wing of
[01:58.080 --> 02:05.600]  the political establishment, is because he is for America.
[02:05.600 --> 02:10.200]  And most people don't understand the gravity of this war that we're in right now.
[02:10.200 --> 02:11.200]  They don't understand it.
[02:11.200 --> 02:14.480]  They think that this is just politics as usual.
[02:14.480 --> 02:20.440]  And because their involvement in the political process this year has been such a vitriolic
[02:20.440 --> 02:25.040]  Trump bash, they just think that this is par for the course.
[02:25.040 --> 02:28.800]  Oh, of course Chuck Schumer is gonna say all this stuff about Trump.
[02:28.800 --> 02:31.560]  Of course Nancy Pelosi is gonna say all this stuff about Trump.
[02:31.560 --> 02:32.840]  Of course Trump is Russian.
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.080]  This is just par for the course.
[02:34.080 --> 02:35.080]  It's Trump, after all.
[02:35.080 --> 02:36.160]  He's so bad.
[02:36.160 --> 02:38.720]  Of course this is what we're gonna get from Trump.
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.240]  But the truth of the matter is this is not par for the course.
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.640]  These are the most unbelievable times that are going on right now, and it's almost as
[02:47.640 --> 02:56.680]  if you wonder, in 1776, the people that were forming this nation, the ideals that brought
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.320]  us here, did they know the revolution that they were starting?
[03:01.320 --> 03:06.880]  Did they know how long their ideals would last and the country that they would build
[03:06.880 --> 03:09.920]  and the freedoms that they would ensure and the impact they would have on the world?
[03:09.920 --> 03:11.520]  Did they even know?
[03:11.520 --> 03:17.680]  Did they even know what 1776 would mean to the world?
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.000]  Do we even know right now how important Donald Trump is?
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.720]  Do we even know right now the seriousness of the undermining of the Donald Trump presidency?
[03:29.720 --> 03:31.680]  What is really going on here, folks?
[03:31.680 --> 03:34.280]  But of course we do know.
[03:34.280 --> 03:35.280]  Of course we know.
[03:35.280 --> 03:38.560]  We've been following this for decades now.
[03:38.560 --> 03:44.880]  All the prior administrations, George Bush and Barack Obama, if you want to be specific,
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.880]  but specific.
[03:45.880 --> 03:48.560]  But if you might as well, you might as well go back to Clinton too because he's undoing
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.400]  all of this Clinton mess too.
[03:50.400 --> 03:53.520]  He went up against Clinton in the last election process.
[03:53.520 --> 03:56.920]  So you might as well throw the Clinton administration in there.
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.080]  So let's just take those last three administrations.
[04:01.080 --> 04:10.960]  Donald Trump is the first president who got into the White House for you.
[04:10.960 --> 04:17.960]  Donald Trump is the first president that put it all on the line for the Republic.
[04:17.960 --> 04:23.360]  See, we've never had a president like that before.
[04:23.360 --> 04:24.360]  That's not Bill Clinton.
[04:24.360 --> 04:25.360]  That's not George Bush.
[04:25.360 --> 04:26.360]  That's not Barack Obama.
[04:26.360 --> 04:28.360]  They had other agendas.
[04:28.360 --> 04:31.920]  They had people behind them pulling the strings.
[04:31.920 --> 04:36.280]  And that's why you've never seen an attack on a president like you have Donald Trump,
[04:36.280 --> 04:37.280]  folks.
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.120]  Because the same powers that be that have been trying to bring this country down are
[04:41.120 --> 04:45.040]  the same powers that are threatened by Donald Trump, who is a true president of the United
[04:45.040 --> 04:46.040]  States.
[04:46.040 --> 04:48.320]  We're going to hear from Alex Jones on all of this on the other side.
[04:48.320 --> 04:50.800]  This is the Alex Jones show on a Sunday.
[04:50.800 --> 04:58.920]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[04:58.920 --> 05:03.480]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Info War when you visit InfoWarsLife.com
[05:03.480 --> 05:07.960]  and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nace and iodine and all the great products
[05:07.960 --> 05:08.960]  at InfoWarsLife.com.
[05:08.960 --> 05:13.600]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists,
[05:13.600 --> 05:19.480]  and the answer is clear, iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information
[05:19.480 --> 05:22.520]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.960]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these
[05:27.960 --> 05:31.460]  purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[05:31.460 --> 05:35.380]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[05:35.380 --> 05:38.320]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.480]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield Nace and iodine,
[05:42.480 --> 05:46.840]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[05:46.840 --> 05:51.120]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[05:51.120 --> 06:03.320]  It is exclusive to InfoWarsLife.com and the InfoWarsLife family of incredible products.
[06:03.320 --> 06:06.640]  This is an emergency message to President Donald J. Trump.
[06:06.640 --> 06:10.980]  The globalists are openly announcing their plans to overthrow your administration elected
[06:10.980 --> 06:16.040]  by the American people because you have dared to actually restore our republic and set up
[06:16.040 --> 06:19.640]  a constitutional system to actually empower the American people.
[06:19.640 --> 06:23.160]  There's almost $3 trillion already added to the stock market.
[06:23.160 --> 06:27.920]  We see the best numbers with small businesses since the Reagan recovery in 1984 and that
[06:27.920 --> 06:32.800]  only makes the Democrats and Republicans in the power structure more angry at you.
[06:32.800 --> 06:39.480]  Sure, you must launch an 8 o'clock every night of the week special report fireside
[06:39.480 --> 06:45.960]  chat where you go directly to the people countering the lies of MSM and their fake news
[06:45.960 --> 06:48.440]  and their disinformation every day.
[06:48.440 --> 06:53.880]  If you launch this and there's a set time, you will go from the top rated media personality
[06:53.880 --> 07:00.040]  in history to absolutely dwarfing that and breaking the back of the enemy media once
[07:00.040 --> 07:01.040]  and forever.
[07:01.040 --> 07:08.840]  I'm about to break it down live in this special report.
[07:08.840 --> 07:11.720]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[07:11.720 --> 07:16.720]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[07:16.720 --> 07:20.240]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us failed.
[07:20.240 --> 07:26.400]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants for now doesn't mean we've won the war.
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.640]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls and our minds.
[07:30.640 --> 07:32.920]  We have to be good.
[07:32.920 --> 07:33.920]  We have to be pure.
[07:33.920 --> 07:34.920]  We have to be strong.
[07:34.920 --> 07:38.720]  We have to build prosperity and we have to bring every one of every race, color and creed
[07:38.720 --> 07:44.440]  together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to fail,
[07:44.440 --> 07:47.160]  who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[07:47.160 --> 07:55.320]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just become it.
[07:55.320 --> 08:12.720]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, he were losers from the day you were born.
[08:12.720 --> 08:28.480]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[08:28.480 --> 08:29.480]  Move, bitch!
[08:29.480 --> 08:30.480]  Get out of the way!
[08:30.480 --> 08:35.480]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.960]  Info rules help to fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[08:39.960 --> 08:41.960]  It's been a cozy relationship.
[08:41.960 --> 08:47.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us for this live Sunday emergency
[08:47.520 --> 08:48.520]  feed.
[08:48.520 --> 08:50.200]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[08:50.200 --> 08:55.800]  We've got the radio show coming up four to six p.m. tonight that I'll be hosting with
[08:55.800 --> 08:56.800]  Owen Schreuer.
[08:56.800 --> 09:03.200]  But I had to go live at 109 Central Time directly to the American people and directly to the
[09:03.200 --> 09:06.320]  President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
[09:06.320 --> 09:13.160]  Again, it's Sunday, March 5, 2017.
[09:13.160 --> 09:17.280]  I'm not going to really tell the President something he doesn't know, but I'm going to
[09:17.280 --> 09:21.800]  tell the American people some things that they may not know, but also just encourage
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.880]  the President to know that we, the people, have his back and understand what's happening.
[09:26.880 --> 09:33.440]  It was right after the President won the election last year that criminal elements of the intelligence
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.360]  agencies and the bureaucracy that Congress has handed our power over to, the people's
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.860]  power over to, began to openly announce they were planning to overthrow the President.
[09:42.860 --> 09:44.440]  And we had countless reports on this.
[09:44.440 --> 09:50.360]  One of them was put up in the middle of December dealing with the fact that CIA was developing
[09:50.360 --> 09:57.520]  systems and ideas and propaganda to sell the idea of overthrowing the Trump election or
[09:57.520 --> 09:59.920]  even assassinating President Trump.
[09:59.920 --> 10:09.080]  The headline, of course, was Maximum Alert, Rogue CIA working to overthrow Trump election.
[10:09.080 --> 10:16.920]  Now, if you look at the headlines today in CNN, the New York Times, you name it, Obama's
[10:16.920 --> 10:20.480]  silent coup versus Trump, it's everywhere.
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.720]  Obama came out in the New York Times on Thursday and admitted we leaked intelligence to the
[10:24.720 --> 10:25.720]  press.
[10:25.720 --> 10:34.240]  We're going to overthrow Trump, Holder said, Obama is coming like he's a messianic God.
[10:34.240 --> 10:42.200]  They admitted in other reports that they had wiretapped Trump, General Flynn, and others.
[10:42.200 --> 10:46.080]  And I'm going to go over some of those reports.
[10:46.080 --> 10:53.600]  Here's one out of Hearst Publishing, FBI-granted FISA warrant covering Trump camps ties to Russia.
[10:53.600 --> 10:57.560]  And it's been in the news that they spied on myself, Roger Stone, you name it, as if
[10:57.560 --> 10:58.640]  we're Russians.
[10:58.640 --> 11:01.560]  This is truly asinine.
[11:01.560 --> 11:09.640]  But what is amazing about all of this is that now they've come out in the news thinking
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.560]  everybody's so dumb, and I'm getting my message to Trump here in a moment, that they came
[11:14.560 --> 11:21.040]  out in articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post, all the usual suspects saying
[11:21.040 --> 11:28.600]  over and over and over again that it's insane no one wiretapped anybody, nobody spied on
[11:28.600 --> 11:34.200]  Trump or his people thinking we're dumb that they didn't spy on Flynn and release the transcript
[11:34.200 --> 11:37.760]  of him saying to the Russian ambassador, yeah, we'll set up a meeting about sanctions with
[11:37.760 --> 11:38.760]  the president.
[11:38.760 --> 11:42.240]  That's not discussing sanctions, that's saying, yeah, you want a meeting about sanctions, we'll
[11:42.240 --> 11:43.960]  do it.
[11:43.960 --> 11:47.680]  That's not discussing the sanctions, it's saying we'll set up a meeting about sanctions, totally
[11:47.680 --> 11:51.080]  normal for an incoming national security advisor.
[11:51.080 --> 11:55.960]  So Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence on Russian election hacking.
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.320]  They admitted that last week, but now they come out and say in the New York Times, Trump
[12:00.320 --> 12:06.640]  seeks inquiry into unproved allegations that Obama tapped his phones.
[12:06.640 --> 12:07.640]  What?
[12:07.640 --> 12:10.960]  They tapped Trump Tower when Flynn was there making the damn phone calls.
[12:10.960 --> 12:15.600]  You can go show where they admitted that in the very New York Times.
[12:15.600 --> 12:19.560]  I mean, this is insane, but again, they think the public's dumb.
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.040]  Trump's citing no evidence, it's well known, like Trump claims the Atlantic Ocean exists.
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.800]  They admitted that they were tapping the phones at Trump Tower when the incoming president
[12:30.800 --> 12:34.760]  was running his operation out of there, and that's where the phone calls where General
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.640]  Flynn, the incoming national security advisor, taught, wow.
[12:40.640 --> 12:45.880]  Trump accuses Obama of Nixon Watergate wiretap, but offers no evidence, they admit they were
[12:45.880 --> 12:48.680]  tapping his whole operation and could come up with nothing.
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.680]  The House Intelligence Committee chairman on Monday came out.
[12:53.680 --> 12:56.200]  You can Google it and said, we looked at their so-called evidence.
[12:56.200 --> 13:00.520]  There aren't even phone calls with the Russians, any of them in the campaign.
[13:00.520 --> 13:06.560]  There are once he's transitioning to president as president-elect, that's noon as the head
[13:06.560 --> 13:08.760]  of the committee.
[13:08.760 --> 13:12.880]  Again, Trump knows we're a low attention span population, he loves us to death, so he puts
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.200]  these out in tweets, and then they just sit there in the New York Times and tell you none
[13:16.200 --> 13:19.920]  of this happened when I'm giving you a complete roadmap of it.
[13:19.920 --> 13:21.440]  Trump again is dead on.
[13:21.440 --> 13:29.720]  Trump's claim about Obama wiretap in is indefensible, oh my God, the Washington Post, so his aides
[13:29.720 --> 13:36.000]  aren't even defending it, total lie, it's indefensible, oh my God, it's indefensible
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.400]  that they all announced they were wiretapping Trump Tower and listening to every damn word
[13:40.400 --> 13:42.600]  the president and his adjunct said.
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.040]  But technically it's not called a wiretap because they didn't tap it there, they grabbed
[13:46.040 --> 13:51.200]  it in the phone system after it left there at the telecoms.
[13:51.200 --> 13:55.480]  So they're playing games with semantics here.
[13:55.480 --> 14:00.640]  Trump's evidence for Obama wiretap claims relies on sketchy anonymous source reports.
[14:00.640 --> 14:01.640]  Oh, really?
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.320]  The New York Times going, we got from the Obama administration the transcripts of Flynn
[14:06.320 --> 14:10.600]  talking to the Russian ambassador when he said he didn't, then they go, oh, actually
[14:10.600 --> 14:13.680]  he did say he talked to him, just not about the sanctions.
[14:13.680 --> 14:20.760]  So this is next level lying and the president is on target, but I think Mr. President, you
[14:20.760 --> 14:26.040]  need to come out with an address to the nation and say, I called for this country to have
[14:26.040 --> 14:30.080]  its taxes cut and regulations cut to help small businesses and all the great things
[14:30.080 --> 14:32.600]  that you've done, sir, lay that out.
[14:32.600 --> 14:37.880]  And then they come out with more bull that sessions from Alabama, from the army.
[14:37.880 --> 14:45.360]  The cleanest guy in the Senate says in a confirmation hearing to Al Franken, were you or any surrogates
[14:45.360 --> 14:48.880]  in the campaign involved in the campaign, speak to the Russians about the campaign?
[14:48.880 --> 14:49.880]  No, I didn't.
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.640]  Well, wait a minute, you met with him twice last year.
[14:53.640 --> 14:57.800]  Yeah, as the head Republican on the armed services committee.
[14:57.800 --> 14:58.800]  That's what they do.
[14:58.800 --> 14:59.960]  Pelosi met with them.
[14:59.960 --> 15:00.960]  All of them met with them.
[15:00.960 --> 15:01.960]  We have all the photos coming up.
[15:01.960 --> 15:03.920]  But again, Trump's hitting them back.
[15:03.920 --> 15:05.920]  It's beautiful.
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.520]  The problem is they continue to try to bypass everything the president puts out to unify
[15:10.520 --> 15:15.960]  the people with new lies and it signifies that rogue elements in the government.
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.040]  Because Trump can't even get people hired at the CIA at State Department because the
[15:20.040 --> 15:25.040]  government's so full of traders, there's all these operatives log jamming and sabotaging
[15:25.040 --> 15:26.540]  it admittedly.
[15:26.540 --> 15:30.400]  They say they're not letting him get in because he represents the American people and the
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.120]  criminal bureaucracy and the elites believe they own this country.
[15:35.120 --> 15:36.560]  That's Alex Jones, special report.
[15:36.560 --> 15:38.400]  We're going to have more from Alex Jones on the other side.
[15:38.400 --> 15:41.040]  Be sure to support us, folks, infowarstore.com.

[15:45.360 --> 15:46.360]  Be right back.
[15:46.360 --> 15:58.160]  That's Alex Jones on the other side.
[15:58.160 --> 16:03.200]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[16:03.200 --> 16:06.560]  before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk.
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.800]  We are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[16:11.800 --> 16:17.960]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[16:17.960 --> 16:20.320]  great tasting formula, caveman.
[16:20.320 --> 16:24.320]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[16:24.320 --> 16:25.320]  superior ancestors.
[16:25.320 --> 16:28.280]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[16:28.280 --> 16:30.960]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[16:30.960 --> 16:36.120]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength,
[16:36.120 --> 16:40.440]  for the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces
[16:40.440 --> 16:41.540]  the blood for the body.
[16:41.540 --> 16:44.080]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[16:44.080 --> 16:48.440]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[16:48.440 --> 16:52.080]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.520]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com
[16:56.520 --> 16:57.520]  today.

[18:04.040 --> 18:08.360]  produce, about a group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[18:08.360 --> 18:11.800]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[18:11.800 --> 18:14.000]  it's very, very important.
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.640]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[18:20.640 --> 18:24.160]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes, but when it runs out, you
[18:24.160 --> 18:25.160]  start dying.
[18:25.160 --> 18:29.320]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[18:29.320 --> 18:32.200]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[18:32.200 --> 18:33.840]  It works like an antioxidant.
[18:33.840 --> 18:36.840]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.

[18:58.520 --> 19:00.400]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[19:00.400 --> 19:02.400]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[19:02.400 --> 19:03.640]  It's the air we're breathing.
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.280]  Especially for our children.
[19:05.280 --> 19:11.320]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[19:11.320 --> 19:16.280]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[19:16.280 --> 19:21.240]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[19:21.240 --> 19:26.080]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, through the best
[19:26.080 --> 19:28.080]  job you can to purify your air.
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.120]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[19:33.120 --> 19:36.120]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[19:36.120 --> 19:38.320]  The general public doesn't.
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.280]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[19:42.280 --> 19:45.880]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[19:45.880 --> 19:49.440]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[19:49.440 --> 19:52.640]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[19:52.640 --> 20:02.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[20:02.520 --> 20:20.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.640 --> 20:33.600]  Brashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:33.600 --> 20:38.200]  The problem is they continue to try to bypass everything the president puts out to unify
[20:38.200 --> 20:44.560]  the people with new lies, and it signifies that rogue elements in the government, because
[20:44.560 --> 20:48.200]  Trump can't even get people hired at the CIA, the State Department, because the government's
[20:48.200 --> 20:54.200]  so full of traders, there's all these operatives log jamming and sabotaging it admittedly.
[20:54.200 --> 20:58.080]  They say they're not letting him get in because he represents the American people, and the
[20:58.080 --> 21:03.200]  criminal bureaucracy and the elites believe they own this country.
[21:03.200 --> 21:08.480]  And Trump has proven himself to be real with $3 trillion in the stock market just since
[21:08.480 --> 21:10.120]  he got elected.
[21:10.120 --> 21:14.120]  All of it, even Bloomberg and Mitch driven by small businesses and people believing in
[21:14.120 --> 21:18.760]  America again, and the amazing executive orders he's put in saying you won't be penalized
[21:18.760 --> 21:23.280]  $5,000 per employee or individual for not getting Obamacare.
[21:23.280 --> 21:27.280]  And the news won't even tell people the penalty's gone.
[21:27.280 --> 21:30.280]  It just goes on and on and on.
[21:30.280 --> 21:34.720]  So it is very, very, very, very exciting to see what he's doing.
[21:34.720 --> 21:37.160]  And the elites are pissed.
[21:37.160 --> 21:41.360]  Now I saw this Thursday night and Friday I went on air, everybody heard me and I said
[21:41.360 --> 21:46.800]  Trump's first mistake was getting rid of Flynn, his second mistake was telling the attorney
[21:46.800 --> 21:48.640]  general Jeff Sessions to recuse.
[21:48.640 --> 21:53.880]  I said, I can't believe Trump did that because what both of them did was completely normal.
[21:53.880 --> 21:59.400]  Now we know in hindsight that Flynn got called in and chewed out by the vice president.
[21:59.400 --> 22:00.600]  I don't want to get in a fight with Pence.
[22:00.600 --> 22:04.600]  I don't think the guy's bad, but he's from that Republican establishment that just,
[22:04.600 --> 22:05.600]  are wimps.
[22:05.600 --> 22:07.680]  They still believe MSM.
[22:07.680 --> 22:13.440]  And he got surrounded by mad dog Mattis and the rest of them and he said, look, I'm just
[22:13.440 --> 22:16.600]  going back to work in private contracting where I can get 10 times the money.
[22:16.600 --> 22:17.680]  I've tried to help the country.
[22:17.680 --> 22:20.920]  I expose Obama and Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[22:20.920 --> 22:21.920]  I resign.
[22:21.920 --> 22:25.600]  Trump, the word is, and this has now come out, didn't even know until he got word of
[22:25.600 --> 22:26.680]  it.
[22:26.680 --> 22:32.360]  Same way, previous, I said this on Friday, calls people in and says the president wants
[22:32.360 --> 22:33.360]  you to resign.
[22:33.360 --> 22:34.360]  And they go, let me talk to the president.
[22:34.360 --> 22:36.920]  The president goes, I didn't do that and the people are still there.
[22:36.920 --> 22:39.320]  This is the stuff that's going on.
[22:39.320 --> 22:44.080]  And it's not even so much that they're globalist operatives is its power plays, Washington power
[22:44.080 --> 22:47.400]  plays that are going on.
[22:47.400 --> 22:51.280]  Where these people all want their particular power and these guys are in there measuring
[22:51.280 --> 22:54.600]  each other's Johnson's instead of trying to save the country.
[22:54.600 --> 22:56.560]  Only Trump has the vision.
[22:56.560 --> 22:59.240]  It's true to understand what's happening.
[22:59.240 --> 23:01.800]  And I said, I can't believe the president did this on Friday.
[23:01.800 --> 23:06.240]  What came out on Saturday and Sunday, the Hill?
[23:06.240 --> 23:08.800]  Not furious that sessions recused himself.
[23:08.800 --> 23:13.200]  We got video coming up where they're shooting video through the window of big screaming matches
[23:13.200 --> 23:23.280]  going on with Jared Loftner and Jared Loftner, the son-in-law, and of course, Bannon and
[23:23.280 --> 23:28.720]  all the rest of Kushner and Bannon and the rest of it.
[23:28.720 --> 23:30.520]  So all this is happening.
[23:30.520 --> 23:31.520]  All this is going on.
[23:31.520 --> 23:35.720]  Of course, now we learn Trump said, what the hell is this?
[23:35.720 --> 23:39.160]  We don't sit there and let them get rid of our good, clean attorney general and now put
[23:39.160 --> 23:44.040]  a prosecutor in that Obama put in an investigator at the Justice Department.
[23:44.040 --> 23:52.040]  Oh, in the Justice Department, 99% Obama people tell sessions he ought to recused himself.
[23:52.040 --> 23:54.360]  So he does because sessions is so clean.
[23:54.360 --> 23:59.040]  He says, sure, he doesn't get the point is they're going to bully and intimidate every
[23:59.040 --> 24:03.320]  member of the cabinet and Trump can't be bullied or intimidated.
[24:03.320 --> 24:06.680]  But almost all the rest of them can.
[24:06.680 --> 24:10.720]  Previous is a guy that collects money for the Republican Party and goes to dinners and
[24:10.720 --> 24:14.920]  sneaks around like a gremlin and kisses people's butts.
[24:14.920 --> 24:17.520]  He's a modern groom of the stool.
[24:17.520 --> 24:22.000]  I want to believe in Pence does a great job, stands for good things.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.040]  But you look at all this, I know Bannon's strong, restoring the Republic, cutting taxes,
[24:26.040 --> 24:29.960]  empowering the people, breaking the back to collectivism.
[24:29.960 --> 24:34.400]  But this is such a serious situation, we're going to air this today on the radio.
[24:34.400 --> 24:39.520]  We're going to come back to play more of this live on the radio after we go to a break.
[24:39.520 --> 24:46.240]  But here as I do this live in this message, directly to President 45 is just this.
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.440]  These people aren't ever going to stop.
[24:50.440 --> 24:56.120]  We have them and Trump should just do a live speech from the Oval Office next few days and
[24:56.120 --> 25:00.920]  bring in boards, bring in posters, showing them saying they wiretapped, showing them
[25:00.920 --> 25:05.320]  saying they recorded the Trump Tower and then show the very same New York Times saying we
[25:05.320 --> 25:10.240]  didn't record Trump Tower and the same Washington Post saying they didn't do it and saying,
[25:10.240 --> 25:15.960]  saying they never reported that and saying you're crazy, you're bad, you're despicable,
[25:15.960 --> 25:18.160]  you're horrible, you're a bad person.
[25:18.160 --> 25:28.880]  I mean, here are some of the quotes, Trump accuses Obama of Nixon Watergate wiretap but
[25:28.880 --> 25:30.000]  offers no evidence.
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.200]  What?
[25:31.200 --> 25:38.080]  Trump's claim about Obama wiretapping him is indefensible, sketchy.
[25:38.080 --> 25:39.760]  What the hell are you talking about?
[25:39.760 --> 25:44.880]  What's sketchy is you guys admitting you wiretapped him and then ever putting out the Pacific's
[25:44.880 --> 25:50.520]  and then you get Congress looking at it, the Intelligence Committee and they go, there's
[25:50.520 --> 25:51.520]  nothing here.
[25:51.520 --> 25:56.960]  So, here's my message to the President and everybody else, the viewers, the listeners,
[25:56.960 --> 26:00.080]  the activists.
[26:00.080 --> 26:07.360]  I'm personally calling prominent people that are in the libertarian, patriot, pro-human
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.320]  Americana movement.
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.440]  Jesse James sent me a text today, big icon of, you know, gearheads and motorcycle folks
[26:14.440 --> 26:17.800]  and tough guys, really interesting guy, a friend of mine.
[26:17.800 --> 26:21.080]  He sent me a text with something else and I texted him back and I said, don't underestimate
[26:21.080 --> 26:22.640]  how important you are as a rallying cry.
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.080]  I want you on this week to fight back, they're trying to bring Trump down.
[26:26.080 --> 26:28.720]  And he said, absolutely, I'll come on.
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.240]  And I called a bunch of other people and I said, listen, we're in total war mode.
[26:33.240 --> 26:39.120]  I never said and Trump never said that it was going to be easy to restore this republic.
[26:39.120 --> 26:43.680]  This is a battle for America, a real fight to try to get the globalist off our backs
[26:43.680 --> 26:47.360]  and have a government that's for the people and lets the people have freedom, private
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.360]  property, prosperity, and practice their own religion or not.
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.440]  The globalists are conquering the planet, they're a bunch of arrogant, control freaks.
[26:55.440 --> 26:59.480]  Trump is the blue-collar billionaire that actually cares about the people and realizes
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.960]  it'll create giant wealth and the elites will get even richer.
[27:03.960 --> 27:09.920]  He is a billionaire elitist of the people, a true philanthropist that wants to empower
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.960]  the people through free market, through empowerment, through jobs, because all of his businesses
[27:13.960 --> 27:20.360]  are about service and about a good economy brings the Trump empire success.
[27:20.360 --> 27:23.640]  And he knows the world's going into a controlled depression.
[27:23.640 --> 27:30.200]  And Trump's fighting it with Stephen Bannon, whose writings and speeches are dead on about
[27:30.200 --> 27:34.040]  globalism and how they want to make you poor because they've all written it and said it.
[27:34.040 --> 27:39.880]  So the American people, my message to Donald Trump is this, rally the American people,
[27:39.880 --> 27:42.240]  rallies are great, the media can't ignore them.
[27:42.240 --> 27:46.160]  It's good to do all this, but you now, while you have all your power still, as they try
[27:46.160 --> 27:50.680]  to destroy you, as they prepare to destroy your name so they can physically assassinate
[27:50.680 --> 27:55.400]  you, as this soft coup goes into overdrive, as it peaks, as it accelerates, everything
[27:55.400 --> 28:00.120]  I said in November, everything I said in December, first, is what they're now doing.
[28:00.120 --> 28:05.000]  Oh, it's big news, nothing against him when Mark Levin comes out and says there's a coup
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.560]  against Trump and he needs to move against it.
[28:07.560 --> 28:13.520]  Oh my gosh, today, Mark Levin to Congress, investigate Obama's silent coup versus Trump.
[28:13.520 --> 28:15.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[28:15.880 --> 28:20.160]  But it's rogue elements of the intelligence agencies, it's all of it.
[28:20.160 --> 28:25.000]  They are in a mode where they knew you had an avalanche, a huge tsunami, a win, and here's
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.520]  the key to everything.
[28:27.520 --> 28:29.240]  They want to discredit populism.
[28:29.240 --> 28:34.880]  They want to discredit the populist movement worldwide by putting Hillary in that failed.
[28:34.880 --> 28:37.680]  So now they want to discredit it by destroying Trump.
[28:37.680 --> 28:39.680]  And thank God we did not get Hillary Clinton.
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.160]  Can you even imagine what would be going on right now if we had Hillary Clinton in the
[28:44.160 --> 28:45.160]  president's office?
[28:45.160 --> 28:46.160]  My God, I can't imagine.
[28:46.160 --> 28:58.720]  More from Alex Jones on the other side, infowars.com.
[28:58.720 --> 29:03.640]  Mexican congressman Brayulia Gheera scaled to the top of the 30-foot Mexican-American
[29:03.640 --> 29:09.520]  border fence near Tijuana in an attempt to ridicule Trump's plan to build a border wall.
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.640]  Gheera stated, it would be simple for me to jump into the United States, which shows
[29:14.640 --> 29:18.800]  that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall.
[29:18.800 --> 29:24.040]  It shows how unnecessary this project, this political rhetoric from Donald Trump, is.
[29:24.040 --> 29:30.400]  However, all this proves is that the fences on our border right now are too easily climbable.
[29:30.400 --> 29:34.960]  And perhaps some barbed wire at the top of the fence would be a solution to keep people
[29:34.960 --> 29:38.000]  from lounging on top of our border wall.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.360]  The irony here is that the only thing this Mexican congressman accomplished is demonstrating
[29:43.360 --> 29:49.520]  just how unsecured our border fences currently are, which then proves that Donald Trump's
[29:49.520 --> 29:54.080]  idea to build a better, more secure wall is the solution.
[29:54.080 --> 29:58.720]  This is Milly Weaver for infowars.com.
[29:58.720 --> 30:03.240]  We have the new product at infowars.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[30:03.240 --> 30:08.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.080]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[30:14.080 --> 30:18.800]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[30:18.800 --> 30:19.800]  body.
[30:19.800 --> 30:24.040]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[30:24.040 --> 30:26.520]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[30:26.520 --> 30:30.480]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[30:30.480 --> 30:31.480]  all over the body.
[30:31.480 --> 30:37.560]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium,
[30:37.560 --> 30:42.880]  so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[30:42.880 --> 30:44.640]  I'm taking it now every day.
[30:44.640 --> 30:45.640]  This is so key.
[30:45.640 --> 30:49.880]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[30:49.880 --> 30:52.160]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[31:52.880 --> 31:55.520]  infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[31:55.520 --> 31:58.680]  Check it out for yourself today.
[31:58.680 --> 32:03.640]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:03.640 --> 32:06.960]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[32:06.960 --> 32:12.200]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslives.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[32:12.200 --> 32:18.400]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[32:18.400 --> 32:20.760]  great tasting formula, Caveman.
[32:20.760 --> 32:24.760]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:24.760 --> 32:28.720]  superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[32:28.720 --> 32:31.400]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:31.400 --> 32:36.560]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength,
[32:36.560 --> 32:40.880]  for the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors, for the marrow that produces
[32:40.880 --> 32:41.980]  the blood for the body.
[32:41.980 --> 32:44.520]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:44.520 --> 32:48.840]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:48.840 --> 32:52.480]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[32:52.480 --> 32:56.920]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslives.com
[32:56.920 --> 33:02.420]  today.
[33:02.420 --> 33:12.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:12.920 --> 33:14.760]  We are on the march.
[33:14.760 --> 33:17.880]  The empire is on the run.
[33:17.880 --> 33:22.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[33:22.920 --> 33:27.240]  It's rogue elements of the intelligence agencies.
[33:27.240 --> 33:29.000]  It's all of it.
[33:29.000 --> 33:33.880]  They are in a mode where they knew you had an avalanche, a huge tsunami, a win, and here's
[33:33.880 --> 33:36.360]  the key to everything.
[33:36.360 --> 33:38.120]  They want to discredit populism.
[33:38.120 --> 33:44.320]  They want to discredit the populist movement worldwide by putting Hillary in, that failed.
[33:44.320 --> 33:48.560]  So now they want to discredit it by destroying Trump and destroying Le Pen and destroying
[33:48.560 --> 33:51.280]  Nigel Farage and destroying Vladimir Putin.
[33:51.280 --> 33:56.600]  Whether you think Le Pen or Putin or Farage or Trump or angels or devils are in between.
[33:56.600 --> 33:58.200]  They're symbols of nationalism.
[33:58.200 --> 33:59.360]  They're symbols of hope.
[33:59.360 --> 34:03.400]  They're symbols of countries existing and not being overrun exploited by the globalist
[34:03.400 --> 34:05.120]  who admit they're doing that.
[34:05.120 --> 34:09.560]  So to everyone out there that's attacked Trump and drunk the Kool-Aid, you're fools.
[34:09.560 --> 34:14.040]  If you have what you want, this will wound nationalism and sovereignty in the human
[34:14.040 --> 34:15.640]  awakening, but it won't stop it.
[34:15.640 --> 34:20.320]  But it will cause a global depression undoubtedly that Trump and his advisors and good people
[34:20.320 --> 34:22.900]  inside the intelligence agencies are trying to stop.
[34:22.900 --> 34:26.280]  Look at $3 trillion in the stock market.
[34:26.280 --> 34:31.000]  Look at the best small business numbers since 1984 versus all the other bad numbers.
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.880]  Trump is doing textbook what you do to transfer power from the elite to the people.
[34:37.880 --> 34:43.040]  And shame on all the pseudo-intellectuals and fascistic leftists that don't understand
[34:43.040 --> 34:44.520]  that and don't see that.
[34:44.520 --> 34:49.800]  From the bottom of my red-blooded heart, from my Americana heart, but to my pro-human
[34:49.800 --> 34:51.960]  heart to all of you.
[34:51.960 --> 34:58.080]  The reason I get so excited about Trump is I study his policies and 95% of them are solid
[34:58.080 --> 35:00.080]  gold.
[35:00.080 --> 35:01.080]  They're beyond that.
[35:01.080 --> 35:04.440]  It's so nuanced, so perfect, it's incredible.
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.700]  Other parts of it I don't agree with, but then I think he's so good and so much more sophisticated
[35:08.700 --> 35:13.200]  than even I can get, and I research this more than anybody, that I wonder maybe I'm even
[35:13.200 --> 35:14.720]  wrong about that.
[35:14.720 --> 35:16.480]  But this is history happening.
[35:16.480 --> 35:17.480]  There is a war.
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.520]  This is 21st century war going on and when he says that MSM lying with fake news as an
[35:22.520 --> 35:25.400]  enemy of the American people, it is.
[35:25.400 --> 35:30.600]  When he says that the rogue intelligence agencies are acting like Nazis, lying about him and
[35:30.600 --> 35:34.120]  lying about the press and trying to overthrow an elected government, that's exactly what's
[35:34.120 --> 35:35.120]  happening.
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.680]  They're using Joseph Gerber's tactics.
[35:37.680 --> 35:40.960]  And when Chuck E. Schumer and others come out and say, oh, he's attacked all the intelligence
[35:40.960 --> 35:43.080]  agencies, that's another lie.
[35:43.080 --> 35:44.760]  He didn't attack all media.
[35:44.760 --> 35:47.000]  He said a free press is key.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  He said fake news media lying is the enemy of the American people.
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  It is.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.280]  It is the media of the occupiers that have hijacked our country, the oligarchs.
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.400]  And it's the same thing when he talks about the intelligence agencies.
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.200]  But this, look at all the so-called liberals that claim they're against power and against
[36:04.200 --> 36:05.680]  the intelligence agencies.
[36:05.680 --> 36:12.080]  Now they all love it because it's a delusional fantasy that they're part of the power structure.
[36:12.080 --> 36:15.560]  President Trump needs to say to the American people, you've been disenfranchised, elites
[36:15.560 --> 36:20.160]  have hijacked your country, they've sold you out to China and other nations, they have
[36:20.160 --> 36:24.640]  enslaved you, they are trying to make you poor, they admit they want to make you poor,
[36:24.640 --> 36:29.760]  they are lying to you saying they never wiretapped me and then had made up intelligence.
[36:29.760 --> 36:33.720]  The House Intelligence Committee says it's not even what they claim is in there.
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.440]  And then they talk to you like you're stupid and say they're not wiretapping when he can
[36:38.440 --> 36:43.960]  rescind the executive orders Obama put in place that allow the illegal wiretapping of
[36:43.960 --> 36:45.440]  our own government.
[36:45.440 --> 36:50.920]  The NSA was caught under Bush and Obama wiretapping Congress and the heads of the intelligence
[36:50.920 --> 36:54.320]  communities to try to blackmail them.
[36:54.320 --> 37:00.840]  This is rogue state and rogue government and rogue corporations puppeteering that government.
[37:00.840 --> 37:07.440]  This is outrageous 21st century Machiavelli garbage.
[37:07.440 --> 37:13.920]  And then you've got Chuck Schumer and Brennan saying, watch your mouth, President Trump.
[37:13.920 --> 37:17.760]  This is truly a biblical spectacle to see.
[37:17.760 --> 37:23.460]  Let's play a clip from Schumer just a month and a half ago saying, the president better,
[37:23.460 --> 37:25.880]  watch what he does to these intelligence agencies.
[37:25.880 --> 37:31.120]  And now you see the rogue government that is even supposed to be involved, the CIA domestically,
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.160]  with the whole media and 20th century Fox being caught putting out thousands of fake
[37:35.160 --> 37:38.520]  news articles about Donald Trump saying he hates Mexicans.
[37:38.520 --> 37:41.800]  He cut off aid to California.
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.520]  He met secretly with Putin when it's Hillary and all of them meeting with Putin secretly
[37:46.520 --> 37:47.520]  and being caught.
[37:47.520 --> 37:48.520]  We have Medyedyev too.
[37:48.520 --> 37:49.520]  I forgot that clip.
[37:49.520 --> 37:51.600]  We'll get it queued up as we play Schumer.
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.600]  We have that clip.
[37:52.600 --> 37:58.160]  Remember meeting with Obama, remember?
[37:58.160 --> 38:04.160]  And also meeting with Medyedyev and others, Putin, you name it, saying, don't worry.
[38:04.160 --> 38:06.720]  Once I get reelected, I'll be able to do whatever I want.
[38:06.720 --> 38:08.760]  So it's again, Obama and Medyedyev.
[38:08.760 --> 38:09.760]  We have it.
[38:09.760 --> 38:10.760]  We have the clip earlier.
[38:10.760 --> 38:11.760]  That it pulled up.
[38:11.760 --> 38:12.760]  And Obama, they had it pulled up.
[38:12.760 --> 38:13.760]  Good.
[38:13.760 --> 38:14.760]  We have it queued up.
[38:14.760 --> 38:15.760]  Good.
[38:15.760 --> 38:16.760]  We're live right now with the skeleton crew.
[38:16.760 --> 38:17.760]  The main crew is coming in.
[38:17.760 --> 38:18.760]  Show.
[38:18.760 --> 38:20.080]  Teleprompter free here, folks.
[38:20.080 --> 38:21.080]  Just fighting hard.
[38:21.080 --> 38:22.640]  Let's go to the Club of Chuckie Schumer.
[38:22.640 --> 38:24.640]  Here it is.
[38:24.640 --> 38:29.280]  On the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.680]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do
[38:34.680 --> 38:35.680]  this.
[38:35.680 --> 38:37.760]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were moved to?
[38:37.760 --> 38:38.760]  I don't know.
[38:38.760 --> 38:41.760]  From what?
[38:41.760 --> 38:44.760]  So there you go.
[38:44.760 --> 38:46.640]  And I don't have an earpiece in.
[38:46.640 --> 38:48.640]  We got that all in.
[38:48.640 --> 38:50.760]  Roger, Roger.
[38:50.760 --> 38:51.760]  Fantastic.
[38:51.760 --> 38:52.760]  All right.
[38:52.760 --> 38:54.880]  Now let's continue.
[38:54.880 --> 38:56.960]  Let's go ahead and get to the next clip.
[38:56.960 --> 39:00.000]  This is the president of Russia.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.200]  When Putin was prime minister that exchanged places, Medyedyev, if I pronounce his name
[39:05.200 --> 39:06.200]  right.
[39:06.200 --> 39:10.080]  This is a famous meeting where he didn't know a shotgun mic was aimed at him.
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.400]  A long-distance mic, or mics were turned off, but a long-distance mic in the press gallery
[39:14.400 --> 39:19.720]  got him saying, I can do a lot more once I'm re-elected, meaning I'm not letting Congress
[39:19.720 --> 39:23.960]  and the people know what I'm planning, but once I get re-elected, I can do a lot more.
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.280]  This is truly an off-the-record secret meeting he believes he's having that got caught on
[39:28.280 --> 39:29.280]  tape.
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.200]  But the point is, a president's allowed to say whatever he wants to the Russians as
[39:32.200 --> 39:35.440]  long as he doesn't sell out U.S. interests, like Hillary did at the State Department.
[39:35.440 --> 39:42.400]  The idea that even if Trump survives all this attempt to overthrow him, it's to kill us
[39:42.400 --> 39:47.440]  ever having relations, not just with Russia, but anybody else when the MSM and others tell
[39:47.440 --> 39:53.120]  you that someone's a traitor, if they're an elected president, having communications
[39:53.120 --> 39:54.120]  with anybody.
[39:54.120 --> 39:56.120]  So here's part of that famous press conference.
[39:56.120 --> 40:25.880]  Now, I know personally that the president likes a slow, smooth briefing of data.
[40:25.880 --> 40:30.240]  But my briefing is here to give people the facts, but also get the American people that
[40:30.240 --> 40:33.840]  are on the couch to understand, rah, rah, this is like a football game.
[40:33.840 --> 40:34.840]  We've got to get excited.
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.840]  But let me give the president a nice soothing briefing, because I know that's how the president
[40:38.840 --> 40:40.440]  likes it, I'm told.
[40:40.440 --> 40:45.120]  Mr. President, your instincts are obviously on target that sessions should not ever accuse
[40:45.120 --> 40:48.680]  himself, and you've got to be asking yourself the question, how is this happening without
[40:48.680 --> 40:50.160]  your authorization?
[40:50.160 --> 40:55.960]  And the answer is, a lot of the men around you, though they're good, they are cowards
[40:55.960 --> 40:57.200]  compared to you.
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.760]  That's not an ass-kissing event, it's a statement of fact, no bragg just fact.
[41:01.760 --> 41:05.840]  And so that's why you've got to absolutely instruct them, as I'm sure you've already
[41:05.840 --> 41:10.080]  done, I'm told you got very, very angry before you left back to Marlago, and to tell them
[41:10.080 --> 41:15.200]  that no one is to resign now without doing it to your face, or no one is to recuse themselves
[41:15.200 --> 41:17.080]  without doing it to your face.
[41:17.080 --> 41:21.160]  I know you hire people because they have good backgrounds, and you trust them, and then
[41:21.160 --> 41:24.560]  you tell them, run their own departments, you're a great delegator.
[41:24.560 --> 41:31.280]  The problem is, Sessions is a great guy, not a coward, but he got bullied into this.
[41:31.280 --> 41:36.000]  Same thing with General Flynn, who I know left before he even knew it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.120]  I know you're telling the Pentagon, hey, if you know there's al-Qaeda and you've got
[41:39.120 --> 41:41.520]  them targeted, and it's legal, target them.
[41:41.520 --> 41:46.000]  There's moles inside, even if they're mainly good people, that just like Yemen will blow
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.720]  operations just like Kennedy at the Bay of Pigs, they will set you up, Mr. President.
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.480]  You have to green light, and you have to certify, and you have to approve everything, or the
[41:56.480 --> 41:58.400]  traders will undermine you.
[41:58.400 --> 42:03.960]  I know you have good will, and you believe the illegal back off if you create incredible
[42:03.960 --> 42:06.840]  prosperity for everybody, and prove you're right.
[42:06.840 --> 42:09.240]  They don't want to grow the economy, sir.
[42:09.240 --> 42:12.280]  They want to implode it and consolidate it.
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.240]  You've run service-based, successful companies.
[42:16.240 --> 42:18.520]  They run monopolies, sir.
[42:18.520 --> 42:20.760]  And they're your enemy, and they're our enemy.
[42:20.760 --> 42:23.080]  So I salute you for your hard work.
[42:23.080 --> 42:25.680]  I thank you for your courage, it's unprecedented.
[42:25.680 --> 42:29.720]  And the $3 trillion in the stock market, and all the new jobs, and everything the elite
[42:29.720 --> 42:31.720]  are trying to block.
[42:31.720 --> 42:35.240]  And your tweets are amazing, and they're on target, but they take them out of context
[42:35.240 --> 42:38.520]  and claim you haven't shown evidence of them wiretapping.
[42:38.520 --> 42:39.520]  I know they bragged.
[42:39.520 --> 42:42.680]  That's right, folks, they take everything Donald Trump does, and they take it out of
[42:42.680 --> 42:46.640]  context, and they try to claim that it's un-American or Russian.
[42:46.640 --> 42:47.640]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[42:47.640 --> 42:48.640]  That's Alex Jones from earlier.
[42:48.640 --> 42:51.680]  We're going to have more of Alex Jones on the other side.
[42:51.680 --> 42:55.680]  Infowarsstore.com, support this operation, folks.

[43:56.160 --> 43:58.440]  Hey, everyone.
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.160]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[44:02.160 --> 44:04.440]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[44:04.440 --> 44:06.720]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[44:06.720 --> 44:11.320]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[44:11.320 --> 44:16.800]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[44:16.800 --> 44:20.080]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.240]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[44:23.240 --> 44:26.040]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.360]  vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional
[44:30.360 --> 44:35.120]  raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental
[44:35.120 --> 44:39.440]  nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.120]  healing work, you need to check out InfowarsTeam.com.

[44:50.280 --> 45:00.560]  Follow the web at InfowarsTeam.com.
[45:00.560 --> 45:01.720]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[45:01.720 --> 45:02.720]  This is Alex Jones.
[45:02.720 --> 45:04.800]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid
[45:04.800 --> 45:08.920]  products of 2017, and seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[45:08.920 --> 45:12.560]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System from our friends at Solutions from
[45:12.560 --> 45:14.840]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[45:14.840 --> 45:19.040]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.880]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[45:23.880 --> 45:28.320]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[45:28.320 --> 45:29.320]  even airplanes.
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.520]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own
[45:33.520 --> 45:36.760]  private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[45:36.760 --> 45:41.360]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[45:41.360 --> 45:44.720]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[45:44.720 --> 45:46.800]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[45:46.800 --> 45:52.560]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[45:52.560 --> 45:54.960]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[45:54.960 --> 45:58.240]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.520]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[46:02.520 --> 46:07.880]  a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.840]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[46:12.840 --> 46:14.440]  at InfoWareShore.com.
[46:14.440 --> 46:18.280]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[46:18.280 --> 46:22.400]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.640]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders of about $50.
[46:27.640 --> 46:31.680]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[46:31.680 --> 46:33.480]  the products that you need each month.
[46:33.480 --> 46:38.080]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto-ship and
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.200]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[46:41.200 --> 46:46.520]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto-ship feature at InfoWareStore.com,
[46:46.520 --> 46:47.880]  this is a sure win.
[46:47.880 --> 46:53.880]  10% off on auto-ship, win, win, win at InfoWareStore.com, free shipping on orders of about $50.
[46:53.880 --> 47:01.960]  And all auto-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[47:01.960 --> 47:12.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:12.960 --> 47:21.960]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[47:21.960 --> 47:29.120]  There's holes inside, even if they're mainly good people, that just like Yemen will blow
[47:29.120 --> 47:32.120]  operations just like Kennedy at the Bay of Pigs.
[47:32.120 --> 47:34.800]  They will set you up, Mr. President.
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.560]  You have to green light, and you have to certify, and you have to approve everything, or the
[47:39.560 --> 47:41.480]  traders will undermine you.
[47:41.480 --> 47:47.080]  I know you have goodwill, and you believe the illegal back off if you create incredible
[47:47.080 --> 47:49.960]  prosperity for everybody and prove you're right.
[47:49.960 --> 47:52.360]  They don't want to grow the economy, sir.
[47:52.360 --> 47:55.360]  They want to implode it and consolidate it.
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.320]  You've run service-based, successful companies.
[47:59.320 --> 48:03.840]  They run monopolies, sir, and they're your enemy, and they're our enemy.
[48:03.840 --> 48:06.160]  So I salute you for your hard work.
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.440]  I thank you for your courage, it's unprecedented, and the $3 trillion in the stock market and
[48:10.440 --> 48:14.800]  all the new jobs and everything the elite are trying to block.
[48:14.800 --> 48:18.320]  And your tweets are amazing, and they're on target, but they take them out of context
[48:18.320 --> 48:21.600]  and claim you haven't shown evidence of them wiretapping.
[48:21.600 --> 48:25.280]  I know they bragged and said they wiretapped you.
[48:25.280 --> 48:26.840]  It doesn't matter.
[48:26.840 --> 48:31.400]  I know the courts say they refuse their wiretaps, so they're illegal.
[48:31.400 --> 48:36.280]  I understand that, but they're going to snip it out of context and play dumb and lie by
[48:36.280 --> 48:43.040]  omission so you must put together your own media reports, sir, that aren't just you speaking,
[48:43.040 --> 48:46.160]  but you giving the American people daily briefings.
[48:46.160 --> 48:53.200]  Mr. President, I know for a fact, if you give the American people a fireside chat with
[48:53.200 --> 48:59.040]  a briefing and just bring in the media technicians, any competent group can do it.
[48:59.040 --> 49:01.440]  They claim they can't, they're liars.
[49:01.440 --> 49:07.120]  I and one other person, one other editor, I'm not asking for this job, could come there
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.600]  and put together an hour-long briefing with your information and your analysis in an hour
[49:12.600 --> 49:14.400]  for you to do a 30-minute briefing.
[49:14.400 --> 49:20.160]  One hour guaranteed showing everything you say with a document, an article, their own
[49:20.160 --> 49:23.520]  statements where they can't play dumb and can't act like they don't know what you're
[49:23.520 --> 49:24.720]  talking about.
[49:24.720 --> 49:29.440]  When you show a lapue or, you know, 10 other major studies that two to three million illegals
[49:29.440 --> 49:35.560]  vote in the 2008 election or the 2012 election, not to mention yours, they can't play dumb.
[49:35.560 --> 49:36.560]  You'll be there.
[49:36.560 --> 49:40.880]  You'll hold up that, just like you hold up the bills when you sign them.
[49:40.880 --> 49:42.480]  That's the number one thing.
[49:42.480 --> 49:45.120]  You get on the offense.
[49:45.120 --> 49:46.120]  You do what you've already done.
[49:46.120 --> 49:47.960]  I've been saying for months.
[49:47.960 --> 49:51.200]  Check out Hillary with the Communist Chinese, Hillary with the Russians.
[49:51.200 --> 49:55.560]  You show Chuckie Schumer, as you did Friday, from Drudge and other reports.
[49:55.560 --> 49:59.560]  Again, it's the human intelligence doing the research showing it.
[49:59.560 --> 50:03.840]  You go to the humet, Drudge, info wars, you name it, Breitbart.
[50:03.840 --> 50:07.560]  You show what's happening and all the rest of the media follows.
[50:07.560 --> 50:12.280]  Trump tweets photo Schumer, just as you've called for Pelosi, who said she didn't meet
[50:12.280 --> 50:17.240]  with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
[50:17.240 --> 50:23.840]  And you show the photo of her, indeed, across the table from him with the other Russians.
[50:23.840 --> 50:26.120]  So that's how this works.
[50:26.120 --> 50:27.320]  And you know what you're doing.
[50:27.320 --> 50:32.400]  You just don't have, I understand Breitbart is disconnected from Stephen Bannon.
[50:32.400 --> 50:33.400]  He's too busy with policy.
[50:33.400 --> 50:34.400]  I get it.
[50:34.400 --> 50:41.280]  And I understand that Breitbart's there covering your six with research nomination.
[50:41.280 --> 50:42.600]  Info wars is not asking for that job.
[50:42.600 --> 50:44.600]  We already have that job with the American people.
[50:44.600 --> 50:45.600]  We're already doing it.
[50:45.600 --> 50:49.120]  I think, sir, no one has the ratings or Q scores of you.
[50:49.120 --> 50:53.000]  No one has higher viewership than you in your history and media.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.560]  Again, not kissing your butt, sir.
[50:54.560 --> 50:55.560]  You know, it's already true.
[50:55.560 --> 50:57.920]  Schwarzenegger took over your number one show.
[50:57.920 --> 50:59.480]  He's now been fired.
[50:59.480 --> 51:00.480]  Total loser.
[51:00.480 --> 51:01.960]  Everybody's sick of the old system.
[51:01.960 --> 51:05.840]  They're sick of disingenuous, fake, tough guys that act tough in movies.
[51:05.840 --> 51:06.840]  You're tough.
[51:06.840 --> 51:07.840]  You became the 45th president.
[51:07.840 --> 51:08.840]  It's overwhelming.
[51:08.840 --> 51:09.840]  Our odds.
[51:09.840 --> 51:12.000]  You kicked the globalist, but you're restoring the Republic.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.240]  You have the entire new old order global combined against you.
[51:15.240 --> 51:19.840]  A lot of the public and smart enough to get it, but a lot of us are, we're behind you.
[51:19.840 --> 51:23.040]  You've already damaged them so much, exposing their globalist program that no matter what
[51:23.040 --> 51:28.520]  they do to you, it won't destroy the populist movement and these losers need to know that.
[51:28.520 --> 51:30.440]  But you've got to call for congressional hearings.
[51:30.440 --> 51:32.080]  You've got to have your own hearings.
[51:32.080 --> 51:34.080]  You've got to have your own displays.
[51:34.080 --> 51:39.360]  You've got to counter them every day, 30 minutes at say eight o'clock at night, sir.
[51:39.360 --> 51:41.560]  And you will destroy them.
[51:41.560 --> 51:44.860]  You will have more viewers than the entire MSM combined.
[51:44.860 --> 51:47.760]  We already have more viewers than most of the MSM.
[51:47.760 --> 51:52.680]  Drudge already has more clicks and viewers than all MSM combined.
[51:52.680 --> 51:53.680]  That's pure research.
[51:53.680 --> 51:56.440]  The New York Times admits more than Facebook and New York Times combined.
[51:56.440 --> 51:58.240]  I'm bigger than New York Times online.
[51:58.240 --> 51:59.400]  They're a damn joke.
[51:59.400 --> 52:01.120]  Call them out.
[52:01.120 --> 52:06.080]  We let these facades sit up there and act like they care about the American people or
[52:06.080 --> 52:07.960]  that they're sitting there putting out truth.
[52:07.960 --> 52:11.560]  Well, all they're doing is giving cover for a bunch of criminals that are in the government
[52:11.560 --> 52:16.840]  that have ignored your orders in the Constitution to set the stage to politically demonize you
[52:16.840 --> 52:22.320]  enough to assassinate you physically or to have false witnesses come forward and fake
[52:22.320 --> 52:28.360]  hearings and have you impeached by that pack of cowards in Congress who don't want prosperity.
[52:28.360 --> 52:33.040]  They're a bunch of cowards, 180 degrees from you and I.
[52:33.040 --> 52:35.000]  You remember our more lengthy conversation.
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.800]  The others have been short when you called me on the Friday after you've been elected
[52:39.800 --> 52:44.800]  three and a half days later and you were said, thank your listeners.
[52:44.800 --> 52:45.800]  Thank everybody.
[52:45.800 --> 52:46.800]  Keep up your work.
[52:46.800 --> 52:47.800]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[52:47.800 --> 52:48.800]  I need your support.
[52:48.800 --> 52:49.800]  Thank you.
[52:49.800 --> 52:53.520]  And I said, sir, I know you think you're going to create prosperity and turn America back
[52:53.520 --> 52:54.520]  on.
[52:54.520 --> 52:55.520]  I know the plan.
[52:55.520 --> 52:58.840]  We talked about it previously, but I said they're coming after you.
[52:58.840 --> 53:01.360]  They're never going to give up because you're the real deal.
[53:01.360 --> 53:02.560]  You care about this country.
[53:02.560 --> 53:03.560]  You're strong.
[53:03.560 --> 53:07.720]  You're honorable and they are never going to allow you to stop their monopoly until
[53:07.720 --> 53:12.120]  you go on the offense, you must, even though I know it's not the president's position,
[53:12.120 --> 53:13.600]  but make sure you get people in there.
[53:13.600 --> 53:15.080]  They'll carry out justice.
[53:15.080 --> 53:17.000]  He said, very interesting.
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  Hold on one minute.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  He comes back and he goes, let me hear more about this.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.040]  And I said, well, you already know in your instincts, don't listen to the people around
[53:24.040 --> 53:25.040]  you.
[53:25.040 --> 53:28.040]  They may be good, but they don't have the courage to go up against the power structure.
[53:28.040 --> 53:35.440]  And if you really want to do this, then cut the taxes, cut the regulations, put the coal
[53:35.440 --> 53:36.560]  plants back on.
[53:36.560 --> 53:38.080]  This is all, he goes, absolutely, I'm doing it.
[53:38.080 --> 53:39.080]  I'm doing it.
[53:39.080 --> 53:40.080]  You watch.
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.360]  I'm going to do it.
[53:44.360 --> 53:51.160]  And the president's super smart when I say dog-like, I mean, honorable, true, delivering
[53:51.160 --> 53:52.160]  what he said.
[53:52.160 --> 53:55.520]  He's like a St. Bernard going to rescue people in the frozen ice or something.
[53:55.520 --> 54:02.160]  I mean, it's sick to watch this guy being attacked by all the scum and they're just
[54:02.160 --> 54:05.640]  never going to stop because they're after us, the bitter clingers, the Christians, the
[54:05.640 --> 54:07.080]  gun owners, the hard workers.
[54:07.080 --> 54:12.520]  They feed off us and parasites always have to stain for the host.
[54:12.520 --> 54:14.440]  And Trump can't even roll over, which he won't.
[54:14.440 --> 54:19.560]  Mr. President, I know you'll never roll over a compromise, but even if you did, they're
[54:19.560 --> 54:20.560]  not going to stop.
[54:20.560 --> 54:23.240]  They've got to destroy you forever.
[54:23.240 --> 54:28.240]  I said this many times during the campaign and now they're saying it, it's a death battle.
[54:28.240 --> 54:30.000]  We're the resistance against their tyranny.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.520]  They're the resistance against humanity and free markets and open free societies.
[54:34.520 --> 54:38.360]  And I feel so sorry for people that can't see it, that have been caught by this weird
[54:38.360 --> 54:44.040]  demon spirit of the age to just go along with evil and corruption and just thank God, Mr.
[54:44.040 --> 54:48.480]  President, that we're not the scumbag Obama, the loser of eight years, the failure.
[54:48.480 --> 54:52.120]  Now who thinks he can be the big community organizer down the street from you, who brags
[54:52.120 --> 54:58.840]  it's his plan to bring you down and the New York Times acts like it's not true, codify
[54:58.840 --> 55:06.720]  the data each day, go after him with their own words, hold up where they admit they were
[55:06.720 --> 55:10.680]  wiretapping your Trump tower and then show the New York Times saying they're not doing
[55:10.680 --> 55:13.720]  it just like you've been doing it and they will fall.
[55:13.720 --> 55:19.920]  But you need a set time every day that you go live.
[55:19.920 --> 55:22.680]  They tried to say as the president, you shouldn't have a Twitter.
[55:22.680 --> 55:25.120]  Hell, next you shouldn't have blood flowing through your veins.
[55:25.120 --> 55:29.160]  I mean God, everybody knows you can't talk to foreign leaders as president and God knows
[55:29.160 --> 55:33.400]  you can't breathe oxygen and God knows you can't have a Twitter.
[55:33.400 --> 55:35.240]  They want to isolate you.
[55:35.240 --> 55:39.480]  They want to lie about you and they're not going to stop you put your family, your treasure
[55:39.480 --> 55:40.480]  on the line.
[55:40.480 --> 55:43.640]  They're going to destroy your family if you don't win and let your family know this.
[55:43.640 --> 55:44.640]  I know they're smart.
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.600]  I know your sons are strong, but let the people in your family know.
[55:48.600 --> 55:50.840]  They're still coming back from this.
[55:50.840 --> 55:52.400]  This is total war.
[55:52.400 --> 55:57.040]  They're not going to let your family roll over even if you're destroyed, although let
[55:57.040 --> 55:59.480]  them roll over at first and then destroy them as well.
[55:59.480 --> 56:01.360]  They're going to destroy you.
[56:01.360 --> 56:03.040]  They're going to destroy Baron.
[56:03.040 --> 56:04.520]  They're going to destroy Eric.
[56:04.520 --> 56:06.280]  They're going to destroy Donald Jr.
[56:06.280 --> 56:07.720]  They're going to destroy me.
[56:07.720 --> 56:09.280]  They're going to destroy Matt Drudge.
[56:09.280 --> 56:10.920]  They're going to destroy Ron Paul.
[56:10.920 --> 56:16.160]  They're going to destroy anybody like Stephen Bannon that actually stood up for the little
[56:16.160 --> 56:20.920]  people because that example can't be allowed because if you let one aunt stand up, they
[56:20.920 --> 56:29.720]  might all stand up and those little aunts outnumber the parasites a thousand to one.
[56:29.720 --> 56:31.680]  If they want a war, let's let them have it.
[56:31.680 --> 56:33.680]  Now they're getting their ass kicked in the economy.
[56:33.680 --> 56:35.640]  Your approval ratings are going up, sir.
[56:35.640 --> 56:38.440]  They don't care.
[56:38.440 --> 56:44.280]  They're going to intimidate and pay off and roll people in your second level operation
[56:44.280 --> 56:46.040]  to try to burn you.
[56:46.040 --> 56:48.240]  You must go on the offense.
[56:48.240 --> 56:49.320]  This is war.
[56:49.320 --> 56:53.600]  You think George Washington kicked the redcoats ass just with information?
[56:53.600 --> 56:54.600]  No.
[56:54.600 --> 56:56.600]  We tried to start this country peacefully.
[56:56.600 --> 56:57.840]  They wouldn't let us.
[56:57.840 --> 57:02.000]  And the rebirth of this country, and I want peaceful resistance in the Info War, but through
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.880]  your office and through the Attorney General, they're already trying to broke back and hamstring.
[57:06.880 --> 57:10.520]  These criminals are all on the communist, Chinese and Russian payroll.
[57:10.520 --> 57:12.960]  They're the ones that sold us out every foreign interest.
[57:12.960 --> 57:14.160]  That's what globalism is.
[57:14.160 --> 57:19.040]  I'm going to have a big Washington insider in studio tomorrow that's here in town I met
[57:19.040 --> 57:20.040]  with about all this stuff today.
[57:20.040 --> 57:22.480]  So get ready for his emergency message to Trump tomorrow.
[57:22.480 --> 57:24.600]  Now, coming up in hours.
[57:24.600 --> 57:28.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will have the conclusion of Alex Jones's special report on the other
[57:28.200 --> 57:29.960]  side, but they want to shut us down.
[57:29.960 --> 57:30.960]  You know this.
[57:30.960 --> 57:33.560]  Go to infowars.com slash newsletter.
[57:33.560 --> 57:35.040]  Sign up for the Info Wars newsletter.
[57:35.040 --> 57:41.720]  We give you special offers at infowarstore.com plus it's a direct source so that they try
[57:41.720 --> 57:42.820]  to shut this show down.
[57:42.820 --> 57:46.600]  We can still reach you with that newsletter, infowars.com slash newsletter.
[57:46.600 --> 57:50.120]  Alex Jones and myself, Owen Troyer on the other side.
[57:50.120 --> 57:52.080]  Let's get a follow up creation.
[57:52.080 --> 57:53.080]  Charlie Daniels.
[57:53.080 --> 57:54.080]  He's always loved America.
[57:54.080 --> 57:56.080]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[57:56.080 --> 58:01.120]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[58:01.120 --> 58:03.960]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[58:03.960 --> 58:05.960]  Well, you know, the next one's going to be, don't you?
[58:05.960 --> 58:06.960]  It's going to be coming after you.
[58:06.960 --> 58:07.960]  Good.
[58:07.960 --> 58:08.960]  Oh yeah.
[58:08.960 --> 58:10.960]  I take it ain't going to sit well down my way at all.
[58:10.960 --> 58:11.960]  It ain't going to sit well.
[58:11.960 --> 58:14.200]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[58:14.200 --> 58:15.400]  They lost.
[58:15.400 --> 58:16.400]  We won.
[58:16.400 --> 58:18.280]  We want to see what Trump's up against.
[58:18.280 --> 58:19.760]  It's time to ride, boys.
[58:19.760 --> 58:21.280]  We need a thousand toddler beers.
[58:21.280 --> 58:25.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.760]  Heritage, mom and apple pie.
[58:27.760 --> 58:30.080]  And beef was for supper.
[58:30.080 --> 58:32.680]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[58:32.680 --> 58:34.480]  The ethical screenings on demand.
[58:34.480 --> 58:36.080]  DVDs now available.
[58:36.080 --> 58:40.400]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.
[58:40.400 --> 58:44.080]  We want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue.
[58:44.080 --> 58:45.680]  Revelation, the movie.
[58:45.680 --> 58:46.680]  The info.
[58:46.680 --> 58:48.800]  Let's fix it.
[58:48.800 --> 58:55.400]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense,
[58:55.400 --> 58:56.400]  probiotic.
[58:56.400 --> 59:03.120]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[59:03.120 --> 59:10.800]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[59:10.800 --> 59:15.760]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[59:15.760 --> 59:22.440]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[59:22.440 --> 59:27.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.520]  probiotic on the market.

[59:52.440 --> 1:00:04.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:04.760 --> 1:00:13.360]  Here is the passion of slaves, and this man knows no fear, he is Alex Jones.
[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:19.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:23.680]  We are live on a Sunday, this is the second hour, as I said we're going to have the conclusion
[1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:28.840]  of Alex Jones special report from earlier, and the conclusion is quite fiery, classic
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:32.120]  Alex Jones if you will, but how can you not be fired up with everything that's going
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:38.800]  on right now, they are attacking our president, the first president in my life that puts Americans
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:43.480]  first, the first president in my life whose agenda caters to the people of the United
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:51.320]  States of America, instead of some foreign technocracy with aims of global domination.
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:54.360]  That's not Donald Trump, that's why he is under so much attack.
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:57.920]  Of course you know that we are also under attack, and just like Donald Trump needs us
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:01.760]  more than ever to stand up for him, we need you more than ever to stand up for us, and
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:06.760]  you know how to do that folks, infowarstore.com, we have all kinds of specials going right
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:11.120]  now, we try to bring you groundbreaking products, I mean it's almost like a monthly, weekly
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:13.520]  thing here, we're bringing you a new groundbreaking product.
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:20.240]  The latest one is our caveman, paleo bone broth formulation, we've got Trump Pence 2020 t-shirts,
[1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:23.520]  both are new products right now, the crew, they can't figure out which one they want
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:28.680]  to show you, but get your Trump Pence 2020 shirt because look, if you get the Trump
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:33.880]  Pence 2020 shirt, you're supporting this broadcast, you're helping us grow, and you're
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:39.360]  also supporting Donald Trump, and then you wear that shirt out, you can meet like-minded
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:43.280]  people and you can tell people why you're wearing the shirt and maybe beat some of the
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:48.880]  propaganda that they try to force feed them with the mainstream media.
[1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:52.840]  So you're killing, really you're killing three birds with one stone, you're funding this
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:57.160]  operation, you're supporting Trump, you're meeting like-minded people, you're starting
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:02.600]  a conversation in the three-dimensional world, and Alex said he wanted a million of those
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:07.840]  shirts sold, folks, that's why he's selling them at pretty much the price that we pay
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:12.560]  for them, I don't know, we maybe take a dime out of that, but we pretty much just sell
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:17.240]  that right back to you at the price we pay, and that's because we want this shirt on
[1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:23.600]  the streets, we want to get the message out there, that's why Infowars.com exists, folks,
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:29.600]  to spread the message of liberty, to spread the message of truth and justice.
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:36.360]  Infowars.com, please support us, sign up for the newsletter, Infowars.com slash newsletter.
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:39.800]  Now before we get back to Alex Jones on the other side of this break, talking about the
[1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:43.440]  attacks from the deep state on Donald Trump, of course it goes beyond the deep state, it's
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:47.600]  the shadow government, but just look at some of the guys that are coming out right now
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:51.560]  against Donald Trump with this wiretapping claim.
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:59.160]  Now James Comey is heading drudge right now, Comey asked Justice Department to reject Trump's
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:01.120]  wiretapping claim.
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:10.320]  Now I find this funny, so James Comey, without, I don't ask James Comey done an investigation,
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:15.920]  does James Comey know for a fact that there was no wiretapping, even though we know for
[1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:20.680]  a fact there was wiretapping, they even admitted it, they were trying to look for ties with
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:24.760]  Russian banks and Donald Trump, so they wiretapped and they found nothing, they continued to
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:26.040]  do it.
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:29.800]  We know this went on.
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:37.200]  And you know, I also have to say, Marco Rubio is not exactly coming out against Trump, obviously
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:45.160]  like he was during the election cycle, however, little Marco, little Marco, oh little Marco,
[1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:49.840]  do you remember what you said during the debates, little Marco, Barack Obama is a president
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:55.840]  that knows exactly what he's doing, he's the bad guy, he knows exactly what he's doing,
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:04:02.760]  I'm quoting you little Marco, so do you think that Obama knew exactly what he was doing
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:09.600]  when he was, when he was tapping Trump Tower, oh and you can play semantics if you want,
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:13.920]  oh but it wasn't Obama, it was these guys, or this or that, please, you don't think
[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:19.120]  Barack Obama knew what was going on, you don't think that he was keeping Hillary Clinton's
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:26.120]  campaign in the no, give me a break, but you know what, there's this overarching thing that
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:36.040]  is even more funny, folks, the NSA spies on all of us, okay, no crap that they were wiretapping
[1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:44.480]  Donald Trump, they've got all the files, they're wiretapping everybody, James Clapper was already
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:51.680]  being held with contempt for lying about that, so they're just trying to lie on top of lies,
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:59.680]  more from Alex Jones on the other side, infowarstore.com, support this broadcast.
[1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.580]  Mexican congressman Brayulia Guillera scaled to the top of the 30-foot Mexican-American
[1:05:04.580 --> 1:05:10.520]  border fence near Tijuana in an attempt to ridicule Trump's plan to build a border wall,
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:15.560]  Guillera stated, it would be simple for me to jump into the United States, which shows
[1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:21.080]  that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall, it shows how unnecessary
[1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:27.000]  this project, this political rhetoric from Donald Trump is, however, all this proves
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:32.160]  is that the fences on our border right now are too easily climbable, and perhaps some
[1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:36.720]  barbed wire at the top of the fence would be a solution to keep people from lounging
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:42.200]  on top of our border wall, the irony here is that the only thing this Mexican congressman
[1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:48.920]  accomplished is demonstrating just how unsecured our border fences currently are, which then
[1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:55.000]  proves that Donald Trump's idea to build a better, more secure wall is the solution.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:24.840]  This is Milly Weaver for infowars.com.
[49:37.940 --> 1:06:50.160]  you better get online now, you better call in the talk radio and c-span, and you
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:54.200]  better call congress, and those phones better melt down, they were going to have the Syrian
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:55.200]  war.
[1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:59.640]  But our own military came out and said, we're not going to back Al Qaeda that became ISIS,
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:02.280]  we're not going to back this evil, and the American people said, hell yeah, we're not
[1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:03.280]  for it either.
[1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:07.720]  We are military now to cover their faces up like they did with signs saying I'm with Trump,
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:12.200]  the globalists are the traitors, stop the coup against Trump, we need American people
[1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.600]  to get behind the military and the patriots and the intelligence agencies that are the
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:17.920]  majority, but not the top.
[1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:22.200]  Trump's gotten one deep of his people in, the next, second, third, and fourth layer
[1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:28.560]  are globalists, and they all need to be purged, it'd be better to have none of them there
[1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:33.000]  than to have them in place right now as they block him getting people hired into place.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:39.600]  We got a beachhead in DC folks, but our republic is under total unmitigated attack.
[1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:43.560]  This is the second battle for the republic, even more important than the first that began
[1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:45.000]  in 1776.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:50.560]  This is history happening now, and it's time for everybody to be like John Hancock when
[1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:54.440]  they signed that Declaration of Independence, it was a death warrant for many.
[1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:58.920]  He signed his name the biggest at the bottom because he wanted him to know who he was.
[1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:04.120]  Don't sign this thing little, don't be involved, keep your head down, that's the way to get
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:05.120]  ahead.
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:11.440]  That's how nations of slaves like North Korea are born, poor people in Venezuela, place
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:12.440]  like that.
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:16.760]  America is about standing up and being seen and being heard, and stop letting the majority
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:21.840]  of people spread the word or buy the products, we've got a shirt out right now that is the
[1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:26.440]  new shirt, Trump pants 2020 to be seen in the streets, to stand up for the bullies,
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:30.040]  to meet like-minded people, to let them know they're not going to shut us up.
[1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:35.440]  It is so critical that everyone get the shirt at inforwarstore.com, or triple eight, two,
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:40.240]  five, three, three, one, three, nine, and yeah, we're selling thousands today, it isn't about
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:42.400]  the damn money, they're 995.
[1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:45.440]  It's about defeating the globalist.
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:49.480]  It's about putting it in their face, and if they kill Trump, I'm going to wear Trump's
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:53.960]  shirts even more, oh look, your leader got impeached, your leader got killed.
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:57.960]  Let me tell you something, there's a good chance they're going to blow his head off.
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:00.880]  They're going for broke, I told you months ago they're going to build this Russian thing
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:06.400]  more and more, if Trump gives into the fear, starts going, when it's not true, it's over.
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:12.720]  Trump didn't do that, but his own underlings are thinking if they act nice, everything
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:13.720]  will be okay.
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:18.960]  No, everyone that signed on to Trump is now committed, that's why I'm so committed, and
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:23.960]  you see every enemy, every scumbag, every globalist, every piece of filth out there,
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:30.400]  every dumbass on the street, every loser who buys into every new scam against Trump, it's
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:37.240]  a test, because if we reject Trump, and we reject Lepin, and we reject all the nationalist
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:42.160]  movements happening, you see what the globalists mean, five million jihadis flooding Europe,
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:47.000]  hundreds of thousands here, open borders, disease allowed to come in, unfettered, burrowing
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:52.040]  in, attacking the family, saying you can't say mother or father, it's a total cult of
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:56.600]  control freaks that are out to dominate alpha females and alpha males.
[1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:01.720]  It's a culture based on dehumanization by sick, fallen, twisted people that want to
[1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:11.960]  dominate the species in some act of vandalism, it's Satanism, and for all Trump's problems,
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:16.400]  there's really aren't many, but everybody's a sinner, he's not out to get you, he wants
[1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:23.160]  prosperity, and if we reject this, then we're gonna come out of it, but it's gonna be a
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:29.560]  much harder road, this is like a chance to go a detour around the really bad stuff, and
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:34.680]  we're at the detour right now, better make that turn, better make that right turn, because
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:42.200]  let me tell you, we go down into what's right in front of us, only the most wild eyed crazed
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.280]  of us are ready for it, because let me tell you, I'm not worried about going down that
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:49.920]  road, it's gonna be all the slugs and all the cowards and all the dumbasses that are
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:55.480]  gonna find out what happens when the venera civilization gets ripped back, and then it's
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:02.320]  the law that jungle in, and all you jellyfish that have been living artificially off our
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:07.440]  good graces and our kindness, those that took our kindness for weakness, you're gonna be
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:14.800]  devoured by your own, vengeance will not be delivered by me, vengeance will be delivered
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:21.760]  by God Almighty, and history shows it, it's a mathematical equation, so understand this,
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:28.400]  you have been warned, two hours and 15 minutes, we'll be live, infowars.com forward slash show,
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:32.920]  it's an info war, spread that link in a savage way.
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.680]  And the war has now gone right to the White House folks, and it's just amazing to think
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:45.840]  how this is all happening, it's so obvious, I mean this is civil war folks, this is literally
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:52.720]  civil war, and most people can't wrap their heads around it, and it's so hard, and Alex
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:56.720]  just filed that great report breaking it all down, the complete double standards of the
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:12:00.240]  democrats and the Russian thing, and how the deep state is trying to take down Donald
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:01.240]  Trump.
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.560]  Understand something folks, I said this at the top of the show, I'm gonna say it again
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:13.240]  because this is the true story, and if people can see through the fake news, if they can
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:18.440]  see through the virtue signaling, then they will see what they already see going on,
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:23.960]  which is the civil war, but they'll see it for what it is, see right now the mainstream
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:29.200]  media wants to paint everything that's going on as if Trump is the bad guy, Trump is the
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.280]  one that we need to keep out of power because he's the detriment to this country.
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:40.080]  When in fact, you probably already know this, it's the powers that be, it's the forces
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:44.760]  that be that are trying to keep Trump down, trying to delegitimize Trump's presidency
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:48.760]  that is the real threat to this country.
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:54.200]  But people can see the civil war now folks, it's undeniable, you can't deny it now.
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:57.480]  How are you gonna deny it, deny everything that's going on when you've got Obama and
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:00.400]  Trump basically in a civil war right now?
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:03.600]  When you've got democrats and Trump basically in a civil war right now, when you've got
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:07.560]  the march for Trump yesterday and you've got protesters running around in black with their
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:12.640]  faces covered, trying to beat up Trump supporters.
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:18.560]  This is the civil war, and you need to understand something folks, you need to empower yourselves
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:27.600]  because this is our time right now, we have Trump in office, we have the Providence, we
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:34.120]  have the power of truth, the gravity of truth, and the people that come out and protest in
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:38.600]  the streets are nothing, they can get blown over like paper in the wind.
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:43.600]  But if we're not standing up for Trump in the face of all the mainstream news, all the
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:49.320]  political establishment, the Obamas, the Pelosi's, the Schumer's, if we don't show Trump in
[1:13:49.320 --> 1:13:54.600]  full force that we have his back through this, if we don't show the American people out there
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:57.640]  who are clueless to what's going on, that we're standing up against Trump no matter
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:03.280]  what propaganda they try to throw at them, then we will be defeated.
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:07.000]  And that's why this is our battle folks, and all of these headlines, again, people can't
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.120]  deny this anymore.
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:10.120]  Who are you gonna believe?
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:15.120]  Obama denies Trump's sensational Nixon Watergate phone tap accusation, this is from the Daily
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:21.560]  Mail, and of course, again, Obama will try to play semantics, he'll say, well, if somebody
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:25.960]  was wiretapping Trump it wasn't my order, it wasn't my command, I didn't even know, because
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:31.760]  of course we know that the wiretap and the, they're spying on everybody folks, again,
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.840]  this is like a no, you know what Sherlock situation.
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:41.880]  The Sun, this is Watergate, Barack Obama denies ever ordering surveillance on any US citizen
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:45.360]  following bombshell accusations.
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:53.880]  But hold on a second, because let's recall, this is a breaking story from November of
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:59.840]  last year, lawmakers renew calls for James Clapper perjury charges.
[1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:04.200]  So just like Obama is gonna sit here now, Obama, it can't be charged for perjury unless
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:08.560]  I guess he went and made a statement in front of a court.
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:17.120]  But remember, Clapper came out and said that no members, there was no branch of government
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:21.160]  that is spying on the American people, okay?
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:28.160]  So of course that turns out to be a lie, so perhaps Clapper is guilty of perjury.
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:31.680]  So just remember folks, whenever these people come out and they say this stuff, they've
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:36.080]  been caught lying before, they're lying to you now, and every time that they've tried
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:42.720]  to smear Donald Trump, it's completely fallen through, it can't hold water.
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:46.800]  Even a former Bush Attorney General says that Trump was likely right about surveillance.
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:49.680]  They're surveilling all of us, you know this.
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:52.360]  Paul Joseph Watson will be on the other side talking about this.
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:16:06.400]  Go and Troyer, Alex Jones, so we will be right back.
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:36.240]  We'll be right back.
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.760]  Backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:43.000]  I mean, it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick, it's got a 20-year warranty,
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.960]  it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.
[1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:47.240]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:53.680]  Again, fund the info or get the game changing in nano tech tubes, it's a win-win, $200.
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:58.000]  Go check out all their different products, nipforrestore.com, it's amazing.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.920]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:04.800]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:10.840]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:17:10.840 --> 1:17:15.800]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:20.760]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:25.880]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.600]  you can to purify your air.
[1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:32.640]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:35.600]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:37.800]  The general public doesn't.
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:41.720]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:45.360]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:48.920]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[1:17:48.920 --> 1:17:52.120]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:18:20.920]  Look out why this system is so revolutionary today, then FullWarsStore.com.

[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:04.480]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:07.840]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk.
[1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:13.040]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:19.480]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and 7 total primal superfoods in a single great
[1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:20.480]  tasting formula.
[1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:25.040]  Caveman is those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:29.560]  are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:33.600]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:38.920]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:42.800]  of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:45.360]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:49.720]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.360]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:57.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself, and
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:14.120]  you're going to want to get back to that essence, and you're going to want to get back to that
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:15.120]  essence.
[1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:34.040]  So Trump gave a well received speech, and even CNN's polls were showing a huge upswing
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:35.040]  in popularity.
[1:20:35.040 --> 1:20:40.720]  It must be time to bring back the vast Russian conspiracy theory.
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:46.200]  Jeff Sessions spoke with the Russian Ambassador Sergei Kizlyak, which was part of his job
[1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:48.640]  as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
[1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:52.080]  The shock, the horror, how dare he?
[1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:58.400]  I mean it's not like Russian Ambassador Sergei Kizlyak visited the Obama White House 22 times.
[1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:04.640]  It's not like Russian Ambassador Sergei Kizlyak sat with and spoke with top Democrats at Trump's
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:06.760]  speech just a few days ago.
[1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:11.400]  But Democrat Claire McGaskill says she never met with the Russian Ambassador as a member
[1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:17.240]  of the Senate Armed Services Committee, despite back in January 2013 tweeting that she was
[1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:18.920]  off to meet the Russian Ambassador.
[1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:22.400]  And here's a picture of her meeting with the Russian Ambassador.
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:25.920]  I mean meeting with Russians is just awful.
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:27.720]  Who would do such a thing?
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:33.600]  Maybe if Jeff Sessions had just sold 20% of America's uranium to Russia like Hillary
[1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:38.160]  Clinton did in return for a $2 million Clinton Foundation pay-off.
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:44.200]  In addition to a $500,000 check for Bill Clinton giving a speech in Moscow, maybe only then
[1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:48.880]  Democrats wouldn't be complaining because they damn sure didn't complain about that.
[1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:53.160]  But Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn met with Russian Ambassador Kizlyak in December.
[1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:54.560]  Oh my god.
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:22:00.040]  Oh wait, even the New York Times says it's quote common and not improper for transition
[1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:04.800]  officials to meet with foreign officials that Sessions had to recuse himself.
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:09.640]  Just like Loretta Lynch had to recuse herself after meeting privately with Bill Clinton.
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:11.760]  Oh wait, that didn't happen.
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:13.240]  Let's cut the BS.
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:14.920]  This is about two things.
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:20.160]  One, the hysterical left is still in denial about losing the election.
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:26.640]  They're so pompous they can't entertain for a second that they lost the political argument.
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:31.840]  So they're still trapped in this neurotic hysteria that can only be satiated by maintaining
[1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:36.120]  the echo chamber of the vast Russian conspiracy theory.
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:41.960]  As Brendan O'Neill writes, the specter of Putinite meddling is now blamed for everything that
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:44.160]  doesn't go the liberal elites way.
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:47.800]  Brexit, Trump, Italy, Le Pen, Gert Wilders.
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:52.240]  It couldn't possibly be because we have the better arguments, right?
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:55.640]  No, it has to be more Russian conspiracy theory.
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:23:02.720]  This is neo-McCarthyist paranoia mixed with hysterical self-entitlement and supreme arrogance.
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:09.440]  The fact remains that despite all the whining, all the hand-ringing, all the delirium.
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:14.480]  No evidence whatsoever has been presented that Russia hacked the election.
[1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:19.760]  No evidence has ever been presented that any of Trump's team had improper meetings with
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:20.760]  Russians.
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:21.760]  Nothing.
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:22.760]  Zip.
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:23.760]  Nada.
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:28.200]  The second aspect of what this is all about, Trump's anti-globalist message and his vow
[1:23:28.200 --> 1:23:35.280]  to end unnecessary wars represents an existential threat to the deep state and the military
[1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:36.560]  industrial complex.
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:38.480]  You take on the intelligence community.
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:41.720]  They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:47.000]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  this.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:52.080]  That's why parties and intelligence agents keep leaking information.
[1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:55.800]  This is about the total sabotage of the Trump administration.
[1:23:55.800 --> 1:24:01.200]  Now the deep state has formed an alliance with the left to pick off Trump loyalists
[1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:02.720]  one by one.
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:07.280]  People like General Flynn and Jeff Sessions because they're not globalists.
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:11.600]  They really believe in Trump's America-first mandate.
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:13.720]  Look at who replaced Flynn.
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:18.720]  General McMaster, a CFR member and a member of other globalist bodies.
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:22.200]  Look at who dominates Trump's foreign policy team.
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:25.320]  Half of them are counsel on foreign relations members.
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:26.880]  Fiona Hill, CFR.
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:28.600]  Katie McFarlane, CFR.
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:30.360]  Carter Page, CFR.
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:32.000]  Joel Rayburn, CFR.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:33.720]  Kenneth Juster, CFR.
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:35.400]  Christopher Ford, CFR.
[1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:37.000]  Yale Lampard, CFR.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.960]  I could go on and on.
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:41.880]  The CFR is the deep state.
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:45.320]  That's the globalist fifth column within the administration.
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:52.360]  They're trying to force out loyalists so they can isolate Trump and surround him with globalists.
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:54.480]  So he's totally ineffectual.
[1:24:54.480 --> 1:25:00.040]  Kushner and Bannon will be targeted next before they try to topple Trump himself.
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:05.400]  They're so desperate to sabotage Trump they're even trying to get the author of the fake
[1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:09.600]  news piss gate dossier to testify before the Senate.
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:14.200]  Barack Obama has also set up a nerve center two miles from the White House.
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:18.800]  According to reports, his goal is to oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing
[1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:21.360]  his resignation or through impeachment.
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:28.280]  This is a concerted effort across the board to delegitimize sabotage and eventually overthrow
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:29.640]  the Trump administration.
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:31.200]  How can Trump counter this?
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:37.280]  Well, for one, his administration can stop caving and apologizing to deep state bullies
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:39.680]  and contrived leftist hysteria.
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:46.360]  Stop treating sell out Republicans and rhinos like John McCain and Marco Rubio with any respect.
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:47.600]  They don't deserve it.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:52.600]  The establishment GOP only knows about apologizing and losing.
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:54.440]  They have no power.
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:26:01.640]  And stop even acknowledging contrived controversies whipped up by the biased fake news media.
[1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:05.160]  They're widely hated and their credibility is in the toilet.
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:10.960]  Polls show that more Americans trust Trump and above all, purge your administration of
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:12.960]  this globalist fifth column.
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:15.560]  There can be no compromise.
[1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:20.800]  These people literally want to overthrow a democratically elected government.
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:23.080]  They don't have the moral high ground.
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:26.160]  You have the moral high ground.
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:35.160]  You are on the right side of history.
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:37.680]  And that's the bottom line, folks.
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:38.680]  That's the bottom line.
[1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:45.280]  All of this is showing the seriousness of Trump and the desperation of the globalists.
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.600]  See, they've never had anybody like Trump who's gotten in power, who's an actual stalwart
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:53.440]  to their globalist agenda.
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:58.480]  Not only Trump is a stalwart, he's an absolute champion for America, an absolute champion
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:07.720]  for nationalism, and an absolute champion for the return of just realism, non-PC, shoot
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:11.840]  you straight, tell it like it is, nationalism.
[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:15.400]  And again, this is the most important point to this, folks.
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:17.240]  And this is what everybody needs to realize.
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:21.600]  You need to let this sink in, and you need to have this sink in to all of your friends
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:25.560]  and family out there who are never Trumpers.
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:32.880]  The only end to this movement against Trump is total overthrow.
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:41.800]  The only end to this movement against Trump is the repudiation of our democratic process
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:43.000]  by the establishment.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:54.680]  The only end is the complete, complete just removal of our republic.
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:57.480]  So understand that.
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.440]  That's why this is a civil war, folks.
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:05.120]  If they can get rid of Donald Trump, they can do anything.
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:06.600]  They already tried to rig a vote.
[1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:08.080]  That's how pathetic these people are.
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:13.480]  They can't even win a rigged election, folks.
[1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:17.320]  So by the grace of God, they're so pathetic they can't win a rigged election.
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:24.440]  We get Donald Trump in, and now in a plea of desperation, they keep saying, look at
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:28.520]  this guy, he meets with Russia, session met with Russia, Flynn met with Russia, oh.
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:33.200]  But then they all meet with Russia, oh, oh, we never wiretapped anyone in the Trump administration.
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:35.280]  Oh, well, then where did you get those Flynn leaks?
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:38.280]  You see this, folks?
[1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:43.800]  Oh, yeah, nobody's spying on Donald Trump, meanwhile, the NSA spies on everybody.
[1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:44.800]  You know that.
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:46.840]  How are you going to buy these lies?
[1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:48.160]  We're going to have more on the other side.
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.040]  Owen Shroyer filling in for Alex Jones.

[1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:59.040]  Check it out for yourself today.
[1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:04.000]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:07.360]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk.
[1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:10.480]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslives.com.
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:15.800]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:20.360]  and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:21.360]  Caveman.
[1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:25.080]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:29.080]  superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:31.760]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:36.920]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[1:30:36.920 --> 1:30:41.240]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:44.880]  the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:49.200]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[1:30:49.200 --> 1:30:52.840]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:56.200]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[1:30:56.200 --> 1:30:58.560]  at infowarslives.com today.
[1:30:58.560 --> 1:31:03.080]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit infowarslives.com

[1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:08.560]  at infowarslives.com.
[1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:13.080]  As you know we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists
[1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:19.080]  and the answer is clear, iodine is key, is paramount and there's still so much new information
[1:31:19.080 --> 1:31:22.160]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:27.960]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple
[1:31:27.960 --> 1:31:31.080]  blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine.
[1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:35.000]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.920]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[1:31:37.920 --> 1:31:41.960]  Quite frankly I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine
[1:31:41.960 --> 1:31:46.480]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:50.760]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[1:31:50.760 --> 1:31:58.680]  It is exclusive to infowarslives.com and the info wars life family of incredible products.

[1:32:39.920 --> 1:32:40.920]  important.
[1:32:40.920 --> 1:32:45.960]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[1:32:45.960 --> 1:32:47.640]  quality lab standard.

[1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:53.040]  of the spear in the info war.

[1:33:01.920 --> 1:33:20.760]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:30.560]  You are listening to an infowars.com front line report, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:34.920]  Oh and Shroy are filling in for Alex Jones here on a Sunday, we've got two more segments
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:35.920]  left.
[1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:40.400]  You know they keep saying there's no spying on Donald Trump, this is ludicrous even though
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:45.400]  we have the orders for the wiretap so we know they were doing it even though we know the
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:50.560]  NSA is spying on all of us via whistleblowers and the Patriot Act so we know all of this
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:53.720]  is going on but they're still going to say, it's just like the same thing, oh he's meeting
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:56.240]  with Russians, oh my gosh, what will we do?
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:59.760]  And then you show the people that are sitting there bitching and crying about sessions or
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:04.000]  Flynn or Trump meeting with Russians and they're meeting with Russians all day long.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.080]  And then you've got this video, no one's spying on Trump, look at these reporters totally
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:15.000]  spying on him, videotaping into the White House, I'm not even sitting here mad like
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:21.320]  this is going on honestly, it's just that it's so hypocritical, it's such a double standard
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:28.120]  and it just shows you how arrogant and out of touch with reality these people are, oh
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:31.800]  no one's spying on Trump as they're spying on everybody spying into the White House,
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:36.840]  oh Trump is a Russian agent, look his cabinet's meeting with Russians as they're all meeting
[1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:39.360]  with Russians.
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:41.240]  This is the lunacy.
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:45.920]  Now just real quick, I want to play this clip of Claire McCaskill, a lot of people don't
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:50.000]  probably know who Claire McCaskill is, she's from my home state of Missouri, she's one
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:53.920]  of these never Trumpers, she's on Capitol Hill crying all the time about Trump and his
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:58.520]  agenda, just so you know who Claire McCaskill really is, let me just give you this little
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:34:59.520]  clip.
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:02.360]  Hello, I'm Senator Claire McCaskill.
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:07.640]  As one of just 20 women currently living in this state, it's important to me to encourage
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:11.920]  more women to run for office, but even if they're Hillary Clinton, it's encouraging
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:15.320]  more men to sometimes just shut the hell up.
[1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:16.320]  Oh like me?
[1:35:16.320 --> 1:35:20.800]  It's not that women don't value your thoughts, it's just that we don't value all of them.
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:24.040]  Oh okay, well that's nice, how about this Claire McCaskill?
[1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:28.000]  I don't value you, period, okay, so there you go.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:34.480]  So there's Claire McCaskill for you, if you're a man, you need to just shut the hell up.
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:38.320]  That's such a loving little Senator, I'll tell you what Claire, I'm not going to shut
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:43.200]  the hell up, in fact you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to ask the giant mass audience

[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:49.920]  Trump Pence 2020 shirt.

[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:11.560]  us down and the louder you are, the more vocal you are, the more visual you are in the three-dimensional

[1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:20.480]  The dumber these politicians are going to look, the more failure the never Trumpers
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:22.960]  are going to endure.

[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:53.160]  And yesterday, the March for Trump was in Austin, Texas.
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:58.200]  I was out there with a couple of cameramen, Millie Weaver and Ashley Beckford.
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:05.200]  And for the most part in Austin, it was a great March folks and it was pouring rain
[1:38:05.200 --> 1:38:06.680]  the entire day, okay?
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:11.160]  It was absolutely miserable with the rain and we still got about a thousand people,
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:16.920]  if not more, I would say to come out for this March, totally peaceful people, the most loving
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:18.040]  people I've ever met in my life.
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:23.720]  I remember I was talking to, I think he maybe was of Asian descent, I don't know, a college
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:30.320]  student and he was an LBGT student for Trump and he was standing out there and we were
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:34.440]  talking to him and he's like, they keep saying that Trump hates gay people.
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:40.080]  They keep saying that Trump hates minorities but I'm out here as a gay minority and I'm
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:42.240]  getting nothing but love.
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:45.600]  I was talking to Latinos, they said the exact same thing.
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:48.640]  You can see some of the B-roll that we were just showing if you're a TV viewer from that
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:49.640]  March.
[1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:52.680]  The coolest part about it actually, this is the best footage, you can see how it's just
[1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:54.200]  pouring on us.
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:59.000]  We marched through the heart of downtown Austin, thousands of Trump supporters, all with their
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.240]  Trump flags and their American flags, you've never seen a more patriotic event folks, just
[1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:05.800]  flags everywhere, red, white and blue everywhere.
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:10.760]  And we went right through the heart of liberal Austin.
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:15.920]  And I actually saw a lot of the people who were at the bars and at the restaurants there
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:19.160]  looking at us and they were kind of shocked, they were like, whoa, this is actually kind
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:20.160]  of cool.
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:23.600]  Look at all those patriots, look at all those flags, these people are out here in the streets
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:25.080]  marching in unity, wow.
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:30.280]  Of course, the mainstream news pretty much ignored all of that, didn't they?
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:31.280]  Yeah.
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:36.080]  But what they never cease to ignore is the Trump protesters who decided to rear their
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:37.080]  ugly heads again.
[1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:41.080]  Of course, we had Antifa who was out here in Austin, about 12 of them decided to show
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:42.080]  up.
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:48.320]  You know, there was a veteran who was speaking and she was delivering an absolutely powerful
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:49.320]  speech.
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:53.560]  Honestly, it would bring chills to your spine.
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:57.600]  And she was delivering such a powerful speech that these protesters decided they were gonna
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:02.480]  start chanting obscenities, screaming foul language, doing foul gestures to try to disrupt
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:03.480]  her speech.
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:06.920]  And it was really sad that they did that.
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:10.120]  And of course, you know, this woman just happened to be black, you know, so who's the
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:14.240]  real racist here as a bunch of white Antifa protesters are out here protesting.
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:18.680]  Here's a video for TV viewers if you're watching this, this woman comes out of the bar.
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:20.760]  This was unbelievable, I couldn't believe it.
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:25.320]  Comes out of the bar and starts throwing food at people.
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:27.680]  What is wrong with you?
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:31.360]  Hey, you know, there's people starving that would enjoy that food and you just decided
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:33.840]  to throw it at fellow Americans.
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:36.080]  And then she did the Sarah Silverman butt plug thing.
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:39.480]  I'm not exaggerating folks, see, there it is right there.
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:42.480]  There's your Sarah Silverman influence.
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:45.080]  And then she tries to assault Millie Weaver as well.
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:46.080]  Yeah.
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:49.600]  So these are some of the most ugly, pathetic people that never Trumpers.
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:50.720]  And they were out everywhere.
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:53.000]  And what is the media cover, folks?
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:54.240]  What is the media cover?
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:56.320]  All they cover is the Trump protesters.
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:01.920]  Now it's reached a point, especially with this march where they can't show any peaceful
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:04.040]  protesters against Trump folks.
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:06.040]  There were none with the march for Trump.
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:08.040]  All they do is show up dressed in black.
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:10.840]  They cover their face with their masks.
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:12.960]  And then they show up and they try to start trouble.
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:14.840]  They throw things at people.
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:19.680]  They try to, you know, there's the stuff from California, this is of course at Berkeley.
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:26.360]  There's Robert Riesch, Robert Riesch out in Berkeley.
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:27.360]  Yeah.
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:28.960]  You think Robert Riesch is proud of this?
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:30.200]  Oh, but you know what?
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:32.040]  In fact, do we have this clip?
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:34.000]  Yeah, let's roll this clip.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:38.840]  So you've got the peaceful Trump march going on, some of the most amazing people you can
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:39.840]  ever meet, folks.
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:44.080]  Honestly, honestly, I just want to say it's been so amazing.
[1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:48.320]  You fund this broadcast, Alex Jones sends me on the road, and I seriously meet the most
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:50.520]  unbelievable people at these Trump rallies, honestly.
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:53.040]  I love all of you guys, you are so amazing.
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:56.640]  So we've got the amazing Trump supporters out, the Patriots marching in the streets for Trump
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:41:59.480]  in unity and peace, trying to bring this country together.
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:03.000]  And then you get the hateful Trump protesters coming out trying to disrupt it.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:09.840]  And then you get Loretta Lynch coming out and saying this, go ahead to that Loretta
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:10.840]  Lynch clip, guys.
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:13.800]  Do you have that ready?
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:18.760]  People that Loretta Lynch, in the face of the violent Trump protest, would come out
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:21.400]  and make a statement saying more marching is needed.
[1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:24.480]  Of course, you've got the same thing with Robert Riesch and Berkeley.
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:27.880]  You guys have Loretta Lynch ready to go here?
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:32.560]  So let's take Loretta Lynch to break in the face of violent marches.
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:33.560]  This is what she says.
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:37.400]  I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people.
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:41.600]  I know it's a time of concern for you, your criminal.
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:43.200]  It's an uncertain time for you.
[1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:45.440]  You're going to jail.
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:46.880]  I know that this is difficult.
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:47.880]  You've met illegally.
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:50.080]  This has never been easy.
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:51.080]  We have all.
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:52.080]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:53.080]  You've never had America stand up to you.
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:56.080]  If we were to achieve the great ideals of our family.
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:42:57.080]  You're done.
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:42:58.080]  You're done.
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:42:59.080]  Call for more marches.
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:00.080]  You're done.
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:01.080]  To America.
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:02.080]  They lost.
[1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:03.080]  We won.
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:05.680]  We want to see what Trump's up against.
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:06.680]  Revelation.
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:07.680]  The movie.info.
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:12.680]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:18.680]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:25.440]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[1:43:25.440 --> 1:43:31.680]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:34.200]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:35.680]  We're the solution.
[1:43:35.680 --> 1:43:38.200]  Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:44.440]  Darren Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:45.440]  on demand.
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:46.440]  DVD's now available.
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:51.080]  We want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue.
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:53.200]  Americans need to see this film.
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:54.200]  Revelation.
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:56.200]  The movie.info.
[1:43:56.200 --> 1:43:57.200]  Let's fix it.
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:43:58.200]  Hey, everyone.
[1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:02.200]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:04.480]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:08.400]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare,
[1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:13.760]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer,
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:16.840]  heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:20.120]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:23.240]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:26.080]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your

[1:44:53.400 --> 1:45:01.720]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:03.440]  Why is this so good?
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:08.040]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:12.760]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:18.440]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:23.640]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:25.520]  spreading disease around.
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:28.160]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:29.160]  These are all parasites.
[1:45:29.160 --> 1:45:31.840]  Tell us about all the stuff I said, there's so many things that are in it.
[1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:36.200]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:39.520]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:42.640]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:46.640]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarsteam.com, and folks, you can't lose
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:51.200]  it, it's full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast

[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:22.920]  He never gives up.
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:29.720]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:41.240]  I think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of
[1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:44.200]  the Attorney of the Justice Department through the FISA court.
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:45.320]  And what do you base that on?
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:49.880]  I base that on news reports that you mentioned in the last spot.
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:56.240]  I also base it on a kind of inadvertent blurting out by Adam Schiff that his committee wants
[1:47:56.240 --> 1:48:00.440]  to talk to the counterintelligence agents at the FBI who were involved in this.
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:04.360]  Now, what that means is that this is part not of a criminal investigation, but of an
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:07.360]  intelligence-gathering investigation.
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:08.360]  It's got two functions.
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:11.240]  They investigate crimes, and they gather intelligence.
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:16.200]  They started gathering intelligence in 08 based on guidelines that we put in place.
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:21.360]  They tried to get a wiretap based on their criminal investigation function in June.
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  That was turned down.
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:30.320]  They then tried to get, and got, an order, permitted them to conduct electronic surveillance
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:31.320]  in October.
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:33.720]  This is October of 2016.
[1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:36.120]  So that's when, apparently, that's when the...
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:37.480]  Oh, I'm sure Obama didn't know.
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:38.880]  On news reports, as well.
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:40.680]  And on Adam Schiff.
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:42.800]  And it's obvious.
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:43.800]  Let me start with the president.
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:44.800]  Here's Clapper.
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:47.360]  It's a known liar.
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:51.480]  This idea that maybe President Obama ordered an illegal wiretap of his offices.
[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:55.760]  So after something like this, here's Clapper.
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:57.960]  I would certainly hope so.
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:48:58.960]  I can't say...
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:48:59.960]  Obviously, I'm not...
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:04.520]  I can't speak officially anymore, but I would say that for the part of the National
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:11.520]  Security Apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:15.720]  against the president, the president-elect, at the time, or as a candidate...
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:16.720]  Oh, so you're just clueless.
[1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:18.080] ...for the campaign.
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:23.680]  I can't speak for other Title III authorized entities in the room.
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:24.680]  Okay, so that's enough of Clapper.
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:28.920]  So Clapper is just up here then admitting he's completely clueless, I suppose.
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:30.200]  There was no wiretapping.
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:31.640]  I've never heard of wiretapping.
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:33.640]  In fact, that doesn't even go on.
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:36.320]  How do we don't get any intelligence through wiretapping?
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:40.240]  I don't know how they got the Flynn leaks or anything like that, but oh, we don't wiretap
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:41.240]  anyone.
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:43.720]  And it's on record.
[1:49:43.720 --> 1:49:49.840]  So what is Obama and Clapper doing if they don't even know that this is going on?
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:51.520]  Who's running this wiretapping?
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:53.920]  Obama, he has no clue.
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:56.080]  James Clapper, he's denying it.
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:03.720]  But of course, remember, folks, this is James Clapper, who everyone was expecting to resign
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:11.600]  because he's guilty of perjury when he said that no, the National Security Agency does
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:15.560]  not collect any type of data at all on Americans.
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:18.000]  So he just openly lied about that.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.320]  We know that that's going on.
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:21.760]  Look at the Patriot Act.
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:25.980]  Look at the NDNA AA signed by Obama.
[1:50:25.980 --> 1:50:26.980]  Look at Snowden.
[1:50:26.980 --> 1:50:28.080]  Look at the WikiLeaks.
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:29.080]  Look at everything.
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:30.240]  We know this is going on.
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:31.800]  They're spying on everybody.
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:45.000]  Oh my God, folks, who lives in the current year and is so naive to think that with everything
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:48.080]  going on, they're not going to be spying on Donald Trump?
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:49.880]  Are you kidding me?
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:51.920]  Are you that brainwash?
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:53.320]  You really don't think this is going on?
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:55.520]  Of course this is going on.
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:02.160]  So just remember, even though we know for a fact that they were spying on Trump, James
[1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:07.360]  Clapper says he's going to deny it, just like he denies that the NSA exists pretty
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:08.360]  much.
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:12.440]  I mean, so just know who to trust and who not to trust.
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:15.360]  And James Clapper is one that you certainly do not trust.
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:20.680]  Now I wanted to bring these stories to the light before we signed off to date because
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:26.520]  this is serious stuff and this should be a bipartisan or a nonpartisan issue talking
[1:51:26.520 --> 1:51:31.280]  about immigration reform and having a strong border because they want to pretend that when
[1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:36.120]  Donald Trump does a speech or says anything about illegal immigrants coming here and committing
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:40.000]  acts of violence, they want to sit here and act like it doesn't exist or that Trump is
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:41.560]  racist or that it's all okay.
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:43.520]  It's all being blown out of proportion.
[1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:45.360]  Well, no, folks.
[1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:48.760]  In fact, look at this sad story.
[1:51:48.760 --> 1:51:49.760]  This is from Breitbart.
[1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:53.080]  Honestly, I don't even know how you report on this.
[1:51:53.080 --> 1:52:01.480]  Texas girl raped one killed by illegal alien Satanists.
[1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:07.760]  So two MS-13 gang members over a period of several weeks are here illegally in the United
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:16.320]  States kidnapped and raped at least two young girls and of course murdered another one of
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:22.080]  them and when they're in court, they're bragging, they're smiling, they're waving to the cameras.
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:24.080]  This is a big joke to them.
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:32.240]  They are people that kidnap and murder girls in an act of Satanism, folks.
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:40.000]  These are illegal immigrants, gang members in this country, raping and murdering women
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  and children.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.520]  I mean, I'm sorry that I get so fired up about this.
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:48.520]  I'm sorry that I get ticked off when Loretta Lynch is up here telling people to protest
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:52.680]  in the street when I got people violently rioting and looting.
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:57.200]  And then I got criminal crooked Loretta Lynch here meeting on airplanes illegally telling
[1:52:57.200 --> 1:53:00.520]  you to keep protesting against Trump.
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:03.200]  And then they'll tell you that Trump is a racist while you've got illegal gang members
[1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:07.760]  coming here worshiping Satan, raping and murdering women and children.
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:08.760]  That is disgusting.
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:12.880]  How can they even be on this side of reality?
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:19.760]  Excuse me, how dare Donald Trump on a border to protect us from illegal Satanist, raping
[1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:21.040]  and murdering children?
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:23.800]  How dare he?
[1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:27.560]  We got Alex Jones with us right now.
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:28.560]  Let's go to Alex Jones.
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:34.480]  Well, I want to say a great job, you know, my plan has been to get a good stable of folks
[1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:39.040]  that are smart, patriotic, know what's going on, like David Knight and yourself to obviously
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:40.800]  launch more shows in the near future.
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:43.360]  We're getting very, very ready to go to the next level folks.
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:47.320]  That's what the enemy is attacking us, but ladies and gentlemen, they bragged that they
[1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:48.640]  were spying on him.
[1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:55.960]  They bragged right after he was elected and they, the head of the House Intelligence Committee,
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:54:00.280]  Nunes, who has the highest levels, pretty clear as you know, the highest of presidents
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:02.520]  came out and said, we looked at it.
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:03.720]  There's not even phone calls.
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:04.720]  There's nothing.
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:09.640]  There's nothing pre-November 8th, of course, Trump's not involved with the risk.
[1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:12.320]  He doesn't even know how to deal with our government.
[1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:15.400]  And the point is, is that they think everybody's down, they're doing all this because they're
[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:17.400]  desperate and their shows are not going to quit.
[1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:21.680]  How would they commit these nicks to them beyond crimes, then try to blame Trump with
[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:24.800]  it, and then they're the ones all getting in trouble.
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:25.800]  Trump is all about business.
[1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:26.800]  He knows to follow the rules.
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:28.840]  He knows that's how you get ahead.
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:29.840]  That's how you're long term.
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:34.200]  These are all a bunch of crooks who have chips on their shoulders, you know, communists,
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:35.200]  you know.
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:40.640]  Counting on the ignorance of the American people, I mean, it's just Chicago Commies
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:45.360]  and dirtbags and weirdos, who even when they got control of the country, wanted to burn
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:46.360]  it up even though it was theirs.
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:50.680]  I mean, they're just uncool people, and they're a bunch of crooks, and the age of Trump and
[1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:54.680]  the age of nationalism is here, but you're just on fire, so I'm really proud of the work
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:55.680]  you and the whole crew are doing.
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:58.680]  I want to thank all the listeners for their prayers and support because folks, there's
[1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:01.480]  a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, and I'm not liberty to tell you about quite
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:02.880]  yet, but let me just tell you something.
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:05.160]  You are living in total history.
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:06.160]  Everybody knows it.
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:07.160]  It feels like it's surreal.
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:10.080]  This is such an incredible time, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:11.080]  You are the resistance.
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:13.880]  When I say that, it is a patronizing a thousand times.
[1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:15.080]  You literally are it.
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:19.160]  You're the power, your prayers, your action, you're calling in to ceaseband, calling in
[1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:24.120]  here, talking to people at church, getting involved, running for office, going and speaking
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:27.440]  to city council, whatever you do, let them know we're the majority.
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:28.440]  Let them know.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  This is a fight for America.
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:32.600]  This wouldn't be happening if Trump wasn't real folks, but I don't just trust that.
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:38.560]  I go to what he's doing, it is unbelievably just, unbelievably good, unbelievably common
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:43.760]  sense, unbelievably good for Main Street, and it's just so good to see somebody stand up
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:47.280]  like a champion for us who's not a piece of crap that wants to sell people out and then
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:52.240]  to see him attacked by all these demons and people who we all know are horrible scum and
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:56.200]  to claim he's a Russian when they're the ones literally sold out the time to China.
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:58.920]  Russia was like China, I'd say they were bad.
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:02.960]  Russia can barely get attacked together, Russia kicked the oligarchs out though, and that's
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:04.280]  better than we've done so far.
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:07.920]  So Russia is better than America because it kicked the New World Order out, but only on
[1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:08.920]  that front.
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:12.200]  If we get the New World Order out, these people have nowhere to run, and I want to link up
[1:56:12.200 --> 1:56:17.600]  with Russia and Japan and the UK and other people and help the Euro be imploded because
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:21.040]  it's tyrannical and help restore human liberty and freedom.
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:25.240]  We can have a global council of nations that come together where everything's transparent,
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:29.040]  where big corporations aren't making deals, these people stole the country.
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:32.600]  They're a bunch of con men who know they're gonna get in trouble, and they believe they're
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:36.240]  so arrogant that they all get together in groups and decide to commit crimes are gonna
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:37.240]  get away with it.
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:39.720]  Listen, you idiots, you kill Trump, we win.
[1:56:39.720 --> 1:56:41.040]  You get out of his way, we win.
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:46.560]  Okay, the only way we can't defeat you is you were smart enough to join him and then try
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:50.240]  to manipulate things, but you're not even that smart, you're scumbags that inherited
[1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:52.160]  what people built before you.
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:56.400]  So I'm gonna let you take things back over here, but suppose if everybody just gets the
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:57:05.840]  T-shirt for $9.95, this says Trump 2020, America versus 7076 on the back and forwards.com,
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:07.200]  it will change the world.
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:11.240]  You have to have that in physical on the ground to counter all their censorship, all the rest
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:12.240]  of it.
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:15.440]  If everybody starts wearing those out everywhere, it'll be a chain reaction, everybody else
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:17.760]  is gonna copy them, which is what I want, okay?
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:21.240]  I just need them to be out there on the news, we're gonna have more contests, but I don't
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:26.920]  have the money, just get on the news peacefully with the Trump tense 2020, get that out there,
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:29.920]  it's a war, folks, we need you, you are the answer.
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:32.440]  And God bless the inforters and all the things they've done, we don't ever have the time
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:33.440]  to thank them properly.
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:36.800]  But I'm just telling you, you know who you are, of every race, color, and creed, we're
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:41.240]  all human beings, I love you and Trump loves you and we want to have a future, we want prosperity
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:45.120]  together, we're not perfect, but we're not out to get you, okay, and we're just here
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:52.120]  fighting as hard as we can, and look how far inforters have come.
