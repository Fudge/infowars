[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  A few things are more bizarre and sinister than the regressive left and the establishment
[00:05.360 --> 00:10.640]  media's attempt to rebrand the Islamic veil as an emblem of feminism.
[00:10.640 --> 00:16.240]  It's literally a symbol of the most violent anti-woman patriarchal belief system on the
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.240]  planet.
[00:17.240 --> 00:18.240]  And now this.
[00:18.240 --> 00:22.000]  Rap, my hijab, rap, rap, my hijab, keep playing my hijab.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.640]  A hip-hop song to teach the kids how cool and empowering it is to wear the hijab.
[00:26.640 --> 00:32.440]  All around the world, love, women every shade and head, be so liberated.
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.800]  So liberated, she's Syrian.
[00:34.800 --> 00:38.280]  You know the only parts of Syria where it's mandatory to wear a veil?
[00:38.280 --> 00:40.880]  Oh yeah, that'll be the ones controlled by ISIS.
[00:40.880 --> 00:44.560]  They literally stone women to death for not wearing a hijab.
[00:44.560 --> 00:45.560]  So liberated.
[00:45.560 --> 00:50.480]  Yeah, I'm sure all those Syrian women living under ISIS occupation who used to be able
[00:50.480 --> 00:54.080]  to wear whatever they want really feel so liberated now.
[00:54.080 --> 00:59.480]  In fact, they're so liberated wearing the veil that the first thing they do when ISIS
[00:59.480 --> 01:04.600]  has kicked out of the area is to burn the f***ing veil.
[01:04.600 --> 01:17.520]  It's real liberation.
[01:17.520 --> 01:26.600]  Yeah, wearing the hijab is so feminist that the very first Muslim Arab feminist group,
[01:26.600 --> 01:32.280]  the Egyptian feminist union, nearly a hundred years ago, encouraged Muslim women to discard
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.120]  their veils. Removing the veil symbolized the entire objective of their campaign that
[01:38.120 --> 01:43.600]  gave women access to university education for the first time. That's real feminism,
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.440]  that's standing up for real women's rights. They are the Sharia police and it's not vandals
[01:48.440 --> 01:54.320]  or thieves thereafter. Women exposing their hair is only one of the controversial crimes
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.000]  considered to be against local Sharia law. Real feminists in countries like Iran face
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.480]  police, persecution and prison for protesting against Iran's mandatory headscarf law by
[02:04.480 --> 02:10.480]  taking photos of themselves without a veil. That's real feminism, that's standing up for
[02:10.480 --> 02:16.440]  real women's rights. That's true resistance to actual misogyny, whereas this represents
[02:16.440 --> 02:18.560]  total submission to it.
[02:18.560 --> 02:25.320]  Yeah, I'm so jealous of not being subject to an arcane 7th century belief system under
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.920]  which women are herded around like farmyard animals. So jealous, I'm so jealous of something
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.440]  that according to Asra Nomanie, founder of the Muslim reform movement, covers, segregates,
[02:37.440 --> 02:43.760]  subordinates, silences, jails and kills women and girls around the world. According to Bussell,
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.320]  the rap song shatters the typical western narrative of the oppressed hijab wearer. Yeah,
[02:48.320 --> 02:52.960]  oppressed hijab wearers don't get to make rap videos about it, Bussell. They don't get
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.720]  record deals, they don't get to take advantage of huge media platforms. They get acid attacked,
[02:58.720 --> 03:03.560]  beaten and killed. In India, a father killed his 4 year old daughter, smashing her head
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.280]  against the floor when her hijab slipped from her head during dinner. In Ontario, a man
[03:08.280 --> 03:14.760]  strangled his 16 year old sister when she defied their father by refusing to wear a hijab.
[03:14.760 --> 03:20.160]  In Iran, vigilantes roam the streets, throwing acid in the faces of women whose veils are
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.880]  deemed to be too loose. Last year, a former University of Missouri instructor dragged
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.840]  a female relative aged 14 out of school by the hair when he discovered she hadn't worn
[03:30.840 --> 03:35.680]  a veil. Muslim women in London are threatened with death if they're caught not wearing
[03:35.680 --> 03:42.280]  a hijab. None of that is hip or cool. No amount of virtue signalling or stupid rap
[03:42.280 --> 03:47.920]  songs will change the reality that the hijab has caused untold misery and suffering for
[03:47.920 --> 03:53.840]  countless young women and girls across the world for centuries. Another dumb rap video
[03:53.840 --> 04:00.000]  with the exact same message was released in the same month. It also got over a million
[04:00.000 --> 04:09.480]  views. Now CNN's promoting Hijabi, helping the veiled Barbie to become an Instagram star.
[04:09.480 --> 04:15.880]  It's so cool, so trendy. But hey, at least it won't be necessary to produce a line of
[04:15.880 --> 04:21.400]  female genital mutilation Barbies, given that they have no genitals to begin with. Three
[04:21.400 --> 04:27.560]  moms in Pittsburgh are creating Hello Hijab Barbie compatible Islamic headscarves to encourage
[04:27.560 --> 04:33.440]  inclusivity and fight racism. Maybe the moms can repackage Barbie dolls to include miniature
[04:33.440 --> 04:39.360]  stones so the children can practice executing female rape victims. You know, to get that
[04:39.360 --> 04:45.400]  authentic feel because Islam is so progressive. I need that paper, paper, paper, if you want
[04:45.400 --> 04:50.680]  education. Yeah, the only person who needs educating is you. Educating on why you're
[04:50.680 --> 04:58.080]  normalizing and popularizing the very embodiment of violence and oppression against women and
[04:58.080 --> 05:03.360]  young girls across the Islamic world. Good job, Paul. Over the weekend, President Donald
[05:03.360 --> 05:07.320]  Trump has called on God to bless and empower our country and our people and reaffirmed
[05:07.320 --> 05:13.320]  our faith in America. We don't worship government. We worship God. And it's why we proudly proclaim
[05:13.320 --> 05:19.400]  that we are one nation under God. Every time we say the pledge of allegiance, which God
[05:19.400 --> 05:25.480]  exactly has invoked, wasn't the God of Hillary Clinton rich people. God bless us or wasn't
[05:25.480 --> 05:29.400]  the God of Barack Hussein Obama. God bless you and may God bless the United States of
[05:29.400 --> 05:34.280]  America. No, President Trump has called on the one true God of the universe whose name
[05:34.280 --> 05:39.320]  is above every name champions for Christ. He testified to the greatest pieces of literature
[05:39.320 --> 05:43.880]  in the history of mankind because of the power contained within the words of this book. You
[05:43.880 --> 05:49.880]  are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope and love. Even the most remote
[05:49.880 --> 05:54.800]  areas of India, especially Africa, have heard of him. Jesus Christ has been preached in
[05:54.800 --> 06:00.480]  and is believed on in all nations of the world. Our God is not like their God. This has been
[06:00.480 --> 06:06.120]  Daria for Infowars.com. Today we call it bone broth. And for thousands of years, our ancestors
[06:06.120 --> 06:10.760]  enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets, a processed junk. We

[06:31.480 --> 06:35.920]  them. Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You use the meat for
[06:35.920 --> 06:41.560]  sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure
[06:41.560 --> 06:45.760]  full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[06:45.760 --> 06:51.240]  This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were,

[08:49.120 --> 08:54.400]  was officially getting in our reporters faces saying we were racist and were fake news and
[08:54.400 --> 08:58.160]  all the rest of it. So Mellie Weaver is going to be in here at the bottom of the hour with
[08:58.160 --> 09:04.400]  some of the footage that will be premiering here. This this all happened. I guess yesterday
[09:04.400 --> 09:08.880]  I guess Sunday Sunday in the afternoon. This is happening all over the country and there
[09:08.880 --> 09:17.040]  are stories everywhere. Attaching myself you name it every day saying Jones is fake news.
[09:17.040 --> 09:23.000]  Muslims never raped anybody or Muslims never killed anybody or Muslims never stabbed anybody
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.600]  or bombed or shot anybody. So I've told all our great editors and crew video editors to
[09:30.600 --> 09:37.600]  go through really news producers and just get the lowlights that the other the dozen
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.920]  or so truck attacks killing people in the last few years in Europe and then showing
[09:41.920 --> 09:47.080]  ISIS saying get bigger trucks kill more people the stabbings the rapes the murders the fences
[09:47.080 --> 09:55.720]  being torn down the TB levels exploding Journal of Medicine CDC European Union Commission
[09:55.720 --> 10:04.240]  all of we're just going to show the documents and the videos because every day I see 20 30
[10:04.240 --> 10:12.000]  articles about Muslims beating people up in subways raping people just totally entitled
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.680]  doing whatever they want so much footage that I can't even watch it or keep track of
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.440]  it and then I hear there's the myth that Muslims are aggressive there's the myth of
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.880]  Muslim extremism for Obama six years ago said Muslim extremism doesn't exist don't
[10:27.880 --> 10:37.360]  use the term and the media is so dutiful so controlled so absolutely mindless that they
[10:37.360 --> 10:43.320]  go along with it like I never even got to vice president's speech I said I meant to
[10:43.320 --> 10:50.640]  play parts of when he spoke there with Billy Graham Jr. there with Franklin Graham and
[10:50.640 --> 10:57.320]  they both said we are under absolute Islamic attack there is a genocide of Christians
[10:57.320 --> 11:02.720]  hundreds of thousands a year being killed the UN admits for every person persecuted
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.240]  in the world there's more than one and a half Christians being persecuted let me explain
[11:07.240 --> 11:14.640]  that more than half the persecution and killing on earth is a peaceful productive Christians
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.200]  whether it's in Latin America or Asia or Eastern Europe or the Middle East particularly or
[11:20.200 --> 11:28.400]  Asia it's a fact to search engine Christians most persecuted group you in and it's doubled
[11:28.400 --> 11:34.560]  in the last decade it's open season and you see the demonization of Christians everywhere
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.360]  look at the stories I have just just just a few of them and I've got more than that
[11:39.360 --> 11:51.120]  in the stack here Germany Germany confiscating homes to use for migrants and ladies and gentlemen
[11:51.120 --> 11:55.840]  they're taking hotels they're taking people's houses they're taking houses people live in
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.320]  they're taking houses people are renovating they're forcing people in Italy out of their
[11:59.320 --> 12:05.200]  hotels and putting the illegals in it Germany confiscating homes to use for migrants with
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.920]  no consideration in many cases in Hamburg the second largest city in Germany have been
[12:08.920 --> 12:14.840]  confiscating private dwellings to ease a housing shortage the government wanted to keep the
[12:14.840 --> 12:18.760]  program secret the last three years and it's trying to order people under threat of arrest
[12:18.760 --> 12:25.840]  if they talk about it we're linked to mainstream news in this detailed report from the gate
[12:25.840 --> 12:34.360]  stone Institute this is very scholarly every paragraph has links to the government's own
[12:34.360 --> 12:40.240]  admissions and videos that's not fake news that's real news and that's why they call
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.040]  us fake news because they can't stand they don't control the information they want to
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.240]  sit there and tell you oh the foreign shooting wasn't Muslims oh the gay bar attack in Florida
[12:50.240 --> 12:57.360]  wasn't Muslim oh this wasn't Muslim that wasn't Muslim nothing's ever Muslim they're
[12:57.360 --> 13:04.340]  perfectly innocent and I'm not gonna sit here and hear this anymore Sweden 70 year old woman
[13:04.340 --> 13:10.680]  prosecuted for complaining about migrants defecating in the streets that's up on infowars.com
[13:10.680 --> 13:24.880]  with DT.SE that's mainstream biggest publication right there in Sweden DT.SE reporting a 70
[13:24.880 --> 13:32.320]  year old woman in Dalaran prosecuted for hate speech after writing on Facebook that immigrants
[13:32.320 --> 13:36.600]  are defecating on the streets according to the prosecution the woman via Facebook wrote
[13:36.600 --> 13:42.400]  disparagingly of people with a foreign background and they're trying to unofficially in America
[13:42.400 --> 13:48.920]  now with lawsuits and intimidation and all the stuff that's going on tell us you're not
[13:48.920 --> 13:56.120]  allowed to criticize illegal aliens of any stripe but especially Muslims you sit there
[13:56.120 --> 14:03.240]  and you keep your mouth shut remember three years ago they hired former high level Stasi
[14:03.240 --> 14:08.560]  from East Germany for Facebook to help run a program to report to police and arrest people
[14:08.560 --> 14:15.320]  that criticize Muslims. Sweden 70 year old woman prosecuted for complaining about migrants
[14:15.320 --> 14:22.800]  defecating in the streets and mainstream news reports it like it's good in Germany they're
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.520]  starting to prosecute folks you complain migrant tries to rape your daughter in the pool or
[14:26.520 --> 14:32.200]  craps in the pool that's their culture in fact I've got reports out of every day out
[14:32.200 --> 14:35.360]  of England where women are being raped children are being raped and they when they tell them
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.840]  their names Muhammad it's over they say oh you're racist the police actually do that
[14:40.840 --> 14:44.720]  there's a directive there's an order and now their cases in Europe where they're saying
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.920]  migrants are allowed to rape it's their culture there was just one case it's all last week
[14:49.920 --> 14:57.400]  where they like raped a seven-year-old boy sodomized him and they said well he didn't
[14:57.400 --> 15:07.640]  understand the language so he's allowed to here it is rather damn child rape victim authorities
[15:07.640 --> 15:14.040]  did nothing was told not to mention ethnicity of attackers in the US it's just different
[15:14.040 --> 15:18.860]  if there's any connection to migrants or illegals or refugees they'll just say oh the allegations
[15:18.860 --> 15:24.000]  of rape are made up out of hoax then the people later plead guilty and what's the media's
[15:24.000 --> 15:35.160]  answer we just need to shut our shuns down continuing good luck Swedish government administering
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.840]  religious tests to Christian asylum seekers and not letting them in that's right don't
[15:39.840 --> 15:48.120]  let those Christians in and it goes on and on and on and on the bullying intimidation
[15:48.120 --> 15:52.920]  I have a whole stack of niche of professors saying kill Trump professors saying impeach
[15:52.920 --> 16:00.400]  Trump professors saying he's a clear and present danger teachers saying kill Trump teachers
[16:00.400 --> 16:07.080]  on video saying kill me it's government crazies and they say oh he's a clear and present danger

[16:13.080 --> 16:18.200]  the professors clever cutting him in fours dot com reported far left Harvard professor impeach
[16:18.200 --> 16:25.040]  Trump urges Republicans to put national interest over party loyalty national interest and it
[16:25.040 --> 16:30.240]  goes on when he's on George Stephanopoulos calling for all this meanwhile ISIS commanders
[16:30.240 --> 16:37.680]  say join moderate rebels there are no moderate rebels so that's just some of what we've got
[16:37.680 --> 16:43.800]  here meanwhile they're saying Trump has committed high crimes it's not a crime to follow to fire
[16:43.800 --> 16:49.120]  the FBI director the Democrats call for the FBI directors firing hundreds and hundreds
[16:49.120 --> 16:55.080]  of times sometimes dozens of times apiece we've got more than 14 videos of Maxine Waters
[16:55.080 --> 16:59.320]  saying fire comey and the comies horrible and that she has classified info that he's
[16:59.320 --> 17:05.680]  a liar and he's been working for the Russians then he gets up there and says Trump's crazy
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.520]  that Obama was spying on him and Trump goes I'm crazy he's the president Trump has all
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.440]  the files on exactly how they did he has total access to everything he just can't release
[17:16.440 --> 17:21.460]  it because it's classified and he said that the House Intelligence Committee has released
[17:21.460 --> 17:27.520]  limited information they just call me call me crazy hey buddy you're crazy you're fired
[17:27.520 --> 17:33.280]  it's board nation and they go oh my gosh oh my gosh Trump said it was also about Russia
[17:33.280 --> 17:37.520]  he was honest of course it was about that made up witch hunt not to stop the witch hunt
[17:37.520 --> 17:44.400]  the witch hunts ongoing but when Congress comes out admits the Democrats admit we found
[17:44.400 --> 17:49.320]  no evidence of Russian collusion but we want to expand the probe it's a load of manure
[17:49.320 --> 17:57.960]  when all Trump said through sessions was they better investigate Hillary or heads are gonna
[17:57.960 --> 18:03.880]  rule Hillary actually got money from the Russians that's why he's angry and I was told screaming
[18:03.880 --> 18:07.760]  at television when he sees it because he's not a Rusky agent he's trying to make America
[18:07.760 --> 18:14.280]  great again it's all coming up we told you last week where his heads are gonna roll Trump's
[18:14.280 --> 18:17.640]  gonna start chopping heads I think it'll be when he gets back from his foreign trip Watson
[18:17.640 --> 18:21.560]  hasn't tell that it might be as early as tomorrow or today but you notice everybody's saying
[18:21.560 --> 18:27.760]  exactly what we said this weekend now four days after we broke it why now sources Trump
[18:27.760 --> 18:32.760]  looks to replace Spicer as part of establishment advisors begins and now the New York Times
[18:32.760 --> 18:37.280]  say their sources have confirmed that oh because we're fake news oh no no no we're the opposite
[18:37.280 --> 18:41.560]  because we've got the contacts we've got the intelligence agency contacts we've got you
[18:41.560 --> 18:45.640]  the giant audience that gives us intel and we've got a crew that's willing to tell the
[18:45.640 --> 18:51.560]  truth to take action and that's why they're scared Trump's eyeing Spicer replacement
[18:51.560 --> 18:56.320]  as part of broader White House staff shake up report oh it's in the Washington Post the
[18:56.320 --> 19:03.840]  New York Times and the Daily New York Daily News four or five days after we break it we're
[19:03.840 --> 19:09.880]  gonna have more of the Roger Stone breaking news oh look at the stop of drugs Trump the
[19:09.880 --> 19:16.640]  clean house president seething over leaks everything I told you last Tuesday and Wednesday
[19:16.640 --> 19:22.040]  I said he's seething over links he's super angry he's screaming at the television he
[19:22.040 --> 19:29.640]  won't talk to hardly anybody but patriots and and and hardcore libertarians and he he
[19:29.640 --> 19:33.440]  told him I tried to compromise with all you morons just try to save the country and now
[19:33.440 --> 19:36.720]  you're trying to destroy me loves are awful skip this break because I'm gonna have a show
[19:36.720 --> 19:40.320]  in the future and if we don't just occasionally do this because they're trying to completely
[19:40.320 --> 19:47.240]  shut me down now but that's the only one I'm gonna stop now I know the network hates it
[19:47.240 --> 19:52.000]  I shouldn't do it I just I just I just get so upset listen to me very very carefully ladies
[19:52.000 --> 20:02.560]  and gentlemen oh look scoop Trump irked at cabinet and staff moles sweeping shake up
[20:02.560 --> 20:09.840]  and what I love is no one is giving us credit even though we broke all this on May I shed
[20:09.840 --> 20:22.400]  it on May 10th but it broke on info wars May 11th and no one gave us credit except Mike
[20:22.400 --> 20:31.000]  Cernovich and the reason we're here pointing out the credit we should get every day a week
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.320]  later a month later a year later when it what we've said is confirmed exactly as we said
[20:35.320 --> 20:42.040]  it I told you hidden tones over cable and broadcast TV a decade ago are activating and
[20:42.040 --> 20:47.600]  communicating with smart systems in your house and all of it's been made public one week
[20:47.600 --> 20:54.960]  ago I told you 18 years ago that Google right when they were first founded had a plan some
[20:54.960 --> 21:00.960]  of their first press releases to the shareholders wasn't public press releases but internal
[21:00.960 --> 21:06.600]  to shareholders and prospectus that they were going to have computers listening to you inside
[21:06.600 --> 21:12.480]  your house for the ultimate data mining sources for algorithms and profiles all of it's come
[21:12.480 --> 21:20.120]  out the last year we told you all of it over and over and over and over and over and because
[21:20.120 --> 21:26.240]  we would break things nobody else would break we have intelligence agencies and foreign governments
[21:26.240 --> 21:32.560]  and the president listening and now it's become a feedback loop of good info because we were
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.040]  important stuff nobody else would report so people in government and things wanted to
[21:36.040 --> 21:40.880]  hear somebody that was doing a full wide spectrum analysis and they knew a lot of inside baseball
[21:40.880 --> 21:44.840]  themselves so the areas that they knew about they knew we were we were accurate which only
[21:44.840 --> 21:53.520]  sent our credibility up even more and now the creme d'ala creme now the explosive mixture
[21:53.520 --> 22:02.600]  in the chemistry laboratory now we get accelerated leaks because patriots know we'll tell it
[22:02.600 --> 22:07.480]  like it is and aren't afraid to stick our necks out and don't answer to corporate boards
[22:07.480 --> 22:12.640]  above us why do you think the New York Times mirrors what we say now a week after we break
[22:12.640 --> 22:19.000]  it we're forcing them to break it later they already knew this stuff they got a lot more
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.080]  moles and people than we ever thought about but they're doing that for influence and control
[22:24.080 --> 22:31.920]  and so they can manipulate the process influence peddling in my view by us being there and
[22:31.920 --> 22:35.960]  being able to put it out or drudge being able to put it out it forces them to respond and
[22:35.960 --> 22:39.920]  look I know most of you know this better than I I'm talking to new listeners so they understand
[22:39.920 --> 22:50.520]  this paradigm for the low information voter out there
[22:50.520 --> 23:04.720]  for the for the low information voter out there they hear all this they see all this
[23:04.720 --> 23:16.200]  they watch it all unfold and
[23:16.200 --> 23:24.000]  they don't know what to believe the low information voter out there is in their own world they're
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.320]  on the smart phone most of them don't even have jobs they just shuffle around getting
[23:28.320 --> 23:36.320]  deeper deeper debt on government welfare and they just see some guy on TV or clips on the
[23:36.320 --> 23:41.440]  news and they just want to feel like they're powerful and that some famous guys being put
[23:41.440 --> 23:46.240]  down or thrown under the bus or you know it's being sued doesn't matter if the lawsuit gets
[23:46.240 --> 23:58.240]  dropped or I win lawsuits none of that matters they just in the moment that they're in my
[23:58.240 --> 24:20.560]  ear I'm gonna I'm gonna go to break for a while we've got it weging war on corruption it's
[24:20.560 --> 24:28.560]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[24:28.560 --> 24:45.440]  let's say the democrats are going this direction they're going north and get ready to call me
[24:45.440 --> 24:54.200]  and then as soon as Trump agrees with them they do a perfect 180 and go the other direction
[24:54.200 --> 25:02.720]  180 degrees they don't do a you turn take a while to get back to it they didn't start
[25:02.720 --> 25:06.240]  changing their story and say well before we thought this but now we think that they just
[25:06.240 --> 25:16.960]  did a perfect that turn they 180 I just start thinking about these people and what how they're
[25:16.960 --> 25:20.800]  out to get us how they think they're better than us and I just think about what trash
[25:20.800 --> 25:26.640]  they are what scummy families they come from how dishonest they are how twisted they are
[25:26.640 --> 25:36.640]  how they want to hurt the people and they make me absolutely enraged and sick to my stomach
[25:36.640 --> 25:43.360]  because they're a pack of scum and they bully a lot of well-meaning people into following
[25:43.360 --> 25:49.600]  their ideology of modern leftist garbage by peer pressure most liberals are not bad people
[25:49.600 --> 25:56.720]  they really believe the lies of people like people and this is the resistance I appeal
[25:56.720 --> 26:01.840]  to the intelligence agencies and the governments of what is left of the free world to them as
[26:01.840 --> 26:06.960]  entities entirities as bureaucracies making official decisions and the individuals who
[26:06.960 --> 26:14.800]  make decisions of conscience to gchq and mi6 in the uk to the bnd in germany the dgse in france
[26:14.800 --> 26:20.640]  the asis in australia and even to the gru in russia where they must already be profoundly aware
[26:20.640 --> 26:26.000]  that they have not merely helped put an amoral cynic in power here but an uncontrollable one
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  all right let's stop there that is the problem he's not controlled by the globalist so now you're
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.440]  more honest you want the foreign powers who did metal in our election the EU got involved the
[26:35.440 --> 26:40.240]  globalist got involved the UN got involved the saudi's got involved the pope got involved the
[26:40.240 --> 26:45.680]  chinese dictator got involved cuba got involved mexico got involved canada got involved but you
[26:45.680 --> 26:51.200]  couldn't stop the american people you got your asses handed to you and now you want the whole
[26:51.200 --> 26:58.000]  world to gang up on us more you dirtbag traitor and steven cobert so in the last month he's really
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.040]  been attacking me i mean we're talking almost every day so i'm sending private messages
[27:03.040 --> 27:11.360]  to the character he created he admits is based on me talk buckford and to his official cbs show
[27:11.360 --> 27:20.560]  and then to his official steven at home site and no responses obviously does he such a god creature
[27:22.960 --> 27:27.920]  to be saying have me on i mean normally when he's attacking trump
[27:27.920 --> 27:32.800]  promised it on the show or he's attacking bill aralea bill aralea's been on a bunch i'm this major
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.000]  part of the show he has a character based on me and i'm not on so thank you all the last two weeks
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.680]  your mainstream media deception has only intensified the power of info wars as people across the world
[27:43.680 --> 27:49.760]  see that i'm under attack with attempts to take my children from me lawsuits attempts to put me
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.800]  in jail attempts to destroy me google admits they were basically setting up systems to ban us off
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.280]  the internet all of it's coming out because i'm not a coward and i'm not bought and paid for by
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.160]  multinational corporations i'm standing up for this country and i'm telling the truth and serious
[28:04.160 --> 28:15.680]  men and women for every race color and creed know the truth and that and true liberalism
[28:15.680 --> 28:21.760]  is awakening again and all the old corporate whore media systems are going to be swept away
[28:21.760 --> 28:27.520]  like a big rain coming in and flooding into the gutters bill more this is the problem with the
[28:27.520 --> 28:33.120]  gun debate is that it's a constant center right debate there's no left in this debate everyone
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.680]  on the left is so afraid to say what should be said which is the second amendment is both
[28:38.560 --> 28:44.720]  and those guys are praying on their viewers and everything scripted and they know full well
[28:44.720 --> 28:53.520]  what they're doing i just think my lucky stars i'm not one of them
[28:59.360 --> 29:03.920]  where we're at right now it's interesting lester there's a shot of you when you first walk in and
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.320]  it seems the president hands you a piece of paper and of course the eagle eyed viewer wants to know
[29:08.320 --> 29:14.160]  what was that paper this is the paper it was a five pages of quotes of democrats who have been
[29:14.160 --> 29:20.000]  critical of comey a few calling for his resignation calling for his firing being critical uh there
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.400]  were about 20 quotes on here but the president wanted me to have that and it makes it makes a
[29:24.400 --> 29:28.960]  fair point that a lot of democrats were not happy with comey either many believing that he's working
[29:28.960 --> 29:33.440]  to hillary clinton's chances unhappy with him at first and then unhappy with his firing later
[29:33.440 --> 29:37.440]  yeah but part of the reason why the white house thought this might not be so controversial yeah
[29:37.440 --> 29:42.000]  i think i got the sense a lot of people got the sense that it didn't quite see this blowback
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.040]  coming that this would be something that would be more universally applauded lester thank you and by
[29:47.040 --> 29:56.000]  the way you're gonna be back in our next we're gonna march with the empires on the run alex jones
[29:56.000 --> 30:06.160]  and the gcn radio network the one belts one road international forum in beijing started on sunday
[30:06.160 --> 30:10.400]  and right now is in its second day regarding the latest norse korean missile test launch that
[30:10.400 --> 30:15.040]  happened on sunday putin said that it didn't pose a direct threat to russia but that missile tests
[30:15.040 --> 30:19.760]  are unacceptable and that these problems need to be solved peacefully and not through intimidating
[30:19.760 --> 30:25.040]  north korea but through returning to dialogue putin also commented on a so-called want to cry
[30:25.040 --> 30:30.160]  the ransomware virus attack that hit computers across the world last week he said that malware
[30:30.160 --> 30:35.600]  created by intelligence services can backfire on its creators quote microsoft's management has made
[30:35.600 --> 30:40.160]  it clear that the virus originated from us intelligence services and of course putin said that
[30:40.160 --> 30:45.360]  last year washington refused the russia's proposal on cyber security threats with the aim of drafting
[30:45.360 --> 30:50.480]  a bilateral agreement now regarding the forum's main intent putin said that the plan is for the
[30:50.480 --> 30:55.440]  greater eurasia not to just be an abstract geopolitical arrangement but a truly civilization

[33:29.760 --> 33:34.320]  in studio with us a little bit in the next hour roger stone's going to be here and host at least
[33:34.320 --> 33:39.600]  two hours with us mike sternovich they have big breaking news obviously from their winehouse contacts
[33:40.480 --> 33:46.000]  i have my pentagon contacts and others huge developments trump hasn't decided what he's
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.640]  going to do yet but he is really looking at a major purge we first reported on the fact that
[33:52.640 --> 33:58.240]  this purge was coming last tuesday uh and since then the basic breakdowns of what we put out have
[33:58.240 --> 34:04.240]  all been confirmed now millie went out over the weekend here in austin to the illegal alien march
[34:04.240 --> 34:08.880]  it's called the migrant march but under the un there are no borders everyone can migrate do whatever
[34:08.880 --> 34:16.480]  they want the un and the state departments then administer the new migrant populations inside
[34:16.480 --> 34:25.600]  your country so it's global government colonization it is modern feudalism integrated with the older
[34:25.600 --> 34:30.720]  forms of colonialism but now they're using the third world to colonize what's left of the west
[34:30.720 --> 34:35.840]  so this is full spectrum dominance we're going to go to that in a minute millie weaver is here
[34:35.840 --> 34:42.000]  but first i wanted to play a clip that i saw last week because it ties into all this uh of a lady
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.720]  at western washington university at a major art school university where a man has a jesus's lord
[34:48.720 --> 34:54.640]  sign in the commons area we supposedly have free speech and uh reportedly of the name donald trump
[34:54.640 --> 34:59.840]  is seen somewhere on there though i have trouble seeing it and she begins like the exorcist to
[34:59.840 --> 35:05.440]  howl and scream now i want the crew to put this together later we have every few days some crazy
[35:05.440 --> 35:12.720]  thing where people go and just go nuts and scream and yell and throw food and panic and roll around
[35:12.720 --> 35:19.840]  the ground like toddlers and then weirdo professors come over and calm them and then they go to these
[35:19.840 --> 35:26.160]  areas and are given play-doh crayons and crafts like they're five years old so this is the true
[35:26.720 --> 35:31.840]  arrested development psychological warfare center in fact it's in my stack from yesterday
[35:31.840 --> 35:37.600]  i won't talk to you about this millie where they banned mother's day in the united states and
[35:37.600 --> 35:43.040]  canada public schools and they're now saying men have uteruses too and of course bill nye said that
[35:43.040 --> 35:50.320]  chromosomes don't affect the sexes uh the sexes don't uh exist uh only the ones that facebook
[35:50.320 --> 35:55.360]  mentions it's now up to over 100 it was 50 just two years ago so ladies and gentlemen this is a
[35:55.360 --> 36:00.800]  full on attack to turn the public into gibbering mental patients and millie weaver was in the
[36:00.800 --> 36:05.360]  middle of it being stalked being told she's a racist a lot of this has cuss words so we can't
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.000]  play a lot of it uh it'll be posted on info wars dot com unedited a little bit later today
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.360]  this is some of the raw footage shot yesterday at the illegal alien march being run by uh
[36:15.360 --> 36:19.520]  communist and the democratic party but before we do that let's play this clip because it ties into
[36:19.520 --> 36:24.080]  something important uh the headline is autistic screeching we're not making fun of people that
[36:24.080 --> 36:30.320]  have autism it's like a form of programmed autism sjw loses her mind on university campus
[36:30.320 --> 36:38.000]  i called it basically linda blair like possession but this is happening everywhere and so it's
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.760]  it's temper tantrums that are thrown this is the arrest of development so let's play this
[36:41.760 --> 36:58.400]  clip here it is and the professors are telling her it's okay what she's doing just go to your
[36:58.400 --> 37:14.560]  particular a mental facility an art major she's she's an art major you wicked wicked
[37:14.560 --> 37:31.360]  don't be sure i'm at it actually do it let me see your warface that's not very scary
[37:32.960 --> 37:38.960]  the arts are going downhill folks this is an art major oh she's that doesn't scare me better get
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.920]  better at that and it goes on and on millie i want to do a plug here but then i'll eat your take on
[37:43.920 --> 37:50.080]  all this but just overall we should put a compilation together showing and we should find patient
[37:50.080 --> 37:55.520]  zero the last few years where this just throwing convulsion fits rolling around on the ground
[37:55.520 --> 37:59.440]  of your radio list and you couldn't see it what is this i mean i know you've got a toddler yourself
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.640]  but they're not you know a badly bad like that they're being triggered i mean i think there's a
[38:04.640 --> 38:10.400]  level of arrested development that has to be going on here but at the same time i think that
[38:10.400 --> 38:16.160]  it's brainwashing i think that there's brainwashing and they really get so hyped up over these
[38:16.160 --> 38:20.160]  simple things that could be triggering them to where they actually have an emotional
[38:20.160 --> 38:24.160]  mental breakdown and that's why i feel like a lot of people are going out there and trump
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.320]  supporters are going out there purposefully trying to trigger them they'll wear their they'll be
[38:28.320 --> 38:32.560]  decked out in their trump attire be like you know just to see the reaction and they just
[38:32.560 --> 38:37.120]  continue to get triggered and have them out bounds and it's entertainment for all and it
[38:37.120 --> 38:42.320]  just shows the lunacy that's on the left and by the way for anybody thinks we're cherry picking
[38:42.320 --> 38:48.320]  this we have hours and hours ourselves of people going f u f u died marna kill you or
[38:49.760 --> 38:53.520]  of course they'll edit me out of context put on the national news and say that i was just doing
[38:53.520 --> 39:00.240]  that no i'm imitating them yeah so so cobert will take clips of me screaming imitating them
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.560]  and then say oh look he's totally having a mental breakdown no i'm imitating you what your viewers
[39:04.560 --> 39:09.920]  have turned into millie we should search into this if you're a new listener i'm not making it up at
[39:09.920 --> 39:15.360]  colleges all over the united states and europe they give them safe places that's right with crayolas
[39:16.160 --> 39:22.640]  knitting uh arts and crafts coloring books and you know what they're actually transferring the
[39:22.640 --> 39:27.680]  libraries from physical copies into digital versions and a lot of these universities are
[39:27.680 --> 39:34.640]  actually thinking of changing and transforming their libraries into nap pods like nap rooms where
[39:34.640 --> 39:40.800]  people can college students can go and have a nap time i mean what is this this nap time was
[39:40.800 --> 39:46.240]  something in kindergarten and now we're seeing universities wanting to turn libraries into
[39:46.240 --> 39:51.840]  nap time rooms so that they can burn and there it is napping pods that students does off between
[39:51.840 --> 39:55.440]  classes and by the way i'm not joking they're getting rid of white boards because someone
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.520]  might write something offensive but it gets worse you can actually pull up where they hand them
[40:00.160 --> 40:05.040]  crayolas and stuff in fact there's videos uh the project veritas and others where they would
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.680]  have pocket constitutions people will get so triggered they run then the people have a hidden
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.480]  camera of it and they're saying it's okay you can follow complaint i know it's very frightening here
[40:14.480 --> 40:20.800]  here's your play dough oh my god and they go oh thank you play dough it's it's unbelievable and
[40:20.800 --> 40:27.600]  even just yesterday when we went to this anti sb4 march just being out there and having the info
[40:27.600 --> 40:34.240]  wars mic massively triggered people i mean they all were freaking out info wars don't talk to them
[40:34.240 --> 40:39.600]  they were calling us racist they were saying fake news they just couldn't handle it i mean it's
[40:39.600 --> 40:46.400]  called toddler therapy fox news toddler therapy yeah that's and i guess a lot of them didn't get
[40:46.400 --> 40:50.800]  breastfed a lot of them didn't get held by mommy so i did they literally are babies looking for their
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.360]  mommy and then the state's their mommy and then the state teaches them there's no boys and girls
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.360]  there's only binary pods and we're not going to have children anymore because humans are bad
[40:59.360 --> 41:07.680]  we're going to die for the earth now get in a corner and set your thumb it's arrested development
[41:07.680 --> 41:14.480]  and we we've actually seen this happen in japan and japan tokyo especially such a huge city the
[41:14.480 --> 41:19.760]  cost of living is so high people are under so much pressure and they go into video games they go into
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.400]  anime they go into all these most men will not get married or have kids that's right they just won't
[41:24.400 --> 41:30.080]  got up they won't it's like they want to run away from the responsibility of being an adult once
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.400]  you have kids what's it really like you just want to throw awesome they're up they're amazing they're
[41:34.400 --> 41:39.920]  such a blessing and they actually make they force you to grow up and it's fun making them responsible
[41:39.920 --> 41:46.640]  yeah i mean god gave us an incredible incredible fun yeah so you know thank you jesus now it seems
[41:46.640 --> 41:53.600]  like all these sjw's are replacing pets like dogs for children i mean they would rather have a pet or
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.520]  a dog oh absolutely you see some woman with a little dog but then they get pregnant i go i know
[41:57.520 --> 42:04.240]  where that dog's going you have that baby backseat yeah right which is fine personally my dogs are
[42:04.240 --> 42:08.880]  still spoiled and cats are spoiled it's all ridiculous but uh meli let's start actually
[42:08.880 --> 42:13.120]  getting to your report because i don't want to run out of time here but just briefly we are selling
[42:13.120 --> 42:17.920]  the trump pants shirts which by the way had been best sellers 300 400 500 a day then when trumps
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.720]  were going a little bit sideways sales went under like 30 40 50 a day guess what i noticed last week
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.040]  as soon as he fired comey i walked over and i talked to our shipping department i said let me guess
[42:27.600 --> 42:32.320]  sales of the trump shirts are way up and they said let's look they said yeah we're selling 150 a day
[42:33.200 --> 42:38.160]  again it's a it's a people want trump to get tough yes they wanted to take action but regardless
[42:38.160 --> 42:43.920]  nobody's perfect but trump is the man in the arena so we have trump is my president a new design navy
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.080]  blue with the american flag it's like the hillary for prison shirt but it's trump is my president
[42:48.080 --> 42:54.080]  america first in 1776 info wars dot com on the right hand shoulder on the back info wars dot
[42:54.080 --> 42:58.640]  com this is a way to meet like-minded people it's a way to not let bully shut down your free speech
[42:58.640 --> 43:05.680]  and quite frankly uh these shirts ladies and gentlemen are below cost because the xls and xxls
[43:05.680 --> 43:11.760]  and xxxls cost us up to seven dollars a piece uh the regular ones uh extra large and down
[43:11.760 --> 43:16.960]  cost us like four dollars and change so after our cost we're actually losing money on this
[43:16.960 --> 43:24.080]  but i want to flood these shirts i want to trigger people or or just create something like a uh
[43:24.880 --> 43:29.280]  don't have a contest where you create like a scarecrow put it on it put it in a busy intersection
[43:29.280 --> 43:34.880]  have a hidden camera and see who gets triggered right yeah exactly you could do so much with
[43:34.880 --> 43:38.400]  these shirts because this is america just like open carry they want to demonize guns and say
[43:38.400 --> 43:43.040]  they're all banned people start open carrying where it's legal that pushes back our culture of freedom
[43:43.040 --> 43:47.920]  wins of not being arrested development babies so again keeping america great again dot com is on
[43:47.920 --> 43:55.120]  the back info wars dot com trump is my president or trump pence uh that's there as well and then
[43:55.120 --> 43:59.520]  one of the shirts says uh trump is my president 45th president united states america first
[43:59.520 --> 44:05.840]  since 1776 so there's three different variants of the limited editions and when they sell out
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.000]  there's only a few thousand left of each shirt went i did this with the previous trumps my president
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.040]  red shirt no longer available hillary for president 2016 no longer available when these sell out they
[44:15.040 --> 44:19.840]  are gone gone and no doubt they're collector's items no doubt these are in documentaries they're
[44:19.840 --> 44:24.880]  in films they're they're all over tv you change the world by purchasing these shirts you change the
[44:24.880 --> 44:31.200]  world by buying them at 995 or 1495 there are hundreds of thousands of these shirts out there
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.360]  now quite frankly we sell the lion's share when we do to do an at-cost event just because i want
[44:35.360 --> 44:42.080]  to defeat the globalist so four dollars and 95 cents info wars store dot com the shipping as

[45:07.200 --> 45:10.960]  kind of narrate what we're about to see in the narrate over this video we're about to play
[45:10.960 --> 45:16.480]  what happened in austin well i started out and i was able to actually interview a couple people at
[45:16.480 --> 45:24.240]  this sb4 migrant mother's march it was on mother's day and at first some of the people were you know
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.480]  they were talking to me and everything like that and then halfway through a conversation with a
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.560]  woman she realized i was with info war she's like what you're with info wars wait you know i didn't
[45:34.560 --> 45:43.920]  fit the racist xenophobic stereotype that they have tried to push on people like info wars or
[45:43.920 --> 45:49.440]  like donald trump supporters and the next thing you know this march starts going and we have
[45:49.440 --> 45:55.440]  been swarmed and we've been being stalked by these these people who want to make sure that
[45:55.440 --> 46:01.120]  they can go around and tell all the other protesters there don't talk to them they're with info wars
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.320]  they're fake news and this guy right here he actually is wearing a little badge that says
[46:06.320 --> 46:12.720]  that he is a democratic party chairman for travis county so he's actually a member of the democratic
[46:12.720 --> 46:21.440]  party and in fact there are pictures of him on the internet with hillary clinton and tim kane
[46:22.080 --> 46:28.400]  and so he's kind of making sure like a handler in essence that we don't get to talk to anybody we
[46:28.400 --> 46:36.000]  don't get to red pill anyone there and they're protesting because they want to make it basically
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.640]  unlimited where illegal can just do whatever they want we're not against anybody mexico doesn't just
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.440]  let you in germany unless you're in islamism doesn't let you in russia doesn't just let you in japan
[46:45.440 --> 46:50.480]  doesn't let you in we're going bankrupt we're falling apart and then when the immigrants get here
[46:50.480 --> 46:56.800]  the left tries to turn them into a bunch of race conscious race bait systems that's what the democrats
[46:56.800 --> 47:00.320]  abandoned in the 60s because the republicans said we're not going to let you be racist anymore
[47:00.320 --> 47:05.440]  they've just flipped to making minorities who are the majority in most areas a bunch of race based
[47:05.440 --> 47:10.000]  cult members it's absolutely untenable let's start rolling some of this footage of the illegal
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.880]  alien support march yesterday in austin what brings you out here today well it's a mother's day
[47:16.880 --> 47:24.800]  first of all and sb4 needs to end oh it splits up the families mexico um is our neighbor good
[47:24.800 --> 47:29.440]  pause for me okay so mexico's our neighbor and we've been totally inclusive and wide open
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.040]  and if you tried to march in mexico city saying let americans come in and run things you get beat
[47:35.040 --> 47:39.520]  up okay yeah and i'm not saying do that but at least the mexicans have nationalism i mean they
[47:39.520 --> 47:45.840]  would beat the living hell out of you that is a fact it guatemalan's do try to come into mexico
[47:45.840 --> 47:51.680]  and call the shots and they get killed they kill them so i mean it's crazy it's like where i'm
[47:51.680 --> 47:56.960]  sorry go ahead where in mexico do they have sanctuary cities for americans or people from
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.280]  other countries to come and say and they don't have those there by the way mexico's on the high
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.200]  end of third world countries yeah it's on the high end there are a lot of nice areas in mexico
[48:05.200 --> 48:12.400]  i mean it is they don't like the fact that this sb4 bill what it does is it gives police officers
[48:12.400 --> 48:18.480]  the tools the ability to to actually um when somebody's illegal when they're arrested they
[48:18.480 --> 48:23.280]  can actually then go and hand them over to ice what do you think mexican police do when they
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.800]  pull you over yeah it just makes it so that the police can actually follow the law and enforce
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.600]  immigration and that's right you have the states and the cities in total rebellion and it's gotten
[48:33.600 --> 48:36.720]  out of hand i don't want to persecute people that are here don't have criminal records
[48:36.720 --> 48:39.920]  i want to make it easier people to become citizens the democrats and republicans have
[48:39.920 --> 48:45.600]  kept it hard because they want this huge underbelly they control a permanent underclass i don't want
[48:45.600 --> 48:49.680]  that i don't want a permanent underclass of sterilized people that did garter still shots
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.720]  that are all pissed because they're poor thinking i caused it i want mexico to be wealthy i want
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.120]  us to be wealthy if mexico was better than america i'd go move there i'm looking at costa rica i mean
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.360]  i might say i'm gonna move but you know it ain't that i'm trying to keep away from brown people i'm
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.800]  trying to keep away from communist yeah i'm not moving to venezuela i kept trying to tell these
[49:08.800 --> 49:14.080]  people you know it'd make more sense if you were out here trying to protest the fact that our immigration
[49:14.080 --> 49:20.560]  system is flawed it's inefficient there needs to be a change or reform in it and to make it easier
[49:20.560 --> 49:25.680]  so that people can go through the proper process to immigrate exactly faster and they just didn't
[49:25.680 --> 49:30.320]  want to hear it they're like nope you're fake news info wars and by the way we're playing the
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.760]  the lighter stuff because everybody else is cussing but now here it is i feel it's unconstitutional
[49:35.760 --> 49:42.640]  illegal immoral roundup of human beings i think that it's unethical and it's fake safety
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.040]  good pause but democrats love it when old ladies get their houses taken because they're
[49:47.040 --> 49:50.480]  in the rears and can't pay their income tax because their husband had a heart attack and died
[49:50.480 --> 49:57.840]  and i mean that's like my grandmother who died this year i mean it's just it's just it's just
[49:57.840 --> 50:02.080]  ongoing oh but then it's okay to take people's houses and sell them on the courthouse steps
[50:02.080 --> 50:10.000]  in the milling yeah it's pretty crazy i mean everything she says is bull yes and it's coming
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.400]  from this false they're being fed it's this false we're the loving oh we're the saviors everybody
[50:16.400 --> 50:21.920]  else is bad milling yeah they're they're definitely being fed disinformation but watch this clip
[50:21.920 --> 50:27.840]  because this lady then comes up and make sure to tell the woman they're fake news you know don't
[50:27.840 --> 50:30.720]  talk to them and by the way we're gonna go to break i'm gonna come back be a good boy the next
[50:30.720 --> 50:34.720]  seven the next year i limited comments because it's hard to not comment every five seconds i'm
[50:34.720 --> 50:41.280]  horrible about that but understand something we're there showing what they're saying so if you want
[50:41.280 --> 50:46.160]  to defend your ideas if you talk to us but instead they always come and yell and scream and cuss

[54:17.920 --> 54:23.120]  they'll read they'll look down and see the info wars moniker and they'll realize oh my gosh i'm
[54:23.120 --> 54:28.640]  talking to info wars and then all their little misconceptions and and preconceived notions
[54:28.640 --> 54:33.120]  the program had the programming flies and then they it's like they become like possessed or
[54:33.120 --> 54:38.720]  something they just also oh my gosh you're with info wars remove my footage and they freak out
[54:38.720 --> 54:43.920]  like thinking they're talking to like the i used to believe leftist propaganda about the cops will
[54:43.920 --> 54:47.440]  actually look at the statistics and the cops aren't perfect it's just most of it was literally a
[54:47.440 --> 54:53.040]  globalist made up false reality that i was believing so i could be the hero and then
[54:53.040 --> 54:58.880]  strut around and hate all the cops like i was superman so part of this is just is just realizing
[54:58.880 --> 55:05.360]  you've been caught and it's their part of their little sjw thing is to like hate on info wars
[55:05.360 --> 55:12.960]  bash info wars because they're being the most uh superhero sjw possible so there it's a virtue
[55:12.960 --> 55:20.080]  signal to go out and hate on info wars and yell at us and curse us out and it's really bizarre and
[55:20.080 --> 55:26.000]  then they try to say you edit the clips to make us look bad it's like no we don't it's not even edited
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.960]  you guys make yourselves look bad when you're screaming and cursing us out how hard is that to
[55:30.960 --> 55:35.280]  understand they're the ones making themselves look bad at what we we don't need you and Gavin have a
[55:35.280 --> 55:38.720]  lot of courage being out there all the time when are you guys going to upload this big uh you know
[55:38.720 --> 55:43.280]  group of clips we haven't even played yet it's going to be uploaded very shortly probably within
[55:43.280 --> 55:52.800]  the hour well basically the headline is this communist communist party slash democrats organize
[55:52.800 --> 55:58.080]  illegal alien march yes and we didn't even get to that i recognize some of the local communist
[55:58.080 --> 56:04.240]  leaders out there in this march and you know so you had the commies out there not to mention the
[56:04.240 --> 56:09.840]  fact that on mayday the communists had also had an immigrant workers march that marched to the
[56:09.840 --> 56:13.680]  capital and aligned with them and again let's explain a lot of these immigrants are just hard
[56:13.680 --> 56:19.120]  working people from bad situations they're being managed by pure evil the democratic party and the
[56:19.120 --> 56:23.120]  communists exactly they're being used i mean communists have killed like 10 times what the
[56:23.120 --> 56:28.480]  nazis did i mean they think you don't get worse than communists it doesn't and they're being used
[56:28.480 --> 56:33.920]  and exploited because they don't know better and that is why it's so important that people go through
[56:33.920 --> 56:38.720]  the proper immigration process learn about the constitution their rights so that they don't
[56:38.720 --> 56:44.080]  come in here and get used and exploited by groups that have political agendas like the democratic
[56:44.080 --> 56:49.360]  party operatives that were literally hurting them around like cattle and and clipping us off from
[56:49.360 --> 56:54.080]  having any type of dialogue with them and that's a cult a cult is marked by they won't let you talk
[56:54.080 --> 56:58.080]  to members of the media is calling me a cult leader there's no oh yeah i look you have got the answers
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.800]  or a big group or some church i'm at or people i mean i'm the most uncult like boss there is
[57:02.800 --> 57:07.600]  most people in media are running some narcissistic kiss my rear end cult it's just total bull it's
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.320]  the democrats and the nsm that are the cult of dumbasses another interesting thing is that these
[57:12.320 --> 57:19.120]  people were out there chanting see se puede that was their chant which means yes we can so it's like
[57:19.120 --> 57:25.360]  the obama it's a communist chant out of latin america that obama picked up yes it is a trade
[57:25.360 --> 57:32.800]  it's trademarked by the united farm workers and they have been linked by the fbi two communist groups
[57:32.800 --> 57:37.600]  so the whole black eagle and again they did some good things but just because they were getting
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.920]  you know people to not be around deadly pesticides we're fighting that too like the states doesn't
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.640]  mean then communists are good again they seize on issues to become the leaders of movements that's
[57:46.640 --> 57:51.600]  right and a lot of the people out there you could tell the ones that were just kind of going along
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.920]  being used and exploited for political agendas they were all wearing red and when i went and
[57:55.920 --> 58:00.160]  tried to talk to them like why are you guys wearing red you know they're just like oh uh we don't
[58:00.160 --> 58:05.200]  really know the chavez just in solidarity we don't really know the same it's in latin america red
[58:05.200 --> 58:11.760]  means communist yeah so they're all dressed in red and they've got communist local communist leaders
[58:11.760 --> 58:16.800]  out there handling them and democrat democratic and the thing is they don't know that all these
[58:16.800 --> 58:22.640]  latin american countries were rich some of them as rich as the u.s or richer until communism took over
[58:22.640 --> 58:28.640]  you're like beautiful mountains and fields and and soil and culture and then communism comes in
[58:28.640 --> 58:32.480]  and then they wonder why it's a hellhole it's going to be a hellhole here too ladies and gentlemen
[58:33.120 --> 58:38.560]  because with communism comes violence everything it's just it's crazy it's god if latin america
[58:38.560 --> 58:44.080]  was right wing and libertarian it would just be unbelievable but instead it is it is just it is

[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:13.760]  intel what is currently happening because the word is the president is very angry and is about to
[1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:20.240]  make some major shifts in the way he's been governing so far i know he's tried to be inclusive
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:24.880]  he's tried to work with people even very conciliatory and it didn't look like that was taken as a sign
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:30.000]  of strength is that accurate roger and just tell us where we are right now let me say this
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.680]  donald trump is not a man that you push into the corner he is a fighter and he will come back to you
[1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:42.800]  with everything he has i think he is uh he said that the communications operation can't keep up
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:49.600]  with him he is ahead of his own people and that's a problem he is not being well served by
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:55.920]  sean spicer and the entire communications shop which needs to be more proactive right now they're
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:00.960]  dealing with incoming every day but they're not out there selling the president's line and the
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:06.800]  president's point of view and the president's program they're not surfacing servicing local
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:14.080]  media going around the networks to local affiliates which would be amazingly popular and successful
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:21.040]  you could go to miami or chicago reach millions isn't being done so i think that the search is on for
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:27.520]  a new communications head i think generally speaking people are pleased with sarah huckabee
[1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:33.040]  sander she's done a credible job and she's ideal for the number two position i think she's proven
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:40.480]  that under fire alex but the whole sale communication shop i think is going to get a makeover meanwhile
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:49.360]  the fight over anthony scaramucci continues scaramucci a trump loyalist who the transition
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:56.560]  announced would be an assistant to the president still remains in abeyance his appointment frozen
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:05.360]  by rince previs his access to the oval office frozen by rince previs on the pretext that the
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:14.480]  sale of scaramucci's very successful company to a chinese entity is somehow blocking his appointment
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:21.680]  at the same time i checked alex the president's chief economic advisor gary cone liberal democrat
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:28.880]  from from goldman sacks still has bank of china stock in his portfolio stock that he said he
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:35.600]  sold weeks ago so scaramucci a true believer a real conservative widely liked in the trump
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:42.640]  movement being blocked by republican national committee hacks like rince previs so we have is
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:48.960]  is unjust weights and measures we have selective enforcement we have scaramucci playing by the
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:53.120]  rules and then you've got golden sacks boys in there who are allowed to do whatever they want
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:57.680]  just like the globals to always are you were on yesterday and you were on fire and if you could
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:02.800]  just repeat that because you got interrupted by a break and i was actually watching it last night
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:05.680]  and and was frustrated by the fact we had to go to break you were getting into the fact that
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:12.000]  your quote was they made a mistake dealing with trump if you can get back into that well i just
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:19.120]  think that across the board uh the whole comey thing has uh has created a situation in which the
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:25.760]  president is unhappy with the beating he's taking from the mainstream media he is unhappy with the
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:33.520]  with the uh with the response by his communications team he very skillfully as mike cernovich told
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:40.720]  us yesterday um was able to keep the comey thing from leaking which is a first in the trump white
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:49.120]  house because the staff put together by ryan spribis leaks like a sieve i think he's angry uh and i
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:55.600]  think he knows that he needs better people to get the mission done uh and i know that he is privately
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:01.520]  placing calls and talking to people i have to wonder whether this is going to spill over into
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:07.360]  the fbi selection alex because as i looked at that list this morning i think it was up on fox
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:12.960]  there's not a trump person there these are all washington insiders there's nobody there who's
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:19.440]  loyal to donald j trump and his uh and his mission uh and that concerns me very greatly
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:27.360]  yesterday you made the point they made a mistake they pushed trump too hard and again can you get
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:32.480]  back into i may have to go back and look at my exact quote because i was exhausted but i need
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:37.600]  a little more frame of reference well you were just saying that he tried to work with people
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:43.520]  they attacked him they lied now now i understand yeah larger context i think the president uh
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:48.880]  came into office alex thinking that he would get the same honeymoon as other presidents that
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:53.600]  the election was over it was time to unite the country for six months yeah hillary clinton said
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:15:01.440]  something mildly conciliatory so he met with al gore he met with al sharpton he he uh indicated
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:06.240]  that he didn't favor the prosecution of hillary clinton uh he thought that the country would come
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:11.520]  together as they have uh after other raucous political contests there wasn't a honeymoon there
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:17.600]  was a war moon uh they moved on him immediately uh and on every quarter i think he is particularly
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:24.000]  angry that they have promulated this russian collusion nonsense but they refuse to look into
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.840]  the crimes of hillary clinton and bill clinton and the clinton foundation and chelsea clinton
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:35.600]  and he's sick of it i think he is sick of it and it's his government i don't understand why
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:41.280]  the republicans and the house and senate intelligence committees are not more proactive
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:48.720]  into examining what we know to be the surveillance at trump tower the justice department not active
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:54.400]  enough in looking into the surveillance at trump tower so from the president's point of view
[1:15:54.400 --> 1:16:00.480]  we're we're obsessed with russia but we're not looking at the surveillance of the republican
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:06.480]  candidate for president of the united states yes i think it really pisses him off and it should
[1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:11.520]  absolutely and and you know in a wider area you just you made the point is that made a mistake
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:16.720]  they pushed him too far now he's on the war path yeah i i think he's i think all holes are barred
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:22.400]  all all all holes are barred now in other words i mean pardon i'll hold no holds are barred now in
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:29.040]  other words he tried to play pat a cake with the establishment he tried to bring them in and have a
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:36.560]  national unity and he's been spurned now he's got to scorch the earth uh he's got to do what they
[1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:43.680]  did in the 70s he controls the justice department they are criminals i think that uh that a donald
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:49.760]  trump in fighting mood is big big problems for the political establishment and for the globalists
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:59.440]  that's right and they use his honesty as if it's a weakness he has the deputy head of the justice
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:04.480]  department and others come out and say no we recommend you fire comey the democrats have
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.800]  all called for it as well he goes yeah i got that too but i was already getting in the mode to do it
[1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:14.320]  because of just how weird he acts all the things he does he won't investigate the leaks of this
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:18.240]  made up russia thing and they go oh my gosh you just admitted to obstruction of justice no
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:24.400]  he's so honest there is no russia deal he won't go after hillary for all of her russian stuff
[1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:28.320]  when it's all cut and dried that's what trump's saying and then of course the last straw
[1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:31.440]  was from my sources it wasn't the news until this weekend we reported last week
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:37.760]  was trump was really upset over the fact that comey sat there and said that he was crazy
[1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:42.880]  that obama was surveilling him when it's admitted and he talked to the house intelligence head and
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:46.160]  trump's the president he already knows all that information just can't release it because it's
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:50.400]  classified and knows that they were surveilled there's just nothing there so they keep using that
[1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:55.840]  wall of oh it's classified but oh we also didn't surveil them when they admitted they surveilled
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:01.360]  them this is a scandal the president has them caught with their pants down and the media
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:07.200]  wants to pretend like this never happened this never went on this never unfolded and so you've
[1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:13.440]  got the fbi director saying the president's crazy and he's nauseated mildly it's like half pregnant
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:19.280]  i'm mildly pregnant i'm mildly nauseous though that i might have helped trump this isn't just
[1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:24.880]  being neutral this is being a cheerleader against the president some little drama queen
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:31.680]  that wants to be popular with the corporate whore dying dinosaur media well and in all honesty um
[1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:37.920]  there's a lot of troubling things here but one of them is this notion of inconsistency there's no
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:44.240]  inconsistency between what the president said he had he was troubled about comey i think he made his
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:49.920]  decision trouble means there's a lot of problems right and now he gets a legal memo that gives him
[1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:55.680]  as most people use their loyals the legal justification for getting rid of him there's no inconsistency
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:19:00.800]  there this is a a shark fest by the master day after his surrogate say it all he goes and says
[1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:05.600]  what he really wants which is it because he's truthful and you you know him well people that
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:09.760]  know him well but he just he doesn't like teleprompters he feels like it's lying he doesn't have
[1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:17.520]  notes he just goes he's so truthful and he has not yet even got into the s sbc eight
[1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:24.880]  probably hsbc issue with this guy comey gives these guys a pass essentially on multi-billion
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:29.840]  dollar fraud and then he joins the board and he gets paid for it by them i mean this is this is
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:34.160]  well that's why trump knows what is it 80 some percent of the fbi absolutely hate comey that
[1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:37.760]  the client they're crying is a lie ready to go to break and come back and break all this down
[1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:44.720]  on the other side but the fbi is ready to expose comey the word is comey was compromised big time
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:50.400]  all that old lordy lordy i'm just your little preacher boy here 19 feet tall i love little
[1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:55.920]  little birdies that are in the trees no remember obama wanted comey what's that tell you about
[1:19:55.920 --> 1:20:02.240]  comey so comey wants to play around the fbi is gonna burn him we'll be right back loads are made

[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:39.680]  television saying trumps nixonian trump thinks he's above the law trumps committed all these
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:44.400]  crimes and misdemeanors they all wanted comey fired and i know you the audience gets this
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:49.920]  but we've got to understand the mindset of the left and the soros folks they had their world
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:54.160]  government they had everything they were flooding our borders with islamist they believe we would
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:58.720]  put up with anything they're telling us get rid of the genders band mother's day this is a cult of
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:04.240]  control they want to see what they can get you to do they want to make you as weak as possible
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:09.440]  these are social engineers so this is a short segment roger long segment coming up big picture
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:14.160]  from your sources how is the president doing i know he's angry i know he's upset that's good
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:19.920]  because we are in a total war they're never going to compromise they want to kill the idea of nationalism
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:25.440]  but but big picture i think we understand just how serious this death battle is
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.360]  some people bitching complain that trump can't deliver everything right away what do you expect
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:36.880]  we're in a total war we know he's good by his enemies i don't know how anybody could have expected
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:44.480]  that the president was going to undo 30 years of bad decisions in global government in a week
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:50.240]  or in you know we're in 100 days the 100 days thing's a phony measurement anyway he has an
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:57.600]  entrenched bureaucracy it is him alone fighting the world in washington he's surrounded by a hostile
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:02.880]  press corps he is surrounded by a hostile congress because if you take the liberal democrats
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:07.760]  and the yellow bellied establishment republicans they unfortunately are still a majority and by
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:14.400]  infiltrators and then he has made the mistake i think of opening the door to infiltrators
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:22.000]  in an attempt to get people of quality he's overlooked some of their anti-trump credentials
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:27.680]  why for example would we appoint k bailey hutcheson the former senator from texas a never
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:33.120]  trump or who made vicious attacks on donald trump to be the nato ambassador this makes
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:40.160]  no sense to me but that's who rex tell us in and his puppet master kandilisa rice are pushing for
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:44.640]  that job unbelievable it's just unbelievable and they lie to him about the health care bill he
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:48.400]  famously delegates they lie about him and notice now he met with ram paul said we'll have a better
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.800]  version ram paul help now a much better versions past the house it's showing like you always say
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:58.000]  you obsess on this point and now knowing you all over these years it's true when trump gets all the
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:03.440]  info he invariably makes the right decision the problem is they know to keep him away from all
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:10.720]  the info cloistered up in his little tower like repunzel well and only giving him partial information
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:17.200]  for example this issue of of terrorism and abbas who came to see him last week the president put
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:22.880]  the wood to him on his continuing subsidization of terrorism he cannot have a good relationship
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:30.960]  with this country but uh but i know for a fact that a memo outlining abbas's support for hamas
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:37.040]  and hezbollah and so on was kept from the president until he learned about it and demanded it so he
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:45.280]  is not being served well by his staff donald trump is essentially an army of one surrounded by mostly
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:50.640]  hostels the only people that i can see in the white house staff who are loyal to the president
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:57.760]  are keith schiller who is his longtime bodyguard and now in white house operations and hope hex
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:03.120]  who was the press secretary during the campaign those are the only two trump loyalists i can
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:09.040]  find alex i have known donald trump for 40 years i look at the white house staff list
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:15.520]  and i don't recognize any names virtually none and that's because the plan was keep all the
[1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:21.920]  obama people in first year put in republican establishment who then bring people so bad
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:26.480]  trump refuses them but they don't care because that keeps all the obama people in that it's
[1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:32.080]  exactly right so you have this stalemate because rince previs the president's chief of staff
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:39.040]  will not tell the cabinet members half of whom are not trump supporters anyway uh that these are
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:43.120]  the people you're going to hire here's the list this is who you're hiring these are the people
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:47.360]  that we have vetted these are the people we've determined are loyal to the president so the
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:52.720]  cabinet officers think their job is to go fill these jobs they go find people most of them
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:57.920]  establishment types not for trump they send them to the white house personnel office they get stopped
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:04.240]  there stalemate meanwhile the obama appointees sit there and they continue to leak and beaver
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:11.920]  away and beaver away at undoing everything we want to do we can't get control of the government
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:19.440]  this way and at the meantime we have probably the greatest danger which is the slow strangulation
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:24.640]  of the trump message by google sure facebook and twitter to try to let's talk about that when we
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:29.760]  come back but i want to be honest i'm really concerned because this is all great for radio
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:34.640]  but not great for my kids trump clearly you can see it you can also get it from the intel
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:38.560]  he's getting more and more pissed he means well he can't believe there's so many traders he can't
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:43.440]  believe no one will do what he says he can't believe that people are so out to get america
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:50.400]  and then even his base is just wanting instant ratification so i could see the some scenarios
[1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:57.280]  where the enemy wins let's roll through those when we come back on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[1:29:57.280 --> 1:30:06.400]  network the one belts one road international forum in beijing started on sunday and right
[1:30:06.400 --> 1:30:11.280]  now is in the second day regarding the latest norse korean missile test launch that happened on sunday
[1:30:11.280 --> 1:30:16.000]  putin said that it didn't pose a direct threat to russia but that missile tests are unacceptable
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:20.480]  and that these problems need to be solved peacefully and not through intimidating north korea but
[1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:26.720]  through returning to dialogue putin also commented on a so-called wanna cry the ransomware virus attack
[1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:31.760]  that hit computers across the world last week he said that malware created by intelligent services
[1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:36.640]  can backfire on its creators quote microsoft's management has made it clear that the virus
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:41.200]  originated from u.s. intelligence services and of quote putin said that last year washington
[1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:46.160]  refused russia's proposal on cyber security threats with the aim of drafting a bilateral
[1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:50.800]  agreement now regarding the forum's main intent putin said that the plan is for the greater
[1:30:50.800 --> 1:30:56.080]  eurasia not to just be an abstract geopolitical arrangement but a truly civilization-wide project
[1:30:56.080 --> 1:31:00.480]  looking toward the future which can be achieved through the spirit of cooperation this has been

[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:13.680]  problem is a lot of people act like they're trying to fight for the people they're not you can
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:18.240]  tell the whole world system is coming in simple wars because they know we're exposing the truth
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:23.920]  and donald trump is under attack because he wants prosperity and empowerment and americana worldwide
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:28.640]  not through force but through our greater ideas and our judo christian background
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.920]  my guest is roger stone in studio co-hosting i intend to open the phones up
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:38.000]  at the end of the hour right to the next hour with mike cernovich for your questions or roger
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.640]  stone mike cernovich and of course myself i don't normally say hey we have a rule today but
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:49.040]  i think it'll be interesting if we say we're taking questions i do that maybe three or four
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:53.280]  times a year but we're going to take questions for roger stone just like washington journal does
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:57.680]  questions for mike cernovich and questions for myself in fact here's the number eight hundred
[1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:03.440]  two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one is the toll
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:07.760]  free number eight hundred two five nine nine two three one oh we can go to a lot of calls once we go
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:15.840]  to him uh briefly i noticed that donald trump shirts we were selling about 500 a day until about
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:21.040]  his 70th day in office they started going a little bit sideways went down to maybe 30 40 50 a day
[1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:26.880]  i noticed since he fired comey this is a great bellwether we're selling like 150 a day so i'm
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:32.960]  not doing these at cost to unload them even though these are limited edition shirts i am selling these
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:40.400]  shirts these three shirts at cost 495 in fact if it's an xx seller bigger we actually lose money
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:44.480]  they cost us like six dollars seven dollars depending on the size of the shirt there's more fabric
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:51.360]  keeping america grading in in four wars dot com's on the back on the front navy blue beautiful
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:57.520]  right arm in four wars dot com trump is my president america first in 1776 this is about
[1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:02.240]  meeting like-minded people it's about triggering anti-free speech folks that are out there it's
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:07.920]  about taking action so we've got trump is my president new navy blue style we've got trump
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:16.880]  pinch keeping america grading in within four wars dot com on the back as well america first in 1776
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:22.320]  on the back we have another that says trump is my president 45th president of the united states
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:28.080]  america first since 1776 and then on the back it has a another message keeping america great
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:34.000]  in four wars dot com so if you want to stand up against these bullies they get triggered and freak

[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:42.560]  videotape libtards attacking it whatever the case is i want to give it to your mom and your dad or
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:49.440]  son your daughter it's 495 and quite frankly you add that together because the smaller shirts cost
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:55.920]  495 the bigger ones cost 595 695 it goes up xxxx sells like seven bucks or something i don't care
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:04.560]  this is a loss leader 5.0 review on all these shirts we also have the limited edition make america
[1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:13.200]  great again uh poster color poster put out by a top artist only a thousand of those were printed
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:18.960]  and they will probably sell out by tomorrow and then we will never put another out it is again
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:25.520]  limited time special uh on that and when it's gone it is gone for eternity we also have some
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:31.120]  big specials 25 off the entire family of alexa pure water filtration systems if you're not filtering
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:35.520]  your water with a gravity fed system i think you're personally absolutely crazy and uh quite
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:41.200]  frankly uh they ended up making too many water filters for the score uh they already have such
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:45.200]  small margins because they're competitive at alexa pure and it is one of the best gravity
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:50.480]  fed filters out there stainless steel you name it but normally they'll sell one of their six or seven
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:55.680]  units at a lower price this is everything 25 percent off it's not like some of the big companies that
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:38:00.160]  raise the price one week and lower the maximum people you can go look when you're getting
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:06.720]  gravity fed water filtration systems for $59 for the smallest units and 140 for you know 180 for
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:12.720]  the biggest units uh you just cannot beat it at $147 for one of their larger units so info
[1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:18.000]  work store dot com info wars life dot com and that's how free market works you know they came
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:22.160]  business said yeah we've got too many of these for the quarter and uh you know the folks that
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:27.520]  own the company uh really want to offload these so we're ready to give them to you yet basically
[1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:31.840]  a loss for them it's it's it's not quite a loss but it's almost a loss so you've never gotten a
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:36.720]  gravity fed filter personally i don't know why there's so much stuff in the in the well water
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:42.160]  in the tap water you name it this cuts everything out but the good minerals you need it reduces
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:46.800]  everything like 9999 or completely takes it out all the studies are there we've got four
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:50.160]  different companies we carry they're all apples and oranges some of them are better at this and
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:54.560]  better at that but it reduces it all to non-detectable levels or completely takes it out we've got a
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:58.640]  lot of new systems as well some new three-stage systems that are so new they haven't been reviewed
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:03.280]  yet but that doesn't mean they're not highly reviewed out there and this is a political movement
[1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:09.280]  and it takes money to win wars and so we've got products you need at very affordable prices
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:14.560]  and infowarstore.com so please check that out today we have the pro pure scout again for $99

[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:26.400]  going to end up in the smithsonian i gotta tell you the president's commented on this to me twice
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:33.120]  when he sees patriots like the big rally in uh in um in the harrisburg a couple weeks ago people
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:39.840]  wearing the hillary for prison 2016 and 2017 t-shirts the trump is my president shirts the red
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:46.080]  ones it energizes him you're a one-man walking billboard with these on standing up for freedom
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:51.280]  and helping the fight so i gave them i bought a bunch of them gave them away to family and friends
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:57.120]  it's a great gift uh and and frankly it helps push the revolution so i recommend it well thank
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:01.120]  you for the support and you know we're trying to expand here to go to like 18 hours a day live tv
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.240]  radio it's really going to be the new fox news but the libertarian true americana fox news and
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:10.800]  it's kind of metaphysical as fox news really begins to die to be taken over to be put out to
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:14.720]  pasture by the globalist i know you have the inside baseball and that don't even get into it
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:20.160]  you know new new libertarianism is rising to replace that vacuum so folks support now is more
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:26.960]  important than ever well you're exactly right fox is imploding and it is only a matter of time uh
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:34.560]  for your favorites whether it's sean hannity or judge janine piero or judge andrew napolitano the
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:41.600]  real patriots on fox it's only a matter of time before they are squeezed out uh and fox goes the
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:48.880]  way of the sky channel this is what the murdoch sons have in mind and now for the first time
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:54.960]  they're prepared to sacrifice profitability uh for political experience we're talking a billion
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:41:00.480]  dollars a year and and can you you know you have the inside baseball i mean look roger ailes who
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:06.480]  is a great man uh and who is innocent of these bogus charges of sexual harassment against him
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:11.600]  which i think are completely propped up to get him out of there before the election because they
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:16.640]  knew that he opposed uh it was an admitted coup i mean that's that's been the liberal news and the
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:21.200]  bell i don't like bill o'reilly but he settled all that stuff this was all just go out responses
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.280]  and organize deal if they can take him out they can take us all out well and what bothers me in
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:32.480]  this particular case is that megyn kelly testified in this matter uh and her testimony was benign
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:38.880]  when it comes to uh roger ailes and then after the murdochs gave her an 11 million dollar book deal
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:47.600]  well then uh her testimony changed uh and uh this is this is bogus the point is ails built a billion
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:52.720]  dollar money machine that was a conservative powerhouse and now the murdoch you know are
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:58.400]  deconstructing it fox is about a billion and a half a year unbelievable unbelievable it's a tragedy
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:04.480]  really because what ails built was very great but those listeners those viewers they're moving
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:09.280]  to info wars well i mean look here's the bottom line they have to kill anything even if it's
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:14.560]  libertarian oid or christian oid even if it's kind of a facsimile and a system murdoch had to try to
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:19.120]  control the conservative movement the republican establishment doesn't control it the tea party
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:24.080]  the libertarian insurrection the ron paul insurrection the roger stone insurrection the
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:29.440]  the the matt drudge insurrection the alex jones insurrection it's taken over the republican party
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:35.520]  to a great extent the freedom caucus is taking over and so now there's no point when newscores
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:39.600]  make in 50 million a year on its other properties so what if the conservative thing's making them
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:44.560]  a billion plus they have to kill it to try to bring something out of vogue well good luck
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:48.560]  you're only chopping your nose off to spite your face i don't sit there and celebrate
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:54.880]  the fall of fox news as if i'm going to get bigger by its fall i was there the entire time as a true
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:43:00.720]  purist wanting to hit the barbwire wanting to be demonized wanting to be attacked to make it safer
[1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:06.720]  for other people to pick up my truth-based talking points to restore the republic and so
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:11.280]  i've done my job i've had bigger success i never thought i would have but i'd studied history
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:17.680]  and what other bomb throwers like patrick henry and sam adams had gone through and so they're
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:22.240]  not trying to openly kill me every day like they were those guys i'm just they're just killing my
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:26.800]  name and trying to destroy my family and that's bad enough but in the final equation we're having
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:31.040]  devastating victories and if the audience just realizes you're part of this and i don't just
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:36.320]  say that as a pat on the head you are the heart of it that that yeah we're destroying the globalists
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:41.360]  we're wrecking them they're in total collapse they're starting to strike back though so we
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:46.400]  don't have a period victory where we defeat them but where our greatest leaders are then destroyed
[1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:51.760]  and the process if you breathe life into us like god took dust up from the earth
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:57.600]  and blasted it out of his nostrils we are invincible when you pray for us when you
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:02.560]  spread our articles and videos and when you financially buy products and we make it easy
[1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:07.760]  because we bring you the very best so it's a it's a win-win this is true texas hospitality
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:12.720]  taking globally right now you know the go talking to fox one of the most interesting things here
[1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:19.200]  alex is the way tucker carlson has emerged as a star tucker carlson a libertarian tucker carlson
[1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:24.000]  we had dinner with him we had dinner with him in in cleveland he is a big fan of info wars
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:29.040]  so uh what happens to that show which is knocking him dead on ratings remains to be seen because
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:34.480]  he's a clear thinker he has been very pro trombone there's anybody a slick on their feet as he is
[1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:39.520]  live no and he dissembles the the left when he has them as guests it's really extraordinary he
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:44.000]  butchers them like the movie spartakas when he just cuts up the four guys in like five seconds yes
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:50.560]  it's very much like that and by the way he's great in the netflix documentary get me roger stone
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:53.520]  he's very very good we're going to talk about that some of the next hour and we're also going to take
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:58.480]  calls let let me raise this for you roger since you bring up meghan kelly meghan kelly calls last
[1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:02.640]  week and then i'm like yeah i'll talk to her next week no not that i was a big fish or anything
[1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:05.680]  i'm just like i'm sure she's one of the weekend and nico calls me on saturday morning he goes no
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:10.400]  she wants to talk today anytime you want so i call her she doesn't answer she calls back
[1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:14.560]  10 minutes later i'm driving in the car and i said let me get to the office so you can have
[1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:20.560]  a nice discussion we had like a 40 minute discussion total and again it's meghan kelly i
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:25.440]  watched her on tv you know girl next door lawyer next door real smart and on the phone she's really
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:29.760]  impressive but she said twice this is off record right so i'm not going to get into the on record
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:36.320]  but just let me tell you i'm not stupid okay so when a good looking girl sitting there telling you
[1:45:36.320 --> 1:45:42.160]  you know um that's like i mean i'm kind of scared of her now because let me tell you she's a really
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:46.800]  smart lady a good looking lady and she's sitting there going your number one on my list alex i'm
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:51.120]  kind of obsessed with you oh i'm sorry this is off record uh you know alex i gotta have this interview
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:55.680]  alex and you know we're gonna do this interview alex and it's gonna happen and it's gonna be good
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:59.680]  and you're gonna like it and you know i pledged to you it's gonna be real and i'm gonna let you
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:03.360]  talk it was in the hit piece alex and i'm gonna stop right there because the rest is off record
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:08.480]  but i was just like even though i knew i was being sold by the greatest used car salesman on earth
[1:46:08.480 --> 1:46:12.640]  i thought pt barnum had been reincarnated right in front of me well i wanted just the
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:19.680]  experience of her coming to austin and the rest of stuff she said to me i mean the twilight zone
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:25.280]  i've entered man is the next level what the hell is she like behind the scenes this was crazy look
[1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:31.360]  she was very very nice to me uh even when she was at war with uh donald trump uh she did afford
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:37.680]  me an opportunity to go on her program numerous times to defend donald trump so there was some
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:47.280]  balance uh and then suddenly um i was frozen uh and uh she then is out repeating the talking
[1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:55.280]  points about the dna uh test of danie williams bill's uh abandoned illegitimate son uh proving
[1:46:55.280 --> 1:47:00.800]  that that was untrue in 1988 which by the way the box show probably won the election that that's
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:07.360]  a lie so uh and she's been in communicato since then so you may be on her list today alex but
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:12.320]  who knows if you'll be on her list tomorrow yeah well it's not that big a deal because
[1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:19.840]  we get about it all these big shows my big thing is it's just so twilight zone she's very charming
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:24.320]  oh yes she's very charming she's very intelligent she's very beautiful yeah i mean on the phone with
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:29.280]  her she's very good on i couldn't say no to her the whole point even though i knew that it's like
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:34.320]  i'm not an idiot you know and well it does smell like a set up to me let me just say that and i'm
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:40.960]  not the paranoid type but uh abc doing a favorable piece on alex jones why do i think it's NBC uh
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:45.840]  it pardon me NBC it's what i meant why do i doubt that i don't know why do i doubt that nightline
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:50.320]  did a halfway favorable piece i mean it was negative but it wasn't like really nasty spirited
[1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:54.640]  then the host of nightline whatever his name is now he's an abc nightly news guy he's a pretty
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:59.200]  good guy he should be on the 700 club before that what's his name he actually we went to dinner
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:05.200]  and stuff and it wasn't even off record he was like pretty he goes don't worry and you know
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:07.840]  they want me to tear you live in hell out of you but i know a lot of this stuff's true and i'm a
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:12.720]  patriot i'm a christian alex and i got a family and we went to like some steakhouse and i'd be
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:16.640]  careful you get the guy fired yeah i don't want to get him fired actually he didn't say it was
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:20.640]  off the record by the way i didn't tell anybody the real off the record something yeah because i
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:25.440]  said well i mean i gotta tell folks you've called me up and you don't want me to do this oh obviously
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:30.960]  they've told her mount his head on the wall yes but but she also knows she also knows you attack
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:35.760]  alex jones it'll be everywhere i mean you know if she gets the alex jones interview and that's not
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:40.080]  a power trip but how have we gotten to where they've been ignoring me forever and now they want it
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:43.680]  it's like it's the coveted interview because i won't do the interviews anymore because i can't
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:48.160]  be in a room alone with these journalists they will make stuff up ironically her attacks on
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:53.840]  donald trump uh while they may have made her and gave her great financial opportunity to jump to one
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:57.680]  of the nation get harder and destroy her it destroyed fox no it destroyed fox that's right
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:02.720]  fox was shocked when they found out that their listeners were outraged at her treatment their
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:08.080]  key demographics went down by 40 plus percent and i can tell you this right now their overall
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:14.000]  listenership their overall viewership is down 30 percent 30 percent that's almost a third and
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:19.440]  certain people that created fox can't believe their control demoing it's they're destroying
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:27.120]  what was what can't we just why doesn't uh yeah we can't we can't tell people no but look they're
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:32.560]  destroying they're destroying their brand uh and it's a it's a tragedy they're they're committing
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:38.240]  harry carry sepica yes because it is one of the great success stories in modern communications
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:43.120]  what roger ailes bill and they're deconstructing it because it's politically incorrect and because
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:48.320]  let's face it the murdoch boys want to be well liked and well treated when they go to the upper
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:53.120]  west side new york cocktail party by the way it was dan harris from nightline that's right and dan
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:59.840]  harris was like good guy he wasn't he is a good guy oh you know i know of him and he has an excellent
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:07.040]  reputation for fairness he was i yeah there's a few people in the national meeting so let me ask

[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:29.200]  megan kelly is really putting it on heavy to get me to she thinks i'm a texas hillbilly and
[1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:32.880]  you know that a hot woman telling me how much you know she wants to interview me and how she's
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:36.560]  obsessed with me i'll get me to talk to her and even though i know it was bs it still works i'm
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:40.880]  going to be doing an interview a little bit of the difference here all right i'm being sarcastic

[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:53.360]  went out and not do the megan kelly interview but she's gonna come to me i actually think you
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:57.280]  should do it because you can handle her and because you understand the game uh and you're
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:01.440]  very good i should i put her over my knee i don't think she'll let you do that but i do think you
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:06.080]  should you should do the show because anything allows you to break through to the mainstream
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:11.200]  but if i put it over my knee would you no i'm not gonna i'm not going there i'm not going no

[1:56:55.280 --> 1:56:58.240]  that all right we're going to call us in a minute but since i said that we're gonna go to matt when
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:06.080]  come back in the next hour but but but but being serious you understand it's what you said you're
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:11.120]  not really a villain but they call you that's you play into it why not they just don't get it they
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:15.440]  don't know we're thinking their ass i don't really see any way we can lose if trump stays the course
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:21.280]  and they don't kill him what do you think well i thought long and hard about why netflix would make
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:27.520]  a documentary on me that would be fair i mean and then i figured it out you see they think
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:34.400]  president trump will fail and they make a case not accurate but uh but that that i elected
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:40.240]  trump therefore i'm the man to blame they want me to be as hated as carl rove what they don't
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:47.040]  understand is donald trump is going to succeed he's going to be he's going to be a transformational
[1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:54.080]  president he can go down with with washington and lincoln with the greats that's right they
[1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:59.600]  don't get it they're betting against the spirit of america which no one's defeated it's exactly right
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:05.280]  so you have another ronald reagan perhaps even potentially greater in down front i think already
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:11.280]  because he's independent because he's gutsy because he's bold you can't bully him you can't buy him
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:17.120]  he doesn't owe anybody uh and his gut instincts are almost always right and that's not high that's
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:21.520]  really happening that's why they're so terrified that's exactly you know a man by his enemies i
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:28.720]  promise matt gary stewart donna mic and others straight ahead 800 at 25 a 99231 roger stone in

[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:39.920]  i don't even care that you've got all these contacts and stuff that's like a side issue
[2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:44.240]  i like you well i appreciate that look at the best thing to come out of this is that the
[2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:51.760]  mainstream media ban at msnbc and cnn has been broken how do you like that david brock oh yeah
[2:00:51.760 --> 2:00:56.720]  you're all over tv now so uh you know and i i do think it is important to get out there in the
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:01.520]  mainstream when you have the opportunity uh because of the way they're you know censoring
[2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:06.640]  and trying to choke off alternative isn't that a stone rule that never turned on television well
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:12.800]  let's be specific never pass up the opportunity to have sex or be on television stones rules which i
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:17.680]  borrowed from gore vidal but it's still true that is a gore vidal it is you know gore vidal
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:22.720]  like the show uh he uh he has a great quote where he said i'm not a conspiracy theorist i'm a
[2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:28.800]  conspiracy realist he knew the federal government doesn't tell us the truth he knew you had to be
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:33.120]  skeptical of anything coming out of mainstream you know i think gore vidal would have been a
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:38.560]  trump supporter seriously the anti-establishment all of he liked to wreck things well the social
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:44.320]  parts of that may have been problematic but it's possible certainly possible but he was that much
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:51.840]  of a rebel he was a rebel also a great writer uh and no but i mean gore vidal could do any show he
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:55.840]  wanted he would seek out coming on my show and then once there was this theater i was going to
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:01:58.800]  interview him at it and they wouldn't let him do it because there was a union there and there's a
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:02.480]  union and he said screw you i'll cancel the show and then he went out back into the interview out
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:08.240]  out in the alley yeah he was he was a very interesting guy very interesting how did al gord
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:13.200]  like fall so fall from far from the trailer well and the kennedys you know cut him loose because he
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:19.520]  was a cousin of jackie kennedy by marriage and he'd run for congress in the mid hudson valley in
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:27.040]  new york as a john kennedy supporter but bobby hated him and bobby cut him out and then he became a
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:33.360]  fierce critic of the kennedys after that all right let's take the first phone call i apologize to
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:40.720]  matt for having to hold matt you're on the air from ohio yes uh can you hear me clearly yes go ahead

[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:07.040]  to make it look like we haven't been taken over absolutely and now there's a beach had to retake
[2:03:07.040 --> 2:03:11.280]  it oh i totally hell i read stuff from the 60s where the cia thought they'd already captured the
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:18.400]  country roger this is a great question yeah here's the proof bush clinton bush obama identical
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:24.480]  that's not what they told you in the election of course but their policies have been a dental it
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:29.520]  doesn't matter where the deck chairs are it's the people behind the scenes are the same people calling
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:37.360]  the shots and now suddenly we have a president who's not a puppet who won't take orders who won't do as
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:43.760]  he's told because he loves the country because he's a patriot because he wants to return us to the
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:50.560]  greatness that we've experienced that's why they are so frantic to discredit him yeah i mean it folks

[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:15.520]  and by the way just in case there was a problem the puppet masters had this all figured out they
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:21.760]  had jeb bush is the republican nominee you'd have hillary as the democratic nominee and the american
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:27.280]  people would be the loser no matter who won and then along came a guy to upset this apple cart
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:34.240]  donald j trump and they're frantic about the fact that he is uncontrollable he doesn't take orders
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:39.600]  from anybody he believes that he is only insurable to the american people and that's why they're

[2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:08.320]  wars has a lot of great sources too we broke last week what's going on with uh trump being ready for
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:12.480]  big purge and that's all the news today and of course tone has a lot of great sources but a lot
[2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:17.360]  of great research as well but mainstream media attacks us constantly saying shut us down or they
[2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:22.800]  use satire or jokes you know we talk about is some way to try to bring us down it's not working so
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:27.920]  where do they go what do they do now and what's the next shoe to drop and then we're going to take
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:32.720]  phone calls from gary dean steward donna mike and others here in a minute we have questions for

[2:09:41.040 --> 2:09:46.480]  mike sternovich thank you so much for coming on with us again always a pleasure ox you got cut off
[2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:51.120]  yesterday's really had you on for like 20 minutes there's a lot of other breaking stuff you have
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:55.680]  before we take some of these calls uh what's on your radar screen then i'm going to ask you
[2:09:57.360 --> 2:10:00.080]  just about the state of the world right now and where you think all this is going
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:07.760]  yeah the trump is still playing mind games with rince previs and of course um sean spicer which
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:12.960]  paul joseph watson you reported i reported we had that story last week where we said trump
[2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:18.240]  is pushing spicer on the way out because he's not aggressive enough he's not ferocious enough
[2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:25.280]  and then sure enough that is now all over you know the mainstream media exact headline right exactly
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:31.200]  exactly so he's looking to do a big shake up because trump is telling people multiple sources
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:36.800]  have confirmed with me he goes why aren't you guys fighting harder he used that exact word is
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:44.640]  why isn't anybody fighting hard and he's realizing that his own team they're leaking news to the media
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:50.160]  there was an article today in politico i think i don't know i'll text nico the link but everybody
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:55.440]  blabber mouth to trump about his news diet and they called it fake news diet and then they tried
[2:10:55.440 --> 2:11:01.600]  to frame katie mcfarland and claimed that she gave trump a fake a fake news magazine cover from
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:07.200]  time magazine that actually never happened katie mcfarland is a brilliant woman amazing strategist
[2:11:07.920 --> 2:11:13.760]  so what is happening now is McMaster planted that little detail into the fake news media to try to
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:19.360]  look katie mcfarland look bad because as you know which i reported quicker than everybody else
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:25.040]  ricky waddell who's a warmonger with oil ties in venezuela and he actually wants to bring
[2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:30.000]  soldiers into venezuela to protect his oil investments his oil friends ricky waddell is
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:35.840]  per placing katie mcfarland right so all these leaks are coming out and trump is really frustrated
[2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:41.280]  because he wants to know why his team isn't fighting as hard as roger stone is as hard as alex jones
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:46.400]  is and i think that's a great question maybe i would like to ask roger is why is it that the only
[2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:52.400]  people fighting for trump are people on social media and people like you and alex well it's the
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:58.160]  nature of these establishment republicans i mean once they're inside the fore um you know that
[2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:03.120]  danger was always there if you wouldn't fight for trump when he was the nominee why would you
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:08.800]  fight for him when he's the president not only that but in all honesty moderate republicans
[2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:14.080]  never fight they like cocktail parties they don't like you know they don't like combat i was about
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:18.000]  to say you bring in a bunch of conformist and your own enemies that just want to have feathered
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:23.520]  nest and feel like they're part of the establishment there instead of trailblazing we want trailblazers
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:30.880]  we want revolutionaries but it's you see instead of uh of fighting they want to moderate
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:36.640]  the president instead of selling the product they want to change the product trump is who he is
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:40.240]  that's not and by the way i got to give credit to certain of which he was the first to say that
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:45.200]  trump couldn't stand McMaster out of the gates that you can ferment later by other sources
[2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:50.240]  and he was the first to say McMaster just hired a new general to be his aid to camp without even
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:55.680]  consulting congress or the president it's just all this rogue arrogance where they yes man to the
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:12:59.760]  president's face and the new and then do whatever they want so here's the key i'm going to ask this
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:04.400]  question i have a good story too yeah yeah go ahead go ahead but i did have something i wanted
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:08.320]  to talk about McMaster but no if you break that and then i'm gonna bring up this thing about
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:12.880]  the trump listens and and others do what he should do in the shakeup dealing with the press
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:16.240]  because i wanted to raise that last hour but now that we're all here we'll do it and then go to
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:21.440]  call so go ahead and hit McMaster the national security advisor so i talked to roger stone on
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:28.720]  his great podcast is don't call truth that trumps plan was to get McMaster his four star the pentagon
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:34.240]  is actually dragging at speed on that this is breaking news they can't stand him in the army
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:39.920]  they don't want him back doing more active duty army type stuff and they're stalling the plan to
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:46.560]  give him his four star because i and i quote multiple pentagon sources said McMaster is unfit to leave
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:51.520]  that is a direct quote so the question is if he's unfit to lead in the army why is he head of the
[2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:56.480]  national security council so that is breaking news he was supposed to get that four star but the
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:01.840]  pentagon multiple sources and the pentagon have confirmed to me said we don't want him compromised
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:07.760]  or he always claims that he should be in command or his dereliction of duty right so they they said
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:14.160]  and this is a direct quote McMaster is unfit to lead he's unfit to serve and that really and it
[2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:19.520]  says it all and they're they're also they give a head of why he's unfit well he's a warmonger they
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:25.840]  all he knows is let's drop in tanks and bomb people and blow people up and destroy things and he
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:31.360]  doesn't understand four generation warfare he doesn't understand why he's always claiming he's an
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:37.200]  expert in four generation warfare and humed and capturing hearts and minds yeah he is not
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:42.400]  that's the thing and he dismisses it he's actually said we don't have time for that four generation
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:49.040]  warfare nonsense even though as you know the information war is about hey work there's 1.5
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:55.120]  billion Muslims in the world that is the reality we have to find a way to make them more like
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:59.520]  Christians to make them more yeah they've got a reform they've got to have a Martin Luther
[2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:04.080]  instead of us reforming and putting a jibz on exactly we're not changing so either stay in
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:09.920]  your desert hellhole or stop killing us go ahead right in the flip side of that is we need to put
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:14.640]  blowing up their homes too because that is only going to ferment more that's the globalist plan
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:21.120]  is to stir them up exactly yeah that's what McMaster is doing is he wants to go in blow people up
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:27.280]  destroy their lives then you create a refugee crisis then you say we have to use this which
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:32.960]  is a UN plan right exactly then we have to let them in and they say oh how can we not let them in
[2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:37.760]  these people are suffering well if we are never blown up their countries like McMaster wants to do
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:44.240]  so we need to focus more on propaganda scyops telling these moderate making them moderate
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:50.960]  scyops promoting real free market and good stuff soft power scyops that are truthful the ones that
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:55.120]  work yeah let's just go in there and give them coca cola i mean the point is that they need to
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:16:00.240]  understand that we have a better mousetrap that their lives would be better if they open the door
[2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:05.440]  to a relationship for the first time we have an enemy unlike any we've had their face to prepare
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:10.960]  to kill themselves but more importantly we'll kill us if we don't see things their way that's
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:18.160]  outrageous how does a council on foreign relations member like McMaster get this job to begin with
[2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:22.720]  there's the real well let's explain it's worse than it's worse than that brilliant they decided
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:29.920]  them coca cola we should instead of bombing them we should drop the best of american capitalism to them
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:34.960]  refrigeration i pass i'm right give them refrigerators that's going to do way more than
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:39.920]  drop bombs on them drop refrigerators on there then they realize oh hey this is actually pretty good
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:44.960]  why don't we build our homes up well let's go further let's go further let me stop there's the
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:49.360]  globalists in their own writings admit they want to put the most radical muslims in to destabilize
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:54.320]  things then use them as a force to bring down the west and bring in a police state in a response to
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:59.680]  them so it's it's an anti-civilization killing system that's what globalism is it's not that the
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:04.400]  elites are dumb bringing in incompatible radical muslims the arab spring by google and facebook
[2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:09.120]  and twitter and the elites and the liberals was their arab spring that al gore said he wanted
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:14.880]  here they're going to use the muslims as their shock force that's the issue but but really the
[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:21.520]  question is does mcmaster understand that donald trump was elected president as a non-interventionist
[2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:28.560]  does anybody around him understand what he ran on they were mcmaster uh in madis are in there
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:34.560]  advocating 150 000 troops be put in right after the surgical strike that would have been the
[2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:40.880]  functional end of trumpism as we know it i don't think these people know what he ran on i totally
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:45.120]  agree i want to take calls i want to get lose the farce for the trees but at the bottom of the hour
[2:17:45.120 --> 2:17:51.280]  we're going to get into what should trump do it a shake up with the press instead of saying get rid
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:57.280]  of press conferences just have your own press announcements and don't even have press there
[2:17:57.280 --> 2:18:01.920]  instead of having a written statement have it a person talks you have a presentation you have
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:07.600]  videos like m4s would do imagine the president did this the president is fireside chats twice a week
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:12.640]  so he isn't overwhelmed they do press conferences every two weeks but then they have informationals
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:18.960]  not just with you could still keep people like spicer on but you'd also then bring in huckabee or
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:24.160]  you bring in uh guillfoil and then you'd have people whenever they're ready with a key point
[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:29.040]  on twitter on facebook on youtube on whatever and with briefings to hit them where we're hitting
[2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:33.920]  them they've got to tune into us we totally take it away you don't just ignore them or say oh you're
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:38.560]  so fake you're so adversarial we're not going to have these meetings now with you you don't you know
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:44.640]  you just have meetings 24 hours a day and annihilate them i guarantee you within seven days if i had
[2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:50.240]  that pulpit it would be devastation for the enemy i would lay out all their lies i would annihilate
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:54.480]  their frauds i'd say who owned them i would go over all the facts i would list what the president
[2:18:54.480 --> 2:19:01.120]  did and how they're trying to stop that message it would be victory well because it needs to be proactive
[2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:06.320]  that's the whole problem of their communications shop they're so hung up taking in the incoming attacks
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:10.560]  on trump and trying to pair they've got to get on the offense instead of the defense exactly right
[2:19:11.280 --> 2:19:15.200]  sternovich can we do this network just one more i'm not gonna be more for the whole week i promise
[2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:18.320]  skip this break the more times take calls but certainly we're trying to jump in there we'll
[2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:21.520]  do it at the bottom of the hour i promise let's all organize i want to take some calls right now
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:26.240]  but i'm telling you it's not like we're just saying this little rag tag operations we're
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:31.520]  devastating them the president already sees half his supporters at rallies or info wars if he
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:36.720]  is he already knows what you're doing what rogers doing if he simply gets out of defense and goes on
[2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:44.480]  offense it's over well i actually told my wife's parents they watched get me rogers stone because
[2:19:44.480 --> 2:19:49.120]  they always go what is it that sternovich does why do i see him in my facebook feed all the time
[2:19:49.120 --> 2:19:54.080]  why does everybody who knows me at the bank say hey how's michael doing what's michael doing
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:58.640]  so they actually watched get me rogers stone because we were all there together but we were
[2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:04.560]  like in a parallel world at the time we had united joined forces where we were at the r and c covering
[2:20:04.560 --> 2:20:09.440]  the course of protesters were fake you know you were there at the megaphone black lives matter was
[2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:14.480]  was attacking you think about what we do three men and of course with all the people listening
[2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:19.440]  and helping we don't have a billion dollar could you imagine if we had a billion dollar budget
[2:20:19.440 --> 2:20:25.120]  even a hundred million dollar kind of devastation that we would have yeah no we're living off the
[2:20:25.120 --> 2:20:29.840]  land and google has got billions of dollars with which to cry and they always need to know the
[2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:34.560]  empire is striking back we blow up the death star we're now under attack if you simply support us
[2:20:34.560 --> 2:20:39.600]  now more than ever and take action yourself we're going to win it's the best reason to go to the
[2:20:39.600 --> 2:20:44.480]  info wars the store dot com that i can think of and then spread stone cold truth dot com and the
[2:20:44.480 --> 2:20:48.480]  websites of cernovich the twitter it's just it's a war it's fun i don't want to lose
[2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:52.800]  we're promoting freedom america it's not like we're promoting north korea the democrats are
[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:56.480]  promoting north korea the republic established there are a bunch of yes men and cowards that
[2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:02.320]  want to socially climb an organization we want to overturn the fake globalist paradigm it's a
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:08.320]  face sucker on america we don't want to ascend the end of the face suckers belly and be some
[2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:12.720]  turd floating around its belly we want to kill the face sucker we want to remove it we want to
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:17.920]  restore the republic we want to put up washington monuments 20 times bigger that are space elevators
[2:21:17.920 --> 2:21:24.400]  hailing our victory over the globalist we want victory mcmaster had even said and i broke that
[2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:31.280]  story that he's trying to remake the nsc to the democrats we call it make the nsc democrat again
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:36.560]  he had said we need to i quote professionalize the national security council and that will
[2:21:36.560 --> 2:21:40.800]  mean bringing in more democrats and liberals so what they're doing is they're pulling the
[2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:46.320]  security clearances of pro trump people and they're bringing in more democrats bringing in
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:50.720]  gather circling the wagons telling trump we'll compromise we'll let you make a merit rating
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:54.480]  we'll let you cut taxes when all they're doing is preparing his destruction like a bunch of

[2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:01.120]  that moves my heart this is spiritual warfare that we're waging against people and you can't let
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:05.520]  them get you down sweetheart even though they're evil and horrible we're starting to win so be
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:11.040]  positive right that's what they want to do is they but what a lot of people don't understand is like
[2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:16.480]  the hope with the occult magic that they believe in it isn't enough that they win and they get more
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:21.040]  money and they get more slaves and they can buy more children from haydie but that isn't enough
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:26.320]  they want to destroy your spirit because they're they're death eaters they are a death cult so that
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:32.080]  is why you have to take care of yourself um keep your spirit high pray they're like senators but
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:38.560]  they they they just live off of it right so they want you when so if they if they get you down and
[2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:43.600]  that's why they're trying to to drive info wars into bankruptcy and trying to ruin alexis it
[2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:48.720]  isn't enough that they have everything they want to see people grovel and death that's why they want
[2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:53.840]  north korea or venezuela they want you poor that's their religion while they claim they love you all
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:58.640]  day and you grovel to them they gravitate to the most poorest populations they can get the control
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:04.880]  great points this is the outrageousness of the of the of the story of the bushes in the clintons
[2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:11.600]  while their policies made america weaker and made the people poorer they and their cronies have made
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:16.720]  hundreds of millions of dollars these are crony capitalist these are thieves is what they are
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:20.000]  we're gonna take a ton of calls is a lot color i was about to go to just hung up we're gonna go to
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:24.160]  steward we're gonna go to mike we're gonna go to everybody right now steward in canada you're on the

[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:58.320]  you have to double down and we're gonna absolutely crush the globalist i'm on twitter i'm not on
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:04.160]  facebook but i can see it the bell whether the atmosphere we're winning and that lady that was
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:09.440]  calling in uh yeah don't be discouraged at all you've got so many people backing you up all
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:14.400]  over this planet i'm in canada here and we're not gonna let exactly look at the elites everywhere
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:21.520]  panicking they can feel the spirit of awakening rising i wanted to mention uh you're well your
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:26.960]  first caller he called in and he said do you think uh the globalists are are trying to make it look
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:31.520]  like they're not actually taking us over and it kind of dovetailed with what i why i originally
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:38.160]  called in i and i might be i hope i'm not semantical in saying this but i've always i've never liked
[2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:43.040]  to use the term the new world order just because bush senior used that and i always wonder why would
[2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:49.760]  he go on national television and say the new world order you know when when it's like um when i'm
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:55.760]  thinking it doesn't just go back to the roman empire and what did happen to the roman empire anyways
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:27:00.400]  and so i look at this as it's not the new world order it's the old world order and this is the
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:05.760]  old games that they've always played and yes they did hijack america to another caller exactly the
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:11.360]  root of true renaissance is the real new world order of human empowerment so they create a
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:16.640]  false new order sorry but the real the reason that george bush george hw bush popped out and said that
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:22.320]  is he's always had this propensity to read the stage directions he's not ronald reagan he was never
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:27.760]  very talented so you might remember when he went to new hampshire and a sour economy one of his
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:32.480]  handlers said well the main reason we're going up there mr president is to tell people that you care
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:39.360]  he gets on stage and he says message i care and he sits down the guy had no talent he had a tin
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:45.840]  ear he still does and he blurted it right out the new world order there it is well steward's
[2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:49.600]  an exciting caller and come back with a comment on that steward but mike service is what you were
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:54.800]  just hitting on we're not just cheerleading here the globalist are panning panicking the paradigm
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:58.320]  is shifting incredibly positive things are happening they're hitting us with everything
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:04.480]  they've got to tell us we're losing because it's the opposite exactly it's a sigh of the running
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:09.760]  on the people that's why they closed comments that's why they want to ban info wars from youtube and
[2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:15.840]  google and facebook and everywhere else because people want to feel connected and they want you
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:21.680]  to feel isolated and alone so you got to realize it was all a sign up i mean i was with dallas and
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:26.720]  austin everywhere we went people like oh hey alex hey sirnevich you know at the r and c everybody's
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:31.840]  like hey roger we're recognized and again that is it to brag i don't care about fame none of us
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:37.040]  is to let folks know it's a bellwether of the success that we're not alone exactly i go to the
[2:28:37.040 --> 2:28:41.920]  bank actually and one of the the bank manager it's called sirnevich man how are you i read your stuff
[2:28:41.920 --> 2:28:50.160]  all the time one of my i was at a mother's day thing and one of the um uh the wives of cousin i
[2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:55.040]  can't remember who the who she was but she was a relative and in-law and she goes oh yeah my
[2:28:55.040 --> 2:29:00.560]  clients are big faniers and they're the the sheriffs right so the police are on her side
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:05.040]  so don't be dismayed don't let them sure the police are permanent just like people everywhere
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:09.040]  and they get given globalist orders that are wrong but on average i'm just saying this is
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:13.760]  true the cops know what's going on they research stuff they know how the media lies and they're aware
[2:29:13.760 --> 2:29:18.480]  there's an attempt to absolutely shut this country down well why shouldn't they be awake they know
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:23.120]  george soros that hates us is a literally funding groups that say kill the cops randomly well so i
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:27.200]  mean you know that's a no brainer and the cops better be awake they better be awake father
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:31.440]  patrolling they listen to this live streams and periscope and everything while they're doing
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:34.640]  their patrol sure but let's just be honest we better be awake the cops better be awake
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:39.360]  what does that say about the public that isn't that's scary you mean you better be awake now
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:45.040]  right mike stay there story gonna finish up with you then mike then dean then gary's then
[2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:48.400]  zack we're going bam bam bam your questions your comments straight ahead with mike starting

[2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:57.680]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:57.680 --> 2:30:06.800]  the one belt one road international forum in beijing started on sunday and right now is in
[2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:11.600]  its second day regarding the latest north korean missile test launch that happened on sunday putin
[2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:16.240]  said that it didn't pose a direct threat to russia but that missile tests are unacceptable and that
[2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:20.640]  these problems need to be solved peacefully and not through intimidating north korea but through
[2:30:20.640 --> 2:30:26.720]  returning to dialogue putin also commented on a so-called want to cry the ransomware virus attack
[2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:31.760]  that hit computers across the world last week he said that malware created by intelligent services
[2:30:31.760 --> 2:30:36.560]  can backfire on its creators quote microsoft's management has made it clear that the virus
[2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:41.760]  originated from us intelligent services and of quote putin said that last year washington refused
[2:30:41.760 --> 2:30:46.720]  russia's proposal on cyber security threats with the aim of drafting a bilateral agreement
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:51.440]  now regarding the forum's main intent putin said that the plan is for the greater eurasia
[2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:56.240]  not to just be an abstract geopolitical arrangement but a truly civilization-wide project looking
[2:30:56.240 --> 2:31:00.880]  toward the future which can be achieved through the spirit of cooperation this is bandaria for

[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:24.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:29.520 --> 2:33:38.080]  in your hearts are inscribed the values of service sacrifice and devotion now you must go forth into
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:46.960]  the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action america has always been the land of dreams
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:56.560]  because america is a nation of true believers when the pilgrims landed at plymouth they prayed when
[2:33:56.560 --> 2:34:06.640]  the founders wrote the declaration of of independence they invoked our creator four times because in
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:25.440]  america we don't worship government we worship god that is why our elected officials put their
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:34.480]  hands on the bible and say so help me god as they take the oath of office it is why
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:43.600]  our currency proudly declares in god we trust and it's why we proudly proclaim that we are one
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:56.240]  nation under god every time we say the pledge of allegiance all right my turn which is our guest i
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:35:00.000]  want to get to a lot of calls now we're going to go to stir and have him finish up in this whole
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:05.520]  board of calls then we're going to spend some time on what does trump need to do i know with
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:12.240]  the power that he has his star qualities and if he just had a crew of six seven people that could
[2:35:12.240 --> 2:35:18.000]  be on call in different four five-hour quadrants throughout the day to independently go out and
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:23.920]  just expose lies do press conferences do live feeds it would all have millions of viewers per
[2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:31.360]  transmission would put the the enemy back on their heels we'll talk about that and what roger
[2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:34.960]  stone thinks what mike cernovich thinks what you think should be done here in a few minutes but
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:39.520]  steward in canada you know callers comes oh thank you you're so great listen you're great there
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:44.480]  wouldn't be a movement if it wasn't for you we wouldn't see nationalism rising all over the
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:50.000]  world it wasn't for you we wouldn't see hope it wasn't for you so we're all we're all uh peers here
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:54.400]  here in the in the great animating contest for liberty but go ahead and finish your point
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:36:00.320]  on the whole new world order yeah but alex i wouldn't be psych psychologically so healthy
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:06.080]  there was so much stress before i stumbled upon uh your media platform on my shoulders
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:10.400]  because i thought i was the only one that understood what was going on i couldn't talk
[2:36:10.400 --> 2:36:15.600]  about it you just hit the key they make us all feel alone and then once you learn there's other
[2:36:15.600 --> 2:36:20.480]  people that believe this it takes a lot of the stress off that is absolutely critical whole
[2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:26.000]  world came off my shoulders suddenly i wasn't the only one i wasn't alone in the dark and i did
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:31.200]  reach i had to do more and more and more research to realize that you're you're the real deal and i
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:36.080]  got my fridge is full of your info or your your products and i take them daily and i'm so great
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:39.760]  for one day i'm going to give you an awesome testimonial but it's just not the right time well
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:43.040]  brother you're the reason we're on air and god bless you i appreciate you but the most important
[2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:47.600]  thing is just spread the articles the videos start your own youtube your own facebook really i mean
[2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:53.120]  it's critical that we absolutely take the culture over we're already intellectually the majority
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:59.280]  we just all have to get more active call c span retweet a link i mean roger uh sarnovich this gets
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:03.040]  into how do we take things back in the media that kind of opens the door to discuss this
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:08.720]  what do you think everybody can do just as an basic example of how we up our game as the globalist
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:16.960]  up there's you know in a way downstairs and took brain for us so i'll let you guys thank you but
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:22.800]  seriously i mean what do we all do look i think that history has repeated itself here until
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:28.720]  richard vigory came along and invented essentially direct mail advertising in a political form in
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:34.000]  the 70s conservatives and liberty minded folks couldn't contact each other we didn't have media
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:40.400]  outlets the new york times cbs they were all against us now the internet has really fueled
[2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:45.120]  the revolution so they had air superiority they're in trouble right and now that's why they're trying
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:49.520]  to put the toothpaste back in the tube that's why they want to censor us they realize there's a
[2:37:49.520 --> 2:37:54.720]  revolution afoot and good god the people have found out what's happening and that's a real problem
[2:37:54.720 --> 2:37:59.280]  so you think about the 60s and 70s when direct mail even started and everything was liberal
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:03.920]  communist garbage because the big corporations wanted that as a failed system for america to
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:08.880]  control us now they're so far behind the eight ball we should be way more positive if you look at
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:13.680]  the scheme of time but now they get how much trouble they're in they want total authoritarianism now
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:19.520]  they want to put it all back on the tube now they can't well the idea of liberals classic liberals
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:25.840]  pushing censorship it is nonsense there's nothing liberal about being for censorship but they can't
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:31.440]  argue with our ideas they can't argue the facts of the merits so they have to silence us it's all
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:36.240]  they can do that's right mike you're chopping at the bed go ahead well you know that is why i
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:42.880]  offered to donate a hundred thousand dollars to a an a an a-rated charity of keith oberman who talks
[2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:48.960]  a big game to debate alex jones neutral moderator we could fill a stadium sell tickets by the way i
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:54.480]  didn't know you did that we could raise millions i will debate anybody i will debate uh charlie
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:59.280]  rose i will debate uh i will debate keith oberman any of them without teleprompters that's a great
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:03.120]  idea i don't know you've done that although oberman would have to take off his tinfoil hat because
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:09.280]  these conspiracy theorists like him they really bother me left-wing conspiracy theorist well
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:13.920]  that's why they're afraid to debate us louise mensch actually challenged me to a debate and i
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:19.200]  accepted she backed down sam harris yeah why do they always back out why can't they actually debate
[2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:25.680]  live because they know that if they they'll lose i mean you can't shut us up we don't we want live
[2:39:25.680 --> 2:39:30.640]  why are they also scared who are they yes absolutely sorry go ahead sorry but i apologize
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.200]  why is the average liberal scared to death of live or not controlling things or not having
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:41.120]  a teleprompter p.s where is where is my invitation to testify for the house and senate intelligence
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:46.560]  committee i want to go i want i want to yes please we'll go together i mean they've got no subpoena
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:52.160]  needed they've accused you of being a russian spy they actually said i'm i'm under russian control
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:57.520]  so what it's the american line i should have a chance to respond should i email you a friend of mine
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:02.960]  and the cia actually showed me a flyer where remember the economist wrote that article claiming
[2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:07.760]  that you and i were inadvertent russian stooge is that the article is being used in trained
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:13.120]  materials now so we're actually it isn't this isn't like it's literally true this isn't hyperbole
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:17.200]  you said you were saying that i may have missed it we sent to nico we'll put it on screen well i don't

[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:28.240]  i texted you it but so that article in the economist calling us um inadvertent russian stooge is
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:34.080]  is being used by the cia and their trained materials now so we're literally being targeted by the cia
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:38.800]  and the training materials and this can be confirmed by any of your sources in the cia if yes well
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:44.400]  they had the congressional hearing where the cia said and the arm services committee uh they said
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:52.960]  we are investigating alex jones who who who who is being directed by the gru and the kgb the biggest
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:59.360]  load of horse manure but no proof just oh he just is a russian agent uh uh the article he's talking

[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:37.520]  she now is hiding sam harris challenged me to a debate i accepted it he ran away and then he went
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:42.640]  on the joe rogan podcast and went on a tirade about me for an hour and said i saw it he said i can't

[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:31.040]  you were well known for rounding up russian agents and watching i mean it looks an outrageous but
[2:42:31.040 --> 2:42:38.960]  this guy thinks he's going to the u.s. senate guess again pal i just can't believe that that they
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:44.240]  literally think when the democrats are famous for being in bed with the russians they're the ones
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:49.440]  who are soft on communism not not us well now we're not big enemies with russia because they're
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:54.400]  getting more free markets sorry might go ahead mccarthy was a hero actually hollywood was was
[2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:58.720]  infiltrated by communists and communist spies and mccarthy has been lied about in history
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:03.440]  isn't it funny the democrats religion is hating christianity and whining about the red list
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:08.080]  and all the rest of it and then meanwhile they're doing stuff a thousand times worse now yeah
[2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:15.840]  their blacklist is much larger than the blacklist of the 30s or the 50s censorship is is a tactic of
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:21.520]  scoundrels stalin hitler those are the only people who want to silence them let's have a debate
[2:43:21.520 --> 2:43:26.160]  see i'm against i think every left winger should have full access to how do they think with america's
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:30.080]  tradition that they're going to kill free speech they may have brainwashed zombies at colleges that
[2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:34.880]  howl and scream if they see a trump sign but those people are basket cases that'll end up being
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:39.680]  institutionalized literally they're only sabotaging themselves their new intelligentsia because they
[2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:46.000]  want such a brainwashed bot is literally someone that can't wipe their own rear end we're inheriting
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:51.840]  the world because the globalists gave their own people lobotomies actually sernovich it's almost
[2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:57.600]  like it's a conspiracy by elites that are patriots to sabotage this because sometimes i sit back and
[2:43:57.600 --> 2:44:04.080]  look i mean we're gonna win well i joked that louise mensch is actually um on my payroll because she
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:09.360]  has done way more to this credit the left and make them look so kooky all these bizarre or
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:16.240]  conspiracy people on twitter their conspiracy theories i've in sometimes i wonder is russia
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:22.000]  actually because here's what i would do if i were russia i would pay these morons to be kooky and
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:27.600]  to humiliate everybody to discredit the whole story about russia that's far more effective than
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:33.600]  anything anyone else could do so i'm very grateful yeah attack roger stone alex jones ron paul
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:40.480]  donald trump mr america call us russian agents than any criticism of russia has seen as clownish
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:46.240]  yeah look if this is the conspiracy theory of all time this is the left-wing mainstream media
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:52.720]  conspiracy theory trump had to collude with the russians to win no he didn't and there is no evidence
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:58.400]  no you ran a corpse hillary clinton right i mean there's just no evidence to this and they continue
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:02.320]  all right i gotta take phone calls this is all riveting and i know and i love soon all of us
[2:45:02.320 --> 2:45:05.600]  don't show three hours a day but i know it's all prepared for his hour that i run over it but
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:09.840]  we're gonna bring in from the other studios you can pop in uh also we're gonna have a break too but
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:13.520]  a few minutes to the next hour would never not just take calls as well but look we're gonna go to
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:20.560]  mike zach jane uh dean and gary but first let's go ahead and go to dean in wisconsin he has a
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:27.040]  question for roger stone go ahead dane hey alex uh i just want to say about purging the government
[2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:34.720]  trump should just go to each department and just just fire everyone and bring every low level
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:43.600]  patriot up into the you know all those no i totally agree but they scare him with train wrecks
[2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:48.000]  or government shutdown so he wants to be judicious he wants to be smart about it but then they they
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:52.640]  they that's a great question how do we accelerate the purge thanks go ahead look i actually think
[2:45:52.640 --> 2:45:57.840]  the caller is exactly right first of all he needs a hatchet man he needs somebody who'll go into each
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:05.120]  department and determine uh who the those who are disloyal are and terminate them he also needs a
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:11.600]  political operation the white house that finds and vets trump supporters people with experience
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:15.920]  people with government experience people with proven capability who come out of the campaign
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:19.920]  which is everybody mid-level in government seems to be for trump because they love the country
[2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:24.080]  liberal or conservative they all support him he's got a giant base of people i mean it seems to me
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:29.840]  that if you worked for george w bush or the republican national committee that should exempt
[2:46:29.840 --> 2:46:35.280]  you from a job in the trump white house not accelerate you what do you think about mike
[2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:40.000]  rogers that's what the fbi is saying they want i mean he's got to be disaster a disaster i mean
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:45.760]  donald trump needs an fbi director who is loyal to trump's vision for the country first of all
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:50.240]  mike rogers said that donald trump was not surveilled at trump tower sure what about what
[2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:55.120]  what about trinket trinket he would be expectacular i noticed on fox this morning he was not on the
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:47:01.120]  list ray kelly the former new york police commissioner someone donald trump knows well
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:08.160]  not on the list judge janine piero former judge former prosecutor not on the list these are the
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:13.120]  trump loyalists look at that list by the way as we know that those are really on trump's list though
[2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:17.120]  fox and others are putting out fake lists to create this perception i hope that is the case
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:22.560]  because in this case i looked at that list and every single one of them is an establishment
[2:47:23.200 --> 2:47:28.640]  lackey there's nobody on that list who is a trump loyalist and who understands the struggle
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:33.200]  between the globalists uh sure but didn't mike rogers exposed in gaussie at least
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:39.280]  he was good on that yes i mean he's a lot better than combing well who isn't my dog is better than
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:44.720]  combing i mean please okay all right all right dean thank you uh let's go ahead and talk to uh
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:54.080]  guy in quad city mike you're on the air worldwide go ahead hey uh um hey alice i just want to know
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:48:04.720]  i'm praying for you thank you i'm a new family and you're on all your team too but um the people
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:10.800]  and uh news media have no business getting your privacy and i don't need no need no
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:16.800]  to your privacy of your family business but when you come to public i think it's a very
[2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:25.040]  disgraceful let me hear about your story and questions for uh for roger stone and i do have
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:35.120]  a question for you alice is that i am howdy him um i watched uh uh info war um roadtube and watched
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:42.160]  it maybe three times to watch it to understand without the closed caption but i understand
[2:48:42.160 --> 2:48:48.640]  it costs a lot of money to run that but you think it's causing a problem with uh news people are
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:53.040]  trying to take away yeah no we've got all sorts of sabotage and and i thank you for your call sir
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:57.600]  it costs us a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year to have closed captioning and we're doing it
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:01.040]  and then even when we do it we have problems and it's not sent out over the cable of the internet
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:05.600]  for you so for the listeners that don't know what we deal with money wise trying to really do this
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:10.000]  and get to everybody a hundred two thousand dollars is a lot uh you know for closed captioning
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:14.160]  it's a real person we have to pay for a digital fee that's thousands of years so a real person
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:19.760]  is is doing it and and i'm glad you called in god bless you mike thank you um what's what i deal
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:23.040]  with every day trying to get money in here is that is that people don't know what it's like with
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:29.040]  satellites and stuff and legal and licensing and all the stuff we deal with it's a lot of money
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:32.960]  and so yes we want to close caption all the shows and i'm sorry some of the shows aren't
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:37.120]  closed caption that's that you know that's not done to put you down or anything like that
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:42.480]  it's that we literally are under attack and lawsuits and george soros and everything else and
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:46.800]  i i i want to be able to do that so i know only three hours of the show every day is closed caption
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:50.160]  people complain the other stuff isn't closed captioned i don't have the money it's hundreds
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:53.440]  of thousands more and i don't know what i'm supposed to do and i'm glad to call our call
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:57.600]  though because you don't screen these calls you get the sausage making behind the scenes
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:01.120]  that makes me just throw my hands up the listeners don't know how much money it costs for others
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:05.360]  people say oh just start a network you know people want to do network well we're trying to do it it
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:11.120]  takes money agreed well we don't have billion out that's what i tell people is we don't have
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:16.480]  billion dollar budgets we're not driving ferraris and flying private jets we can make so much more
[2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:23.360]  money selling people on real estate commercial real estate people like us could do so much
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:27.200]  if we wanted to make money we're in the worst business in the world to make money on and
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:31.040]  that's what people don't realize a lot of my family are way way more money than i ever made
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:35.920]  they're all successful exactly i'm doing this i really really care exactly well this is a
[2:50:35.920 --> 2:50:40.320]  uphill battle but what we're gonna get on the end is so big but i'm glad the guy called in about
[2:50:40.320 --> 2:50:44.320]  hey some of your shows aren't closed captioning and the stuff google's got was supposedly free it
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:50.000]  just doesn't work very well i it's money yeah it's money i'm in fact we're about to launch more
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:56.400]  satellite time and i gotta do all that too as well roger looking at that pizza hungry more calls

[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:32.640]  that's holding her in a moment but we talked about it earlier and kind of gave our advice but
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:36.800]  trump shaking things up he's sick of his media people not responding in real time
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:43.040]  he's sick of them always worried about what he's doing and his agenda and and you know kind of
[2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:49.920]  criticizing it instead of criticizing the msm so mike sernovich asking you and then roger stone
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:53.920]  what are you thinking this big shake up that they now admit trumps about to engage in
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:55:00.560]  what would you advise the president to do i would advise them to bring in roger stone or
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:06.720]  somebody roger stone recommends and say it's time to clean house it is time to get rid of people
[2:55:06.720 --> 2:55:12.160]  who are actively sabotaging you who cares if they want to sue you who cares let them call the union
[2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:18.320]  who cares it is time to get rid of mall at once let them cry let them father dumb losses we don't
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:24.560]  care this is about saving america this is about getting active saboteurs and the criminals out
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:30.400]  so he needs to bring in somebody willing to do whatever it takes that has to be trumps model
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:34.320]  i agree and he starts let me ask you about this he starts a couple days a week or more
[2:55:34.320 --> 2:55:38.240]  the fireside chat with graphics showing you this people love it to be top rated
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:44.880]  he goes on the offense with his agenda he has people that are 24 hours a day doing press announcements
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:49.440]  sure have the press a few days a week in the room with you but it's about your agenda you're
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:53.680]  putting your ideas out not just written like the president said but you've got people out there
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:58.160]  out front will dominate the whole cycle will win it's a no brainer he must do it what's holding
[2:55:58.160 --> 2:56:04.560]  that back roger uh look he based on his history of getting phenomenal television ratings i think
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:10.640]  you've hit on the solution here a weekly report to the american people that is unfiltered by the
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:15.760]  mainstream media would be enormously successful so donald trump's report to america the two things
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:22.960]  i would do additionally to a total white house staff shake up is i would direct uh the assistant
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:29.520]  attorney general for antitrust to begin immediately reviewing the activities of google and facebook
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:33.760]  and yahoo and twitter and that's the true offense move because they're openly doing we've caught
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:40.160]  them started with got the documents so i mean that and then frankly i would ask uh i would direct
[2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:48.000]  attorney general jeff sessions to convene a grand jury and to bring bill and hillary clinton
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:53.280]  and kelsey uh and everybody else involved in the criminal enterprise of the clinton foundations
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:58.720]  in front of the grant that would energize the base so indict the criminals weekly fireside chat
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:04.800]  don't worry about the production just get it done right daily vlogs that's the whole point
[2:57:04.800 --> 2:57:09.760]  is he needs to bring it to talk to somebody like you and say hey i want to do trump needs to do a
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:15.520]  daily vlog here's what we did here's where i visited he needs to manage his content and his
[2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:20.960]  press strategy to do it brought him to power but which is if you go to charge hillaryclinton.com

[3:00:57.440 --> 3:01:04.400]  great state of arizona you're on the year go ahead hi alex and roger um i just want you to
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:09.680]  know your products are absolutely fantastic uh i've been using them now for quite a long time
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:16.480]  and i i reckon i couldn't recommend any higher um but anyway i i um i changed my political
[3:01:16.480 --> 3:01:22.560]  affiliation from uh independent to republican just in order to vote for donald trump so i have
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:28.720]  been a very strong supporter of his uh but i have a two-part question uh for you alex or mic
[3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:35.520]  the last time i asked uh this question to roger and i got a spin job so and that's no disrespect
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:42.640]  to you roger that's what i do anyway the aerosol spray of toxic chemicals all over america
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:48.080]  is increasing every day and here in phoenix we're getting pounded like never before donald
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:53.520]  trump could have stopped this on the first day of his presidency i know he could have but instead
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:58.160]  he is allowing it to continue there is a complete silence from the president oh let me respond to
[3:01:58.160 --> 3:02:03.120]  that they're ignoring him and all the agencies there's all sorts of secret programs going on
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:08.000]  there is geoengineering going on the cfr admits it i've seen less of it maybe it's worse in arizona
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.360]  but but specifically what would you like to see trump do i mean you're probably educating him
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:19.440]  now go ahead well here's my question how can donald trump and again i'm a supporter i'm not
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:26.480]  i'm not uh a critique you know i'm i'm a critic i'm a critic of his but i'm a supporter but how
[3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:32.320]  how can donald trump have any hope of making america great again when he is jeopardizing
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:35.840]  the health and welfare of his fellow so you're talking about here's the deal you're talking about
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:39.600]  why do you assume that he knows about it it's deep state man there you assume that this that he
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:42.880]  knows about it do you think maybe someone on the white house staff has told him about that i've
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:47.120]  got a building next to me full of crew members that i only go to like once a week i don't know
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:53.200]  what they're doing a hundred yards from me go ahead sorry no but look the president any president
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:03:00.720]  every president lives in a cocoon and ryan's previous has sought to uh to control super cocoon
[3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:06.400]  flow of information the president told insony scaramucci he wanted to see him this week
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:10.960]  yet ryan's previous keeps knocking him off the president's schedule so let's expand the question
[3:03:10.960 --> 3:03:17.920]  the listener is really asking then how do we get trump out of his cocoon well he needs he needs a
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:24.480]  staff change i mean if he is not getting in his daily news briefing bright bar info wears
[3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:30.800]  daily caller cernovich then something's wrong those who are complaining that he is getting those
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:34.560]  things what they're complaining about is they haven't been able to keep them out well like you said
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:38.480]  he didn't understand that they're blocking for months all his positive twitter comments
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:43.440]  he's noticed that he's like where's all my people and because he didn't even understand they're only
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:47.840]  giving him the negative stuff it's exactly right he doesn't even think he supports there anymore
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:51.920]  that's why he goes out the rally he goes i'm glad you're still here and his wife leads the lord's
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:58.160]  prayers they're so freaked out cernovich yeah that is why there's a great article that politico
[3:03:58.160 --> 3:04:02.720]  which revealed that rents previous is now the leaker we might as well talk about that roger
[3:04:02.720 --> 3:04:07.280]  can talk about why do we let them have that we already had this weeks ago but there it is
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:13.600]  how does this fake news so they didn't actually reveal rents previous is the leaker there but
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:19.360]  if you read it the entire article is trying to make rents previous look like this great smart guy
[3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:25.440]  around a bunch of fools by the way i knew this six months ago bad idea rent rent previous and others
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:31.840]  run into the president with the the printouts they want to yeah look i'm gonna be honest with you
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:39.040]  about this i really am i've had it up to here with rides previous this guy is he is a malevolent
[3:04:39.040 --> 3:04:46.320]  midget is what he is he did not want donald trump to become president he shifted campaign funds uh
[3:04:46.320 --> 3:04:52.480]  in pennsylvania from trump 750 thousand dollars to pat to me he did the same thing in virginia
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:59.040]  in an attempt to undermine us at the last minute he cannot be trusted let's come back and talk more
[3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:04.000]  about that stay with us this is key over the weekend president donald trump has called on
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:08.320]  god to bless and empower our country and our people and reaffirmed our faith in america we
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:14.640]  don't worship government we worship god and it's why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation
[3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:20.560]  under god every time we say the pledge of allegiance which god exactly has he invoked
[3:05:20.560 --> 3:05:27.280]  was it the god of hillary clinton rich people god bless us or was it the god of barack sanabama
[3:05:27.280 --> 3:05:31.520]  god bless you and may god bless the united states of america no president trump has called on the
[3:05:31.520 --> 3:05:37.680]  one true god of the universe whose name is above every name champions for christ he testified to
[3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:42.240]  the greatest pieces of literature in the history of mankind because of the power contained within the

[3:08:09.440 --> 3:08:17.120]  strange days of fun strange days of the lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:08:20.800 --> 3:08:24.240]  all right so gary brought up secret government projects and we've already
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:31.520]  documented that the state department is just completely ignoring what the president wants
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:36.080]  every other agency he's throwing fits he's about to have a purge he says that there's all sorts of
[3:08:36.080 --> 3:08:41.760]  stuff going on he's upset about but i hear you i'd like to see geoengineering and secret programs
[3:08:41.760 --> 3:08:47.200]  exposed but i think gary that roger stone and mike sernovich kind of answer your question
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:53.520]  before you call the theme of this is trumps being ignored does that make sense
[3:08:55.920 --> 3:09:01.920]  yes but in the meantime i think the american people are being ignored i mean well i think
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:07.680]  it's up to us to get a hold of through c span and tv and radio and rallies and messages and you know
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:13.920]  paper airplanes we throw over the wall at the white house we need to get the message to him
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:20.880]  it's up to us candidly the president gets more of his news through television then he gets through
[3:09:20.880 --> 3:09:25.280]  that's the problem even mainline republicans they still watch tv he's 70 years old he does
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:29.600]  get some news on the road well let's talk about it let's put the political article thank you gary
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:32.480]  let's put the political article up and actually get started with the comment on it then you go
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:40.240]  ahead right so the political article is a rents previous leak job to try to make it so that trump
[3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:46.800]  won't read us anymore so the whole article spin is that people are freedom fighters are giving
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:52.160]  trump truthful information from people like us and that this has to stop and rents previous is mad
[3:09:52.160 --> 3:10:00.240]  are we in the story no we're not fortunately but they um the point is that they want to keep us out
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:05.760]  of trumps news diet rents previous is because rents previous is really nervous now because
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:10.560]  we already know that when trump gets to call people previous is like floating around on the
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:16.000]  phone line reportedly yeah no and when the president has meetings previous is always in
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:21.200]  the meeting so how can you run the government when you're spending all the time trying why does
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:25.200]  trump let him be in the meeting so like you you're there and then previous is there in the corner
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:30.080]  right well the president does occasionally turn to him and say did you get that did you get that
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:36.240]  downright it's treating him like a secretary look this guy is no bob hollerman he's no jim baker
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:43.120]  he's not even an andy card he is so over his head in terms of capability uh it's a joke he's just
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:46.880]  but the establishment likes him as he leaks like a said he should uh put some point of
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:51.600]  ambassador to ireland and get rid of him the president would be better served by somebody
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:57.920]  who is loyal to donald j trump i could name three people who are eight who are more than capable
[3:10:57.920 --> 3:11:02.800]  of doing this job how close is previous my source to say that you know trump's deciding but he really
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:08.160]  wants to blow him uh spicer and a bunch of the people out the airlock from your intel who is on
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:14.160]  the chopping block i think spicer is in desperate trouble uh one thing about donald trump is he
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:20.880]  doesn't like to be pushed when you push him he resists he does not like to be told to do things
[3:11:20.880 --> 3:11:26.400]  perfect example david duke of course you would throw david duke over the side the first time
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:31.120]  his name came he'd done it a decade before he had done it before when i was working for him
[3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:35.520]  just somebody said hey can't get everything all i hate him because the media insisted that he do it
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:41.120]  then he resisted and then of course he ultimately did it there's no value in having a david duke
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:46.800]  around and donald trump has no truck with racism or racists like duke but it's a perfect example
[3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:52.480]  of pushing him into a corner so uh at the end of the day uh he's going to have to clean house to
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:58.480]  save his presidency there's no question about that so he is in a crisis he's got the people he's
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:02.320]  got the agenda he's got the trip behind him but he's surrounded by traders who don't want to compromise
[3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:06.720]  who don't want him to work with them they want to mount his head on the wall well or they want to
[3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:12.320]  moderate him which means emasculate him well i just see how his own people bitch when he does
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:17.920]  stuff he's the president you're not uh why did you think i think it's the cherry on top with
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:24.720]  the nut sprinkles why did he hide in the bushes why did uh sean spicer last week hide in the bushes
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:28.080]  he really was because i don't think he wanted to go out there and defend the president of the united
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:32.080]  states what was the great quote i read the other day from a white house staffer who said oh my god
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:38.160]  what has he done now i mean this is the same thing i saw by the way under reagan where
[3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:42.640]  they underestimate the principal and his and his strength and his power and their week
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:46.640]  italics right and they don't want to fight they want to come their followers they're not leaders
[3:12:46.640 --> 3:12:50.160]  i mean here's my deal i don't want the white house press job i'm not even saying i would get it the
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:55.600]  point is it'd be fire breathing it'd be unapologetic they'd be on their heels these own people don't
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:13:02.400]  get why trump's successful because he's brazen he's naked he's real he's committed he's bonafide
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:07.360]  he's he's not a fake you notice it was ronald reagan who brought pat bucannon back into the
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:12.800]  white house press operation that's what you need a young pat bucannon somebody who is smart somebody
[3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:17.360]  who is combative somebody who will grab the other guys by the throat and pull them down the hill a
[3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:23.280]  fighter like trump a fighter instead we have people who are trying to be conciliatory and kiss
[3:13:23.280 --> 3:13:26.880]  the air and conciliatory is fine if people are being trying to conciliatory with you they're
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:32.800]  running around saying kill the president kill us shut down free speech arrest everyone he's a
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:37.280]  group of people with flaming torches running at you is not someone you make a deal with well and
[3:13:37.280 --> 3:13:42.480]  as the new yorker magazine showed us last week there's a subset of liberals now who say he's insane
[3:13:42.480 --> 3:13:46.800]  we've got to remove him because he's crazy just because he doesn't agree with them just because
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:51.280]  he doesn't and again people go oh you're settling establishment the whole the pope the chinese
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:56.800]  communist dictator the saudi arabians the corrupt mexican government the corrupt canadian government
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:14:01.600]  the republican part of the democratic party all these the e you they're all against trump
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:09.440]  what nutball wouldn't be for him i mean if if uh if mental instability is the hallmark
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:16.720]  why do we have a rapist as president for eight years a rapist a serial sexual assaulter uh so this
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:20.880]  line of sure i totally agree so let me ask you this question because i want to put this together
[3:14:20.880 --> 3:14:24.160]  maybe we should do a lot of a tape thing later because this is really a big deal trump will
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:28.640]  listen to this i won't take a few calls here and then i'll bring david indian david what do you
[3:14:28.640 --> 3:14:34.960]  think president trump should do with a shakeup i mean i think he should do fireside chats people
[3:14:34.960 --> 3:14:38.880]  try to make it too produced just get up there with his basic graphics his facts he gives him a day
[3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:43.360]  before the 10 point thing he wants to cover that they have the clips just like he sees on facebook
[3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:48.320]  just like he sees on twitter he gets up and says here's the clip of 20 democrats saying fire the
[3:14:48.320 --> 3:14:54.000]  fbi director see that's all i'm doing this guy says i'm crazy because there was wiretapping
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:58.480]  here's the new york times saying there was wiretapping let's move the next agenda he goes in for 45
[3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:05.120]  minutes hits like 10 points then maybe has a few journalists a mix takes a few questions he does that
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:10.400]  once or twice a week game over he's defeated him okay that's my idea let's do it oh what do you think
[3:15:10.400 --> 3:15:15.440]  david i think you're absolutely right alex you know ronald reagan said he was going to transcend
[3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:19.360]  washington he was going to go directly to the people he never did it or had the potential to
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:23.440]  do it in the way that donald trump put a ball in him before he could yeah i think you ought to go
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:28.240]  beyond just canceling the press conferences i think you ought to do exactly what you said
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:33.280]  go directly to the people bypass these daily press conferences that are going bypass the press
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:39.040]  secretary and i think he ought to use these bully pulpits not just to defend himself personally
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:43.440]  but to advance his agenda to tell the american people look i want you putting pressure on
[3:15:43.440 --> 3:15:49.840]  washington with me together the two of us can get this agenda that i ran on that you voted for done
[3:15:49.840 --> 3:15:53.440]  and we can shut down washington i think that's exactly what i said and david and i want all
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:15:57.040]  you to comment on this and take calls i'll turn over to you david i've been prepared for the
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:01.840]  sour for all day trump must know and i think he knows this now that's where we're getting from
[3:16:01.840 --> 3:16:07.200]  multiple sources very high up is that he gets there's no compromise he gets they don't make
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:11.200]  sense they want to run the country they don't care about the power of what they run they have no
[3:16:11.760 --> 3:16:18.080]  rubber meets the road uh basic understanding uh oh you guys got a mic open in there so they
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:26.000]  have no understanding of this basic system and he now understands that and understands he's in a
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:32.560]  death battle and that if he goes all the way he wins if he doesn't he loses and so now it's up to
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:37.680]  all of us to understand just how critical this moment really is like so over the weekend we
[3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:42.720]  had james clapper say our institutions are under attack internally by president trump i had said
[3:16:42.720 --> 3:16:48.000]  on friday that all these liberals were saying it's a coup it's a coup no it wasn't really a coup
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:53.280]  donald what donald trump did was within his legal rights as president he is still president so it
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:59.920]  was not technically a coup but they see it as a coup because it was someone that they see simply as
[3:16:59.920 --> 3:17:05.360]  a stated preference by the people they're not accounted to the elected president they saw it
[3:17:05.360 --> 3:17:11.040]  as a coup against the swamp against the uh unelected bureaucracy that stays there permanently
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:14.800]  and that's what we're seeing from james clapper he says our institutions are under attack i'm
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:19.040]  going to talk about that in detail what james clapper was really saying but that's what they're
[3:17:19.040 --> 3:17:24.240]  looking at alex they're looking at the fact that out that donald trump would actually fire
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:29.600]  one of the higher ranking members of the permanently entrenched bureaucracy he was right
[3:17:29.600 --> 3:17:35.040]  these are arrogant entitled lords yes who believe that that that they own us and trump
[3:17:35.040 --> 3:17:39.920]  was involved in a coup against the swamp yeah there the swamp is trying to have a coup over
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:46.160]  trump that's right now is this the counter coup is this the same uh james clapper who testified
[3:17:46.160 --> 3:17:51.760]  falsely to the u.s congress about the collection of metadata proven to be a lie by edward snow
[3:17:51.760 --> 3:17:56.800]  he said he said nobody spies the american people and and that's the same story we hear over and over
[3:17:56.800 --> 3:18:02.960]  again with fbi comey saying trump's crazy nobody spies on anybody but but they let clapper come
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:07.360]  back and clean it up and apologize instead of indicting him for perjury and sending him to
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:13.360]  jail where he belongs that's right that's right and a politicized member of the national security
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:21.440]  council as he's sitting in his positions during the election actually using that as a bully pulpit
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:26.560]  to get involved in politics why would be be surprised to find out that they use the national
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:31.520]  security apparatus to look and to investigate into politicians way beyond donald trump but also
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:36.320]  people like rand paul and he said another senator has told him that he's also been told we got looked
[3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:41.040]  at you better believe they're listening right now one of the questions i want to ask and i was on
[3:18:41.040 --> 3:18:47.600]  uh uh real time with bill mar about a month ago now and michael hayden was uh the former cia director
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:53.040]  was one of the guests why do these guys all have shaved heads is it like some secret club or something
[3:18:53.040 --> 3:19:00.560]  did you ever notice this brennan uh a clapper uh i mean all of them hayden they all have these
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:05.440]  shaved heads it must be some like secret signal or something well i think there's not some such
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:09.360]  secret signals when they brag about what they're doing i james clapper is going to be the worst
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:13.680]  poker player in the world when he was lying to ron wyden he's like you know looking down and
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:18.960]  rubbing his face but then you had Michael hayden go to the wash to washington lee university
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:24.080]  and brag about the fact that he didn't need any special provisions under the even the patriot
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:28.560]  act which is unconstitutional he said i had a direct order from the president i could do whatever i
[3:19:28.560 --> 3:19:35.280]  wanted that's the mindset of these people and he has the nerve to go on with uh judge napolitano
[3:19:35.280 --> 3:19:39.440]  and say that he's a libertarian and that was just totally insane it's totally crazy do you remember
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:44.000]  when nixon said uh if the president orders it that makes it legal that's right and how all the
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:48.960]  lefties went crazy when he said that that's right where were they when hayden said essentially that's
[3:19:48.960 --> 3:19:53.280]  right let's take a few final calls and let david night take over but uh mike's heard what you've
[3:19:53.280 --> 3:19:58.640]  been holding there patiently um your take on what you've just been hearing oh no i'm just listening
[3:19:58.640 --> 3:20:05.440]  and it's great great roundtable discussion so i don't have anything to add you do have stuff to add
[3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:10.240]  what's the next big shoe drops from your intel you said we're gonna be very very happy soon
[3:20:10.240 --> 3:20:16.160]  about what trump's about to do from your sources well roger roger covered the shan spicer angle
[3:20:16.160 --> 3:20:21.360]  trump knows he has to get rid of rents he has to get rid of spicer i don't know that he's gonna
[3:20:21.360 --> 3:20:26.720]  fire spicer right away though i think he's playing mind games on him because as roger will tell you
[3:20:26.720 --> 3:20:31.440]  trump likes to pit people against each other because competition brings out the best in people
[3:20:32.080 --> 3:20:38.720]  and now spicer is because he's spiced as a beta male so now he is shook up a little bit and i don't
[3:20:38.720 --> 3:20:43.600]  think he's gonna rise to the occasion so i don't think he's out right away but trump is definitely
[3:20:43.600 --> 3:20:48.400]  letting him know hey i'm interviewing these other people you better up your game you better
[3:20:48.400 --> 3:20:54.880]  put hide in the bushes you need to call on alternative media i mean talk about media strategy
[3:20:54.880 --> 3:21:00.560]  why is spicer giving the first questions to the fake new york times to the fake associated press
[3:21:00.560 --> 3:21:05.280]  why isn't he asking alternative media why is there all this butt kissing i mean doesn't
[3:21:05.280 --> 3:21:09.840]  he get that that doesn't get him anywhere well look i think we all know that katie walsh who was
[3:21:09.840 --> 3:21:16.240]  the deputy to ryan's previous was fired because they caught her leaking who do you think directed her
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:22.400]  to leak ryan's previous is a the leaker and the leaks are not oh yeah we went to break and never
[3:21:22.400 --> 3:21:27.360]  got to that i'm never good at our biggest story of the day dun dun dun mike sternovich then of
[3:21:27.360 --> 3:21:31.520]  course roger stones told me before the show he's ready to go after previous he's the leaker now
[3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:35.440]  you're saying this political thing basically shows he's the one let's both spend a few minutes on that
[3:21:35.440 --> 3:21:41.840]  then the final calls right so the you have to use you know good lawyerly reasoning and deductive
[3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:46.480]  reasoning one thing i noticed a couple months ago and i even wrote the article the dog that
[3:21:46.480 --> 3:21:52.640]  didn't bark based on a sherlock home story i said where are the rents previous headpieces that was
[3:21:52.640 --> 3:21:56.560]  you know because it's human beings we notice what is in our face but a lot of times we don't notice
[3:21:56.560 --> 3:22:01.840]  what is in there and i noticed you couldn't find a bad article about that guy anywhere in the world
[3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:07.280]  and i thought that's really weird because everybody else in trump world gets hammered and
[3:22:07.280 --> 3:22:12.400]  smashed that's right rents previous is the giant bloated butt that the diarrhea just squirts out
[3:22:12.400 --> 3:22:17.840]  of well look no they buy immunity by leaking don't write that about me i'll give you something better
[3:22:18.640 --> 3:22:25.680]  is it incidental that uh that days before anthony scaramucci a patriot a guy who is better on tv
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:30.400]  defending donald trump in my view that anyone else that there's a hit piece on him about his
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:36.720]  business dealings all of it bogus who planted that how did that get in the paper i can tell you
[3:22:36.720 --> 3:22:41.680]  rents previous that's how now i'm not against short people i'm not the tallest guy i mean like you know
[3:22:41.680 --> 3:22:47.040]  five eleven but i'm told that rents previous is basically five feet tall and actually
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:54.240]  it it it well it's napoleonic i think is what you're trying to say i mean i think that the guy
[3:22:54.240 --> 3:23:00.560]  is uh he's out of his depth here he doesn't have the administrative capability to to do this job
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:06.400]  you can't be both in the in the meetings trying to cover your ass with the boss and still have time
[3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:10.800]  to run the federal government i was about to say i mean this guy's clearly a weasel and trump knows
[3:23:10.800 --> 3:23:18.080]  that so how long until rents p penis is gone uh look you can't push down trump it is always a
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:24.000]  mistake he will do the right thing uh but this is broken it's not working one does not have to be a
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  genius to see that now do they have dirt because trump's saying hey better watch out i'm recording
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:31.680]  conversations all the phone calls recorded the media acts like they don't know that's true or not
[3:23:31.680 --> 3:23:37.200]  that's just the fact it's not dirty it's going on how does rents penis previous i misspoke how
[3:23:37.200 --> 3:23:41.280]  does he strike back then i mean do they have some kind of dirt the dirt right any release i don't
[3:23:41.280 --> 3:23:46.960]  think he has any cards here i think he is living day to day uh and he was never the right guy so
[3:23:46.960 --> 3:23:53.280]  rents previous is kind of like a limp biscuit in a sense yes i'm like starting to put your
[3:23:53.280 --> 3:23:59.200]  comments on uh rents rents well you know roger brought up the point is how he bought immunity
[3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:04.560]  that's why there are no hit pieces and then that political article is like the cherry on top where
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:09.840]  the whole article says oh my god trump is being spread these fake news but rents previous he's
[3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:16.240]  really trying to make sure that trump isn't giving any fake news so it's a total hatchet job on everybody
[3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:22.640]  except rents previous and i thought rents you idiot you fool you moron he should at least plant
[3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:27.840]  something bad about himself you know it's interesting when i worked for ron rayon they used to try to
[3:24:27.840 --> 3:24:33.120]  keep human events which was uh you know one of the early conservative newspapers a great publication
[3:24:33.120 --> 3:24:36.880]  try to keep it away from him because they didn't want him to read it because he would read things
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:43.600]  there and he would blurt them out and it didn't even lead a laroush stuff i mean they destroyed
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:48.960]  their efforts to move him to the center and quote unquote moderate him but the good news is that
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:53.920]  dutch loved his human events and he wanted to see it every week i wish the president would
[3:24:53.920 --> 3:24:59.680]  demand to see info wars every day because you know they attempt to keep it from him and it's not on
[3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:04.800]  the television screen where he is used to seeing his television so he's got to go looking for it
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:09.840]  wow cernovich i want to take a few final calls i appreciate your time you never even plug yourself
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:14.320]  stonecultruth.com info wars.com i know you've got a lot of sites a lot of things you do a lot of
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:19.200]  twitter facebook where's the best places for people to find all things mike cernovich the great hated
[3:25:19.200 --> 3:25:26.000]  patron yeah twitter.com forward slash c-e-r-n-o-v-i-c-h twitter.com forward slash
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:31.360]  cernovich is usually a good place to be and we've been developing this rents previous thing for
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:38.640]  a while so i'm glad that roger got confirmation too that it's rents and again we need more news
[3:25:38.640 --> 3:25:44.720]  going to trump so people what can you do share because trump does read his twitter share articles
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:51.200]  to info wars by replying to at real donald trump that is how we'll wake him up share this video
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:56.480]  that we've done right now share the videos with trump reply to him because trump does he watches
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:26:01.840]  television for a lot of news but he does get a lot of news from his twitter so we need to bombard
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:09.120]  his feed with and the great thing is when he actually responds he is reading his twitter feed
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:13.520]  which is how he figured out that they were they were pushing all his positive comments to the
[3:26:13.520 --> 3:26:17.440]  bottom or deleting them and pushing all the negative ones to the top but it was not until
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:26.160]  somebody mentioned that to him that he saw real under who that was somebody in any event uh look
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:31.360]  this is uh this is going to be a struggle trump can still be the transformative president we need
[3:26:31.360 --> 3:26:37.680]  him to be but not when he's surrounded by these midgets by these pygmies and rinse pray was
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:44.000]  something to short guys i mean he should be a lollipop guild extra on the new uh remaking of
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:50.880]  the yellow book road uh what's the name of that movie he is too he's too tall for that i think
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:26:59.040]  but look uh without the personal attacks he's not up to this he's paul ryan's man he's dreaming
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:06.720]  of the paul ryan presidency post trump trump needs a trump loyal is he dreaming of paul ryan coming in

[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:10.400]  that was very powerful i know you had a lot of interpersonal things going on behind the scenes

[3:28:15.040 --> 3:28:19.120]  on your show you guys delve into it and then pence two days later literally uses those lines which
[3:28:19.120 --> 3:28:23.200]  haven't been uttered out of a diplomatic channel in the u.s in a long time so it's very powerful

[3:33:57.760 --> 3:34:03.040]  bureaucracy and by the washington press against donald trump that's what's really going on there
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:07.760]  and we've got some other news as well from ram paul talking about the senate seeing changes

[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:26.320]  to be with you and thanks for holding me over um yeah so basically i called in on the 14th last
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:33.360]  month when sternovich and jones were speaking um and i kind of brought up the point of strategic
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:36.960]  patience which is the cfr game that's pretty critical when it comes to north korea in our
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:42.480]  position diplomatically with them um and then right after that show you have pence going
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:47.840]  to south korea and japan and then you start seeing the strategic patience thing being brought up
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:52.320]  obviously things are changing as far as our strategy goes and i know alex has known through
[3:34:52.320 --> 3:34:56.720]  some interpersonal things so maybe it wasn't followed up on but it just showed it just goes to show
[3:34:56.720 --> 3:35:01.680]  how powerful the reach of info wars is obviously i work with db but the fact that it was set on
[3:35:01.680 --> 3:35:06.080]  that show and then you could see through you know not just intelligence but obviously military
[3:35:06.080 --> 3:35:09.520]  channels that that word got down the chain and they were literally using the term strategic
[3:35:09.520 --> 3:35:14.560]  patience so it kind of broke their paradigm which is powerful um but also we see that happen a number
[3:35:14.560 --> 3:35:19.360]  of times as a matter of fact you know it's about a year ago we started saying there isn't a left
[3:35:19.360 --> 3:35:23.600]  right paradigm that's a false dichotomy that they've sold people we need to understand that the fault
[3:35:23.600 --> 3:35:28.880]  line here is between nationalism and globalism and i think we were saying that first maybe we
[3:35:28.880 --> 3:35:33.360]  weren't i don't know but it became a central point of the campaign i think one thing that
[3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:37.040]  illustrates that today is one of the news items that i had here i'll get back to you in just a
[3:35:37.040 --> 3:35:43.120]  second zack but france has a new prime minister they've reached out to the conservative party so
[3:35:43.120 --> 3:35:48.480]  here's this guy macron who really was didn't have any political leanings but he was part of the
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:51.760]  socialist government before he stopped and then said well i'm going to run as an independent
[3:35:51.760 --> 3:35:58.400]  actually he's running as a ross child party uh banker but the issue here is to pick this guy
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:04.560]  because he is pro e you so you can be pro it doesn't matter if you're conservative or if you're
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:10.560]  liberal it doesn't matter if you're socialist or if you're laissez faire in france you the dividing
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:17.360]  line here is between being pro eu and being pro france and they're not going to let anybody
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:22.160]  into that cabinet but they will reach across the so-called ideological lines remember it was the
[3:36:22.160 --> 3:36:27.280]  left right paradigm that originally came from france but it is a false dichotomy the real
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:30.880]  choice that's before us right now with these governments are are the governments going to
[3:36:30.880 --> 3:36:35.200]  even exist are we going to have national governments or they're going to be subsumed
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:40.640]  into some kind of a multinational organization that is a stepping stone to a world government
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:46.160]  and that's what's going on in france right now uh your comments that uh yeah absolutely i mean i
[3:36:46.160 --> 3:36:50.400]  think one thing that's happening and you hit the word and i think these things like you know get out
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:54.400]  there and they're so accurate like the paradigm changing and this is what i was finishing up with
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:36:58.640]  stone and jones and cernovich with is that they were talking about previous and talking about
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:03.280]  the spicer and who's in who's out they're antiquated it does not matter trump was not
[3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:08.320]  elected on that trump trump completely broke what the status quo was so it's like white house
[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:14.080]  chief of staff is roger stone the press secretary's alex jones cernovich is the insider we got david
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:18.320]  knight who's also the i mean you look you guys get so many more listeners than who's actually
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:23.280]  listening to that establishment in those quote unquote real positions trump knows that so he could
[3:37:23.280 --> 3:37:27.840]  put these actual quote unquote real guys in the chopping block and let them dance but look he didn't
[3:37:27.840 --> 3:37:32.400]  get elected by you know following those steps he got elected by just blowing that out of the water
[3:37:32.400 --> 3:37:37.040]  getting mainstream attention and completely just changing it so well the important thing i think
[3:37:37.040 --> 3:37:41.200]  is just sorry go ahead i think it's just important to put the truth out there and let people make
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:46.000]  their own decisions we trust the people to make their own decisions and so we don't come out here
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:50.560]  and say something without backing it up with articles many times it'll be information that's
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:55.920]  coming from so-called mainstream sources that we backed that up with but they're buried sources
[3:37:55.920 --> 3:38:00.560]  and so we put that stuff together and we connect the dots for people and we let you make up your
[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:05.200]  own mind that's a very powerful thing to be able to speak our mind without having to worry about
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:10.000]  access without having to be worried about what people are going to say about us that's a very
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:14.720]  powerful thing the truth can be very powerful so i think that's really what we have going for us
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:18.240]  i want to get to some news but thank you zach it's very important that everybody understand
[3:38:18.240 --> 3:38:22.960]  that we can have an impact you can forward these articles as they were just saying for those to
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:27.120]  uh donald trump forward it to his twitter account that's one way that we can get to him
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:32.320]  and i believe that we need to break this bottleneck this wall that has been erected between the
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:38.480]  american people and donald trump and that is the washington bureaucracy and in that i would include
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:43.040]  the press as part of that you know last week there was this article that was on drudge report
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:48.000]  they're not so viral firing of james comey and they said despite the wall to wall media coverage
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:52.560]  most americans according to measurements on facebook interaction didn't really care about
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:58.320]  that that much but the press does and they care very much about it those who are in washington
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:05.200]  care very much about it we have pret barara said are there still public servants who will say no to
[3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:10.640]  the president this is a featured article on the washington post today well i would ask him i would
[3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:15.840]  ask clapper what do you really think is the constitutional structure of the government
[3:39:15.840 --> 3:39:22.160]  you know clapper said yesterday on cnn with jake clapper uh jake tapper it was clapper and tapper
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:27.120]  hey they should do a show together former director of national intelligence james clapper said our
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:32.640]  institutions of government were under assault by president trump this is the way it went he said
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:36.720]  our institutions under assault both externally and that's the big news here is the russian
[3:39:36.720 --> 3:39:42.480]  interference in our election system well show us some evidence or shut up put up or shut up
[3:39:42.480 --> 3:39:48.240]  james clapper you politicize this as someone who was head of the intelligence agencies this is a
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:53.840]  guy who has been pointed out before he lied to everyone just before the snowden leaks showed
[3:39:53.840 --> 3:39:58.160]  what a liar he was but we could tell he was lying we knew he was lying and his face showed that he
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:04.080]  was lying but then he goes on to say and i think as well our institutions are under assault internally
[3:40:04.080 --> 3:40:10.640]  and then tapper says internally from the president he said exactly said clapper and then tapper comes
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:15.360]  back and says because he's firing the checks and balances he's firing the checks and balances
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:20.160]  and then clapper james clapper says well i think you know the founding fathers a system of three
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:24.320]  co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances and i feel as though
[3:40:24.320 --> 3:40:31.760]  it's under assault and it's eroding okay so i would ask clapper what branch of government
[3:40:31.760 --> 3:40:38.160]  is the department of justice what branch of government is the nsa or the cia or the bureaucracy
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:45.520]  understand when all this stuff began back in the 1970s we knew that the government was spying
[3:40:45.520 --> 3:40:50.640]  illegally on americans in violation of the constitution violation of the fourth amendment
[3:40:50.640 --> 3:40:56.080]  requirements to get search warrants to say i believe go to before judge i believe this person
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:02.480]  is committing a crime here's why i believe that and here's where i want to search them the person
[3:41:02.480 --> 3:41:07.760]  the place the time the reason go before a judge get an order no no we don't do that anymore as a
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:12.160]  matter of fact we weren't doing that back in the 60s and the 70s as soon as these agencies were
[3:41:12.160 --> 3:41:16.960]  created they went rogue and so we had the frank church committee hearings and remember they did all
[3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:21.760]  of the talk about the assassination to get the public's attention away from the fact that it was
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:29.120]  the public that was a target of the cia not so much castro and they were very successful at
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:33.760]  getting the public's information not very successful at assassinating castro bulls how the heart
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:38.720]  attack gun we saw all that stuff you didn't even hear much about the pike committee hearings the
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:44.240]  pike committee hearings focused more on the nsa the church committee hearings focused on the cia
[3:41:44.240 --> 3:41:48.800]  the church committee hearings were in the senate the pike committee hearings were in the house and
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:54.240]  when they had the director of the nsa which at the time and for very long after that when i was
[3:41:54.240 --> 3:41:59.040]  working at texas instruments in the early 80s i knew a guy who used to work for the nsa he had
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:04.720]  retired and they would laugh about it and he said yeah i used to work for no such agency that was
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:10.000]  what everybody said the nsa stood for because in the 1970s when they were having these hearings
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:16.080]  and congressman pike called the head of the nsa to come testify as to why they were spying on
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:22.720]  americans he said uh i want to see i've seen the charter for the cia where is your authorization
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:26.960]  and he says i'm not going to show it to you we were created by an executive order by president
[3:42:26.960 --> 3:42:31.760]  truman and i'm not going to show it to you congressman that's the contempt with which
[3:42:31.760 --> 3:42:37.280]  these people hold our constitution that's the contempt that they hold the checks and balances
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:42.480]  in our government that's what you need to understand out of that came the foreign intelligence
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:48.160]  surveillance act that was supposed to restrain the intelligence agencies from spying on americans
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:52.960]  without cause and now we know what's happening with all of that but that's that's the idiocy of
[3:42:52.960 --> 3:42:57.040]  all this of course the department of justice is under the president and we don't have checks and
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:02.720]  balances mainly because we've had the congress abdicate their power to the bureaucracy that
[3:43:02.720 --> 3:43:07.680]  then does whatever they wish and if we want to know where this is going take a look at
[3:43:07.680 --> 3:43:12.640]  rand paul who's continually pointing out the fact that it's not just president trump who was
[3:43:12.640 --> 3:43:18.560]  spied on it was rand paul who said you don't get a search warrant for mr mrs verizon and so rand paul
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:25.120]  says hey i know people have come to me and said that i was unmasked i was surveilled on and there
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:28.960]  were other people who are other presidential candidates people who are other congressmen and
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:34.400]  so forth he says i know now of one other senator who has already confided to me that he was surveilled
[3:43:34.400 --> 3:43:39.600]  by the obama administration including his phone calls so when all this comes out said senator
[3:43:39.600 --> 3:43:46.000]  rand paul if there are no political figures from the opposition party it's a story that is bigger
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:51.200]  than any of the allegations with regard to russian collusion do you understand that if our
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:59.440]  government has politicized the massive surveillance state that in itself is unconstitutional
[3:43:59.440 --> 3:44:04.160]  should be a concern to all americans but if they have politicized that that's the story
[3:44:04.160 --> 3:44:09.680]  the people like james clapper would be involved in that and of course he is politicized as he was
[3:44:09.680 --> 3:44:16.160]  still in his office before he stepped down he was getting involved in the campaign that was
[3:44:16.160 --> 3:44:22.000]  outrageous a military man who would do that as department of defense if he was a soldier or general
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:27.120]  he would be immediately dismissed for getting involved in politics but these spooks can get
[3:44:27.120 --> 3:44:32.080]  involved in electoral politics during a presidential election like james clapper did and face not only
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:36.800]  no discipline but as we were talking about before the fact that he could lie to congress and there
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:42.000]  would be no consequences for this guy of course he's lying to us now james clapper is a liar you
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:45.920]  shouldn't believe anything this man says earlier this month they point out paul announced that
[3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:50.000]  sources have told him he has been surveilled by the obama administration this is bright bar to
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:54.160]  believe in and that he has requested information from the white house and congressional intelligence
[3:44:54.160 --> 3:44:59.360]  committees on whether he's been surveilled unmasked or searched for within intelligence reports he
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:06.080]  said it's about your own government spying on the opposition party that would be enormous if true
[3:45:06.080 --> 3:45:11.280]  that is what we should be focused on folks this conspiracy theory about the russians is absolute
[3:45:11.280 --> 3:45:16.480]  nonsense and we go back and we look at james comey remember that james comey let's just put
[3:45:16.480 --> 3:45:23.920]  some of his his career in perspective it was james comey who sent martha stewart to jail for insider
[3:45:23.920 --> 3:45:29.360]  trading while nancy polosi and the rest of congress was making millions off of insider trading
[3:45:30.240 --> 3:45:35.920]  and this is the same guy who put small sailors in jail for keeping a photograph said don't
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:39.680]  you try this at home here's hillary clinton's felonies but i'm not going to do anything to her
[3:45:39.680 --> 3:45:44.800]  because she violated national security but don't you try this at home soldiers sailors anybody
[3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:47.440]  else who works for the government don't you try this and of course we're going to give
[3:45:47.440 --> 3:45:54.400]  huma abedana pass as well even though she stored massive amounts of above top secret data on her
[3:45:54.400 --> 3:46:00.080]  husband's computer even though he didn't have the clearance for that so this is the same guy who
[3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:04.240]  would send martha stewart to jail for insider trading when the real insiders in washington the
[3:46:04.240 --> 3:46:09.840]  people who are manipulating the laws that can affect entire industries up and down as well as
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:14.960]  companies are out there trading and they had no no controls on them and of course it wasn't
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:18.880]  illegal what nancy polosi and the rest of them were doing at the time they had the stock act
[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:25.280]  that they put in place to stop that and when everybody stopped looking about eight or nine
[3:46:25.280 --> 3:46:31.120]  months later they gutted that and went back to business as usual but that's the kind of corruption
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:35.280]  that james comey should have been fired for but understand the difference here between what was
[3:46:35.280 --> 3:46:40.720]  going on with hillary clinton and the allegations with donald trump what he said was hillary clinton
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:45.040]  has committed these felonies but i'm not going to do anything about it with donald trump they
[3:46:45.040 --> 3:46:50.400]  haven't come up with any wrongdoing and yet this is the kind of game that james comey is playing
[3:46:50.400 --> 3:46:56.720]  what he's playing is the game that jagger hoover used to play blackmail everybody in washington
[3:46:56.720 --> 3:47:02.320]  and of course harry truman talked about that oh he had dossiers and files on everybody and when
[3:47:02.320 --> 3:47:07.280]  he died his personal secretary got rid of that stuff but that was his key to power the difference
[3:47:07.280 --> 3:47:12.880]  was is that james comey was doing it publicly he was investigating both presidential candidates
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:18.960]  simultaneously and doing it publicly and defying them to do anything to him don't you fire me i'm
[3:47:18.960 --> 3:47:23.360]  staying here for 10 years if you fire me i'm going to say but but i had you under some kind of an
[3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:27.680]  investigation so if you fire me that shows that you're a criminal right that's the game that he's
[3:47:27.680 --> 3:47:32.160]  playing right now donald trump didn't bite into it i was very happy to see donald trump
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:36.720]  not playing that game with james comey but of course the press is going to continue to play
[3:47:36.720 --> 3:47:41.920]  that game but going back to what ran paul said and this is the crux of the issue folks the crux
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:47.760]  of the issue that they're not investigating is whether or not the obama administration was spying
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:53.760]  on its political opponents and trying to hack the election that is far more concerning than
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:48:00.720]  anything that russia would do isn't it isn't it concerning that the bureaucracy especially
[3:48:00.720 --> 3:48:06.000]  the surveillance state with a lie itself with certain politicians and then start attacking people
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:12.480]  this is what ran paul said he said it's about your own government spying on the opposition party
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:16.960]  that would be enormous if true i don't know the truth we've asked the intelligence committees
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:22.160]  house and senate i've also asked the white house because there is this whole discussion
[3:48:22.160 --> 3:48:29.440]  of susan rice unmasking people and of course that's the deal folks that is the essence of
[3:48:29.440 --> 3:48:34.880]  what is truly here now as we look at this swamp that is pushing back and as i said it is a coup
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:40.880]  what donald trump did he had the audacity to stand up to this corrupt bureaucracy to this
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:47.520]  edgerhoover jaggerhoover want to be and uh who's trying to blackmail him into not firing him he
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:52.800]  stood up to him and fired him and now the bureaucracy is freaking out about that and
[3:48:52.800 --> 3:48:58.800]  they're freaking out about something else us a today says irs executives say our lives are at
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:04.720]  risk in the tea party case if you open this up a judge's rule that there was a strong showing
[3:49:04.720 --> 3:49:10.960]  that the irs had a bias against tea party groups and say details about the tea party bias claims
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:17.120]  against the irs could remain secret however because current and former agency officials say
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:22.320]  their lives are in danger if they publicly testify against the case think about that
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:28.480]  this is us a today a couple of hours ago what they're saying here is that the irs executives
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:34.320]  are saying if we told you what we have done to you you would want to kill us that's what they're
[3:49:34.320 --> 3:49:40.640]  saying they're saying that they're essentially admitting to crimes and so this is the concern
[3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:45.120]  that we have the concern that we have people like james clapper who will use his political
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:48.880]  office to try to take down political opponent or use his surveillance office to take down
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:53.440]  political opponents that we would have the irs used as a political weapon do you understand
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:50:00.400]  what's going on here this government is way beyond doing any minor adjustments we're either
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:05.360]  going to have to cut this thing off or we're going to have to do massive amputations in
[3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:10.880]  washington if we don't cut the head off this is something this is like a cancer it really is
[3:50:10.880 --> 3:50:16.800]  like a cancer and there's an analogy to that i think that that really is more than just the
[3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:22.640]  fact that it's malignant and spreading you know when a cancer starts you have a kidney cancer
[3:50:22.640 --> 3:50:29.680]  as my sister did it starts trying to create kidney uh aberrant cells try to create kidneys
[3:50:29.680 --> 3:50:33.840]  and other parts of your organ it tries to metastasize to your lungs and tries to create a kidney
[3:50:33.840 --> 3:50:38.320]  there but it they're broken and they don't work and they can't create a kidney but they go there
[3:50:38.320 --> 3:50:44.400]  or they go to the brain that's what this metastasizing cancer the federal government has done it tries
[3:50:44.400 --> 3:50:50.640]  to go in every aspect of our life and become something that it could never be it has to be
[3:50:50.640 --> 3:50:56.160]  cut out it has to be cut off it is politicized that is the core of what the problem is ran paul
[3:50:56.160 --> 3:51:00.800]  has it exactly we need to investigate the fbi we need to investigate what's going on with the irs
[3:51:00.800 --> 3:51:05.840]  stay with us we'll be right back are you putting your money into an ira pension or 401k then i hope

[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:27.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night i want to quickly cover a couple of health
[3:54:27.440 --> 3:54:34.000]  issues here before we break there was an article today on cnn patients say roundup gave us cancer
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:39.680]  as an api official helped the company this is what happens is called regulatory capture it happens
[3:54:39.680 --> 3:54:44.480]  with all these government bureaucracies with the fda and the drugs that they approve you wind up
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:50.000]  having a system with the fda where all the drugs are approved on a pass fail basis well we don't
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:55.440]  live in a digital world it isn't either perfectly safe or totally prohibited there is a floating
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:54:59.440]  scale you need to be aware of that you need to understand what the risks are what these drugs
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:04.480]  can do and what they can do to you but they don't give you that information then of course if you
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:10.000]  get something from the fda a prescription drug and you have an adverse reaction to it or somebody
[3:55:10.000 --> 3:55:15.520]  in your family as i've known this happened to people they die from this drug and they were not
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:18.960]  really informed about what happened whether you know they they go through the motion of it just
[3:55:18.960 --> 3:55:23.920]  like if you have a vaccine they give you the the flyer the insert that you don't have time to read
[3:55:23.920 --> 3:55:29.280]  all that information too but of course it's approved by the fda so you can't really win if you sue that
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:34.640]  company in court but now we see with the epa they're saying these patients say that an epa official
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:41.440]  helped monsanto to do this and they say there's 800 cancer patients are suing monsanto claiming
[3:55:41.440 --> 3:55:47.440]  the company failed to warn consumers about a risk of cancer from the weed killer roundup monsanto
[3:55:47.440 --> 3:55:54.880]  insists that roundup is safe and i have personal experience with this with uh we had uh a dog of
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:56:00.720]  ours who died from uh getting out and getting into neighbors lawns after they had been sprayed
[3:56:00.720 --> 3:56:05.040]  that's neighbors would do this and they would put these little signs up and we had a dog that was
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:10.960]  an escape artist he got this uh kind of lefoma that they say happens with these weed killers
[3:56:11.680 --> 3:56:16.000]  and i thought well how in the world did he get this he's a young dog otherwise healthy we we
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:22.720]  fed him uh very healthy food and uh then i heard this news story about farmers who were spraying
[3:56:22.720 --> 3:56:28.960]  their crops with this stuff and they came down with the same cancer that my dog had so the basset
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:34.080]  hound in our neighborhood mar basset hound was really kind of the canary in the coal mine i've
[3:56:34.080 --> 3:56:38.160]  seen this type of thing happen and of course when we look at the water we've had a couple of
