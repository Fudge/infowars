[00:00.000 --> 00:07.140]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting network
[00:16.520 --> 00:18.520]  Waging war on corruption
[00:18.520 --> 00:26.480]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:26.480 --> 00:28.480]  Oh
[00:47.360 --> 00:52.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live it is the 12th day of
[00:52.560 --> 01:02.040]  May 2013 on this live Sunday edition we will be here as we are every Sunday Lord willing 4 to 6 p.m.. Central
[01:02.520 --> 01:04.520]  standard time
[01:04.760 --> 01:13.080]  Obviously Benghazi is unraveling and exploding and Obama's face a lot quicker and a lot faster than I thought it would they tried to cover it up
[01:13.160 --> 01:19.600]  The globalist are not invincible the New World Order and the collectivist are not invincible and
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.640]  They can end up basically going to jail
[01:24.240 --> 01:30.440]  For their crimes the problem is much of the Republican leadership is involved in their own corruption and
[01:30.840 --> 01:33.240]  funded by some of the same globalist interest in
[01:34.080 --> 01:38.800]  Many cases and so they're not going to want to really go after Obama
[01:40.520 --> 01:43.920]  Because then skeletons that are in their closets will be
[01:43.920 --> 01:50.600]  Spotlighted now. No, I know what I just said is well-known common sense. You're like, yeah, we we know that Alex
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.200]  Well, the general public does not know that and
[01:54.640 --> 02:00.200]  I agree with Mike Adams that wrote an article today for natural news comm. It's also up on info wars calm
[02:01.080 --> 02:04.680]  Where he says that he predicts the next seven days
[02:05.440 --> 02:11.280]  You will see some type of giant diversion war stage terror attacks stock market crash
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.400]  Who knows what it'll be and when I open the phones up in the second hour today, I'm gonna cover news of the first hour
[02:17.400 --> 02:23.240]  I want to know what you think that diversion may be or maybe there's not gonna be a diversion. Maybe you disagree
[02:24.080 --> 02:26.840]  And and maybe you don't think Benghazi is a big deal
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.240]  We've known what happened in Benghazi since day one. We've known they've been lying. We know there was a standout
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.200]  we've reared those colonels Schaefer and Steve Pachennick and
[02:38.080 --> 02:40.080]  Webster Tarbley and
[02:40.080 --> 02:45.840]  Wayne Madsen interviews on the nightly news and here on the radio and they're all there on record from seven and a half
[02:45.840 --> 02:52.200]  Months ago the two weeks after it happened. We knew and by the way, most of it was in the news here and there as well
[02:52.920 --> 02:55.160]  So much of the stuff gets hidden in plain view
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.560]  They almost normalize the information by putting it in the paper, but just as a footnote
[03:01.560 --> 03:04.880]  Oh, by the way, it's confirmed the all kind of forces that attacked
[03:04.920 --> 03:08.960]  They were hired to run security in Benghazi by the Pentagon and NATO. Oh
[03:08.960 --> 03:16.140]  By the way, they knew the inside security procedures that no one else knows highest level national security of diplomatic
[03:16.920 --> 03:25.240]  Security detail. Oh, by the way, yeah, there were two predator drones overhead and then the administration lied and said there wasn't remember that
[03:26.880 --> 03:33.380]  But notice it's never a person from the administration saying who says it's just sources say oh
[03:33.380 --> 03:37.380]  And now they're saying Hillary didn't know
[03:39.140 --> 03:41.140]  That's like saying Satan
[03:42.100 --> 03:47.180]  You know didn't know he had a fork tail. This is ridiculous. So that's all
[03:48.660 --> 03:53.260]  Coming up after the break. I'm gonna cover that then I
[03:55.060 --> 04:01.380]  Saw this story on the website yesterday and I called curtain ammo. We we worked on an article together dealing with it
[04:01.380 --> 04:03.300]  and
[04:03.300 --> 04:05.620]  That is all over the country. I've confirmed
[04:06.420 --> 04:08.420]  They have drills
[04:09.260 --> 04:11.260]  Where they practice?
[04:12.820 --> 04:19.380]  Fighting homeschoolers and militias when they attack public schools. In fact, that's the main scenario
[04:20.380 --> 04:27.020]  So it came back out in the news and I thought, you know, why why just have an article about how it happened this one time
[04:27.020 --> 04:31.580]  Why not go back and have some of the background? So here's that article by curtain ammo
[04:31.580 --> 04:37.620]  I've asked him to re-link it this from yesterday in the write-up area of the write-up area for the show
[04:37.780 --> 04:41.020]  It's homeland security funded exercise
[04:41.620 --> 04:43.660]  portrayed homeschoolers as
[04:46.220 --> 04:48.220]  Kevory Stas
[04:48.620 --> 04:51.060]  Like I'm practicing my Spanish terrorist
[04:51.460 --> 04:54.980]  So that is coming up and oh and we told you about this years ago
[04:54.980 --> 04:56.980]  Not that it was hard to know
[04:57.460 --> 05:02.100]  Being at the end of it IRS apologizes for targeting tea party groups
[05:02.100 --> 05:07.500]  I guess Jeffrey Dahmer apologizes as well for what he did. It was all a big accident promise
[05:08.420 --> 05:11.740]  You prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms
[05:11.820 --> 05:17.660]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection
[05:17.900 --> 05:23.300]  When you're sleeping or away from home who's watching out for intruders check out simply safe
[05:23.300 --> 05:30.180]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless. Go to get simply safe calm
[05:30.700 --> 05:37.420]  Simply safe is independent and off the grid. It runs on battery power. So even if the grid goes down, you're protected
[05:37.540 --> 05:46.100]  It's completely customizable so you can use it in your home business boat trailer storage unit or shed get simply safe calm
[05:46.780 --> 05:51.180]  Simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes
[05:51.180 --> 05:55.820]  So there's no need to let a stranger into your home if you move or need to relocate
[05:55.820 --> 05:57.820]  You can take the system with you wherever you go
[05:57.980 --> 06:04.780]  You aren't always at home, but simply safe will stand guard protecting your property 24 hours a day seven days a week
[06:05.140 --> 06:07.540]  Again, that's get simply safe calm
[06:07.540 --> 06:19.700]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[06:19.700 --> 06:37.380]  It is the 12th day of May 2013 on this live worldwide transmission. Thank you for joining us for the Sunday broadcast. I
[06:37.900 --> 06:39.500]  Am here
[06:39.500 --> 06:44.140]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. Until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time live
[06:44.140 --> 06:53.380]  I will cast on XM 244 blasting on over a hundred and fifty five MN FM affiliates and of course streaming audio and video at info wars
[06:53.380 --> 06:58.940]  Dot com and present planet dot TV. I am your host Alex Jones and again
[06:58.940 --> 07:02.820]  Thank you for joining us here on Sunday broadcast. Okay
[07:04.060 --> 07:07.900]  Benghazi gate is going critical and
[07:08.860 --> 07:11.260]  If Obama's globalist controllers
[07:11.260 --> 07:18.420]  Do not stage some type of new war or provocateur or allow or carry out
[07:19.100 --> 07:22.220]  Another big terrorist attack like fast and furious
[07:23.660 --> 07:29.460]  They are in deep trouble. There is no way Obama is going to get out of
[07:31.780 --> 07:36.540]  Ben Gazi because they have been caught in the public's eye
[07:37.540 --> 07:39.540]  Engaging in lies
[07:39.540 --> 07:41.540]  Sure, they got caught
[07:42.980 --> 07:44.980]  Involved in massive fraud
[07:46.580 --> 07:51.380]  When it came to fast and furious shipping guns into Mexico for three years
[07:51.900 --> 07:56.500]  To then track them back to the US to blame the second amendment in an attempt to restrict the second amendment
[07:56.500 --> 08:00.660]  That's called a staged attack. It's called a false flag. It's called a frame up a
[08:01.660 --> 08:07.660]  Self-inflicted wound a provocative event, but still it dribbled out over time
[08:07.660 --> 08:11.420]  It's a complex story and it's hard for people to follow
[08:13.260 --> 08:18.300]  But when you get something like Benghazi people know that
[08:20.740 --> 08:24.900]  Embassies and sub embassies are heavily guarded. They know that there was a standout
[08:24.900 --> 08:26.900]  It's now come out that there was a standout
[08:27.060 --> 08:32.860]  They know they've been lied to and there's such a loss of confidence in the government
[08:32.860 --> 08:38.860]  That if the establishment doesn't go after Obama and his group of cohorts
[08:39.700 --> 08:42.260]  The establishment will lose even more credibility
[08:43.260 --> 08:48.300]  Quite frankly at a Machiavelli level very sickening political level, which I don't support
[08:48.300 --> 08:51.540]  But I'm able to follow that line of future development
[08:52.020 --> 08:55.700]  And scenarios if they left Obama alone for this
[08:55.700 --> 09:02.980]  It would probably only accelerate the awakening of the globalist even more because every time the corrupt get caught
[09:02.980 --> 09:07.500]  But then show that they're in control illegitimately and don't get in trouble
[09:08.500 --> 09:11.860]  It illustrates everything we're talking about now now
[09:12.380 --> 09:18.540]  I wish politically that Obama would be brought to justice that Hillary would be brought to justice that all of them would be
[09:18.540 --> 09:23.740]  So that we could use this to to really wake people up and use this
[09:23.740 --> 09:28.740]  To expand in the other areas of government lies and try to get our government back
[09:29.740 --> 09:31.740]  So that's not just a
[09:32.740 --> 09:39.740]  Private cash machine for offshore special interest that have basically conquered this country thanks to the collaborators
[09:40.740 --> 09:42.740]  In the so-called
[09:43.740 --> 09:44.740]  Mainstream media
[09:44.740 --> 09:46.740]  But all of that said separately
[09:46.740 --> 09:52.740]  Unless Obama stages or his controllers his handlers stage something really big
[09:53.740 --> 09:56.740]  You're going to probably see Obama
[09:57.740 --> 10:00.740]  Get impeached over this and if he doesn't leave office
[10:01.740 --> 10:02.740]  Indicted
[10:03.740 --> 10:06.740]  Because they did order a stand down and here's the problem
[10:06.740 --> 10:12.740]  The military knows there was a stand down from my military sources like Colonel Schaeffer and others
[10:12.740 --> 10:14.740]  They knew the whole story a weekend to it
[10:14.740 --> 10:21.740]  That's why they had the head of the cent com fired and at least ten other generals and admirals because they follow the orders to stand down
[10:22.740 --> 10:25.740]  And watch high-def video and infrared of that
[10:26.740 --> 10:29.740]  Eight-hour event the firefight for about five and a half hours
[10:30.740 --> 10:38.740]  Since it's from the very beginning to the end they sat there and they watched it happen and now it's a crystalline event
[10:38.740 --> 10:43.740]  This isn't collateral damage reabombo building kill a hundred people to get once supposed bad guy
[10:43.740 --> 10:47.740]  And then you find out that guy's really a double agent. Well, why did we do that?
[10:48.740 --> 10:55.740]  No, no, this is in the face and this is what tyrants always do they go too far they get too arrogant
[10:57.740 --> 11:02.740]  When I've talked about the fact that let's be conservative 40% of the military
[11:02.740 --> 11:08.740]  And I'm in a restaurant. I'm walking down the street anywhere in the US about
[11:09.740 --> 11:13.740]  Four times out of ten if it's military in uniform officer enlisted
[11:14.740 --> 11:16.740]  A non-commissioned officer whatever it is
[11:17.740 --> 11:23.740]  The person or group runs over wanting autographs and says we're all awake. We know what's going on
[11:23.740 --> 11:29.740]  I go you're all awake. Well, yeah in our unit our group. Well, what percentage and they say 35 to 50%
[11:29.740 --> 11:33.740]  So I round down to let's say 40%
[11:35.740 --> 11:38.740]  Every time I am gonna be in any city and walk past a group of police
[11:38.740 --> 11:41.740]  Some of them will say hey Alex, we know what's going on. We're not all bad
[11:42.740 --> 11:48.740]  So my point is even the enforcers of this system are waking up in fact more than the general public
[11:48.740 --> 11:53.740]  Because there were the rubber meets the road there. They're seeing the real illegitimate policies
[11:53.740 --> 11:59.740]  And so imagine the military imagine the Navy the Air Force the Marines and the army
[12:00.740 --> 12:02.740]  Especially the Navy and the army
[12:03.740 --> 12:08.740]  Because the Navy ships had their aircraft in the air the army had control of their own drones
[12:08.740 --> 12:14.740]  The CIA drones were separately operated. They all saw in those situation rooms
[12:15.740 --> 12:21.740]  They all watched the stand down and the execution and then the jihadis go and get the mission
[12:21.740 --> 12:25.740]  And the jihadis go and get the missiles and the heavy guns
[12:26.740 --> 12:27.740]  the
[12:28.740 --> 12:30.740]  Truck-born anti artillery
[12:31.740 --> 12:37.740]  Technically medium guns but but but but heavy for for rebel forces to then be shipped into Syria
[12:38.740 --> 12:43.740]  Now I have news on that here today a lot of you that are longtime listeners are gonna say oh we already heard all this Alex
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.740]  You covered this years ago
[12:45.740 --> 12:50.740]  And again that isn't about tooting our horn. It's about saying you better listen to us
[12:51.740 --> 12:54.740]  Because being right in this type of system is dangerous
[12:55.740 --> 12:59.740]  There is a talking point going on and I'm gonna cover it some of the second hour today
[13:02.740 --> 13:04.740]  That I am calling for violence
[13:05.740 --> 13:09.740]  I hear it on my show. I hear it on every other major
[13:10.740 --> 13:12.740]  conservative broadcast
[13:12.740 --> 13:16.740]  That Alex Jones is calling for violence and
[13:17.740 --> 13:20.740]  Obviously a listener as a listener, you know, that's the opposite but
[13:21.740 --> 13:24.740]  I've listened to these calls now. These are people following a script
[13:25.740 --> 13:27.740]  They call them seminar callers and
[13:29.740 --> 13:32.740]  Again if they can take us down folks they can take anybody down
[13:33.740 --> 13:36.740]  I'm in direct quote competition with rush limbaugh
[13:36.740 --> 13:41.740]  I defended him when they tried to get rid of his sponsors last year and take him off the air
[13:41.740 --> 13:46.740]  I even we went into a big ad by the lot that you heard to support
[13:47.740 --> 13:49.740]  Just as an act of resistance
[13:50.740 --> 13:54.740]  Because if they can take rush limbaugh off the air they'll take everybody else off the air
[13:54.740 --> 13:56.740]  It's called hang together or hang separate
[13:56.740 --> 14:02.740]  Even though I disagree with a lot of what rush limbaugh has to say if people go around saying lies about rush limbaugh
[14:02.740 --> 14:04.740]  I am going to counter it
[14:04.740 --> 14:08.740]  Because if they can take him down then they can get all the rest of talk radio
[14:08.740 --> 14:13.740]  Which isn't perfect, but you can call in it's free form. There's long thoughts
[14:14.740 --> 14:17.740]  It's very hard to censor and control. It's teleprompter free
[14:19.740 --> 14:24.740]  And in one of these talking points I was sent a clip where Michael Savage defended me
[14:25.740 --> 14:27.740]  Just last Friday
[14:28.740 --> 14:30.740]  So
[14:30.740 --> 14:34.740]  It's creepy they want to put this idea out
[14:34.740 --> 14:41.740]  So that they can try to arrest me or shut me down or
[14:41.740 --> 14:47.740]  Or try to convince federal state you name it police that I'm planning something
[14:47.740 --> 14:50.740]  And it doesn't matter if you know that's not true
[14:51.740 --> 14:55.740]  If they decide to go with some type of plan like that you have to understand it's pure bull
[14:56.740 --> 15:00.740]  Alright now we're gonna go to break and again the reason we're under attack is manifold
[15:00.740 --> 15:05.740]  And it's it's it's it's it's multifaceted
[15:07.740 --> 15:13.740]  We forced the government arming itself against us preparing for war with libertarians
[15:13.740 --> 15:19.740]  Returning veterans Christians conservatives we forced the last four years that information out and mainlined
[15:21.740 --> 15:24.740]  And even the media admits that the establishment media they hate it
[15:24.740 --> 15:31.740]  We mainlined the fact that criminal elements in the government are running al-Qaeda not just in Libya or Syria
[15:31.740 --> 15:35.740]  But also here and in Europe that's now mainline news
[15:36.740 --> 15:42.740]  We forced it and we forced so many other news items out
[15:42.740 --> 15:45.740]  The system doesn't like it
[15:45.740 --> 15:51.740]  So I hope you realize when you listen to this broadcast you are hearing something that the establishment
[15:51.740 --> 15:56.740]  The real hardcore criminal element of it you know they're all somewhat corrupt
[15:56.740 --> 16:04.740]  But the really centralized cold-blooded globalist anti-family anti-human New World Order eugenics group
[16:04.740 --> 16:07.740]  Absolutely has its eye on me
[16:09.740 --> 16:14.740]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging
[16:14.740 --> 16:20.740]  But nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[16:20.740 --> 16:27.740]  And as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied
[16:27.740 --> 16:34.740]  Now there are hundreds of great products at infowarstein.com but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose
[16:34.740 --> 16:38.740]  37 pounds in just two months
[16:38.740 --> 16:43.740]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound
[16:43.740 --> 16:49.740]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months
[16:49.740 --> 16:51.740]  Now that's results
[16:51.740 --> 16:57.740]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarstein.com and to order just three of their products
[16:57.740 --> 17:03.740]  And you will see the changes in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost immediately

[18:14.740 --> 18:18.740]  Storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone
[18:18.740 --> 18:22.740]  In 2012 we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years
[18:22.740 --> 18:26.740]  You may think out of sight out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected

[20:13.740 --> 20:19.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:19.740 --> 20:34.740]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance
[20:34.740 --> 20:40.740]  Rallying Patriots worldwide
[20:40.740 --> 20:47.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:47.740 --> 20:50.740]  All right, we have some of the biggest
[20:50.740 --> 20:52.740]  No, no, not some of the biggest
[20:52.740 --> 20:56.740]  We have probably undoubtedly the biggest Bilderberg group
[20:56.740 --> 21:00.740]  Global government news we've ever covered
[21:00.740 --> 21:03.740]  Breaking tomorrow morning at eFoodsDirect.com
[21:03.740 --> 21:08.740]  And when we start the second hour I will give you some foreshadowing of that
[21:08.740 --> 21:11.740]  And it's all recorded
[21:11.740 --> 21:14.740]  You get news this big
[21:14.740 --> 21:18.740]  And you get it confirmed and then you don't even know how to report it
[21:18.740 --> 21:23.740]  In a way that really illustrates how big it is
[21:23.740 --> 21:28.740]  Because we under promise and over deliver at M4 Wars
[21:28.740 --> 21:31.740]  Undoubtedly, I mean we're just constantly breaking big news
[21:31.740 --> 21:35.740]  Constantly forcing stuff out into the media
[21:35.740 --> 21:37.740]  And again, I am humbled by that
[21:37.740 --> 21:40.740]  I was pulling up to work today on Sunday
[21:40.740 --> 21:44.740]  I was pulling in and I got out of the truck and I looked at the office and I said
[21:44.740 --> 21:49.740]  I can't believe that I'm one of the most prominent people fighting these folks
[21:49.740 --> 21:52.740]  And that I'm having such a big effect
[21:52.740 --> 21:58.740]  And I don't think that speaks to Alex Jones, the man you're listening to, yours truly
[21:58.740 --> 22:06.740]  Being really anything special other than the fact that I started researching tyranny a long time ago
[22:06.740 --> 22:11.740]  And it shows how pathetic a culture we've become
[22:11.740 --> 22:16.740]  That we've become so acquiescent to corruption that we've just laid down to it
[22:16.740 --> 22:21.740]  And that mild resistance defeats it
[22:21.740 --> 22:25.740]  Mild resistance shoots down their anti-gun bills
[22:25.740 --> 22:28.740]  Mild resistance will stop their open borders
[22:28.740 --> 22:31.740]  Mild resistance will restore prosperity
[22:31.740 --> 22:40.740]  It takes mild resistance and not just being a TV head who believes you're powerless
[22:40.740 --> 22:46.740]  So I'm going to get into that as well and I've just got obviously IRS apologizes for targeting tea party groups
[22:46.740 --> 22:48.740]  They don't just target them
[22:48.740 --> 22:51.740]  They go after radio talk show host
[22:51.740 --> 22:55.740]  They go after anybody who is right of Mao Zedong
[22:55.740 --> 23:01.740]  So I thought they're ridden the left-right paradigm, I've got to use those terms to communicate with people
[23:01.740 --> 23:09.740]  It's kind of like teachers that speak somebody, someone that teaches English-speaking people how to speak Spanish
[23:09.740 --> 23:14.740]  Has to know how to speak English to teach people how to speak Spanish
[23:14.740 --> 23:24.740]  Or someone who is Spanish who wants to learn English needs to be taught by someone who can speak Spanish to teach them English
[23:24.740 --> 23:30.740]  But there is a left-right paradigm within the controlled system
[23:30.740 --> 23:40.740]  But it is the quote right wing that is more advantageous to be used to restore the Republic and common sense
[23:40.740 --> 23:43.740]  And do process and common law
[23:43.740 --> 23:47.740]  And you can give that whatever name you want, but a free society
[23:47.740 --> 23:48.740]  That's what I want
[23:48.740 --> 23:53.740]  People say, what do you stand for? What does Alex Jones want? What are you pushing?
[23:53.740 --> 23:55.740]  That's what I'm pushing
[23:55.740 --> 23:58.740]  And I promote and stand with anybody
[23:58.740 --> 24:05.740]  Whether they be Ted Cruz, Senator Cruz, Senator Rand Paul, DrudgeReport.com, whoever it is
[24:05.740 --> 24:10.740]  If they consistently promote basic liberty, I stand with them
[24:15.740 --> 24:17.740]  And you look at what Obama has done
[24:17.740 --> 24:18.740]  I mean, I've got to be honest
[24:18.740 --> 24:21.740]  Obama was far worse than I thought he would be
[24:21.740 --> 24:26.740]  And Obama signifies the most corrupt elements of the power structure
[24:26.740 --> 24:29.740]  Making a move to get everything they want now
[24:29.740 --> 24:32.740]  They're moving on every front
[24:34.740 --> 24:36.740]  You try to chronicle all the things they're doing
[24:36.740 --> 24:38.740]  It makes the head spin
[24:38.740 --> 24:40.740]  It is dizzying
[24:42.740 --> 24:44.740]  And then there's Benghazi
[24:44.740 --> 24:48.740]  And the only way they're going to get out of this is if they can blackmail the Republicans
[24:48.740 --> 24:50.740]  To stand down and not go after them
[24:50.740 --> 24:53.740]  But the American people aren't going to stand for that
[24:54.740 --> 24:57.740]  We're not going to just sit there and watch Darrell Issa score political points
[24:57.740 --> 25:03.740]  We're not going to sit there and watch Boehner try to block subpoenas or investigations
[25:05.740 --> 25:08.740]  They need to be out of the list of aiding and abetting this
[25:08.740 --> 25:10.740]  And being part of it if they go along with it
[25:10.740 --> 25:14.740]  These are the type of things in history that could break down the whole power structure
[25:14.740 --> 25:17.740]  And thousands of these crooks could go to jail
[25:17.740 --> 25:20.740]  This is how you turn a country around
[25:20.740 --> 25:21.740]  Is events like this
[25:21.740 --> 25:23.740]  But let me warn you
[25:23.740 --> 25:25.740]  They either stage a big event to get out of this
[25:25.740 --> 25:27.740]  Or they blackmail the Republicans to do it
[25:27.740 --> 25:28.740]  And that won't work
[25:28.740 --> 25:30.740]  So the only way out of this is staging a big event
[25:30.740 --> 25:33.740]  And the next seven days we are in prime danger
[25:33.740 --> 25:35.740]  As I said Friday
[25:35.740 --> 25:37.740]  As Mike Adams wrote today
[25:37.740 --> 25:42.740]  We are in prime danger right now of a big staged event
[25:42.740 --> 25:46.740]  They could provocateur it
[25:46.740 --> 25:47.740]  They could fully stage it
[25:47.740 --> 25:48.740]  You name it
[25:48.740 --> 25:49.740]  So we're going to be talking about that
[25:49.740 --> 25:50.740]  But let me tell you why we're in that great danger
[25:50.740 --> 25:52.740]  Let's go to the document cam for TV viewers
[25:52.740 --> 25:55.740]  Radio listeners you can just read along and search all these
[25:55.740 --> 25:56.740]  This is mainstream news
[25:56.740 --> 26:01.740]  Republicans call for depositions in Benghazi probe
[26:01.740 --> 26:03.740]  I'm at Revelation Clinton Barely Interviewed
[26:03.740 --> 26:04.740]  Well of course she wasn't
[26:04.740 --> 26:06.740]  And she's in command of this
[26:06.740 --> 26:07.740]  So that's come out
[26:08.740 --> 26:10.740]  George Stephanophilus
[26:10.740 --> 26:11.740]  George Will
[26:11.740 --> 26:14.740]  Nation systematically misled on Benghazi
[26:14.740 --> 26:16.740]  When you get George Will
[26:16.740 --> 26:18.740]  Coming out against you you're in deep trouble
[26:18.740 --> 26:21.740]  Pressure mounts on boner to
[26:21.740 --> 26:23.740]  I know it's baner
[26:23.740 --> 26:26.740]  The point is to appoint select committee on Benghazi
[26:26.740 --> 26:28.740]  We don't want to select committee
[26:28.740 --> 26:29.740]  We want a special prosecutor
[26:29.740 --> 26:31.740]  We want congressional hearings
[26:31.740 --> 26:33.740]  We want a full up or down vote
[26:33.740 --> 26:36.740]  For impeachment, indictment in the House, trial in the Senate
[26:36.740 --> 26:38.740]  Now
[26:38.740 --> 26:41.740]  By the way we can get it if we demand it
[26:41.740 --> 26:43.740]  They're going to try to set the parameter now
[26:43.740 --> 26:45.740]  Of will there be a select committee?
[26:45.740 --> 26:48.740]  No, not a blue ribbon committee of insiders
[26:48.740 --> 26:53.740]  Huckabee, Benghazi cover up could lead to Obama impeachment
[26:53.740 --> 26:58.740]  Rand Paul challenges Hillary and key Iowa speech
[26:58.740 --> 26:59.740]  Says they're covering up
[26:59.740 --> 27:00.740]  Good for Rand Paul
[27:00.740 --> 27:02.740]  McCain calls Benghazi a cover up
[27:02.740 --> 27:04.740]  Folks when you get McCain
[27:04.740 --> 27:06.740]  Who is one of the worst people in Washington
[27:06.740 --> 27:08.740]  Coming out against you you're in deep
[27:08.740 --> 27:10.740]  Deep you know what
[27:10.740 --> 27:12.740]  That's Politico
[27:15.740 --> 27:17.740]  President of ABC and CBS
[27:17.740 --> 27:19.740]  News have siblings working in wine house
[27:19.740 --> 27:20.740]  With ties to Benghazi
[27:20.740 --> 27:23.740]  And it all goes back and forth on a revolving door as well
[27:23.740 --> 27:25.740]  Like half the people on MSNBC and CNN
[27:25.740 --> 27:27.740]  Have worked in the wine house publicly
[27:27.740 --> 27:29.740]  I mean media matters
[27:29.740 --> 27:31.740]  Which nobody reads and doesn't get any
[27:31.740 --> 27:34.740]  But it is what writes the talking points for MSNBC
[27:34.740 --> 27:37.740]  It's the wine house one of the former transition chief
[27:37.740 --> 27:40.740]  This is a group that calls to criminally infiltrate
[27:40.740 --> 27:42.740]  Libertarian and conservative news agencies
[27:42.740 --> 27:45.740]  And quote destroy them from within
[27:45.740 --> 27:47.740]  These aren't media people these are spies
[27:47.740 --> 27:49.740]  Let's continue here
[27:51.740 --> 27:54.740]  Look at this report NBC spike story
[27:54.740 --> 27:57.740]  I ding Benghazi whistleblowers as Obama
[27:57.740 --> 27:59.740]  Clinton voters yeah but they've tried to
[27:59.740 --> 28:02.740]  Of course they wouldn't be given those jobs if they weren't
[28:02.740 --> 28:05.740]  They just don't like watching their own people
[28:05.740 --> 28:07.740]  Killed and being accomplices to it
[28:07.740 --> 28:09.740]  And they're smart to not go along with it
[28:09.740 --> 28:11.740]  Hicks and others
[28:11.740 --> 28:13.740]  Now here's my final piece on this
[28:13.740 --> 28:16.740]  And we're going to break and come back with the rest of the news
[28:16.740 --> 28:18.740]  The New Yorker magazine
[28:18.740 --> 28:20.740]  When the New Yorker
[28:20.740 --> 28:22.740]  You can't get more establishment liberal
[28:22.740 --> 28:25.740]  Comes out against you and says the white house has been caught lying
[28:25.740 --> 28:28.740]  And Carney's been caught lying it's over
[28:28.740 --> 28:30.740]  This article says they've been caught lying
[28:30.740 --> 28:32.740]  And need to get in trouble
[28:34.740 --> 28:36.740]  You know what that means?
[28:36.740 --> 28:39.740]  That means the new world order is in deep trouble
[28:39.740 --> 28:41.740]  They're going to try to contain it
[28:41.740 --> 28:43.740]  They're going to try to blame it and you know
[28:43.740 --> 28:45.740]  Oh my gosh if Hillary resigns
[28:45.740 --> 28:47.740]  That'll be called a big devastating discrediting
[28:47.740 --> 28:48.740]  No
[28:48.740 --> 28:50.740]  Obama gets impeached
[28:50.740 --> 28:52.740]  Obama gets impeached
[28:52.740 --> 28:55.740]  And then if the republicans try stuff like this
[28:55.740 --> 28:57.740]  We go after them politically
[28:57.740 --> 29:00.740]  It's time to get government back on a short leash right now

[34:16.740 --> 34:22.740]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[34:22.740 --> 34:28.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show

[34:40.740 --> 34:44.740]  I hosted about two days a week with file reports every single day
[34:44.740 --> 34:49.740]  With my team of reporters here coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas
[34:49.740 --> 34:53.740]  Blasting out worldwide, thank you so much for joining us
[34:53.740 --> 34:58.740]  Let me continue here on Benghazi, then I'm going to get into the other news and open the phones up
[34:58.740 --> 35:03.740]  In the next hour was the biggest Bilderberg news we've ever brought out
[35:03.740 --> 35:08.740]  And I've really thought about that, it really is the biggest news
[35:08.740 --> 35:13.740]  And I just don't know if people are going to register how important it is
[35:13.740 --> 35:15.740]  And how big a deal it is
[35:15.740 --> 35:21.740]  But here are the headlines, New Yorker Magazine spinning Benghazi
[35:21.740 --> 35:28.740]  The article they say, oh, the White House has been caught lying
[35:28.740 --> 35:32.740]  Now, they're being forced to say this, they've defended it, they've covered up
[35:32.740 --> 35:36.740]  They've defended Fast and Furious, they've defended it all
[35:36.740 --> 35:40.740]  They've defended the insider deals with the waivers for the healthcare
[35:40.740 --> 35:42.740]  And the power plants being shut down
[35:42.740 --> 35:46.740]  So General Electric made more money and on and on and on
[35:46.740 --> 35:49.740]  And shipping Vault and Cadillac factories in China
[35:49.740 --> 35:52.740]  They've defended all the different programs
[35:52.740 --> 35:56.740]  But now, I'm seeing CNN, I'm reading in New Yorker Magazine
[35:56.740 --> 36:01.740]  I'm seeing John McCain, who's basically a member of the Democratic Party by fiat
[36:01.740 --> 36:05.740]  All of them line up against the White House right now
[36:05.740 --> 36:09.740]  Because they realize people aren't buying their lives anymore
[36:09.740 --> 36:14.740]  I've seen statistics where Congress, you can pull it up, Gallup poll has a 9% approval rating
[36:14.740 --> 36:20.740]  I've seen numbers where 74% of Americans say they see the government as a bigger threat
[36:20.740 --> 36:23.740]  Than terrorists and then other polls of 50% plus percent
[36:23.740 --> 36:26.740]  And those are spin polls, it's worse than that
[36:26.740 --> 36:30.740]  The people are awake by and large, they just don't feel empowered
[36:30.740 --> 36:32.740]  And don't feel like they can do anything
[36:32.740 --> 36:36.740]  All you've got to do is stop buying their lives and withdraw your consent
[36:36.740 --> 36:39.740]  And criticize them everywhere openly
[36:39.740 --> 36:42.740]  And say no to basically everything the federal government does
[36:42.740 --> 36:45.740]  And their system will fall
[36:45.740 --> 36:47.740]  Very simple
[36:47.740 --> 36:50.740]  If it's in the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, support it
[36:50.740 --> 36:53.740]  If it isn't, resist it
[36:53.740 --> 36:57.740]  And the mainstream media is losing
[36:57.740 --> 37:00.740]  Its entire viewership, I mean, they're a shadow of themselves
[37:00.740 --> 37:06.740]  Larry King 10 years ago had 7, 8, 9, 10 million viewers a night
[37:06.740 --> 37:08.740]  Some nights 15 million
[37:08.740 --> 37:12.740]  Same time slot, 400,000 now is what he's got
[37:12.740 --> 37:18.740]  When I went up against Piers Morgan on January 7th, his average viewership was 600,000
[37:18.740 --> 37:21.740]  That night it was 2 million
[37:21.740 --> 37:24.740]  People say, Howard Stern asked me, he said, yeah, what are they afraid of ratings?
[37:24.740 --> 37:26.740]  They should have you on every night with those ratings
[37:26.740 --> 37:29.740]  It ain't about ratings at that level
[37:29.740 --> 37:35.740]  It's about putting out the talking points and making it look like everybody's going along with the system
[37:35.740 --> 37:39.740]  But when that facade finally falls, which it's starting to do
[37:39.740 --> 37:41.740]  Katie barred the door
[37:41.740 --> 37:44.740]  7,000 anti-mine tanks
[37:44.740 --> 37:46.740]  2 billion bullets
[37:46.740 --> 37:50.740]  Checkpoints, manuals saying Christians and conservatives
[37:50.740 --> 37:54.740]  And returning veterans and libertarians or terrorists isn't going to work
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.740]  In fact, that propaganda is so over the top
[37:56.740 --> 37:59.740]  That's what's woken up the police and military
[37:59.740 --> 38:01.740]  All over the country, they're brought into briefings
[38:01.740 --> 38:04.740]  It's in the Denver Post and they tell them, Christians are terrorists
[38:04.740 --> 38:06.740]  We're training to take their guns
[38:06.740 --> 38:10.740]  To see who and the state police are for that
[38:10.740 --> 38:15.740]  See, the corruption is getting to a level now
[38:15.740 --> 38:17.740]  Yeah, there's the Fox News headline
[38:17.740 --> 38:20.740]  Army labeled evangelicals as religious extremists
[38:20.740 --> 38:24.740]  Along with al-Qaeda, all Catholics were listed as terrorists
[38:24.740 --> 38:28.740]  Go read it, you cannot make this up
[38:28.740 --> 38:31.740]  Listed as religious extremists next to al-Qaeda
[38:31.740 --> 38:34.740]  And said, prone to terrorism
[38:34.740 --> 38:36.740]  Where are Catholics blowing anything up?
[38:36.740 --> 38:38.740]  They list all evangelicals
[38:38.740 --> 38:41.740]  And you're like, if you're a new listener, you're like, that sounds nuts
[38:41.740 --> 38:44.740]  Hey, I ain't the one, keep using the word ain't to illustrate it
[38:44.740 --> 38:48.740]  I'm not the one who's doing this and writing this
[38:48.740 --> 38:50.740]  I know it sounds crazy
[38:50.740 --> 38:52.740]  I'm just reporting on what they're doing
[38:52.740 --> 38:58.740]  Don't confuse the messenger with the message
[38:58.740 --> 39:02.740]  Do not ever do that
[39:02.740 --> 39:07.740]  Look, they list Catholicism, quote, U.S. Christian next to Ku Klux Klan and al-Qaeda
[39:07.740 --> 39:09.740]  I'm sorry
[39:09.740 --> 39:12.740]  Ultra-Orthodox is listed as terrorists
[39:12.740 --> 39:17.740]  You know, Jews that are Hasidic that try to follow ultra-ditions, kind of like the Amish
[39:17.740 --> 39:18.740]  They're listed as extremists
[39:18.740 --> 39:23.740]  I saw a new FBI report where they list the Amish as potential extremist
[39:23.740 --> 39:28.740]  It's basically anybody that doesn't put on a skirt as a man
[39:28.740 --> 39:29.740]  I'm not joking
[39:29.740 --> 39:33.740]  And run out and announce they're a metrosexual and they hate their family
[39:33.740 --> 39:36.740]  And again, I'm not attacking men that want to wear skirts
[39:36.740 --> 39:38.740]  The point is the establishment on record
[39:38.740 --> 39:41.740]  Wants to break up the natural order of things
[39:41.740 --> 39:45.740]  And wants to demonize those of us that don't want to wear a skirt
[39:50.740 --> 39:52.740]  Now, ladies and gentlemen
[39:52.740 --> 39:56.740]  We are right across roads here and I want to
[39:56.740 --> 39:59.740]  I want to play a clip here right now
[39:59.740 --> 40:03.740]  Because, you know, when I say we're going to have 1776, they try to take the guns
[40:03.740 --> 40:05.740]  1776 was Bill of Particulars
[40:05.740 --> 40:10.740]  Most of it was an Info War leading up to 1774, 1775
[40:10.740 --> 40:12.740]  I don't want that conflict to happen
[40:12.740 --> 40:14.740]  I want to fix things peaceably
[40:14.740 --> 40:16.740]  And we have defeated the gun bills for now
[40:16.740 --> 40:20.740]  And we are going to try to get rid of the open border bill
[40:20.740 --> 40:22.740]  That even Wired reports when I told you years ago
[40:22.740 --> 40:23.740]  Because all these bills do it
[40:23.740 --> 40:26.740]  Creates a national ID card biometric system
[40:26.740 --> 40:28.740]  We're going to be getting to that today
[40:28.740 --> 40:31.740]  But I continually see it in the media
[40:31.740 --> 40:33.740]  From MSNBC to you name it
[40:33.740 --> 40:36.740]  Saying I'm calling for violence
[40:36.740 --> 40:41.740]  And you need to understand that, A, when you hear callers calling and call for it
[40:41.740 --> 40:43.740]  I say it's not a good idea
[40:43.740 --> 40:47.740]  We should exhaust every remedy and then only have violence as a defense
[40:47.740 --> 40:50.740]  If people try to forcibly inoculate us or take us to a FEMA camp
[40:50.740 --> 40:55.740]  Or, you know, all this crazy stuff that's now in the Army manuals
[40:55.740 --> 40:58.740]  We need to fight like the Dickens
[40:58.740 --> 41:02.740]  Before we get to that point
[41:02.740 --> 41:05.740]  So that we never reach it
[41:05.740 --> 41:09.740]  And then Adam Kokesh, Libertarian Talk Show host
[41:09.740 --> 41:11.740]  He comes out a week ago
[41:11.740 --> 41:14.740]  It's in the news, it breaks, it's all over the news
[41:14.740 --> 41:17.740]  I already knew about it a few days before but decided to see what happened
[41:17.740 --> 41:19.740]  Because I said on air, I don't think it's a good idea
[41:19.740 --> 41:23.740]  To have an armed march on Washington D.C.
[41:23.740 --> 41:28.740]  But once it broke in the news, I covered it
[41:28.740 --> 41:30.740]  I've been asked to have an armed march, you've heard it on air
[41:30.740 --> 41:33.740]  No exaggeration, probably a thousand times over the years
[41:33.740 --> 41:35.740]  18 years on air
[41:35.740 --> 41:37.740]  Not an armed march to overthrow the government
[41:37.740 --> 41:39.740]  An armed march, they say to illustrate we're in charge
[41:39.740 --> 41:42.740]  We've got the right, D.C. Heller five years ago
[41:42.740 --> 41:46.740]  Four and a half years ago ruled that they can't bar you from having guns in D.C.
[41:46.740 --> 41:48.740]  Loaded to protect yourself if you're not a felon
[41:48.740 --> 41:52.740]  But still, almost five years later, you can't have guns
[41:52.740 --> 41:55.740]  So yes, the police chief is in the wrong
[41:55.740 --> 41:59.740]  They're all in the wrong, but I don't want the confrontation
[41:59.740 --> 42:01.740]  They can provocateur it
[42:01.740 --> 42:03.740]  But once Adam said he's going to do that on July 4th
[42:03.740 --> 42:05.740]  Once, it's already a big story
[42:05.740 --> 42:08.740]  We've got to have cameras there, people need to go there with cameras
[42:08.740 --> 42:09.740]  If that's your choice
[42:09.740 --> 42:13.740]  To document it as observers to make sure nothing goes wrong
[42:13.740 --> 42:17.740]  And to make sure they don't provocateur something
[42:17.740 --> 42:21.740]  That has now been spun on the web that I have endorsed it
[42:21.740 --> 42:24.740]  And all the usual suspects are the ones saying it
[42:24.740 --> 42:28.740]  That I have said let's go out and let's go armed
[42:28.740 --> 42:32.740]  Now again, if I say it's someone's right to do that
[42:32.740 --> 42:36.740]  And I get that it's civil disobedience, civil disobedience means breaking laws that are unconstitutional
[42:36.740 --> 42:39.740]  Like blacks being told they have to sit at the back of the bus or sit at the front of the bus
[42:39.740 --> 42:42.740]  It's civil disobedience because you're doing something that's illegal
[42:42.740 --> 42:45.740]  The police chief of DC said I will allow you to protest
[42:45.740 --> 42:47.740]  Even though it's civil disobedience
[42:47.740 --> 42:49.740]  Because they say protesting is illegal
[42:49.740 --> 42:51.740]  See, that shows how far we've gone
[42:51.740 --> 42:53.740]  It's not illegal
[42:53.740 --> 42:56.740]  Carrying your guns to DC loaded is illegal
[42:56.740 --> 42:59.740]  So I've said since it's already happening
[42:59.740 --> 43:01.740]  We need to make sure they don't try to set something up
[43:01.740 --> 43:05.740]  Then they've spin that into I'm Calling for Armed Conflict
[43:05.740 --> 43:07.740]  We'll talk about it when we get back
[43:35.740 --> 43:39.740]  The continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state
[43:39.740 --> 43:43.740]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen
[43:43.740 --> 43:47.740]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship
[43:47.740 --> 43:53.740]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner
[43:53.740 --> 43:57.740]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan
[43:57.740 --> 44:00.740]  The police state isn't coming, it's here

[47:48.740 --> 47:51.740]  I want to hear from you on Benghazi Gate
[47:51.740 --> 47:53.740]  Do you think it's going to bring them down?
[47:53.740 --> 47:56.740]  Are you concerned about the establishment staging a new war
[47:56.740 --> 47:59.740]  Or letting terrorists attack us or staging it themselves
[47:59.740 --> 48:02.740]  I mean they stage fast and furious and so many other events
[48:02.740 --> 48:05.740]  What will they do or is one element of the establishment
[48:05.740 --> 48:08.740]  Going to allow the destruction of Obama
[48:08.740 --> 48:12.740]  Because the Democratic Party is getting too much power too fast
[48:12.740 --> 48:15.740]  Because even the establishment understands the separation of powers
[48:15.740 --> 48:18.740]  And that doesn't want a man on the white horse completely taking over
[48:18.740 --> 48:21.740]  And that's what Homeland Security and Obama is doing
[48:21.740 --> 48:24.740]  Did they move too fast for the globalist liking
[48:24.740 --> 48:28.740]  Toll free number to join us on the Sunday show 877-789 Alex

[48:39.740 --> 48:44.740]  And we will get you up and on the air today
[48:44.740 --> 48:49.740]  Now again, I've played the clips, you've probably seen it
[48:49.740 --> 48:51.740]  MSNBC, well you probably haven't seen it
[48:51.740 --> 48:53.740]  Nobody watches that
[48:53.740 --> 48:57.740]  They come out and say, Alex Jones and Ron Paul
[48:57.740 --> 49:00.740]  Probably 10 times last year I've seen it myself, clips online
[49:00.740 --> 49:03.740]  They're going to cause violence, they want violence
[49:03.740 --> 49:06.740]  Why, they're rhetoric is going to make crazy people
[49:06.740 --> 49:09.740]  Go out and do something violent, I've had 2020
[49:09.740 --> 49:13.740]  You name it, all of them ask me that question
[49:13.740 --> 49:16.740]  While it's the government buying billions of bullets
[49:16.740 --> 49:20.740]  The government saying Homeland Security is for their political opposition
[49:20.740 --> 49:23.740]  I've got more news coming up in the next hour with a news clip
[49:23.740 --> 49:27.740]  Where Homeland Security funding exercises nationwide portraying
[49:27.740 --> 49:30.740]  Home schoolers as terrorists
[49:30.740 --> 49:35.740]  And angry parents that attack the school with militias
[49:35.740 --> 49:41.740]  That isn't really happening, but it's part of a demonization program
[49:41.740 --> 49:44.740]  So that maybe they can stage it down the road and people will believe it
[49:44.740 --> 49:47.740]  Because well, we drilled for that
[49:47.740 --> 49:51.740]  There's a huge classical tyranny operation going on
[49:51.740 --> 49:53.740]  And then if you look at it, they act like you're crazy
[49:53.740 --> 49:56.740]  The Washington Post is flipping out today
[49:56.740 --> 50:02.740]  Establishment media attacks Rand Paul for saying globalist plotting against the Constitution
[50:02.740 --> 50:07.740]  And Rand Paul is quoted as saying Obama has teamed up with globalists to take over America
[50:07.740 --> 50:11.740]  And they call it the black helicopter crowd
[50:11.740 --> 50:15.740]  No, Obama says our military is under NATO now
[50:15.740 --> 50:19.740]  And Congress can't see the Homeland Security civil unrest plans
[50:19.740 --> 50:24.740]  Obama says that he's trying to bring in a new world order globalism
[50:24.740 --> 50:27.740]  Here's the actual Washington Post headline
[50:27.740 --> 50:30.740]  Rand Paul, Obama is working with anti-American globalist
[50:30.740 --> 50:33.740]  Plotting against our Constitution
[50:33.740 --> 50:35.740]  Well, yeah, that's what the UN treaty does
[50:35.740 --> 50:39.740]  By the way, they use the UN treaty, though it's not even ratified
[50:39.740 --> 50:44.740]  I read the import, export, defense department document that Cody Wilson was sent
[50:44.740 --> 50:46.740]  We broke that on Thursday here
[50:46.740 --> 50:50.740]  Notice on Friday, no one gave us credit in the mainstream media for breaking that
[50:50.740 --> 50:52.740]  With the 3D printable gun
[50:52.740 --> 50:56.740]  And they stated import, export, rules, and treaties
[50:56.740 --> 51:04.740]  And said that it's against the law to transfer a 380 single shot plan across the border
[51:04.740 --> 51:10.740]  When that's not been ratified
[51:10.740 --> 51:12.740]  We are going under globalism
[51:12.740 --> 51:14.740]  There are globalist corporate interest
[51:14.740 --> 51:18.740]  $85 billion a month of taxpayer money goes to mainly foreign banks
[51:18.740 --> 51:20.740]  Under QE3
[51:20.740 --> 51:23.740]  What do you think five years of banker bailouts have been?
[51:23.740 --> 51:25.740]  Most of that money, more than half of it
[51:25.740 --> 51:28.740]  Almost all of it, the last few years, goes overseas
[51:28.740 --> 51:32.740]  But the details are quote, classified, the Federal Reserve says
[51:32.740 --> 51:33.740]  The Federal Reserve is private
[51:33.740 --> 51:37.740]  How does it classify something with the President and the Treasury
[51:37.740 --> 51:41.740]  That is federal from Congress when they control the purse springs
[51:41.740 --> 51:46.740]  We're under globalism and they say, oh, he's discredited for talking like this
[51:46.740 --> 51:48.740]  They're like, oh, that's discrediting
[51:48.740 --> 51:49.740]  No, no, no, it's not discrediting
[51:49.740 --> 51:51.740]  We need more people, see if more people go
[51:51.740 --> 51:54.740]  Yeah, why is the private Federal Reserve, mainly foreign shareholders
[51:54.740 --> 51:56.740]  Why is it running our monetary policy?
[51:56.740 --> 51:59.740]  Why can't it be audited?
[51:59.740 --> 52:06.740]  Why is Congress not doing its job of oversight and the power of the purse in the Constitution?
[52:06.740 --> 52:09.740]  The globalists have gotten away with such outrageous stuff
[52:09.740 --> 52:15.740]  That if we ever just start talking like Rand Paul and Alex Jones
[52:15.740 --> 52:20.740]  See, that's why they're like, Congress is having bullet purchase hearings
[52:20.740 --> 52:24.740]  Because of that nut Jones, they're discredited
[52:24.740 --> 52:27.740]  And Congress goes, no, you did buy billions of bullets and you're buying more
[52:27.740 --> 52:29.740]  And you're training to use them on us
[52:29.740 --> 52:32.740]  It's over, folks, if we want it to be
[52:32.740 --> 52:35.740]  Their outrageous takeover is outrageous
[52:35.740 --> 52:40.740]  We're not outrageous for pointing it out
[52:40.740 --> 52:44.740]  But that's something you see, cognitive dissonance, learned helplessness
[52:44.740 --> 52:53.740]  Mastoccom syndrome, normalcy bias, Overton window, whatever political, philosophical, psychological scenario term
[52:53.740 --> 52:55.740]  You want to use or describe it
[52:55.740 --> 53:00.740]  It always happens when the neighbor gets caught with dead people in trunks in their house
[53:00.740 --> 53:03.740]  Or in the backyard or in the refrigerator
[53:03.740 --> 53:06.740]  No one ever believes it because they're not like that
[53:06.740 --> 53:08.740]  So that couldn't be going on
[53:08.740 --> 53:10.740]  And it's the same thing with these people
[53:10.740 --> 53:13.740]  It's a fact, we're under UNESCO UN Treaty
[53:13.740 --> 53:16.740]  It's a fact, we're under Agenda 21
[53:16.740 --> 53:20.740]  It's a fact, they have federally taken the country over
[53:20.740 --> 53:24.740]  And are now trying to federalize and demonizing the states that say, hey
[53:24.740 --> 53:26.740]  The federal government's been taken over
[53:26.740 --> 53:28.740]  We want to get the country back
[53:28.740 --> 53:32.740]  They call us secessionist or people in revolt
[53:32.740 --> 53:34.740]  We're not in revolt
[53:34.740 --> 53:37.740]  If I was on an airplane and there was a hijacking
[53:37.740 --> 53:43.740]  And I saw them bound the pilot, co-pilot and the flight attendants
[53:43.740 --> 53:49.740]  And I saw the hijackers get in the uniform of the pilot
[53:49.740 --> 53:52.740]  I wouldn't kneel before them and say, well, you're wearing
[53:52.740 --> 53:55.740]  No, I would know, that's an illegitimate hijacker
[53:55.740 --> 53:57.740]  I don't care if you wear a uniform
[53:57.740 --> 54:02.740]  But I'm convinced with the average American that a guy could knock the pilot on the head
[54:02.740 --> 54:06.740]  Put on his uniform and the average American would actually kneel before them
[54:06.740 --> 54:08.740]  And would go into mass Stockholm syndrome
[54:08.740 --> 54:09.740]  This is what happens now
[54:09.740 --> 54:13.740]  And their studies out showing more people go under Stockholm syndrome now
[54:13.740 --> 54:15.740]  When they're kidnapped and stuff
[54:15.740 --> 54:20.740]  When Stockholm syndrome was first discovered and codified in the 60s
[54:20.740 --> 54:22.740]  It was much rarer in studies
[54:22.740 --> 54:25.740]  Now people shift into it, it's delusional thinking
[54:25.740 --> 54:27.740]  Well, I'll just say everything's okay
[54:27.740 --> 54:30.740]  I'll just say the guy going, hey, that's not the pilot, that's the hijacker
[54:30.740 --> 54:31.740]  You're a conspiracy theorist, sir
[54:31.740 --> 54:34.740]  Well, we all saw him, we all saw him get in the uniform
[54:34.740 --> 54:38.740]  He's got the big beard, he's got the gun in his hand, he's got the hand grenade
[54:38.740 --> 54:40.740]  Shut up and we'll all get out of this safe
[54:40.740 --> 54:43.740]  Are you not saying he's a hijacker?
[54:43.740 --> 54:45.740]  That's right, conspiracy theorist
[54:45.740 --> 54:47.740]  They lie to themselves
[54:47.740 --> 54:51.740]  And so the only way they're going to get out of this
[54:51.740 --> 54:54.740]  Is staging a terror attack or launching a big war
[54:54.740 --> 54:55.740]  You can bet money
[54:55.740 --> 54:58.740]  And I guess they'll do it in the next week or two
[54:58.740 --> 55:01.740]  Or they've been told you're going down, sit down and shut up
[55:01.740 --> 55:04.740]  And there's been a rebellion within the power structure
[55:04.740 --> 55:07.740]  And I've been told by some high-level sources that's happened
[55:07.740 --> 55:09.740]  Not that there's even perfect people doing this
[55:09.740 --> 55:12.740]  But they understand, they don't want to live under Mao Zedong
[55:12.740 --> 55:16.740]  They understand it's bad for business to live under something that's corrupt
[55:16.740 --> 55:19.740]  So let's play Michael Savage Friday
[55:19.740 --> 55:22.740]  A syndicated radio host has been a guest, we're going to get him back on soon
[55:22.740 --> 55:25.740]  Having to say, well, I don't know if that's true
[55:25.740 --> 55:27.740]  But Alex Jones seems like a good guy
[55:27.740 --> 55:29.740]  With a guy clearly going off talking points
[55:29.740 --> 55:31.740]  Because we're hearing these same talking points everywhere
[55:31.740 --> 55:35.740]  Without proof that I'm saying attack the police
[55:35.740 --> 55:37.740]  When I'm saying wake up the police
[55:37.740 --> 55:40.740]  See, they're worried about that because I want to unify America
[55:40.740 --> 55:41.740]  Let's go to this clip
[55:41.740 --> 55:46.740]  Anyway, so I want to touch on the question that you had asked
[55:46.740 --> 55:50.740]  Which is what media figures are goading us into a potential shooting war
[55:50.740 --> 55:52.740]  Which would be a catastrophe
[55:52.740 --> 55:54.740]  Yes, a catastrophe is right
[55:54.740 --> 55:56.740]  So I'm going to let you name names
[55:56.740 --> 55:59.740]  I don't know that I'll agree or disagree, but you're going to name them
[55:59.740 --> 56:01.740]  Who's doing this?
[56:01.740 --> 56:05.740]  Alright, well, first of all, I want to say that much like you
[56:05.740 --> 56:11.740]  I believe that the quickest and most effective way to tear a nation apart
[56:11.740 --> 56:16.740]  Is to pin the police against the citizens and the citizens against the police
[56:16.740 --> 56:21.740]  And I feel that we have several provocateurs doing this
[56:21.740 --> 56:25.740]  And to go back into the analysis of the wolf and sheep's clothing
[56:25.740 --> 56:29.740]  I believe we have many patriots in patriot clothing
[56:29.740 --> 56:33.740]  Which are to be feared even more than the murderous government
[56:33.740 --> 56:40.740]  Well, hold on, you think the patriot movement itself could provoke the civil war?
[56:40.740 --> 56:42.740]  I believe it's certainly possible
[56:42.740 --> 56:46.740]  When you look at the murderous government, of course
[56:46.740 --> 56:48.740]  They wear their colors at the gate
[56:48.740 --> 56:51.740]  They wave their flag openly
[56:51.740 --> 56:56.740]  But one of their most effective weapons would be to infiltrate a movement
[56:56.740 --> 57:02.740]  That sets up a sort of opposition ideologically to...
[57:02.740 --> 57:06.740]  Alright, so they're doing a counter-movement, I get it
[57:06.740 --> 57:09.740]  In other words, there's a genre of provocateurs within the patriot movement
[57:09.740 --> 57:13.740]  Trying to trigger some kind of inflammatory event
[57:13.740 --> 57:16.740]  So this issue of the a genre of provocateur
[57:16.740 --> 57:18.740]  You think they've penetrated what?
[57:18.740 --> 57:23.740]  The Tea Party movement to try to provoke some kind of reaction from the government?
[57:23.740 --> 57:26.740]  I would hope not so much the Tea Party movement
[57:26.740 --> 57:30.740]  I believe the Tea Party as a whole, generally speaking, is...
[57:30.740 --> 57:32.740]  Absolutely, I've never seen any violence
[57:32.740 --> 57:34.740]  Alright, hit pause
[57:34.740 --> 57:36.740]  Hit pause, when we come back, I'll finish the rest of the clip in the second hour
[57:36.740 --> 57:39.740]  The guy goes, it's Alex Jones, he wants violence, he says be violent
[57:39.740 --> 57:42.740]  When I'm saying, wake the military and police up
[57:42.740 --> 57:44.740]  And then the guy's saying, I'm saying violence
[57:44.740 --> 57:47.740]  And Michael Savage says, well, Alex Jones seems like a good man to me
[57:47.740 --> 57:50.740]  The point is, is that this is the lies
[57:50.740 --> 57:54.740]  And that guy calling in probably works for MSNBC or somebody
[57:54.740 --> 58:21.740]  Stay with us

[1:00:51.740 --> 1:00:55.740]  They're married to the state, at least that's how the globalists would have it
[1:00:55.740 --> 1:00:59.740]  On this Mother's Day transmission, I want to welcome you all for joining us
[1:00:59.740 --> 1:01:01.740]  Look, I'll take some calls in this segment
[1:01:01.740 --> 1:01:06.740]  I ran out of time to play that Michael Savage clip, it was longer than I remembered it being
[1:01:06.740 --> 1:01:14.740]  But the point is there's a real talking point that libertarians, conservatives, gun owners, veterans are going to start shooting and killing everybody
[1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:17.740]  And it's a way to pain us as terrorists
[1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:22.740]  And there is a talking point that I'm trying to pit people against the police
[1:01:22.740 --> 1:01:26.740]  That I'm trying to start a civil war when I'm trying to stop a civil war
[1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:30.740]  Now when the police are federalized and act like goons and thugs
[1:01:30.740 --> 1:01:35.740]  I say it's wrong
[1:01:35.740 --> 1:01:39.740]  Mindlessly worshiping the police is what allows tyranny to come in
[1:01:39.740 --> 1:01:43.740]  You want to worship police? Go to North Korea
[1:01:43.740 --> 1:01:45.740]  Let's go to Wayne in Florida and then we'll go to everybody else
[1:01:45.740 --> 1:01:48.740]  Wayne, you're on the air
[1:01:48.740 --> 1:01:52.740]  You're doing Alex's Mother's Day to your wife
[1:01:52.740 --> 1:01:54.740]  Go ahead, sir
[1:01:54.740 --> 1:02:02.740]  I was just thinking about the Benghazi incident and something that's kind of interested me in the past
[1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:07.740]  Probably weak and having some family in the military and knowing some military officers
[1:02:07.740 --> 1:02:12.740]  Is something that Dr. Steve Picinic touched on a little bit the other day
[1:02:12.740 --> 1:02:21.740]  And that's that all of these officers that obey that stand down order can be court-martialed and should be court-martialed
[1:02:21.740 --> 1:02:28.740]  Unless they go public and explain that in the moment they didn't
[1:02:28.740 --> 1:02:34.740]  In law, if they come out admit they were wrong and admit they committed a crime
[1:02:34.740 --> 1:02:38.740]  Then they'll just get kicked out of the military for standing down and being part of the murders
[1:02:38.740 --> 1:02:42.740]  If they go along with it and don't speak out when we finally take the country back
[1:02:42.740 --> 1:02:47.740]  They will be eligible for a very long stint in prison
[1:02:47.740 --> 1:02:54.740]  That's what some of the people that I know that are not necessarily officers
[1:02:54.740 --> 1:03:02.740]  Well, and the officers, I thought with three different officers and they all said that now that it's really coming out
[1:03:02.740 --> 1:03:12.740]  What really happened, they're very concerned about the upper echelon officer corps that we're seeing out of this
[1:03:12.740 --> 1:03:17.740]  Well remember it wasn't just going to be high level officers in those situation rooms
[1:03:17.740 --> 1:03:22.740]  I mean there was all sorts of people right down to enlisted that sat there and watched all this happen
[1:03:22.740 --> 1:03:29.740]  Well that's the point that they were really making is the number of people
[1:03:29.740 --> 1:03:40.740]  You know their fellow soldiers, officers enlisted men that actually obeyed what essentially was an illegal order
[1:03:40.740 --> 1:03:45.740]  The difference, Admiral Moore, who later became the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
[1:03:45.740 --> 1:03:49.740]  I've interviewed him before he died, I interviewed the head jag officer
[1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:56.740]  They all knew they were on the ships, they were ordered to stand down in terms of jets back in 67 with the attack on the Liberty by LBJ
[1:03:56.740 --> 1:04:00.740]  They told McNamara no, and then the president came on and said that's an order
[1:04:00.740 --> 1:04:05.740]  And they sat there and watched the ship attack for another two hours by aircraft and torpedo boats
[1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:12.740]  And they went public years later through channels and tried to expose it
[1:04:12.740 --> 1:04:18.740]  And they said they felt guilty and felt like they helped be involved in that crime
[1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:22.740]  But at least they went public, the difference is we can't wait 20-30 years this time
[1:04:22.740 --> 1:04:28.740]  And it shows how much danger we're in that the military would stand down and watch something like that happen
[1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:34.740]  It shows how everybody's collateral damage now you see for the globalist agenda
[1:04:34.740 --> 1:04:40.740]  Exactly, well and it just shows me too how far along we are as you bring this out a lot
[1:04:40.740 --> 1:04:45.740]  To see the number of people that just don't even really care much about this
[1:04:45.740 --> 1:04:50.740]  They're like, oh, this is just, you know, something went wrong and somebody messed up and that did
[1:04:50.740 --> 1:04:59.740]  But when you have a congresswoman, former ambassador, you know, sitting right there saying that, you know, that was the president's decision
[1:04:59.740 --> 1:05:04.740]  Absolutely, and that's what's going on, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us
[1:05:04.740 --> 1:05:30.740]  For more calls and a lot more
[1:05:34.740 --> 1:05:41.740]  This is an amazing deal and you will love the way real soap makes your skin feel

[1:05:49.740 --> 1:05:54.740]  Alex and his staff have used these earth-friendly pure soaps for years

[1:06:25.740 --> 1:06:29.740]  All right, folks, you're tuned into the Sunday edition
[1:06:29.740 --> 1:06:35.740]  I haven't even gotten into the huge Bilderberg group news that we're going to be fully breaking tomorrow
[1:06:35.740 --> 1:06:41.740]  11 a.m. Central with a Paul Watson report that I'm working on with him all weekend
[1:06:41.740 --> 1:06:44.740]  And that I'll be working with him tomorrow morning on
[1:06:44.740 --> 1:06:51.740]  And if you don't know who Bilderberg Group is, at the bottom of the hour, I'll tell you and give you some of the history and why it's so important
[1:06:51.740 --> 1:06:54.740]  That we forced the dinosaur media to cover it
[1:06:54.740 --> 1:07:00.740]  And what one of our sources told us, we went and confirmed it, and it is devastating news
[1:07:00.740 --> 1:07:05.740]  I'll give you the big part of it now, but all the details tomorrow
[1:07:05.740 --> 1:07:11.740]  Googleberg, we've known Google is at the core of Bilderberg at least for 10 years
[1:07:11.740 --> 1:07:15.740]  Google, of course, created by the NSA and CIA, that's now been declassified
[1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:23.740]  We broke that in 2005 with what David Steele, formerly of the CIA
[1:07:23.740 --> 1:07:27.740]  But now Google is actually running it
[1:07:27.740 --> 1:07:35.740]  And the Bilderberg Group meeting really starts next week
[1:07:35.740 --> 1:07:40.740]  So people know I always say, it's coming up, it's coming up, and I'll just give you the news right there
[1:07:40.740 --> 1:07:46.740]  We've got recordings, we've got, they're a whole agenda
[1:07:46.740 --> 1:07:52.740]  And let me tell you, we've got some really good sources
[1:07:52.740 --> 1:08:01.740]  Of course they surveil everything I do, but even with all their big computer programs, they're not going to be able to figure out where I got this information
[1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:07.740]  So, by the way, this is the kind of stuff you get out in a couple days
[1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:12.740]  In fact, I wouldn't have waited two days, but there's so much data, we've got to collate it all and get it together
[1:08:12.740 --> 1:08:15.740]  It's part of really a two-year investigation
[1:08:15.740 --> 1:08:19.740]  I said I'd get to that, I'm already getting to it
[1:08:19.740 --> 1:08:24.740]  The point is, tomorrow 11am central infowars.com
[1:08:24.740 --> 1:08:27.740]  Audio streams, you don't have a local AMRAF in your area
[1:08:27.740 --> 1:08:35.740]  Free podcast there on infowars.com and so much more, XM244, they just moved the whole channel I was on from 166 to 244
[1:08:35.740 --> 1:08:39.740]  Okay, where to begin here with this hour?
[1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:44.740]  I got a bunch of Bilderberg news, I want to get to IRS, apologizes for targeting Tea Party groups
[1:08:44.740 --> 1:08:50.740]  That's part of bringing Obama down, that's been going on for a long time, now it's in the Associated Press
[1:08:50.740 --> 1:08:57.740]  We've got biometric databases of all adult Americans hidden immigration bill
[1:08:57.740 --> 1:09:01.740]  That's been in all the last versions under Bush, so we knew it'd be there
[1:09:01.740 --> 1:09:06.740]  U.S. government funding Al Qaeda, that's mainstream news
[1:09:06.740 --> 1:09:10.740]  We're going to be getting into all that coming up in between your phone calls
[1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:13.740]  But last hour I tried to get to this, but misjudged the time
[1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:18.740]  I'm going to play this clip of Michael Savage that I just happened to come across
[1:09:18.740 --> 1:09:24.740]  Linked on infowars.com and one of the articles, people making comments
[1:09:24.740 --> 1:09:29.740]  And it's all over the place, I mean I'll randomly tune into local radio and I'll hear
[1:09:29.740 --> 1:09:34.740]  I'm afraid Alex Jones wants to play people off against the police and wants violence
[1:09:34.740 --> 1:09:40.740]  And it's always said the same, or I'll be sent an MSNBC clip, there's like four of them in the last month
[1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:45.740]  Alex Jones is going to cause violence along with Ron Paul who wants violence
[1:09:45.740 --> 1:09:50.740]  In fact I played that clip about a month ago on air, Ron Paul wants violence?
[1:09:50.740 --> 1:09:56.740]  And what Dr. Magoo does or something or Mr. Magoo?
[1:09:56.740 --> 1:09:59.740]  You take Ron Paul, Mr. Magoo and combine them and you get Dr. Magoo
[1:09:59.740 --> 1:10:02.740]  I mean the last thing I want is violence
[1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:06.740]  And I've had guests on that have said we need to have violence, no we don't
[1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:11.740]  That will absolutely let the globalist control the media, poses the good guys
[1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:14.740]  We are hurting them in the info war
[1:10:14.740 --> 1:10:18.740]  The last thing we want is violence
[1:10:18.740 --> 1:10:22.740]  The globalists have to stage their own violence, they get called all the time to pose as saviors
[1:10:22.740 --> 1:10:27.740]  So I played part of the call last time, we just tuned in, the guy's like I'm concerned about provocateurs
[1:10:27.740 --> 1:10:30.740]  I'm concerned about somebody trying to infiltrate the Tea Party
[1:10:30.740 --> 1:10:34.740]  And this guy's either a liberal foundation operative, they're on record
[1:10:34.740 --> 1:10:37.740]  They hire thousands of them to call in with seminar calls every day
[1:10:37.740 --> 1:10:42.740]  Or it's a defense contractor or a cop who's buying into the propaganda
[1:10:42.740 --> 1:10:49.740]  That you fight the establishment by never criticizing what the paramilitary police do
[1:10:49.740 --> 1:10:57.740]  You know that any criticism of government is some type of sedition
[1:10:57.740 --> 1:11:01.740]  That's government sedition against us
[1:11:01.740 --> 1:11:06.740]  So I wanted to play this clip of, and by the way I get it on the other side
[1:11:06.740 --> 1:11:10.740]  I get calls constantly, well you hear them going
[1:11:10.740 --> 1:11:14.740]  Michael Savage said something bad about you
[1:11:14.740 --> 1:11:16.740]  And then we go look it up and he didn't say it
[1:11:16.740 --> 1:11:20.740]  Plus Paul Watson listens almost every day, I listen sometimes when I'm not busy
[1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:24.740]  But it's not true, and I've talked to Savage off air before
[1:11:24.740 --> 1:11:27.740]  He's had people go and send him stuff trying to stir stuff up
[1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:32.740]  Man I don't have time to sit here and get in fights with Michael Savage
[1:11:32.740 --> 1:11:36.740]  He doesn't have time and there's people trying to get this going
[1:11:36.740 --> 1:11:39.740]  Because they're afraid, they're always going to Rand Paul and going
[1:11:39.740 --> 1:11:42.740]  How dare you go on Alex Jones' show
[1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:45.740]  So I don't even call Rand Paul, I don't even need him on the shows
[1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:47.740]  I've supported him, I've known him for a long time
[1:11:47.740 --> 1:11:51.740]  I've interviewed him for 16 years, back when he used to campaign for his dad
[1:11:51.740 --> 1:11:54.740]  Talked to him off air quite a few times
[1:11:54.740 --> 1:11:58.740]  The last time Rand Paul was on he called us and wanted to come on
[1:11:58.740 --> 1:12:02.740]  But MSNBC like says don't go on Alex's show Rand Paul
[1:12:02.740 --> 1:12:05.740]  Like they're going to tell him what to do
[1:12:05.740 --> 1:12:07.740]  It's the same thing with the Washington Post
[1:12:07.740 --> 1:12:10.740]  Oh he's discredited, he says Obama's plotting with globalist
[1:12:10.740 --> 1:12:14.740]  To overthrow our constitution, what do you call the UN gun treaty?
[1:12:14.740 --> 1:12:19.740]  It puts us under the UN, what do you call three different generals?
[1:12:19.740 --> 1:12:23.740]  Three different hearings, with up to five generals per hearing
[1:12:23.740 --> 1:12:27.740]  Last year saying we're under NATO command, Congress doesn't command the military
[1:12:27.740 --> 1:12:33.740]  Congress doesn't, isn't in control of the purse strings
[1:12:33.740 --> 1:12:36.740]  That's a total lie
[1:12:36.740 --> 1:12:39.740]  You've got to call it for what it is
[1:12:39.740 --> 1:12:42.740]  So they're going to try to say we're crazy, we want violence
[1:12:42.740 --> 1:12:46.740]  And they're going to try to get us fighting with each other
[1:12:46.740 --> 1:12:50.740]  I don't agree with everything Michael Savage says, I disagree with everything I say
[1:12:50.740 --> 1:12:53.740]  Vice versa, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, any of those people
[1:12:53.740 --> 1:12:55.740]  But the point is at least they're defending the Second Amendment
[1:12:55.740 --> 1:12:58.740]  Property rights, the family, national sovereignty
[1:12:58.740 --> 1:13:01.740]  We're dealing with Obama and the globalist, okay?
[1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:03.740]  And I am not here to end fight with people
[1:13:03.740 --> 1:13:06.740]  And I salute Michael Savage because I talk to Watson about this
[1:13:06.740 --> 1:13:08.740]  He says no this happens all the time
[1:13:08.740 --> 1:13:14.740]  There are people calling in lobbying Michael Savage to say bad things about me
[1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:16.740]  And they do it to everybody else
[1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:18.740]  I talk to other big media people that aren't globalist
[1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:22.740]  Same thing happens because they're afraid of us linking up
[1:13:22.740 --> 1:13:26.740]  They want us fighting with each other, it's classical, divide and conquer
[1:13:26.740 --> 1:13:31.740]  If you support the Bill of Rights, I don't care if you're liberal, conservative, libertarian, whatever you call yourself
[1:13:31.740 --> 1:13:36.740]  If you support due process and freedom, you better come together
[1:13:36.740 --> 1:13:40.740]  Against what this federal government's doing, headed up by Obama
[1:13:40.740 --> 1:13:43.740]  And that's why they're coming after us, because we're simply Americans
[1:13:43.740 --> 1:13:46.740]  You know who I am? I'm an American
[1:13:46.740 --> 1:13:50.740]  You don't know what I stand for? Listen to the show, read the news websites I have
[1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:54.740]  Don't listen to people that call in not giving evidence
[1:13:54.740 --> 1:13:56.740]  Listen to this caller, go back to it
[1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:59.740]  Absolutely, I've never seen any violence, they don't even leave a gum wrapper on the floor
[1:13:59.740 --> 1:14:04.740]  So I would, of all the groups in America, they're probably the most benign
[1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:06.740]  And the least provocative
[1:14:06.740 --> 1:14:09.740]  Exactly, I agree completely
[1:14:09.740 --> 1:14:16.740]  When I've seen or associated with other Tea Party members of the Tea Party
[1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:23.740]  So where is this talk of go to war, get your guns, get your ammo, get the bulletproof vest, get the drum magazine
[1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:27.740]  Who's provoking this? Who is doing this?
[1:14:27.740 --> 1:14:36.740]  In my personal estimation, Alex Jones for as much good as he's done as far as spreading information, accurate information
[1:14:36.740 --> 1:14:43.740]  To a certain extent, yes, he does transmit facts, yes, he does give out good information
[1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:50.740]  But at the same time, there are certain things that the man does that really lead me to question his motives and his agenda
[1:14:50.740 --> 1:14:55.740]  Well, rather than going into it, because I think Alex is a good man who does the right thing
[1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:59.740]  But if he's gone overboard, I can't speak to that, he'd have to speak to that
[1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:07.740]  The fact is that the dogs of hate have been tearing at people of faith since the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s
[1:15:07.740 --> 1:15:13.740]  The fact of the matter is the dogs of hate on the left have torn apart our courts and schools, the military, the police
[1:15:13.740 --> 1:15:18.740]  And they have snarled at us, sufficient to provoke some people into an early reaction
[1:15:18.740 --> 1:15:25.740]  I would like them to understand that they should back down at this time and not call themselves cowards for doing so
[1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:30.740]  There are revolutionaries, there are counter-revolutionaries, and then there are anti-revolutionaries
[1:15:30.740 --> 1:15:33.740]  I consider myself Michael Savage an anti-revolutionary
[1:15:33.740 --> 1:15:36.740]  We do not want to burn the nation to the ground in order to save it
[1:15:36.740 --> 1:15:38.740]  Mark it, I'm going to leave it at that
[1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:39.740]  Alright
[1:15:39.740 --> 1:15:40.740]  That's a very good question
[1:15:40.740 --> 1:15:44.740]  Okay, see how the guy, and if you hear the whole call, it's online, we'll post it
[1:15:44.740 --> 1:15:48.740]  He says, you know, there's a group doing this, they're calling for violence, and he says, well, who is it?
[1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:49.740]  It's Alex Jones
[1:15:49.740 --> 1:15:53.740]  When I, kudos to what he just said, that's what I say
[1:15:53.740 --> 1:15:58.740]  I'm a restorationist, I want the Republic back, I'm not a revolutionary
[1:15:58.740 --> 1:16:01.740]  The globalists are the revolutionaries
[1:16:01.740 --> 1:16:15.740]  And this is the type of bull, you notice the guy didn't have any proof of that, he just said I was saying that
[1:16:31.740 --> 1:16:34.740]  And is powerful enough to help protect you and your family

[1:17:09.740 --> 1:17:16.740]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving
[1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:22.740]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[1:17:22.740 --> 1:17:29.740]  And across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[1:17:29.740 --> 1:17:34.740]  That our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy
[1:17:34.740 --> 1:17:40.740]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity

[1:19:17.740 --> 1:19:24.740]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover

[1:20:21.740 --> 1:20:24.740]  I have sworn upon the altar of God
[1:20:24.740 --> 1:20:30.740]  Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[1:20:30.740 --> 1:20:32.740]  Thomas Jefferson
[1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:36.740]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:42.740]  You see our illegitimate government or the people that have hijacked it
[1:20:42.740 --> 1:20:46.740]  They're the ones gearing up for violence, they're the ones carrying out violence worldwide
[1:20:46.740 --> 1:20:50.740]  They're the ones with secret torture bases and all the rest of this garbage
[1:20:50.740 --> 1:20:53.740]  And then they're always trying to say those of us that want our country back
[1:20:53.740 --> 1:20:56.740]  That we're the violent ones, that we're planning something
[1:20:56.740 --> 1:21:00.740]  And it's a way to change the subject off of Benghazi Gate
[1:21:00.740 --> 1:21:04.740]  It's a way to change the subject off of Tea Party groups and talk show hosts
[1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:06.740]  Targeted by the IRS
[1:21:06.740 --> 1:21:09.740]  That's stuff that Nixon did to his enemies
[1:21:09.740 --> 1:21:13.740]  And that's what led to the beginning of his impeachment
[1:21:13.740 --> 1:21:16.740]  But he stepped down before it went to the Senate
[1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:20.740]  And so they're just trying to change the subject
[1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:22.740]  Now I'm going to go to your phone calls right now
[1:21:22.740 --> 1:21:25.740]  I'm asking callers, what do you think of Benghazi Gate
[1:21:25.740 --> 1:21:28.740]  Or are you concerned like I am that Obama or his handlers
[1:21:28.740 --> 1:21:31.740]  May try to stage something
[1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:36.740]  And what could they stage to politically divert off of Benghazi
[1:21:36.740 --> 1:21:38.740]  It'll have to be mega massive
[1:21:38.740 --> 1:21:41.740]  And again, I'm not saying the Republicans are going to save us either
[1:21:41.740 --> 1:21:44.740]  But punishing government for wrongdoing
[1:21:44.740 --> 1:21:46.740]  Is what will get it back under control
[1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:49.740]  If you just let it run wild and oh, that's just what they do
[1:21:49.740 --> 1:21:52.740]  If they get away with Benghazi Gate and Fast and Furious
[1:21:52.740 --> 1:21:55.740]  And Cilandra Gate, Cylindra Gate
[1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:58.740]  All the other things they've done
[1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:00.740]  The Obamacare scam, all of it
[1:22:00.740 --> 1:22:02.740]  Trying to legalize 30 million illegal aliens
[1:22:02.740 --> 1:22:05.740]  And give them free welfare and food stamps
[1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:07.740]  To vote to take our guns
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:09.740]  It's time to get angry
[1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:11.740]  It's time to get on the offense
[1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:14.740]  The Republican Party itself is going after the Tea Party
[1:22:14.740 --> 1:22:15.740]  Trying to say, oh, they're extreme
[1:22:15.740 --> 1:22:17.740]  Rand Paul's extreme
[1:22:17.740 --> 1:22:21.740]  Alex Jones, you've got the Democrats and Republicans
[1:22:21.740 --> 1:22:23.740]  Attacking Rand Paul
[1:22:23.740 --> 1:22:25.740]  Attacking me
[1:22:25.740 --> 1:22:27.740]  You've got National Review going
[1:22:27.740 --> 1:22:29.740]  Alex Jones is an extremist
[1:22:29.740 --> 1:22:31.740]  Yeah, I'm extremely patriotic
[1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:33.740]  I'm extremely accurate
[1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:36.740]  And I know what you're doing
[1:22:36.740 --> 1:22:39.740]  Just like you went after Barry Goldwater
[1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:42.740]  Hell, National Review didn't like Ronald Reagan at first
[1:22:42.740 --> 1:22:44.740]  These people
[1:22:44.740 --> 1:22:46.740]  William F. Buckley was CIA folks
[1:22:46.740 --> 1:22:48.740]  To control the right wing in this country
[1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:50.740]  Look it up
[1:22:50.740 --> 1:22:52.740]  Let's talk to Shauna
[1:22:52.740 --> 1:22:54.740]  In Texas, then Shawn, Michael, Kelly, many others
[1:22:54.740 --> 1:22:56.740]  Go ahead, Shauna
[1:22:56.740 --> 1:22:58.740]  Hi, Alex, are you?
[1:22:58.740 --> 1:23:00.740]  I'm great, what's on your mind today with the Benghazi?
[1:23:00.740 --> 1:23:02.740]  Okay, okay, so
[1:23:02.740 --> 1:23:04.740]  First I want to make sure you know that
[1:23:04.740 --> 1:23:07.740]  Sandy Hook found in the Batman Rises two times
[1:23:07.740 --> 1:23:09.740]  I don't know if you know that
[1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:11.740]  But I believe it all has to do with Benghazi
[1:23:11.740 --> 1:23:14.740]  Benghazi, Aurora, Sandy Hook, all of them
[1:23:14.740 --> 1:23:17.740]  Are all the tax against Americans
[1:23:17.740 --> 1:23:19.740]  Within Aurora happening
[1:23:19.740 --> 1:23:21.740]  About a year later
[1:23:21.740 --> 1:23:23.740]  The legislation's going through
[1:23:23.740 --> 1:23:25.740]  Sandy Hook killing our kids
[1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:27.740]  That's in a month of new legislation going through
[1:23:27.740 --> 1:23:29.740]  And if I wanted to let you know
[1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:32.740]  The other time Sandy Hook found in that movie
[1:23:32.740 --> 1:23:35.740]  Yes, ma'am, we're the ones that broke that
[1:23:35.740 --> 1:23:37.740]  And I appreciate your call
[1:23:37.740 --> 1:23:40.740]  The media says, Alex Jones says Batman's
[1:23:40.740 --> 1:23:43.740]  Connected to the shootings for some reason
[1:23:43.740 --> 1:23:45.740]  I didn't say it after the fact
[1:23:45.740 --> 1:23:48.740]  I said this film looks like it's triggering
[1:23:48.740 --> 1:23:51.740]  And programming with subliminals
[1:23:51.740 --> 1:23:53.740]  For mentally ill people when I saw the trailer
[1:23:53.740 --> 1:23:56.740]  And we put the video out, it got like half a million views
[1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:59.740]  The makers tried to do a takedown order on YouTube
[1:23:59.740 --> 1:24:02.740]  I challenged it, they tried to have my video taken down
[1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:05.740]  And I said
[1:24:05.740 --> 1:24:07.740]  It promotes terror bombings, mass shootings
[1:24:07.740 --> 1:24:10.740]  You name it, it's going to be a trigger
[1:24:10.740 --> 1:24:13.740]  And if you know how psyops work
[1:24:13.740 --> 1:24:16.740]  Then that's why in both events
[1:24:16.740 --> 1:24:19.740]  You can actually look this up, they say it's strange
[1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:22.740]  Sandy Hook was listed on the map of where Bane set attack
[1:24:22.740 --> 1:24:24.740]  And the same thing with Aurora
[1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:26.740]  And the guy was connected to Batman
[1:24:26.740 --> 1:24:28.740]  And how did Alex Jones say this?
[1:24:28.740 --> 1:24:31.740]  It sounds crazy, I've just learned how these people operate
[1:24:31.740 --> 1:24:34.740]  They love to brag about what they do ahead of time
[1:24:34.740 --> 1:24:37.740]  Or they have things that are also meant with subliminals
[1:24:37.740 --> 1:24:40.740]  To trigger people that have been basically programmed
[1:24:40.740 --> 1:24:43.740]  And not just programmed in some CIA mind control base
[1:24:43.740 --> 1:24:46.740]  They can now program people that are on psychotropic drugs
[1:24:46.740 --> 1:24:48.740]  Through the televisions
[1:24:48.740 --> 1:24:50.740]  It's amazing
[1:24:50.740 --> 1:24:53.740]  Let's go ahead, let's talk to Sean in Canada
[1:24:53.740 --> 1:24:55.740]  Sean, you're on the air
[1:24:55.740 --> 1:24:58.740]  Yes, hi Alex, nice to talk to you
[1:24:58.740 --> 1:25:03.740]  I was reading a book by Stephen Pigeon
[1:25:03.740 --> 1:25:07.740]  Prime Crimes, Treason and Libya
[1:25:07.740 --> 1:25:10.740]  I don't know if you've seen the book
[1:25:10.740 --> 1:25:14.740]  But he's a lawyer and he has all the things listed in his book
[1:25:14.740 --> 1:25:17.740]  Which they are criminal for
[1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:23.740]  But if anybody wants to read the book, they can
[1:25:23.740 --> 1:25:26.740]  Sure, tell us what you think about Benghazi
[1:25:26.740 --> 1:25:29.740]  Well, I think it was complete
[1:25:29.740 --> 1:25:32.740]  Well, it's murder and treason
[1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:34.740]  If you can't really...
[1:25:34.740 --> 1:25:36.740]  What else is it?
[1:25:36.740 --> 1:25:38.740]  What else is it?
[1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:41.740]  Do you think Obama will get away with it?
[1:25:41.740 --> 1:25:43.740]  They always have before
[1:25:43.740 --> 1:25:45.740]  Why would anything change?
[1:25:45.740 --> 1:25:48.740]  Well, I mean, sometimes things do change
[1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:50.740]  These people are not invincible
[1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:53.740]  And I think that if we have the attitude of that nothing's going to change
[1:25:53.740 --> 1:25:55.740]  It won't, but I do hear you
[1:25:55.740 --> 1:25:57.740]  And I'm not saying you're wrong
[1:25:57.740 --> 1:26:00.740]  But this has really caught people's imagination
[1:26:00.740 --> 1:26:02.740]  This has really gotten through to people
[1:26:02.740 --> 1:26:04.740]  So I don't know how they'll get away with it
[1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:06.740]  And again, as for mind control
[1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:10.740]  15 years ago, they had Pokemon episodes that aired in Japan
[1:26:10.740 --> 1:26:14.740]  More than 10,000 children had convulsions when it aired
[1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:17.740]  They aired it here, and even more children had convulsions
[1:26:17.740 --> 1:26:22.740]  Just the flashing lights can cause a convulsion
[1:26:22.740 --> 1:26:26.740]  And if you go study the mainline science, they can flicker a television
[1:26:26.740 --> 1:26:29.740]  Via the programming in the show
[1:26:29.740 --> 1:26:31.740]  And then put subliminal straight through
[1:26:31.740 --> 1:26:35.740]  Just like a magician can hypnotize highly suggestible people
[1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:37.740]  You've ever been to a big magic show
[1:26:37.740 --> 1:26:41.740]  And the magician calls up like 10 people and asks them questions and does things
[1:26:41.740 --> 1:26:43.740]  And then sends most of them back
[1:26:43.740 --> 1:26:46.740]  They're finding the suggestible people
[1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:49.740]  What do you think advertising is?
[1:26:49.740 --> 1:26:54.740]  Back in the 50s, they would put in millisecond clips of a desert
[1:26:54.740 --> 1:26:57.740]  With a Coca-Cola dripping with water
[1:26:57.740 --> 1:26:59.740]  An ice cold Coca-Cola
[1:26:59.740 --> 1:27:02.740]  And they found it doubled purchases of Coca-Cola
[1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:06.740]  This is taught in radio TV film
[1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:09.740]  It's in the textbooks, famous cases
[1:27:09.740 --> 1:27:13.740]  Few years later, they would flash hot dogs and popcorn saying, I'm hungry
[1:27:13.740 --> 1:27:17.740]  And it would more than double people purchasing hot dogs and stuff
[1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:19.740]  It's everywhere, and that's 1950s technology
[1:27:19.740 --> 1:27:21.740]  That's what I was getting at there, that sounds crazy
[1:27:21.740 --> 1:27:23.740]  Let me show you a few news articles
[1:27:23.740 --> 1:27:28.740]  Then I'm going to go to break and come back with Kelly, Cheryl, Georgette, Richard, Diane, Andrew and John
[1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.740]  To have your questions and comments ready
[1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:33.740]  And again, I want to hear what you think about Benghazi
[1:27:33.740 --> 1:27:36.740]  I want to hear whether you think Obama is going to get away with this
[1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:39.740]  And maybe the last caller is, you know, correct
[1:27:39.740 --> 1:27:44.740]  I certainly hope not, because if they can get away with anything, sky's the limit
[1:27:44.740 --> 1:27:47.740]  But let me show you these articles right here, if you're a TV viewer
[1:27:47.740 --> 1:27:54.740]  Libya protest prompts U.S. to evacuate diplomats, put troops on alert, Washington Post
[1:27:54.740 --> 1:28:01.740]  Now, who, two years ago, spent a year injecting more than 50,000 al-Qaeda operatives
[1:28:01.740 --> 1:28:05.740]  Through Benghazi out of Egypt into Libya
[1:28:05.740 --> 1:28:08.740]  Who took out the old Western-backed dictator, because he wouldn't go along with it
[1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:11.740]  Hosni Mubarak out of Egypt, Obama
[1:28:11.740 --> 1:28:15.740]  Who, in England, at that Google campus a year before
[1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:18.740]  In Watford, England, that's part of what's breaking tomorrow
[1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:24.740]  Who funded the Arab Spring out of Watford, England
[1:28:24.740 --> 1:28:29.740]  Google, they are all involved in this, ladies and gentlemen
[1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:33.740]  And now their own people are running around going crazy
[1:28:33.740 --> 1:28:36.740]  But they don't care, now they can just invade again to take out the people they put in
[1:28:36.740 --> 1:28:38.740]  Order out of chaos, here's another one
[1:28:38.740 --> 1:28:43.740]  Under the black flag of Al-Qaeda, the Syrian city ruled by gangs of extremists
[1:28:43.740 --> 1:28:47.740]  London Telegraph, it goes on to admit Al-Qaeda forces put in by the West
[1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:51.740]  Are running around killing Christians, Jews and others
[1:28:51.740 --> 1:28:54.740]  And they fly the Al-Qaeda flag over the city
[1:28:54.740 --> 1:28:58.740]  That's London Telegraph, oh, you heard that here two years ago?
[1:28:58.740 --> 1:29:02.740]  Now you get to read it in the London Telegraph
[1:29:02.740 --> 1:29:04.740]  That's just some of what's coming up
[1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:18.740]  Milderburg, the IRS coming up for patriots and your calls

[1:32:08.740 --> 1:32:12.740]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating
[1:32:12.740 --> 1:32:15.740]  I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working
[1:32:15.740 --> 1:32:20.740]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[1:32:20.740 --> 1:32:27.740]  And as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied
[1:32:27.740 --> 1:32:30.740]  Now there are hundreds of great products at eFoodsDirect.com
[1:32:30.740 --> 1:32:38.740]  But I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months
[1:32:38.740 --> 1:32:43.740]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst and Rebound
[1:32:43.740 --> 1:32:46.740]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day
[1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:49.740]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months
[1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:51.740]  Now that's results
[1:32:51.740 --> 1:32:55.740]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarseteam.com
[1:32:55.740 --> 1:32:57.740]  And to order just three of their products

[1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:29.740]  For Christ's sake Ben, don't you understand?
[1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:33.740]  Americans love television, they wean their kids on it
[1:33:33.740 --> 1:33:39.740]  Listen, they love game shows, they love wrestling, they love sports and violence
[1:33:39.740 --> 1:33:44.740]  So what do we do? We give them what they want
[1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:48.740]  We're number one Ben, that's all that counts
[1:33:48.740 --> 1:33:51.740]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years
[1:33:51.740 --> 1:33:55.740]  Well I haven't been in show business as long as you have Killian
[1:33:55.740 --> 1:34:01.740]  But I'm a quick learner, so I'm going to give the audience what I think they want
[1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:05.740]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:10.740]  And the heart of the Resistance
[1:34:10.740 --> 1:34:15.740]  Alright, I gotta get to at least the next 10 callers, Michelle through John
[1:34:15.740 --> 1:34:20.740]  And of course tomorrow, 11am to 2pm central, we'll be covering all this in more detail
[1:34:20.740 --> 1:34:25.740]  And I've got to hit this other news on Bilderberg just briefly and some of the other news
[1:34:25.740 --> 1:34:29.740]  But I'm going to try to hurry and get right to your calls because I really want to hear what you have to say
[1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:34.740]  It's a great frustration of mine that I cover so much news and don't go to enough calls
[1:34:34.740 --> 1:34:36.740]  Because I love the directions you take us
[1:34:36.740 --> 1:34:44.740]  By the way, the May issue of infowars magazine has sold out except for a couple thousand I held back
[1:34:44.740 --> 1:34:48.740]  I saw the stack in the warehouse, it's almost completely gone
[1:34:48.740 --> 1:34:54.740]  In fact, by the time you even go to infowarsstore.com
[1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:57.740]  Unless they've got some of these in the warehouse, I don't know where they're at
[1:34:57.740 --> 1:35:01.740]  You won't be able to get the special May false flag stage terror attack
[1:35:01.740 --> 1:35:05.740]  Boston bombing issue that has three free bumper stickers in it
[1:35:05.740 --> 1:35:09.740]  Now we put 80,000 of these on the streets from San Antonio to Austin, Texas
[1:35:09.740 --> 1:35:11.740]  On the I-35 corridor
[1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:16.740]  So if you go in a restaurant or business and see the magazine, that's the only other way to get it
[1:35:16.740 --> 1:35:20.740]  We're going to start the syndication of it into other cities very soon
[1:35:20.740 --> 1:35:24.740]  It's backlogged and the big work pile I'm working on
[1:35:24.740 --> 1:35:26.740]  But we are moving in that direction
[1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:29.740]  So be sure and go to infowarsstore.com
[1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:33.740]  We also held some back for those that subscribe to the next 12 issues
[1:35:33.740 --> 1:35:37.740]  You can also get it that way or again buy them in bulk at cost
[1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:39.740]  It's just that those sold out
[1:35:39.740 --> 1:35:41.740]  When you're in infowarsstore.com
[1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:47.740]  We have the best prices and one of the widest selections of non-air loom, non-hybrid seeds
[1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:50.740]  That create their own seeds after you plant them
[1:35:50.740 --> 1:35:54.740]  Wow, the life cycle, what an unusual extremist thought
[1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:59.740]  And we have the best pro pure water filters with a 10% off promo code water
[1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:02.740]  System I use, a lot of research went into that
[1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:04.740]  Books, t-shirts, films, all of it
[1:36:04.740 --> 1:36:06.740]  A lot of new stuff added
[1:36:06.740 --> 1:36:11.740]  infowarsstore.com or 24 hours a day, 7 days a week you can call and ask any questions

[1:36:32.740 --> 1:36:37.740]  I put almost all the money back into this operation, some of it we save and back up for emergencies
[1:36:37.740 --> 1:36:40.740]  And other things, but the point is my mission is to take on the globalist
[1:36:40.740 --> 1:36:45.740]  So infowarsstore.com, thank you for your support out there
[1:36:45.740 --> 1:36:49.740]  Or link through at infowars.com, the shopping carts, we have several
[1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:52.740]  Okay, let me just briefly hit this news as quickly as possible
[1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:55.740]  Obviously tomorrow on the 3 hour show I'll get to more of this
[1:36:55.740 --> 1:36:59.740]  But look at this, I told you this years ago, I've had guests on about this
[1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:04.740]  It's a fact, ILS apologizes for targeting tea party groups
[1:37:04.740 --> 1:37:07.740]  But this only came out because of whistleblowers
[1:37:07.740 --> 1:37:10.740]  And it turned out they've known this for years
[1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:12.740]  And the Treasury did nothing
[1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:18.740]  So why is the Treasury Department only now admitting this?
[1:37:18.740 --> 1:37:22.740]  By the way, when Nixon did this he was going to be impeached for it
[1:37:22.740 --> 1:37:26.740]  So if you commit a crime
[1:37:26.740 --> 1:37:31.740]  And it's illegal to do stuff like this, to share the data, to go after people
[1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:35.740]  Because they're political views, who's going to go to jail for that?
[1:37:35.740 --> 1:37:37.740]  You know, I'm sick and tired of apologies
[1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:44.740]  And this is only coming out now because there are whistleblowers which they've tried to prosecute
[1:37:44.740 --> 1:37:48.740]  So again, see we told you so on that front
[1:37:48.740 --> 1:37:53.740]  And here's Kurt Nemo's article from Friday about it
[1:37:53.740 --> 1:37:56.740]  Harris admits harassing patriot groups
[1:37:56.740 --> 1:37:58.740]  Unbelievable
[1:37:58.740 --> 1:38:03.740]  Here's another one, biometric database of all adult Americans hidden in immigration reform
[1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:07.740]  We told you that weeks ago, we told you that years ago, it's in every bill
[1:38:07.740 --> 1:38:10.740]  It's a national ID card, it's in every immigration bill
[1:38:10.740 --> 1:38:13.740]  It's a national ID card for you
[1:38:13.740 --> 1:38:14.740]  The illegals are above the law
[1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:17.740]  And I'm not personally even against the illegals, I don't blame them coming here
[1:38:17.740 --> 1:38:21.740]  Have your kids for free, get free welfare, globalists have imploded their countries
[1:38:21.740 --> 1:38:24.740]  The point is it's meant to bankrupt the country
[1:38:24.740 --> 1:38:28.740]  Again, are the globalists above the law? That is the question I'm asking you
[1:38:28.740 --> 1:38:31.740]  Look at this article I showed you earlier, London Telegraph
[1:38:31.740 --> 1:38:36.740]  U.S. government puts al-Qaeda in charge of areas of controlled Syria
[1:38:36.740 --> 1:38:40.740]  Out of the black flag of al-Qaeda, the Syrian city ruled by gangs of extremists
[1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:44.740]  Is our government above the law? It's not our government
[1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:48.740]  It's not above the law, it's outside of the law, and it's gotten away with bloody murder
[1:38:48.740 --> 1:38:50.740]  They call that anti-government
[1:38:50.740 --> 1:38:53.740]  I love my country, I fear my government
[1:38:53.740 --> 1:38:55.740]  I fear it being out of control
[1:38:55.740 --> 1:38:57.740]  And when the government fears the people, there is liberty
[1:38:57.740 --> 1:38:59.740]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny
[1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:01.740]  And if you don't like that, you don't like America
[1:39:01.740 --> 1:39:04.740]  Because that's a Thomas Jefferson quote
[1:39:04.740 --> 1:39:09.740]  Laying down to corruption enslaves us, it destroys our future
[1:39:09.740 --> 1:39:13.740]  Are they above the law? That's what I'm asking you
[1:39:13.740 --> 1:39:16.740]  How long can their bluff go, where they go
[1:39:16.740 --> 1:39:20.740]  Oh, look at Rand Paul, he imagines a new world order global government
[1:39:20.740 --> 1:39:23.740]  He's a cook, nanny, nanny, boo-boo
[1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:28.740]  It's a seal of approval now when they attack you
[1:39:28.740 --> 1:39:33.740]  I was telling a GQ writer that the other day
[1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:36.740]  And I was telling the same thing to a Esquire writer
[1:39:36.740 --> 1:39:39.740]  And I was telling it to a TV producer calling me
[1:39:39.740 --> 1:39:42.740]  They're questioning me, and I said, look, I don't need to convince you of this stuff
[1:39:42.740 --> 1:39:44.740]  Plus you're not going to listen anyways, most of you
[1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:47.740]  Or if you do, your editor won't let you publish it
[1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:53.740]  I said, you're going to find out, all this stuff's real
[1:39:53.740 --> 1:39:56.740]  And I tell these people stuff and they look at me like I'm crazy
[1:39:56.740 --> 1:40:01.740]  Like Delta Force is running riots and secretly buying off police chiefs
[1:40:01.740 --> 1:40:04.740]  And then the guy sends me a text message going, wow, I looked that up
[1:40:04.740 --> 1:40:08.740]  It's true Delta Force was here and there, I'm like, yeah, I know
[1:40:08.740 --> 1:40:11.740]  Okay, I'm not making this stuff up
[1:40:11.740 --> 1:40:14.740]  They're in there when they're training to put us in FEMA camps
[1:40:14.740 --> 1:40:18.740]  And I can show you the Army document, two years old, on Army.mil
[1:40:18.740 --> 1:40:20.740]  Where they trained to put us in camps
[1:40:20.740 --> 1:40:24.740]  Can you please pull up the Army camp memo?
[1:40:24.740 --> 1:40:26.740]  I want to give people the actual name of the...
[1:40:26.740 --> 1:40:31.740]  Just type in US Army Re-education Camp
[1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:33.740]  And you'll be at Army.mil
[1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:36.740]  They use the Soviet term Re-education Camp
[1:40:36.740 --> 1:40:40.740]  I mean, you talk about Creepville, man
[1:40:40.740 --> 1:40:43.740]  It's FM 3-39.40
[1:40:43.740 --> 1:40:47.740]  Interment Resettlement Operations, February 2010
[1:40:47.740 --> 1:40:50.740]  Let's go to Michelle in Texas
[1:40:50.740 --> 1:40:52.740]  Here on the air
[1:40:52.740 --> 1:40:54.740]  Hello, it's actually Michael, but that's...
[1:40:54.740 --> 1:40:56.740]  There's another Michelle there, I apologize
[1:40:56.740 --> 1:40:57.740]  That's alright
[1:40:57.740 --> 1:41:00.740]  Anyway, I'm a Commonwealth of Benghazi thing and I agree with you
[1:41:00.740 --> 1:41:04.740]  I also think that there's probably going to be a couple of different distractions
[1:41:04.740 --> 1:41:08.740]  I don't know if you're aware of it, but today in New Orleans there was a shooting
[1:41:08.740 --> 1:41:10.740]  At a Mother's Day parade
[1:41:10.740 --> 1:41:12.740]  Second-line parade, 12 people shot
[1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:13.740]  Oh my God
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:17.740]  A little girl had a minor injury
[1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:19.740]  I think three were in surgery
[1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:23.740]  But there's not more news yet if they passed or not
[1:41:23.740 --> 1:41:26.740]  But I'll have to call a media and bring a chair attention
[1:41:26.740 --> 1:41:31.740]  So I don't know if it's provocative or if it's just some random nutcase out there
[1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:35.740]  But I think there might be more than just one big distraction
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:40.740]  Well listen, they've got federally funded mental institutions with fellow travelers on them
[1:41:40.740 --> 1:41:43.740]  Where they've been caught releasing mentally ill people
[1:41:43.740 --> 1:41:46.740]  They know we're planning to go kill people and they let them do it
[1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:51.740]  And again, then they try to say we can't have guns to protect ourselves
[1:41:51.740 --> 1:41:54.740]  So that good people with guns aren't there to stop them
[1:41:54.740 --> 1:41:56.740]  And what they hate is those numbers that came out last week
[1:41:56.740 --> 1:42:02.740]  Did you see the Justice Department numbers of the 69% drop in wounding shootings and all that?
[1:42:02.740 --> 1:42:05.740]  Oh yeah, absolutely, I mean I watch your show every day
[1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:07.740]  I mean I'm right now, I'm on PrisonPlanet.tv
[1:42:07.740 --> 1:42:12.740]  And my friends are like, oh Michael, you know, you're kind of out there with your stuff
[1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:15.740]  And I said, listen, this is in my opinion, go look it up
[1:42:15.740 --> 1:42:17.740]  I didn't write down the same thing
[1:42:17.740 --> 1:42:19.740]  Oh my God, this is in Operation Northwoods
[1:42:19.740 --> 1:42:23.740]  The U.S. government plan to shoot people in the U.S.
[1:42:23.740 --> 1:42:26.740]  Just type in Operation Northwoods folks, you'll get ABC News
[1:42:26.740 --> 1:42:30.740]  Here's U.S. say today, I can't believe I missed this, how long has this been out?
[1:42:30.740 --> 1:42:34.740]  When did this happen? 17 hurt at New Orleans Mother's Day Parade
[1:42:34.740 --> 1:42:42.740]  It's now 17, when gunmen open fire, it'll either be staged or it'll be gang related
[1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:47.740]  But gunmen open fire on dozens of people, gunmen, that sounds very suspicious
[1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:50.740]  Marching in a Mother's Day neighborhood, parade in New Orleans
[1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:53.740]  Now mothers got mad when it happened and demand of the guns be turned in
[1:42:53.740 --> 1:42:56.740]  On Sunday, wounding 17 people police said
[1:42:56.740 --> 1:43:01.740]  Police spokesman Remy Brendon said in an email that 17 victims were graves
[1:43:01.740 --> 1:43:05.740]  And most of the wounds weren't life threatening, no deaths were reported
[1:43:05.740 --> 1:43:27.740]  Oh thank God, we'll be right back
[1:43:36.740 --> 1:43:39.740]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates

[1:47:29.740 --> 1:47:36.740]  We have the Bilderberg Agenda 2013
[1:47:36.740 --> 1:47:39.740]  We have from our inside sources and then confirm on the ground
[1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:44.740]  That they're having an extended like 3-4 week Bilderberg meeting with the main meeting
[1:47:44.740 --> 1:47:50.740]  June 6th through the 9th but weeks of Google building up to it with armed guard shacks
[1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:54.740]  And then weeks of Google after it so Google runs it now
[1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:57.740]  And is heavily involved at every level
[1:47:57.740 --> 1:48:01.740]  And then the mayor is like, I don't think protests are good, they're always violent
[1:48:01.740 --> 1:48:05.740]  And it's so prestigious that Bilderberg is coming here
[1:48:05.740 --> 1:48:07.740]  Of course our media says it doesn't exist
[1:48:07.740 --> 1:48:13.740]  Here is the local news articles, we have them linked up on infowars.com
[1:48:13.740 --> 1:48:18.740]  The Wadford Observer, the Grove Hotel set to host Bilderberg's secret summit
[1:48:18.740 --> 1:48:21.740]  And that was out yesterday
[1:48:21.740 --> 1:48:27.740]  The Wadford Mayor, Bilderberg protesters can and do cause violence and disturbance
[1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:31.740]  So tomorrow we're just going to have the big data dump on them
[1:48:31.740 --> 1:48:35.740]  And our source said, get over there, this is what's happening
[1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:39.740]  And then we sent Watson and other reporters in, I'm not going to say who else we have there
[1:48:39.740 --> 1:48:42.740]  We basically have reporters there constantly
[1:48:42.740 --> 1:48:46.740]  And just the whole staff feels like they're special and are walking around blabbering
[1:48:46.740 --> 1:48:52.740]  Yes, we launched the Arab Spring here, yes Google runs Bilderberg, I mean it's just like
[1:48:52.740 --> 1:48:57.740]  And that's what we were already told by our source inside Bilderberg
[1:48:57.740 --> 1:49:00.740]  Multiple sources, but one big one said get over there
[1:49:00.740 --> 1:49:05.740]  And it's like guard shacks and being set up and we're talking three weeks out from it
[1:49:05.740 --> 1:49:10.740]  It's crazy, let's go to your calls quickly, Kelly in California, then Cheryl and others, Kelly, welcome
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:15.740]  Yes Alex, I just have some thank yous today, thank God for you being the trumpet of truth
[1:49:15.740 --> 1:49:19.740]  And I want to thank my mom for naming me Kelly, which means warrior
[1:49:19.740 --> 1:49:23.740]  Warrior princess, let's get that straight
[1:49:23.740 --> 1:49:28.740]  And let's start calling Go Ogle what it is and what it does
[1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:32.740]  It spies on you and of course Bilderberg pretty much probably started it
[1:49:32.740 --> 1:49:35.740]  So of course it's merging with it, it's its child
[1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:41.740]  Google is a giant public NSA global government promoting anti-gun, new world order trash machine
[1:49:41.740 --> 1:49:46.740]  It is, it's Go Ogle and Barak means lightning
[1:49:46.740 --> 1:49:54.740]  So back to the Benghazi thing, anything could happen when someone like that is around
[1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:59.740]  Yeah and look, the fact that it's a Sunday, this didn't get any news about four hours ago
[1:49:59.740 --> 1:50:04.740]  This 17 injured in what they think probably will end up being gang related
[1:50:04.740 --> 1:50:08.740]  But let me tell you, if it was staged they'd have had their story ready, minute one
[1:50:08.740 --> 1:50:11.740]  And oh my gosh, we've got to take the guns now
[1:50:11.740 --> 1:50:16.740]  But again, 49% drop in violent crime, 69% drop in wounding shootings
[1:50:16.740 --> 1:50:22.740]  39% overall fatality shooting death reduction, just department numbers, LA times
[1:50:22.740 --> 1:50:26.740]  Others covered at last Wednesday, thank you so much Kelly, great points
[1:50:26.740 --> 1:50:29.740]  Cheryl in Tennessee, you're on the air, welcome
[1:50:29.740 --> 1:50:31.740]  Hi Alex, great to talk to you
[1:50:31.740 --> 1:50:33.740]  To talk to you ma'am
[1:50:33.740 --> 1:50:38.740]  I wanted to say this, I think as far as Benghazi goes, I think this IRS story
[1:50:38.740 --> 1:50:48.740]  I mean all of a sudden out of the blue, this comes out on Friday after Obama's media starts to say
[1:50:48.740 --> 1:50:53.740]  Hey, we think maybe something was, you know, truth wasn't told here
[1:50:53.740 --> 1:50:57.740]  I think that was an attempt possibly to distract
[1:50:57.740 --> 1:51:03.740]  And I noticed Drudge had a story come out Saturday that doesn't seem to be going anywhere
[1:51:03.740 --> 1:51:09.740]  That the IRS was also targeting Jewish groups, I kind of wanted to know
[1:51:09.740 --> 1:51:13.740]  No, I saw that, in fact that's in my stack, I meant to get to that, there's just so much news
[1:51:13.740 --> 1:51:18.740]  Yeah, like conservative groups period had been targeted and the headline was
[1:51:18.740 --> 1:51:21.740]  It was going after Jewish nonprofits
[1:51:21.740 --> 1:51:22.740]  Right
[1:51:22.740 --> 1:51:24.740]  Why do you think that?
[1:51:24.740 --> 1:51:26.740]  Why, I'm sorry?
[1:51:26.740 --> 1:51:29.740]  Why do you think that is?
[1:51:29.740 --> 1:51:34.740]  Well, I read the article, it was fairly brief and it just kind of concerns me
[1:51:34.740 --> 1:51:39.740]  Because one of the organization's claims that the IRS asked them a question
[1:51:39.740 --> 1:51:42.740]  And I can't quote here, I don't have it in front of me
[1:51:42.740 --> 1:51:50.740]  But it was something like, do you support the land of Israel as a state or something like that
[1:51:50.740 --> 1:51:53.740]  And it just, it's just very concerning
[1:51:53.740 --> 1:51:59.740]  No, no, you're right ma'am, and I did see the article, we're going to pull it up on screen for people
[1:51:59.740 --> 1:52:05.740]  It's linked up at the top of DrudgeReport.com, at least earlier when I was looking
[1:52:05.740 --> 1:52:09.740]  I think it's been moved down now, but it's in my stack, I'll try to find it
[1:52:09.740 --> 1:52:13.740]  Problem is the main broadcast is going to be over here in just a few minutes
[1:52:13.740 --> 1:52:18.740]  But look, here's the issue, the IRS wasn't around until 1913
[1:52:18.740 --> 1:52:22.740]  It's always been a political group and it always goes after people politically
[1:52:22.740 --> 1:52:25.740]  And so, yeah, there's the link, it's out of the national review
[1:52:25.740 --> 1:52:27.740]  IRS Inquisition Update
[1:52:27.740 --> 1:52:30.740]  And so this is the type of stuff they do
[1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:34.740]  And Nixon was going to go to jail for it until he stood down
[1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:40.740]  Obama, I don't so much think it's a distraction the media's doing
[1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:43.740]  Is that everybody's getting sick of being threatened
[1:52:43.740 --> 1:52:47.740]  And so more whistleblowers are coming out because they don't care anymore
[1:52:47.740 --> 1:52:50.740]  And the answer to bring down corruption is for good men to stand up
[1:52:50.740 --> 1:52:54.740]  The way you end up in tyranny is good men and women do nothing
[1:52:54.740 --> 1:52:59.740]  Let's talk to George Jet in North Dakota, thanks for holding George Jet
[1:52:59.740 --> 1:53:04.740]  Thank you, and I'd like to say thank you for smacking down Piers Morgan
[1:53:04.740 --> 1:53:06.740]  That made the rest of my life
[1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:08.740]  People love that, they just love that
[1:53:08.740 --> 1:53:10.740]  It's great therapy
[1:53:10.740 --> 1:53:15.740]  Now about Benghazi, all of those politicians involved from the top
[1:53:15.740 --> 1:53:18.740]  And every one of them need to be made accountable to the law
[1:53:18.740 --> 1:53:21.740]  Like everybody else, they should be fired
[1:53:21.740 --> 1:53:24.740]  They should have their assets confiscated
[1:53:24.740 --> 1:53:26.740]  They should be put in prison
[1:53:26.740 --> 1:53:32.740]  And the public should not allow any false flag diversion no matter how large
[1:53:32.740 --> 1:53:38.740]  To take this blatant criminal activity off the radar and have it swept under the rug
[1:53:38.740 --> 1:53:44.740]  We need to demand some real justice and the restoration of our freedom and civil liberties
[1:53:44.740 --> 1:53:50.740]  Because we are fed up with their phony wars on everything and their control over every aspect of our law
[1:53:50.740 --> 1:53:57.740]  Absolutely, you've got a bunch of different special interests fighting over control of the global government levers of dominance
[1:53:57.740 --> 1:54:02.740]  And if they stage an attack or let an attack happen or if they all get on the bandwagon and hype something
[1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:07.740]  They can then attach the public purse, but they're going to destroy the country if it continues
[1:54:07.740 --> 1:54:10.740]  And then they go, well that's good, we'll bring in globalism
[1:54:10.740 --> 1:54:13.740]  The truth is freedom is the only security
[1:54:13.740 --> 1:54:16.740]  And that's a decision the establishment needs to make
[1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:19.740]  I mean, do they really want to play dictator?
[1:54:19.740 --> 1:54:22.740]  Because that's a very dangerous place to go
[1:54:22.740 --> 1:54:24.740]  Thank you, George, you had great points
[1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:27.740]  Richard in California, you're on the air
[1:54:27.740 --> 1:54:30.740]  Well at the time you called Ambassador Stevens a punk
[1:54:30.740 --> 1:54:35.740]  So I'm thinking that you kind of have strange bedfellows with Hillary Clinton there
[1:54:35.740 --> 1:54:38.740]  You know what, I'm confused by what you're saying
[1:54:38.740 --> 1:54:41.740]  And I'm calling for violence too
[1:54:41.740 --> 1:54:43.740]  You just called Ambassador Stevens a punk
[1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:46.740]  Hold on just a minute
[1:54:46.740 --> 1:54:49.740]  And I've also been in league with the Easter Bunny
[1:54:49.740 --> 1:54:52.740]  No, I do think I'm probably going back from memory here
[1:54:52.740 --> 1:54:54.740]  I'm not the one that ran Benghazi
[1:54:54.740 --> 1:54:57.740]  Okay, so let's not distract off of that
[1:54:57.740 --> 1:54:59.740]  I'm going to go back to you in just a moment
[1:54:59.740 --> 1:55:01.740]  Richard or whatever your name is
[1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:03.740]  But here's the issue
[1:55:03.740 --> 1:55:06.740]  What I said is the punks and scum
[1:55:06.740 --> 1:55:11.740]  That think they're going to put Al Qaeda and Libya and Syria to carry out massacres of innocent people
[1:55:11.740 --> 1:55:14.740]  That it's going to come back and bite them in the butt someday
[1:55:14.740 --> 1:55:17.740]  That's what I said day one about Benghazi
[1:55:17.740 --> 1:55:19.740]  And that it was a set up
[1:55:19.740 --> 1:55:22.740]  And that those people that were killed there were probably killed
[1:55:22.740 --> 1:55:25.740]  To cover up what was really going on there
[1:55:25.740 --> 1:55:27.740]  Now that's what I've been saying since day one
[1:55:27.740 --> 1:55:30.740]  Now, should Obama be impeached for this
[1:55:30.740 --> 1:55:32.740]  What do you think's going to happen?
[1:55:32.740 --> 1:55:34.740]  That's the question, it's not about me
[1:55:34.740 --> 1:55:36.740]  John Benghazi, go ahead
[1:55:36.740 --> 1:55:38.740]  Okay, I have the documents to play for you
[1:55:38.740 --> 1:55:40.740]  But to answer your question
[1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:43.740]  I think he gets away with it because of his support structure
[1:55:43.740 --> 1:55:45.740]  People like him
[1:55:45.740 --> 1:55:48.740]  He has a lot of people that are going to let him get away with anything
[1:55:48.740 --> 1:55:50.740]  And so, you know, I think it's bad
[1:55:50.740 --> 1:55:52.740]  Alright, I got to jump, thank you for the call
[1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:54.740]  Let's go ahead, now you heard it folks
[1:55:54.740 --> 1:55:56.740]  Now I killed the ambassador basically
[1:55:56.740 --> 1:55:59.740]  Let's go ahead and talk to Diana Louisiana
[1:55:59.740 --> 1:56:01.740]  You're on the air, Diane
[1:56:01.740 --> 1:56:03.740]  Hi, Alex, how are you today?
[1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:04.740]  You're on fire
[1:56:04.740 --> 1:56:06.740]  Okay, I just wanted to make a comment
[1:56:06.740 --> 1:56:08.740]  On this Benghazi thing
[1:56:08.740 --> 1:56:09.740]  I'm with you totally
[1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:11.740]  I'm not really a political person
[1:56:11.740 --> 1:56:14.740]  But I am learning so much listening to your show
[1:56:14.740 --> 1:56:16.740]  But on another note
[1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:19.740]  Is there any way you can get on Lemon LaRouche
[1:56:19.740 --> 1:56:22.740]  Or if the people that's listening today
[1:56:22.740 --> 1:56:24.740]  To go to larouchepack.com
[1:56:24.740 --> 1:56:27.740]  And click on the RSF feed
[1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:29.740]  And look in the second column
[1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:32.740]  And there's an article where you can print out
[1:56:32.740 --> 1:56:34.740]  To restore America
[1:56:34.740 --> 1:56:36.740]  No, it's a great plan
[1:56:36.740 --> 1:56:38.740]  It's a plan to impeach Obama
[1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:41.740]  And to get the Glass-Steagall Act back
[1:56:41.740 --> 1:56:43.740]  That's why they demonize Lemon LaRouche so much
[1:56:43.740 --> 1:56:44.740]  Because he does have some good ideas
[1:56:44.740 --> 1:56:45.740]  I don't agree with them all
[1:56:45.740 --> 1:56:46.740]  But thank you, ma'am
[1:56:46.740 --> 1:56:47.740]  And again, it's very frustrating
[1:56:47.740 --> 1:56:51.740]  I'm hurrying here to try to get to everybody
[1:56:51.740 --> 1:56:55.740]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Illinois
[1:56:55.740 --> 1:56:56.740]  You're on the air, Andrew
[1:56:56.740 --> 1:57:00.740]  Yeah, I hope they get our military back
[1:57:00.740 --> 1:57:02.740]  You know, the United States control again
[1:57:02.740 --> 1:57:03.740]  Away from the UN
[1:57:03.740 --> 1:57:05.740]  That's part of probably what happened in Benghazi
[1:57:05.740 --> 1:57:08.740]  They had UN people over, you know
[1:57:08.740 --> 1:57:09.740]  No, no, you're right
[1:57:09.740 --> 1:57:11.740]  Actually, NATO
[1:57:11.740 --> 1:57:13.740]  But yeah, the UN was involved too
[1:57:13.740 --> 1:57:14.740]  No, no, no
[1:57:14.740 --> 1:57:15.740]  That's how they were able to say
[1:57:15.740 --> 1:57:17.740]  Oh, we don't know because NATO's in control
[1:57:17.740 --> 1:57:19.740]  That's a way to get control away from Congress
[1:57:19.740 --> 1:57:20.740]  Absolutely
[1:57:20.740 --> 1:57:22.740]  All the bullets being grabbed
[1:57:22.740 --> 1:57:24.740]  By the Homeland Security
[1:57:24.740 --> 1:57:27.740]  I think they're planning on using the bullets
[1:57:27.740 --> 1:57:30.740]  To have devices that shoot off bullets
[1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:33.740]  Without guns in order to stop bullets
[1:57:33.740 --> 1:57:34.740]  From being sold
[1:57:34.740 --> 1:57:35.740]  Well, absolutely
[1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:37.740]  It's meant to put a corner on the market
[1:57:37.740 --> 1:57:38.740]  I appreciate your call
[1:57:38.740 --> 1:57:40.740]  But also, it's more than that
[1:57:40.740 --> 1:57:43.740]  Homeland Security bought like 7,000 pounds
[1:57:43.740 --> 1:57:45.740]  Of plastic explosive last year
[1:57:45.740 --> 1:57:46.740]  What is that for?
[1:57:46.740 --> 1:57:48.740]  You have thousands of armored vehicles
[1:57:48.740 --> 1:57:50.740]  They admit their training for war against us
[1:57:50.740 --> 1:57:52.740]  It's illegitimate, it's unconstitutional
[1:57:52.740 --> 1:57:54.740]  Get the government back under control
[1:57:54.740 --> 1:57:56.740]  That's what America's all about
[1:57:56.740 --> 1:57:58.740]  Infowars.com

[1:59:24.740 --> 1:59:28.740]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel
[1:59:28.740 --> 1:59:30.740]  Our new silver gel is not based
[1:59:30.740 --> 1:59:32.740]  On synthetic gelling agents
[1:59:32.740 --> 1:59:33.740]  Which quickly evaporate
[1:59:33.740 --> 1:59:35.740]  And leave the silver at the surface
[1:59:35.740 --> 1:59:38.740]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel
[1:59:38.740 --> 1:59:40.740]  Using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
