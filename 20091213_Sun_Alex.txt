[00:17.960 --> 00:24.040]  texas alex jones well we just had governor jessie ventura back on he
[00:24.040 --> 00:27.480]  happened to be with his last friday and then lord montan came on saying that
[00:27.480 --> 00:32.760]  climate gate is an absolute fraud it's all a scam he was a few years ago on the
[00:32.760 --> 00:37.560]  bandwagon with them he was fooled he's now admitted he was fooled he's very
[00:37.560 --> 00:43.440]  angry a lot of supporters well-meaning supporters of this fraud are now waking
[00:43.440 --> 00:50.120]  up in mass thanks to the work and the research of lord christopher montan and
[00:50.120 --> 00:54.640]  his incredible climate gate caught green-handed report that's up on his
[00:54.640 --> 01:00.240]  excellent investigative site that will be giving you the url for he's with us
[01:00.240 --> 01:06.360]  graciously for the rest of the hour to report on day one and two of the global
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.040]  government takeover summit the un's calling it the most important summit in
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.360]  history youtube says our future is being decided in Copenhagen they're pushing
[01:14.360 --> 01:20.200]  it lord christopher montan third by count of montan and brinchley has worked
[01:20.200 --> 01:23.880]  at all levels of government has been a top journalist has a scientific
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.320]  organization advising governments and corporations was one of the chief
[01:28.320 --> 01:32.560]  advisors to margaret thatcher the list goes on and on he really needs no
[01:32.560 --> 01:36.720]  introduction but lord montan we got a break in three minutes we'll come back
[01:36.720 --> 01:41.640]  with plenty of time to break this down but first off the climate gate blew up
[01:41.640 --> 01:45.800]  even bigger than I thought it would it is collapsing you are now there at the
[01:45.800 --> 01:52.720]  center of these crooks trying to declare their global hegemon tell us
[01:52.720 --> 01:57.120]  what's happening in Copenhagen well it's almost as though climate gate hadn't
[01:57.120 --> 02:02.160]  happened to be honest the vast majority of the world's mainstream media have
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.640]  still not really said what in the climate gate emails they may have mentioned
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.000]  it once or twice at the pbc have not given it anything like the coverage it
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.440]  deserves given the magnitude of the draft treaty which is under
[02:15.440 --> 02:21.040]  consideration here when I went into the conference yesterday to ask for a copy
[02:21.040 --> 02:24.720]  of the treaty I went to the UN documentation and said right I want the
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.360]  current draft of the negotiating text and they looked at me as though they
[02:30.360 --> 02:34.960]  were baffled you know the librarian there who had stacks of papers behind her
[02:34.960 --> 02:39.240]  in various languages she just looked as though she'd never heard of it so I
[02:39.240 --> 02:42.840]  insisted and it took about ten minutes and they consulted each other over three
[02:42.840 --> 02:47.240]  or four of them arguing over it none of them would produce the document so I
[02:47.240 --> 02:51.080]  then did a quick interview with a passing TV camera and came back attack and I
[02:51.080 --> 02:54.720]  said look I know this treaty exists because this is what the conference is
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.080]  all about it's discarding a treaty draft and they said oh no we've got no such
[03:00.080 --> 03:04.440]  thing and I said well you have and I want it and I'm not going to be put off
[03:04.440 --> 03:08.520]  and if I am put off there will be an international diplomatic incident and
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.960]  only then did they produce a stack of papers two inches thick a thousand
[03:11.960 --> 03:16.880]  pages most of which was just a complete element but right at the bottom of the
[03:16.880 --> 03:23.900]  stack when I plowed my way through it I found it the draft are the current
[03:23.900 --> 03:29.080]  draft of the treaty and once again they are desperately trying to conceal from
[03:29.080 --> 03:34.040]  everybody here the magnitude of what they're attempting to do they really are
[03:34.040 --> 03:38.720]  aiming to set up a world government they no longer use the word government in
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.920]  the treaty I think we've frightened them off that but all the institutions of
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.400]  this world government and the enormous powers it's going to be given over free
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.080]  markets to tax the American economy to the extent of two percent of GDP to
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.600]  impose a further tax of two percent on every financial transaction that could
[03:56.600 --> 04:03.240]  come to a very large GDP overall and to close down effectively the West transfer
[04:03.240 --> 04:08.000]  your job to go listen to this to third world countries all of that is still in
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.840]  the treaty draft even after all the negotiating rounds even after we've all
[04:12.840 --> 04:20.400]  made to try to make them rethink and even after climate change well this is
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.760]  just devastating information so this this appears to be breaking news
[04:24.760 --> 04:31.760]  because I've been doing searches every hour for the latest draft text and the
[04:31.760 --> 04:36.480]  media was saying it wasn't released there was this Danish text dealing with
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.960]  the way the taxes would be implemented we'll find out if that's the same text
[04:41.960 --> 04:46.800]  you have that's up on the London Guardian website right now but this is
[04:46.800 --> 04:51.800]  massive breaking news they're also reporting taxes on all air travel
[04:51.800 --> 04:57.600]  globally taxes on all fuel globally just a complete takeover but this
[04:57.600 --> 05:02.800]  financial tax wow hello folks this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to

[05:54.640 --> 06:06.840]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[06:07.120 --> 06:13.600]  we have the fraudulent climate gate emails from the head UN affiliated
[06:13.600 --> 06:20.120]  climate center in East Anglia we have the fake hockey stick the lies about the
[06:20.120 --> 06:25.040]  Arctic completely melting the lies about polar bears and penguins can't swim I'm
[06:25.040 --> 06:30.560]  seeing billboards all over Copenhagen saying save the polar bears they're
[06:30.560 --> 06:34.600]  going to die complete fraud big billboards a little girl saying please
[06:34.600 --> 06:41.040]  don't let me drown the most base mindless fraudulent information Holdren
[06:41.040 --> 06:48.200]  saying 13-foot sea levels when the UN themselves says what 7 to 21 inches and
[06:48.200 --> 06:54.480]  that itself based on a fraud we have now Lord Christopher Moncton because he is
[06:54.480 --> 06:59.840]  a member of the House of Lords went in and demanded the latest treaty this is
[06:59.840 --> 07:03.760]  breaking news it has everything that was in the previous one and worse you're
[07:03.760 --> 07:07.920]  going to hear this now breaking we have the Danish text leaked of the
[07:07.920 --> 07:11.840]  architecture of this global government how private corporate interest IMF
[07:11.840 --> 07:17.280]  World Bank will run the system not even the UN so just that's got the third
[07:17.280 --> 07:21.240]  world now reeling threatening to back out the Saudis are calling for
[07:21.240 --> 07:25.280]  investigations so much is happening I'm going to attempt to go over all of this
[07:25.280 --> 07:29.360]  in the next 51 minutes with Lord Christopher Moncton again graciously
[07:29.360 --> 07:33.400]  joining us so I'm going to try to just sit back sir and and and let you
[07:33.400 --> 07:39.040]  chronicle you're there at Copenhagen but also the good news UN climate chief
[07:39.040 --> 07:43.600]  does say hacked emails are damaging but as you said they're like the cat caught
[07:43.600 --> 07:46.960]  with the canary in its mouth going on about its business like it's no big
[07:46.960 --> 07:53.880]  deal they're trying very very hard to pretend that climate gate people who
[07:53.880 --> 07:56.920]  come to the conference don't really know if it happened because most of the
[07:56.920 --> 08:01.120]  mainstream media have still really not said what's in these emails and what is
[08:01.120 --> 08:05.960]  happening is that the mainstream media have done themselves terrible damage by
[08:05.960 --> 08:10.640]  signing up to this climate nonsense and then by thoroughly refusing to admit
[08:10.640 --> 08:15.280]  that climate gate happening admit how serious it was and simply inform their
[08:15.280 --> 08:19.200]  readers of what was actually in these emails and missions but while they're
[08:19.200 --> 08:24.160]  telling us as the Met Office did just today but today is the warmest decade
[08:24.160 --> 08:28.400]  since records began 150 years ago privately what they're saying in the
[08:28.400 --> 08:31.960]  emails the climate gate emails is hey look we've got a temperature which in
[08:31.960 --> 08:36.360]  fact has been falling and we can't explain why and it's a travesty that we
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.040]  can't explain why so they're saying one thing to us publicly to maintain the
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.120]  scare making them rich and that's what's called fraud it's criminal fraud and on
[08:45.120 --> 08:49.200]  the other hand they're saying privately oh dear oh dear we can't account for the
[08:49.200 --> 08:52.760]  fact there's been no warming for the last 15 years when that is it's very
[08:52.760 --> 08:56.960]  serious this disconnect between what they're saying among the pells
[08:56.960 --> 09:06.800]  privately and what they're admitting to us publicly absolutely talking about
[09:06.800 --> 09:12.440]  criminal investigations Lord Moncton we have senator Inhofe calling for it the
[09:12.440 --> 09:16.280]  Saudis calling for investigations and the Saudis have pointed out the United
[09:16.280 --> 09:21.320]  Nations the progenitor of this fraud they can't run the investigation no they
[09:21.320 --> 09:25.120]  can't because the United Nations is thoroughly compromising all this because
[09:25.120 --> 09:30.080]  the climate panel that it created via the United Nations environment program
[09:30.080 --> 09:33.240]  and the World Health Organization namely this intergovernmental panel on
[09:33.240 --> 09:37.600]  climate change which has produced four major reports on the climate those four
[09:37.600 --> 09:43.960]  major reports are now all under a cloud because all the major contributors to
[09:43.960 --> 09:49.560]  those reports the lead authors indeed the the lead author of the entire science
[09:49.560 --> 09:55.840]  report of 2007 are part of these emails part of this conspiracy to conceal
[09:55.840 --> 10:00.880]  manipulate tamper with invent make-up and eventually destroy data when it was
[10:00.880 --> 10:05.720]  requested by third-party scientists who wanted to check whether the various
[10:05.720 --> 10:09.360]  extraordinary claims they were making could possibly be true it's a very very
[10:09.360 --> 10:13.720]  serious matter and there's no way the UN can be allowed to do this I think this
[10:13.720 --> 10:17.320]  has got to go to district attorneys in the United States and it's got to go to
[10:17.320 --> 10:21.040]  the police of the current prosecution service in the United Kingdom it's
[10:21.040 --> 10:24.760]  already gone to the Information Commissioner because there are plainly
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.560]  plain admission in emails there over the years that they have been planning to
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.200]  avoid disclosing information to other scientists which is contrary to the
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.240]  scientific method as well as contrary to UK freedom of information law but the
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.600]  final seal on that freedom of information thing is the email in which one of the
[10:42.600 --> 10:45.840]  people concerned wrote to all the other said you must destroy all your emails
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.200]  related to our participation in the fourth assessment report of the United
[10:51.200 --> 10:56.360]  Nations climate panel in 2007 because we're being asked for it by another
[10:56.360 --> 10:58.880]  scientist under the Freedom of Information Act so you must destroy it
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.400]  that email clearly constitutes a serious criminal offense for which the
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.320]  highest possible level of financial penalty is allowed for by the Freedom
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.800]  Information Act 2000 and the person who wrote that email whom I won't name on the
[11:13.800 --> 11:18.280]  air because it's not fair to him he is now going to face criminal charges he is
[11:18.280 --> 11:23.800]  I think going to be indicted convicted and he won't be in prison because we
[11:23.800 --> 11:26.720]  don't imprison people yet for these offenses I think the law is going to
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.920]  have to change but he will certainly be subjected as will his institution to a
[11:31.920 --> 11:37.240]  very large financial penalty indeed and quite rightly so well you're a member of
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.000]  the House of Lords the upper chamber of your Parliament for those that don't
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.080]  know Lord Christopher Monkton are you saying that the inside information that
[11:46.080 --> 11:50.560]  you're getting from government is that he will be prosecuted no because the
[11:50.560 --> 11:54.960]  the government would would be most improper if it were to involve itself
[11:54.960 --> 11:59.720]  any way in whether or not to prosecute somebody that is a function entirely of
[11:59.720 --> 12:03.480]  the director of public prosecutions who is a an official who has to be
[12:03.480 --> 12:07.440]  independent government and also I myself although a member of the House of Lords
[12:07.440 --> 12:11.560]  do not have the right to sit or vote that taken away no I understand but I'm
[12:11.560 --> 12:15.840]  saying but I'm saying yeah I'm saying you're you're saying you believe he will
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.640]  be charged or your I think it is I think it is certain that you'll be charged I
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.000]  myself together with Professor Fred Stinger who founded the US satellite
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.440]  weather service many years ago have written an official complaint to the
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.160]  information commissioner asking him to look into this as has one of the people
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.480]  who had made a frequent information request now the person who made that
[12:37.480 --> 12:42.280]  information request has been answered we have not yet been answered and if I
[12:42.280 --> 12:45.600]  didn't get an answer in the next few days and as soon as I get back from this
[12:45.600 --> 12:49.120]  Copenhagen conference I will be arranging for questions to be put down in the
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.880]  House of Lords about why the information commissioner is doing his job
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.440]  and replying to his correspondence so you're going to demand you're going to
[12:55.440 --> 12:59.840]  demand justice and you and others have filed former complaints of formal
[12:59.840 --> 13:05.000]  complaints and we have them red-handed talking to the government colluding to
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.640]  keep the public from getting information that should be public I mean that
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.480]  certainly is a conspiracy to engage in a cover-up it's worse than that it's it's
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.720]  also against every rule of science because the only way science can work
[13:19.720 --> 13:25.560]  is if people who publish results on which the largest tax increase and the
[13:25.560 --> 13:31.320]  largest abandonment of freedom ever can see is about to be negotiated here at
[13:31.320 --> 13:36.160]  Copenhagen they have not been sharing their results and their computer
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.400]  programs and their data with other scientists so that those other scientists
[13:40.400 --> 13:45.920]  can check them all of this has been done behind closed doors so that they could
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.320]  get away with what turns out to be not just an information offense but also a
[13:51.320 --> 13:58.720]  very serious scientific and financial criminal fraud for which a very long
[13:58.720 --> 14:05.160]  sentence in prison is the appropriate remedy and what I have had is request
[14:05.160 --> 14:10.480]  from two immensely senior professors one in the United States and one in
[14:10.480 --> 14:15.440]  Canada but I should draft for them complaints to the British police because
[14:15.440 --> 14:18.880]  they don't know how we do it yet they want me to do that for them they will
[14:18.880 --> 14:22.360]  make sure that I've got all the facts correct and they've both sent me a large
[14:22.360 --> 14:26.120]  amount of information about the fact in their case because they're named in these
[14:26.120 --> 14:31.480]  emails in the most uncompampermentary way and it's very clear that a plot to
[14:31.480 --> 14:38.840]  devalue their scientific research by unfair and foul and dishonest me had
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.520]  been engaged by the conspirators who have been talking to each other in these
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.480]  emails so I will be going to see the police superintendents in the East
[14:49.480 --> 14:53.480]  Anglia Conspiracy who is heading up the investigation into who the whistleblower
[14:53.480 --> 14:56.960]  is and whether he should be prosecuted I can tell you from now he won't be
[14:56.960 --> 15:00.880]  prosecuted because we have legislation which allows whistleblowers to bring
[15:00.880 --> 15:04.840]  criminal offenses the attention of the public in this way without suffering any
[15:04.840 --> 15:09.960]  penalty themselves so the whistleblower will not be prosecuted however I will
[15:09.960 --> 15:15.160]  be saying to the police officer that there is clear and systematic evidence
[15:15.160 --> 15:21.640]  of deliberate wide-scale fraud right across the meteorological community in
[15:21.640 --> 15:27.040]  NASA in NOAA in the University of East Anglia in Penn State University in
[15:27.040 --> 15:32.440]  universities and institutions of learning right across the world where a
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.080]  small coterie of malevolent scientists and when they come across a very nasty
[15:37.080 --> 15:59.040]  thing by the way they write about everybody else they're very nasty
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.360]  the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they
[16:04.360 --> 16:07.760]  want you to eat will you continue to be their profit center buying their
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.080]  processed food that makes you sick go to the doctor and buy their drugs you

[20:00.080 --> 20:06.200]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[20:06.200 --> 20:17.760]  Broadcasting Network the propaganda looks like it's directed at three-year-olds
[20:17.760 --> 20:22.240]  pictures of children saying please don't let me drown isn't it important to get
[20:22.240 --> 20:27.640]  these charges rolling while Copenhagen's going on because that will really blow up
[20:27.640 --> 20:31.240]  in the establishment's face and that's why they're panicking because they know
[20:31.240 --> 20:35.120]  they've been engaging in all this crime earlier last week I'm sure you're aware
[20:35.120 --> 20:39.600]  of this you're always a few steps ahead of us or more or several leagues ahead
[20:39.600 --> 20:45.440]  of us it's now coming out that the UN had documents AP and Fox reported it
[20:45.440 --> 20:51.080]  where they were recruiting and directing scientists in this fraud and in this
[20:51.080 --> 20:55.480]  artificial consensus from behind the scenes so we have the United Nations
[20:55.480 --> 21:02.000]  directly in there as you know really the king rat orchestrating this
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.480]  been a lot of evidence this one of the people who is very prominently named in
[21:06.480 --> 21:11.800]  the emails indeed one of the people exchanging is the person who the UN
[21:11.800 --> 21:18.360]  called in to rewrite the 1995 second major climate assessment report they do
[21:18.360 --> 21:22.800]  these every five years you and really big reports of this is the sort of what
[21:22.800 --> 21:27.040]  the bedwetters based their case on they will the UN says this now the UN said
[21:27.040 --> 21:31.720]  in 1995 report this was what the science in the right of thousands of them had
[21:31.720 --> 21:37.720]  signed off on what they said was there is no huge detectable human influence on
[21:37.720 --> 21:43.120]  global temperature we can't find any we don't know when we will find when I read
[21:43.120 --> 21:48.480]  his reports his essays when I look at his documentation when I see him speak on
[21:48.480 --> 21:52.960]  television or radio the way he lays it out is so amazing because it's such a
[21:52.960 --> 21:58.600]  huge subject and today he's going right at the fraud and he was finishing up
[21:58.600 --> 22:02.440]  with the fraud and the criminal investigations and how it's premeditated
[22:02.440 --> 22:06.560]  fraud to establish a collectivist world government controlled by large
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.280]  financial interests that literally are setting themselves up as emperors of the
[22:10.280 --> 22:14.320]  planet and you were finishing up sir but the time we've got I then want to get
[22:14.320 --> 22:19.560]  into the fact that you went and demanded and bent the will of these of these
[22:19.560 --> 22:26.360]  Copenhagen UN bureaucrats to cough up the latest secret version of the treaty
[22:26.360 --> 22:34.080]  with taxes on money financial transfers I mean this is off the charts then we I
[22:34.080 --> 22:38.760]  want to get your take on the propaganda on the ground there I want to get your
[22:38.760 --> 22:42.480]  take on what all the scientists are out there talking about how many people will
[22:42.480 --> 22:47.560]  die and starve to death if even a small of the amount of this is implemented what
[22:47.560 --> 22:53.640]  the biofuels has already done I mean this is so monstrous please continue
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.720]  right where would you like me to start yes I was just saying that I have these
[22:57.720 --> 23:01.840]  two eminent professors who've asked me to put a case to the police and as soon as
[23:01.840 --> 23:05.280]  I get back from this conference I will be going to see the senior police officer
[23:05.280 --> 23:09.040]  the police superintendent in the East Anglican sanctuary to investigate this
[23:09.040 --> 23:13.480]  matter I will be laying their reports for him I will be asking for a two-hour
[23:13.480 --> 23:18.600]  briefing so that I can brief him on the background to this fraud because you know
[23:18.600 --> 23:22.240]  if you're a police officer you're not a climatologist and somebody comes in and
[23:22.240 --> 23:25.600]  says well these people are lying and they're making up data you'd never just
[23:25.600 --> 23:28.960]  believe it you need to be properly briefed I'm hoping they're going to let
[23:28.960 --> 23:34.120]  me brief them on this so that they can understand just how monstrous is the
[23:34.120 --> 23:39.600]  manufacturing of data let's just take for instance the EPA's decision to try and
[23:39.600 --> 23:45.000]  say that carbon dioxide is an endangerment to the to human health
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.360]  under the clean air and it's being announced it's being announced to
[23:50.360 --> 23:54.600]  coincide with Copenhagen absolutely of course it was about to coincide with
[23:54.600 --> 24:00.480]  Copenhagen and this is clear politicking again of the worst kind but the
[24:00.480 --> 24:06.240]  technical documents on which that is based contains a graph listing the UN
[24:06.240 --> 24:12.280]  document and not checked which pretends to suggest that the rate at which global
[24:12.280 --> 24:17.080]  warming is happening has been accelerating over the last hundred and
[24:17.080 --> 24:21.560]  fifty years and particularly in recent years of last thirty five years now that
[24:21.560 --> 24:27.280]  graph is based on a well-known scientific fraud it's a statistical fraud in
[24:27.280 --> 24:33.000]  fact called the end point fallacy where you take a stochastic data set that's
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.640]  one way you have to guess which way it's going to jump next temperature
[24:35.640 --> 24:39.920]  like that you know it doesn't follow an ordered curve it jiggles up and down a
[24:39.920 --> 24:45.800]  lot and stochastic data sets like that are highly said to precisely the point
[24:45.800 --> 24:51.760]  at which you start and end your trend line and the UN has used this fact to
[24:51.760 --> 24:57.480]  try to convey an entirely false entirely bogus and fraudulent impression
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.360]  which has been recited over and over again by ignorant politicians that the
[25:02.360 --> 25:07.440]  rate of warming is at itself accelerating and the EPA instead of
[25:07.440 --> 25:13.760]  checking independently as I wrote and told it to do instead just lifted this
[25:13.760 --> 25:18.880]  material out of the UN as we now know early tainted documents without
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.760]  bothering to check it and guess who was the lead author of the part of the
[25:23.760 --> 25:30.280]  UN document which produced this bogus graph it was none other than one of the
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.280]  conspirators in the climate-gate scandal so we can tie all these people
[25:34.280 --> 25:40.600]  together in a series of frauds that now links in the EPA itself and because the
[25:40.600 --> 25:46.480]  director of the EPA did not respond she didn't even answer the submissions that
[25:46.480 --> 25:52.760]  I and many others put in she herself is now going to be indicted for fraud
[25:52.760 --> 25:57.680]  because she's made herself part of the fraud by being warned that she was
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.280]  relying on documents that were themselves fraudulent such as this
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.760]  graph which is plainly fraudulent and we know she used it because it's in the
[26:05.760 --> 26:10.800]  technical document that she published and instead of withdrawing that putting
[26:10.800 --> 26:14.280]  in a supplementary document saying that we still believe we're right but we
[26:14.280 --> 26:18.600]  can't rely on that graph anymore she has done nothing about it she has
[26:18.600 --> 26:24.680]  therefore become part of a very serious international scientific and financial
[26:24.680 --> 26:30.200]  fraud and she will have to go and go to jail amazing Lord Moncton is this not
[26:30.200 --> 26:35.320]  as many researchers and scientists are billing it the greatest scientific
[26:35.320 --> 26:40.160]  fraud of history climate-gate caught green-handed cold facts about the hot
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.640]  topic of global temperature change after the climate-gate scandal he joins us
[26:44.640 --> 26:51.160]  from Copenhagen Denmark an extreme demand there obviously we're very fortunate
[26:51.160 --> 26:57.880]  to have him with us here today and Lord Moncton again there's so many subjects
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.760]  to talk about I want to get into the leaked treaty that he will that you
[27:02.760 --> 27:06.000]  went and demanded we're able to get the latest leaked information with the
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.720]  Danish text that has the third world figuring out they're being bamboozled
[27:09.720 --> 27:14.720]  and defrauded by this gaggle of scam artist I also wanted to talk to you
[27:14.720 --> 27:20.320]  about your ideas for the troops out there to not you know get orders from
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.800]  headquarters but to go to the sound of the guns what we can do globally to
[27:24.800 --> 27:28.480]  expose and fight this fraud now that we're beginning to route them what
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.680]  about civil suits you have all these scientists that were persecuted it had
[27:32.680 --> 27:36.400]  their papers blocked you have these scientific journals that were
[27:36.400 --> 27:41.600]  intimidated that right there is a serious civil matter trying to destroy
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.040]  people's careers couldn't civil suits by parties defrauded or taxpayers around
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.480]  the world being defrauded by this lie isn't everyone in the world a plaintiff
[27:51.480 --> 27:56.640]  to sue the United Nations to sue East Anglia to sue the EPA to sue Goddard
[27:56.640 --> 28:02.560]  climate center I mean your take on that Lord Moncton right I think that of
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.800]  course anyone has the right to sue but what you need to do is be very careful
[28:07.800 --> 28:12.000]  to use the proper procedure the first thing is that we're dealing here with
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.480]  a criminal rather than a civil matter these people have committed crime serious
[28:17.480 --> 28:21.840]  imprisonable offense we would you would call them felonies rather than
[28:21.840 --> 28:25.440]  misdemeanor there these are crimes which you can go to prison and should go to
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.640]  prison if you commit them for a very very long time particularly in view of the
[28:29.640 --> 28:33.880]  effect that these crimes are already having on poor people around the world
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.800]  who are being killed in large numbers by starvation as a result of the policy
[28:38.800 --> 28:42.400]  of Western nations including the United States take the case of the United States
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.960]  one third of its agricultural land out from growing food for people who need it
[28:46.960 --> 28:52.520]  and into growing totally unnecessary biofuels and clunkers that don't result
[28:52.520 --> 28:58.440]  a doubling of world food prices in the last two years result starvation

[33:00.120 --> 33:06.280]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the alex jones
[33:06.280 --> 33:15.240]  broadcasting network network take Haiti where they live on mud pie made with
[33:15.240 --> 33:21.240]  real mud costing three cents you take the mud you mash it all up lay it out in
[33:21.240 --> 33:25.680]  the sun scribes your neighbors three cents that's what they're living on or
[33:25.680 --> 33:31.000]  rather dying in Haiti now I was telling the story last year to a conference of
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.440]  government and opposition representatives in Madrid and a lady in the front row
[33:34.440 --> 33:37.920]  first tears and I said I'm sorry to have offended you but it is a rather
[33:37.920 --> 33:42.240]  terrible thing with that I've just come back from Haiti now because of the
[33:42.240 --> 33:46.400]  doubling of world food prices they can't even afford the price of a mud pie and
[33:46.400 --> 33:51.640]  they're dying of starvation all over the place and she was heartbroken it's a
[33:51.640 --> 33:54.760]  reason I'm crying is that you're the first person in the Western world I've
[33:54.760 --> 34:00.120]  ever heard mentioning the plight of the poor so I'm so grateful I just can't
[34:00.120 --> 34:05.840]  tell you will serve how serious this is these people by that scientific fraud
[34:05.840 --> 34:08.760]  and the financial fraud they're profiting enormously one of the
[34:08.760 --> 34:14.040]  documents from this this series of leaked documents is the complete financial
[34:14.040 --> 34:18.800]  account of the of the climate research unit how much grant they've had and how
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.240]  vast with them the amount of grant have increased since they began peddling
[34:23.240 --> 34:26.880]  the scientific and they're working with oil companies while people die of
[34:26.880 --> 34:31.800]  starvation in a dozen reasons of the world and there are food riots in
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.840]  those reasons too hardly ever reported in any major Western news medium it is a
[34:36.840 --> 34:42.840]  scandal of the worst proportion our own fellow preachers are being killed by
[34:42.840 --> 34:48.120]  starvation because these people have lied and made up the science and hidden
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.880]  it so that nobody else could take sir doesn't get worse than that going back
[34:52.880 --> 34:56.800]  to the question I forgot to repose at the start of the break is this the
[34:56.800 --> 35:01.240]  greatest scientific fraud in history a and then B we also now have in the
[35:01.240 --> 35:06.800]  emails where they're meeting with Dutch Royal Shell with BP with Siemens and
[35:06.800 --> 35:12.800]  others saying oh they're part of our agenda this is only part of our takeover
[35:12.800 --> 35:16.920]  this is so wonderful can you speak to this if is this the biggest fraud
[35:16.920 --> 35:22.960]  scientific fraud in history a and B the collusion of Fortune 100 companies in
[35:22.960 --> 35:28.080]  the scam right let's start with that first question it follows from my last
[35:28.080 --> 35:33.560]  answer with a fraud upon an international scale which has already
[35:33.560 --> 35:38.560]  killed millions by starvation is the worst fraud you could ever possibly
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.720]  commit with our fellow human being are dying in large numbers because of its
[35:43.720 --> 35:49.080]  fraud it doesn't get worse and then we come on to your second question just
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.280]  remind me of what that was and I'll do it the oil companies and and and other
[35:53.280 --> 35:59.320]  major corporations feverishly working with the climate scammers that's right
[35:59.320 --> 36:06.440]  this is because they've become so frightened of the united front that the
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.160]  world's governing class has put up saying we are going to pedal with climate
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.960]  nonsense regardless of whether it's true but they've decided I think cravenly and
[36:14.960 --> 36:19.600]  I've told many of them that if that they better just give in and belong with it
[36:19.600 --> 36:23.720]  and try and make as much money as they can answer I think it's disgraceful I
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.400]  think their shareholder there there is a case for civil suit shareholder the
[36:27.400 --> 36:31.680]  companies who have done deals of this kind with the frauds of the UN and
[36:31.680 --> 36:36.360]  among the politicians and among the scientists they do deserve to be sued by
[36:36.360 --> 36:40.400]  their shareholder for not protecting the best interests of shareholders as every
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.440]  director of a major corporation is required by law to do so I think that
[36:45.440 --> 36:50.960]  is indeed a disgrace but what I'd like to do if I may turn to what is in this
[36:50.960 --> 36:55.560]  draft treaty yes yes amount of money that they want to take from you and so
[36:55.560 --> 36:58.960]  let me stop you let me stop you briefly for those that don't know and I've been
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.120]  searching every hour and checking during the breaks you are the only person and
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.040]  you first several months ago ferreted out the secret draft perhaps you can
[37:08.040 --> 37:12.640]  remind us how you were able to get that and then a friend of mine called Willie
[37:12.640 --> 37:16.880]  Sue at the Harvard Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics who reads
[37:16.880 --> 37:22.360]  everything that even that which is produced by the forces of darkness in
[37:22.360 --> 37:26.520]  this matter and he got on to the you are very obscure you've been website the
[37:26.520 --> 37:30.760]  website of the framework convention on climate change conference of the party
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.760]  and he found what said it was a note by the secretary at but he noticed it was
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.800]  a much too large file just to be a note so he looked at the file and it was a
[37:41.800 --> 37:48.000]  two-page note but attached to it with 186 pages and that was the first draft of
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.720]  the tree okay okay let me stop you there because I thought the file did not say
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.920]  treaty of Copenhagen there was nothing to indicate what this was and had he not
[37:55.920 --> 37:59.440]  been diligent in reading everything spotting the side of the file neither
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.120]  he not anybody would ever have found it and they would have been able to say if
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.600]  we had subsequently said over we had no idea that what the government signed up
[38:07.600 --> 38:11.760]  to in Copenhagen meant all this the UN would have moved they said oh but it's
[38:11.760 --> 38:16.040]  been on our website all the time okay how they play these days okay now that
[38:16.040 --> 38:23.000]  said again recap this is breaking here on air you have the latest version you're
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.680]  gonna go over what's in it for everybody right now this is breaking
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.400]  information right now Lord Montyn you have the floor now what I'm gonna do is
[38:32.400 --> 38:37.000]  to give you just that bit of the treaty which talks of part of the financial
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.320]  arrangement I have never seen a treaty as expensive as this one for the West it's
[38:42.320 --> 38:46.760]  only the West that's going to pay all the third world countries have been bought
[38:46.760 --> 38:49.520]  so they will sign the treaty because they think they're going to get money out
[38:49.520 --> 38:54.720]  of it but it's going to cost the West a fortune here's what it says developed
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.720]  country party that's what they call countries like the United States for
[38:59.720 --> 39:07.120]  them are going to have to pay a tax of anything up to two percent of gross
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.240]  national product to give you an idea of how big that is Britain that's half the
[39:11.240 --> 39:16.160]  best defense budget that's how much they are going to confiscate to fund this
[39:16.160 --> 39:20.560]  vast new government that they're setting up I haven't yet counted how many
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.320]  interlocked new bureaucracy there are to constitute this government but I think
[39:25.320 --> 39:30.240]  it's around 700 I'm going to try and do a more exact count later then they're
[39:30.240 --> 39:36.560]  going to be levied on their greenhouse gas emissions they're going to auction
[39:36.560 --> 39:40.760]  allowances to emit greenhouse gases and if you don't buy an allowance to emit
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.280]  greenhouse gases you won't be allowed to admit them you could find that your
[39:44.280 --> 39:48.640]  local electricity company has to shut down because it can't afford to buy the
[39:48.640 --> 39:53.960]  right to emit this harmless gas into the atmosphere but also going to be a
[39:53.960 --> 40:03.800]  uniform global levy of $2 per tonne of CO2 for all fossil fuel emissions so
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.040]  that is really enormous there are going to be levies on emissions from
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.960]  international aviation specifically an international air passenger adaptation
[40:11.960 --> 40:18.200]  levies stroke green levy on every airfare except on journeys that go in or out of
[40:18.200 --> 40:25.280]  four countries of course there's going to be a 2% share of the proceeds on
[40:25.280 --> 40:30.840]  various kinds of UN doggles towards giving money to third world countries
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.440]  they're going to tax the money they're going to hand out there's also going to
[40:34.440 --> 40:39.840]  be a global levy on international monetary transactions that means every
[40:39.840 --> 40:45.040]  transfer of money across borders will be taxed they no longer say as they did
[40:45.040 --> 40:49.640]  in the original draft what rate that tax was that but they didn't mind 2% that's
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.880]  on top of the 2% tax of GDP that they're going to charge anyway there's
[40:53.880 --> 41:00.280]  also going to be get this penalties all fine for non-compliance of developed
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.120]  country parties that's the United States etc with their emission reduction and
[41:05.120 --> 41:10.000]  financial resources commitment that means if you don't cut your economy down
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.160]  to size and cut your carbon emissions or if you don't pay the vast amounts of
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.160]  money that I've just read out for these various categories which admittedly some
[41:19.160 --> 41:22.960]  of them are listed as options but nevertheless we're looking at very very
[41:22.960 --> 41:29.280]  serious amount of money then there will be a police force effectively this
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.320]  government will have the right for the first time ever in an international
[41:33.320 --> 41:39.840]  organization to enforce its will by imposing unlimited financial penalties
[41:39.840 --> 41:45.000]  on any countries whose performance under this treaty they don't like now I
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.160]  could go on and on and on and on because there's pages and pages of this
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.080]  there's an adaptation from the multilateral adaptation from solidarity
[41:53.080 --> 41:56.880]  from mitigation from multilateral climate technology a total global
[41:56.880 --> 42:02.000]  government takeover a global government sir what is this total global
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.960]  government this is total global government but on a scale which is
[42:05.960 --> 42:11.720]  simply unimaginable I mean the cost of all these extra boards and panels and
[42:11.720 --> 42:16.640]  technology funds that's going to come out of general taxpayers money over and
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.320]  above the various individual financial provisions I've just read out we're
[42:21.320 --> 42:26.640]  looking at a grab for absolute power and absolute financial control worldwide
[42:26.640 --> 42:32.840]  by the UN and its associated bureaucracy and 700 new bureaucracy I don't know
[42:32.840 --> 42:37.440]  about 700 new bureaucrats about 700 you bureaucratic body
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.520]  who says how many hundreds of thousands of garbage to those will have briefly need an
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.520]  awful lot of our money to pay for all that and this is how they get in a series of funds
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.240]  this and that and the other I've never seen anything in global authorities over
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.760]  travel tracking where everybody goes
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.520]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[43:05.520 --> 43:11.040]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[43:11.040 --> 43:13.600]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[43:13.600 --> 43:18.560]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[43:18.560 --> 43:23.320]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[43:23.320 --> 43:27.680]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[43:27.680 --> 43:32.960]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[43:32.960 --> 43:37.280]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[43:37.280 --> 43:40.760]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[43:40.760 --> 43:46.000]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[47:00.520 --> 47:07.280]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting
[47:07.280 --> 47:10.760]  Network
[47:11.400 --> 47:18.520]  expanding on that now we have the Danish leaked memo that they've been passing
[47:18.520 --> 47:24.160]  around and I have that draft here and it talks about this is even upsetting the
[47:24.160 --> 47:27.960]  some of the UN bureaucrats in the third world countries that the power will be
[47:27.960 --> 47:33.880]  held by the IMF the World Bank and other quasi-private organizations so we
[47:33.880 --> 47:39.120]  have a private corporate structure directly looting the population why is
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.280]  this horrifying the third world totes that have since been taken over by the
[47:45.280 --> 47:51.220]  IMF and World Bank they want the UN to run everything because the UN that they
[47:51.220 --> 47:58.520]  now see as simply a sort of socialist cash generating machine a cash cow for
[47:58.520 --> 48:03.480]  third world countries the UN no longer serves any purpose except first its own
[48:03.480 --> 48:08.360]  in enrichment and then a little bit of trickle down after it spent all that it
[48:08.360 --> 48:12.000]  wants on its own vast bureaucracy but you know there are 200 of those already
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.840]  at least 200 represented here at this conference unbelievable alphabet soup of
[48:17.840 --> 48:25.000]  acronyms for these different you know UNEPs and WMOs and WFF this and that hundreds
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.360]  of them and all of that being paid for almost entirely by the taxpayers of the
[48:29.360 --> 48:33.200]  West and occasionally letting some money trickle down to third world countries
[48:33.200 --> 48:38.480]  whose leaders therefore want to get this money for their own Swiss bank accounts
[48:38.480 --> 48:44.480]  and they look to the UN as simply another source of cash and so they're trying to
[48:44.480 --> 48:47.600]  buy the UN is trying to buy these third world countries by saying well we're
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.480]  going to really make the developed countries pay and the reason the third
[48:51.480 --> 48:56.160]  world countries are now so annoyed with the Danish draft which was simply
[48:56.160 --> 48:59.320]  intended to try and facilitate agreement but it's got out into the Guardian
[48:59.320 --> 49:04.280]  before it had done its job and therefore the Guardian has rather blown the
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.560]  negotiations out into the open the reason why the third world countries are
[49:08.560 --> 49:13.400]  annoyed about this is because it isn't their friend the UN that will be running
[49:13.400 --> 49:19.240]  things it's the much stiffer much more business-like World Bank and IMF now of
[49:19.240 --> 49:22.600]  course the trouble is that from the point of view of Western countries whether
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.600]  it's the UN or the World Bank and the IMF that's running this world government
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.800]  one astonishing characteristic and I've looked right through this treaty and I
[49:30.800 --> 49:34.840]  can confirm this is just the same as in the previous draft the word election
[49:34.840 --> 49:40.840]  democracy ballot vote does not appear anywhere the one thing that's quite
[49:40.840 --> 49:47.160]  clear is that these enormous powers of taxation and interference enormous
[49:47.160 --> 49:52.440]  powers of devying this and taxing that and funding the other are all going to
[49:52.440 --> 49:58.040]  be without any representation at all now the old principle as you know well on
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.640]  which the US Constitution is currently is that there should be no taxation of
[50:02.640 --> 50:08.720]  any citizen unless the body taxing that citizen represents that citizen by being
[50:08.720 --> 50:14.720]  elected by no taxation without representation but this world climate
[50:14.720 --> 50:20.880]  body this world government is not going to be elected by anyone it's going to
[50:20.880 --> 50:27.800]  be a self-appointed self-perpetuating bureaucracy just like the EU commissar
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.440]  who now run the European Union and make 90% of our laws we have a parliament
[50:32.440 --> 50:36.840]  of course it's more or less redundant we might as well let it let it go to the
[50:36.840 --> 50:41.000]  temps that we're now trying to use that model and have it on international
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.760]  scale with no election no ballot no vote no right to call these people to
[50:46.760 --> 50:51.200]  account no right to question them no right to remove them no right to replace
[50:51.200 --> 50:56.920]  this so in the United Nations word wide so when the United Nations says this is
[50:56.920 --> 51:00.080]  the greatest moment for world government this is the year of the
[51:00.080 --> 51:04.040]  establishment of global governance as the head of the EU and his mankind moon
[51:04.040 --> 51:09.480]  the head of the UN secretary general has said they really mean it and so we
[51:09.480 --> 51:13.880]  now stand here at the precipice you are there in Copenhagen here's the big
[51:13.880 --> 51:20.840]  question what do you predict is going to happen and if we lose this and they do
[51:20.840 --> 51:25.760]  get it ratified then we start fighting it at the national level what do you see
[51:25.760 --> 51:31.400]  happening that this treaty has been through several negotiating rounds and
[51:31.400 --> 51:36.000]  yet although they've taken out the word government because I've screamed at them
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.280]  and you've screamed at everyone's screen all the mechanisms government all the
[51:40.280 --> 51:45.400]  funding sources the funding stream they call or funding windows in the latest
[51:45.400 --> 51:49.840]  spray sounds very coy but actually it means ways of raiding the taxpayer's
[51:49.840 --> 51:54.560]  pocket all of these things are still in place and have not only survived the
[51:54.560 --> 51:59.240]  previous draft draft but have been considerably amplified so what we're
[51:59.240 --> 52:03.280]  looking at is I'm afraid there's no other way of putting this it is a
[52:03.280 --> 52:10.400]  worldwide conspiracy by the governing class against the government by the big
[52:10.400 --> 52:16.680]  boys against the little guy by the rich against the poor by the strong against
[52:16.680 --> 52:22.280]  the weak and if you're a little guy doing your honest job of work to protect
[52:22.280 --> 52:26.960]  and pay for your family you have good reason to be very frightened at this
[52:26.960 --> 52:33.000]  moment and if you think that our kind host and I have been winding each other
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.880]  up and frothing at the mouth about something that's just another global
[52:37.880 --> 52:44.480]  government conspiracy theory I just have three words read the treaty as a
[52:44.480 --> 52:49.480]  little plus I've made there is a chance that by now if you go on to the UN
[52:49.480 --> 52:58.560]  framework convention website I think UNFCCC.int then you may be able to find
[52:58.560 --> 53:02.920]  this treaty now in draft because I have made quite a big stink about it not
[53:02.920 --> 53:07.480]  being immediately available when I asked I think they have been shamed now
[53:07.480 --> 53:11.840]  into putting this up on the web it'll probably still quite hard to find why
[53:11.840 --> 53:16.440]  don't you all have a look if you if you doubt in any way what I've been saying
[53:16.440 --> 53:22.840]  to you about the magnitude and breadth of the scope of this treaty the powers and
[53:22.840 --> 53:29.440]  and the wealth that it will transfer from you and your country to an alien
[53:29.440 --> 53:35.200]  unelected communistic bureaucracy with power to control all free markets
[53:35.200 --> 53:39.680]  worldwide with the power to levy taxes on every financial transaction across
[53:39.680 --> 53:46.840]  the international border we're looking at an enormous enormous communistic
[53:46.840 --> 53:52.160]  government which in its sheer scale is disproportionate to any conceivable
[53:52.160 --> 53:56.840]  threat from CO2 particularly now that we know by measurement that all of the
[53:56.840 --> 54:02.680]  US models were wrong and CO2 is simply harmless it's an outrage and I'd like to
[54:02.680 --> 54:07.240]  tell you if I made what you should do about it as soon as you have finished
[54:07.240 --> 54:11.880]  listening to the program you must dive for the telephone and you must
[54:11.880 --> 54:17.480]  telephone the US Senate and you must demand to speak to your senator or to
[54:17.480 --> 54:21.280]  one of his senior staffer do not be farmed off with the receptionist the
[54:21.280 --> 54:25.960]  switchboard operator a secretary or an intern you must speak to a senior
[54:25.960 --> 54:30.840]  staffer or to the senator himself and you must bring both of the senators for
[54:30.840 --> 54:35.600]  your state and they'll tell you on the switchboard who those senators are and
[54:35.600 --> 54:42.280]  you must say the Treaty of Copenhagen shall not pass the more of you do this
[54:42.280 --> 54:47.840]  the more vigorously you do it the more plainly but always polite you put your
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.520]  point to your senator and to the anti senior staff the more likely it is that
[54:52.520 --> 54:57.280]  the Senate will refuse to ratify this treaty and even though there are various
[54:57.280 --> 55:02.440]  backdoor ways by which Obama has already shared via his staff during the
[55:02.440 --> 55:07.400]  election campaign but he would try to circumvent your constitution by going
[55:07.400 --> 55:14.280]  round the back and allowing the treaty to be enacted into domestic law by a
[55:14.280 --> 55:18.520]  simple majority of both houses or simply by signing it by his executive
[55:18.520 --> 55:23.720]  authority and then using his majority on the Supreme Court to say that that's
[55:23.720 --> 55:27.720]  the way the trend in law is moving and therefore we'll count that as though it
[55:27.720 --> 55:32.440]  were a valid treaty and the present Supreme Court will do that you know if
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.040]  you give it half a chance and you need to make absolutely sure that your
[55:37.040 --> 55:41.720]  senators are told this treaty shall not pass so that if any of these backdoor
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.160]  ways of pushing the treaty through against the will of the Senate are
[55:45.160 --> 55:50.720]  tried the Senate will if necessary exercise the power that it has to
[55:50.720 --> 55:55.360]  establish the impeachment of your president if he does try what his
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.760]  staff has said during his campaign for election that he would try so it's up to
[56:00.760 --> 56:07.280]  you now you only have ten days left of being a free country with a constitution
[56:07.280 --> 56:11.680]  of your own because once he shines that treaty and with his Nobel Peace Prize
[56:11.680 --> 56:16.360]  and the millions of cleaning zombies screaming out here at Copenhagen he will
[56:16.360 --> 56:21.280]  sign anything once that happens that it's bye-bye to your constitution it's
[56:21.280 --> 56:27.280]  bye-bye to the freedom which America has long been a beacon to the world it has
[56:27.280 --> 56:32.680]  offered this beacon of freedom to the world now you are in immediate peril of
[56:32.680 --> 56:38.120]  losing that freedom however extreme what I'm saying to you may sound every word

[59:01.840 --> 59:06.120]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.120 --> 59:10.480]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.480 --> 59:14.560]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:14.560 --> 59:19.120]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.120 --> 59:23.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:18.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:22.280]  Alex Jones
[1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:31.000]  we are live on this Friday the 11th day of December 2009 and out of the gates
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.200]  we are simulcasting a full four hours of this Friday radio show live and living
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:42.760]  color the television at prisonplanet.tv congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to
[1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:48.920]  join us in the next segment but they are voting today up on Capitol Hill so that
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:56.080]  may fluctuate it does routinely when he is on Capitol Hill you know I've talked
[1:00:56.080 --> 1:01:02.680]  for years about how the global government plan is only the beginning the
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:05.840]  United Nations documents the Club of Rome documents Council on Foreign
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:09.880]  Relations State Department memorandums biological diversity assessments
[1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:15.960]  hundreds of government funded textbooks call for a planetary regime that's a
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:22.320]  quote planetary police state government that's a quote planetary dictatorship
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:28.120]  that's a quote to carry out eugenics this is what makes the whole world tick
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:32.600]  it's why the license plate reading cameras are going in it's why the CPS is
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:36.800]  interrogating all of your children and training them to spy on you it's why the
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:41.840]  family is under attack it's why our industrial society has been deindustrialized
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:46.720]  by design publicly announced by the United Nations and we're now going into
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:53.080]  the next deeper phase of this the Chinese government officially yesterday in
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:57.920]  the largest paper in the country and at the Copenhagen summit called for a
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:05.000]  planetary regime to force a one-child policy to begin with simultaneously
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.760]  papers across the world TV news networks and others called for a one-child
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:16.160]  policy to cut the carbon footprint the deadly carbon dioxide now listed as a
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:22.360]  chemical toxin even though plants breathe it humans exhale it and so we're
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:25.320]  going to be going over the latest on climategate the latest on the
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:29.400]  establishment of world government and what this world's going to look like if
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:37.920]  these people succeed and I want to break down the phases of control it just has
[1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:42.160]  really hit me hard again last night this morning how serious this is how dire
[1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:47.820]  this is how criminal and and and just viciously controlling and selfish the
[1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:54.880]  planetary controllers and their minions are we need to have a call to arms
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:00.640]  peaceably in the info war a call to the info war to really call these people out
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:03.920]  for what they are bloodthirsty killers they're already killing people all over
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:07.840]  the planet thanks to starvation and cutting off water supplies and I want
[1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:15.800]  to detail their plan today after congressman Ron Paul leaves us of course
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:20.440]  Bob Chapman will give us his once a week visit on the economy as well as he
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:25.320]  does every Friday for part of the third hour we'll also have open phones later
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:31.840]  in the broadcast they're not open yet but here is the mainstream news articles
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:36.560]  China daily that's their big paper government paper population control
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:43.120]  called key to deal China says they'll sign on if the new planetary government
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:53.440]  implements a one-child policy so we're going to be going over that after we
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:58.520]  come back also the national post out of Canada says the real inconvenient truth
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:02.920]  the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy scores of other papers
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:09.720]  are announcing children are evil carbon blobs and of course ABC news is
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:13.400]  reporting that children are being taught in public schools under a UN program
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:19.080]  with UNESCO when they should die that their carbon credits run out at age 11
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:24.160]  and of course the national ID card under treaty will keep a tally of your carbon
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:28.480]  credits so that is all going into place we're going to go to a quick break we
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:33.000]  have Congressman Ron Paul on the line with us from Washington and we'll go
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.120]  directly to Congressman Ron Paul on a host of issues government takeover of

[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:49.960]  communist Chinese calling for a planetary regime to enforce one-child
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:56.280]  policies will talk to the congressman the leader in the fight for liberty and

[1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:53.800]  head of the EU saying that the carbon tax and this a treaty will be the birth
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:58.560]  of world governance and then I want to play Al Gore saying the same thing and
[1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:02.480]  get the congressman's take out of the gates on that subject here is the new
[1:07:02.480 --> 1:07:07.200]  head of the EU nine is also the first year of global governance with the
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:12.040]  establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis the climate
[1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:17.480]  conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:22.640]  planet okay and he goes on for many minutes after that here's Al Gore
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:28.040]  saying that environmentalism is the key to global governance here is Al Gore
[1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:35.360]  vice-performer vice-president Al Gore but it is the awareness itself that will
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:40.640]  drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through global
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:45.480]  governance and global okay man's congressman for 30 years you've warned of
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:49.960]  global government reading their own documents I have the Danish text leaked
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:54.720]  of the treaty calling for global governance a global authority over all
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:00.760]  air travel over the oceans 2% tax flat tax on all GDPs paid to the IMF and
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:05.680]  World Bank effectively abolishing the UN's power the UN is freaking out
[1:08:05.680 --> 1:08:10.400]  private corporate global governance congressman there's no longer any
[1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:16.520]  denial about this is there no way and in a way it may serve to our benefit because
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:20.360]  the people are going to wake up just as our federal government fails you know
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:25.320]  we hear more about nullification and secession and I figure that when the
[1:08:25.320 --> 1:08:28.040]  federal government fails or the money fails there's going to be a lot of
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:31.840]  independence declared so even though they're bold and they're making these
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:37.440]  plans they're not going to be effective and it may serve our purpose in waking
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.880]  waking up the people but they've been pushing this for a good many years but
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:45.720]  you know 20 years ago approximately when you know the Soviet system collapsed
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:49.640]  they quit using the word socialism but they shifted over toward this
[1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:53.920]  environmental effort claiming that they could get government control through
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:59.640]  through this and they have done a amazing job in infiltrating our public
[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:03.760]  school system and indoctrinating our young kids and young kids going home and
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:08.280]  talking and yelling at their parents and for environmental things and pollution
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:14.320]  and all this so so they have invaded us but hopefully we can survive and be
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:19.640]  motivated enough to counteract these these efforts and and you know making
[1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:23.200]  clear the world government is to no one's benefit except those who
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:26.720]  get to govern the others I've interviewed literally hundreds of
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:29.800]  reporters that have been at these different globalist summits including
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:33.040]  five or six the last few days of Copenhagen and they say that there's a
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:37.920]  sense of desperation and panic by the big banks predominantly that are funding
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:43.240]  this this this private corporate global government sir do you agree with me or
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:46.200]  perhaps you can elaborate on the fact that now that they've been revealed
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:49.840]  because we did our job in the face of ridicule and expose their global
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:53.760]  government plan that now because they've been exposed they're coming out in the
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:57.760]  open and being more bold and honest about it I mean what's your take on why
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:02.600]  they're so bold well I think that could be a they have to be more aggressive but
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:07.800]  in many in many ways though people are backing off from this because they're
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:14.160]  you know some major candidates had been you know supporters of trade cap and
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:18.440]  trade and have taken their names off the bill so they're starting to understand
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:23.320]  this same way with you know audit the Fed thing you know just look how the
[1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:27.280]  establishment come down hard and Bernanke hiring lobbyists and him writing
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:31.240]  editorials it hasn't seemed to help their side they're still on the
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:35.360]  defensive but we are in a struggle there is no doubt and they are going to get
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:39.560]  tougher and right now too many of them have too much power in different
[1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:43.720]  governments and if they take this next step that they can exert power with a
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:49.360]  world government and a world military which is partially here already then
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:54.160]  then we're in very big trouble but I tend to want to be more optimistic
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:58.200]  thinking that the people will wake up and we have the tools still of the radio
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:02.480]  hopefully that'll last and still we have the internet hopefully that'll last but
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:07.920]  but they're capable of closing us down so this is it is vital that we wake up as
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:12.040]  many people as possible as quickly as possible congressman you brought up the
[1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:15.920]  fact that the Senate is now saying they're probably not going to ratify the
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:20.280]  treaty even if Obama signs it that may be a red herring to make a stand down but
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:24.880]  then it looks like it may be real because as you know Obama two days ago was in
[1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:29.560]  the Associated Press headline Obama threatens command and control and tells
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:35.320]  Congress the real boss in our system of government the three three pillars of
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:39.240]  government legislative executive judicial saying I don't care if you don't
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:45.200]  pass this the EPA is going to implement this by executive fiat yeah and that goes
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:49.800]  to show what they can do you know on the system that we've allowed to be created
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:53.440]  you know the executive branch has tremendous powers and the courts won't
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:58.200]  help us they write regulations they have the force of law and it reminds me of
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:02.680]  that statement stroke of the pen law of the land kind of cool and that's how
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:07.280]  powerful presence are they write executive orders they write signing
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:13.400]  statements and they do what they want and this is why the movement is is getting
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:17.760]  very very disgusted and saying you know they keep talking about
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:23.040]  nullification and secession and and that growth is going to continue in closing
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:27.800]  congressman some good news you got 311 sponsors it's passed out a committee
[1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:32.520]  audit the Fed the feds admitted you wanted us you'll destroy us in the last
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:36.360]  three minutes we've got left sir auditing the Fed give us a report on
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:42.120]  that okay I think most know that last week it was put into a bank regular
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:46.480]  regulation bill which is a monster of a bill when it came out of the committee
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:49.600]  I voted against the bill because I don't vote for a few good things when there's
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:55.320]  a lot of bad things in it but my amendment one by 42 to 26 which was a
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:59.760]  major victory it's on the high floor at this moment it will be voted on at the
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:03.880]  end of the day and the auditing provisions and was in both the
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:06.960]  Republican version and the Democratic version the Republic the Democratic
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:10.800]  version will pass and the auditing provision will be in there the real
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:15.400]  work needs to be done in the Senate so if anybody knows whether you know that
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:19.480]  where their senator stands try to urge the senators to get on that same bill
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:25.320]  I think it's 604 and there's 30 and over there there's been several senators
[1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:33.480]  that have put a hold on on Bernanke's reappointment unless unless they have a
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:39.400]  vote on 12 or 7 the auditing bill in the Senate so sir this is a massive
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:43.720]  victory I mean today it looks like they're gonna probably pass it in the
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:47.280]  House it'll go to the Senate and then the fights in the Senate this is
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:53.640]  incredible news yeah it's big if we have no idea you know exactly what will
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:57.360]  happen there'll be a lot more resistance in the Senate and the Fed still has time
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:01.200]  to do all that they do but nevertheless I think you're correct is
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.160]  describing as a major victory for the people you know though I mean the
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:10.200]  grassroots got this done I didn't twist arms I have no cloud up here in that
[1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:16.920]  sense but we have 313 on there all the Republicans and a lot of Democrats so
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:21.960]  it's really it's a really great testament to what can happen when the
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:25.760]  people come together because this is not a conservative Republican bill I mean
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:30.360]  it's liberals and populists and libertarians and constitutionalists have
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:35.160]  all come around to believing enough is enough and the Fed is too big and too
[1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:39.840]  secret and we finally identified it as the real shadow government instead of
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:43.640]  Republican and Democrat puppets you've been working for close to 30 years for
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:48.240]  this even if we don't have victory this year we're a hair away it'll be assured
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:53.040]  next year as the crisis accelerates do you agree with that yeah I don't think
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:56.640]  they'll be able to ever if if they scrouch it it'll just make it a bigger
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:01.080]  issue and the problems are going to get worse and they will know where to look
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:04.200]  and they have to look to the Federal Reserve system to find a real source of
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:08.160]  our problems well Congressman I salute you your book is the best seller in the

[1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:07.480]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting
[1:20:07.480 --> 1:20:12.160]  Network beyond their plans to devastate the economy for global
[1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:17.160]  consolidation a new international framework of draconian law is being
[1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:22.800]  constructed to establish a system of neo feudalistic serfdom remember it was
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:29.760]  Bill Clinton who gave us NAFTA and it was Al Gore the hero of the environmental
[1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:36.840]  movement who was the hatchet man for the Clinton administration to cram NAFTA
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:42.160]  down the throats of a reluctant Congress now this is a good deal for our country
[1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:48.000]  Larry and let me explain why Al Gore who carried the ball for NAFTA and GATT is
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:53.240]  now one of the top standard bears for the elites agenda this I didn't interrupt
[1:20:53.240 --> 1:21:01.080]  you okay guys maybe it just is this NAFTA why huge numbers of manufacturing
[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:05.640]  jobs left Canada came into the United States because of a 15% wage
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:10.520]  differential we pay our workers less in Canada now when you've got a 7 to 1
[1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:14.360]  right wage differential between the United States and Mexico you will hear
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:17.800]  the giant sucking sound no there's a political lesson there's a business
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:23.680]  lesson he serves as the front man for the carbon tax cap and trade scheme which
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:27.720]  will not only increase taxes on every American but will also transfer our
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:32.680]  national sovereignty and rights to a tyrannical world government all in the
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:40.200]  name of saving the earth is the legislation that we are discussing here
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:45.160]  today is that something that you are going to personally benefit from if you
[1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:51.880]  believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is
[1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:57.800]  because of greed you don't know me I've been willing to put my money where my
[1:21:57.800 --> 1:22:01.880]  mouth is do you think there's something wrong with being active in business in
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:07.320]  this country I am simply asking for clarification of the relationship I'm
[1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:13.280]  proud of it my name is dr. Tim ball I'm a climatologist I have a PhD in
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:17.760]  climatology from the Queen Mary College University of London England and I've
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:22.800]  been studying climate both with my nine years in the Canadian Air Force where it
[1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:27.520]  was essential to flying and then after that at the university so it's
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:33.840]  essentially been the whole theme of my career initially we're called climate
[1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:38.600]  skeptics I said but but all scientists are skeptics if you're not a skeptic
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:44.920]  you're not a scientist and then when that didn't work then they came out with
[1:22:44.920 --> 1:22:50.080]  the charge that we were climate change deniers and I remember when I was first
[1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:55.520]  called a denier and it was in the times of London and England and and of course
[1:22:55.520 --> 1:23:00.120]  the word denier was clearly deliberately chosen because of the Holocaust
[1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:05.680]  connotations of that term so it was it was not only a charge that you were
[1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:12.520]  ignoring the truth but you were doing it in a very evil way and of course I
[1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:18.560]  laugh about that now because my whole career has been anything but a climate
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:22.920]  change denier I've spent my career trying to educate people to how much
[1:23:22.920 --> 1:23:28.400]  climate change is naturally so I'm anything but a denier but of course
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:33.080]  that that is part of the politics under the Nazis there was something called
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:39.440]  race science they had a lunatic theory of eugenics the Arian heritage and all
[1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:45.480]  the rest of this absolute crackpot pseudo science there was no empirical measure
[1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:50.760]  or empirical test for the validity of those theories they simply asserted them
[1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:54.320]  and if you were a professor who stood up to them then the Gestapo would come and
[1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:58.400]  take you away we are perilously close to such a situation right now any
[1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:03.200]  academic any other figure standing up to say the global warming theory of Al
[1:24:03.200 --> 1:24:08.240]  Gore is a piece of crackpot nonsense is in danger you'd be fired from a
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:12.480]  government job and in many universities your job would be in danger and of
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:16.960]  course it's also part of what's called ad hominem that if you can't defeat the
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:21.560]  person's argument rationally you start attacking the person and we see that
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:26.240]  with these terms and we see it with Al Gore calling them flat earthers
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:31.680]  congressman you began by denying that there is a consensus on the science
[1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:35.440]  there is a consensus on the science you must have been listening to our
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:39.200]  testimony that we've had for the last few days with dozens of experts that have
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:42.880]  come in who have given completely different views well there so I would I
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:45.880]  would I would encourage you to go back and look at the testimony there's
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:50.920]  committees heard there are people who still believe that the moon landing was
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:55.280]  staged on a movie lot in Arizona and neither of us one of those and I know
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:58.760]  you like given those cute anecdotes this is not a cutesy issue we're talking
[1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:04.360]  about no export millions of jobs out of our economy out of our country Richard
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:08.960]  Linsen at the MIT professor of atmospheric physics said it many years
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:13.000]  ago when he said the consensus was reached before the research had even
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:18.080]  begun and then scientists like myself that stood up and said hold on a minute
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:23.840]  I got problems with it all paid by the oil companies don't trust that guy what
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:28.560]  the international scientific community is saying is correct there is no
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:33.760]  legitimate basis for denying it now you hear the consensus argument show all
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:39.000]  the majority of scientists what they're always talking about is and originally
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  the IPCC was about thirty six hundred scientists is now down to twenty five
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.520]  hundred that's the people they're talking about but when you look at it
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:53.280]  most of them are bureaucrats they're not scientists at all and very very few of
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:58.440]  them are actual climate experts now the consequences of that and whether that's
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:05.720]  because of man-made CO2 I think are debatable if CO2 is not causing the
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:15.360]  climate change what is what are the major driving factors and so they're
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:18.720]  essentially the ones that are left out by the intergovernmental panel on
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:23.760]  climate change it's unbelievable to me that they can come out and ignore the
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:29.960]  Sun I mean everybody knows the Sun goes in it gets cool you notice that right
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:34.200]  you have an eclipse the temperature drops and the birds start to get excited
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:39.840]  and so on and and when you look at the the seasonal changes with the Sun how
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:47.400]  you can suggest that the Sun is not a factor is really quite remarkable giving
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:53.160]  us false scientific information is not going to clean up our environment
[1:26:53.160 --> 1:27:01.160]  speaking with a lot of of promises and innuendo is not going to help clean up
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:05.560]  our environment the globalists have co-opted the environmental movement
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:09.520]  there are a lot of real environmental problems we face like genetic engineering
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:14.240]  where they're splicing plants animals insects you name it toxic waste dumping
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:21.440]  in the ocean no one wants to breathe bad air drink toxic water but the global
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:26.320]  carbon tax has nothing to do with that it's a tax literally on breathing go out
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:30.160]  on the street or talk to your friends your neighbors ask them hey should we
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:35.520]  ban dihydrogen monoxide it's bad for the environment the average person will
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:40.840]  sign your petition calling for the banning of water that's right dihydrogen
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:46.600]  monoxide is water it's the same thing with table salt sodium chloride and
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:53.600]  that's exactly what the establishment is doing with carbon dioxide ooh dioxide
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:59.480]  it has this scary sounding name but the truth is it's one of the four elements
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:06.800]  of life on this planet oxygen carbon dioxide water and sunlight and of the
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:12.840]  establishment can tax enlist as a toxic waste one of those basic four building
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:18.720]  blocks of life carbon dioxide they can regulate and control every facet of our
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:25.000]  lives and shut down any businesses that aren't part of their new world order the
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:30.120]  idea that carbon is a pollutant is essentially a way of saying that
[1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:37.640]  humanity is a disease or a cancer that ought to be wiped out genocide people
[1:28:37.640 --> 1:28:44.320]  have argued in this environmental coterie around Obama around Holdren the
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:48.040]  theoretician of de-development who is now the science advisor with the White
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:54.200]  House really the anti-science advisor they've argued that babies are carbon
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:58.720]  monsters carbon machines
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:05.240]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs

[1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:11.080]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:14.840]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've tremendous
[1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:19.880]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:25.280]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:30:25.280 --> 1:30:30.160]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:34.560]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:38.320]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:42.240]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:47.800]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[1:30:47.800 --> 1:30:53.960]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're

[1:32:58.440 --> 1:33:00.640]  today
[1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:06.720]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:11.960]  Broadcasting Network this is an absolutely anti-human doctrine they use
[1:33:11.960 --> 1:33:17.720]  the environmental movement to promote their real agenda which is globalization
[1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:23.760]  and federalization and power the advisor to Gordon Brown wants to exterminate
[1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:27.120]  one half of the population of the British Isles now that's something
[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:31.160]  Hitler might have tried to do or Stalin they didn't succeed will Gordon Brown do
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:36.920]  it you can read this in the statements of these lunatics radical environmentalists
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:41.720]  fanatical mouth thewzians tree huggers whatever you want to call them this is
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:47.880]  an etiology of genocide which can be documented exhaustively ad nauseum out
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:54.560]  of their own statements when Gorsett the science is settled that raised red
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:59.960]  flags amongst the media and then also amongst a lot of other people that sort
[1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:04.360]  of knew that that wasn't true other scientists and start to look at it and
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:08.800]  of course the more they looked at it the more they realized no science is never
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:14.440]  settled what is coming down now is environmentalism is nothing but phony
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:21.160]  science nothing but phony science and if we really believe in the environment if
[1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:25.280]  we really believe in freedom if we really believe in truth we need to get
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:29.920]  some straight answers now the Kyoto agreement of course was reached in the
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:37.280]  city of Kyoto and what was interesting was several things came out of that but
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:46.280]  the first thing was that not all countries had to participate in Kyoto but
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:51.640]  not all had to take action only the developed nations were required to
[1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:57.360]  reduce their level of co2 the developing nations were excluded now of course at
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:01.680]  that time China was and in some ways you can argue it still is a developing
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:06.760]  nation so it wasn't required to meet any targets under Kyoto nor was India the
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:11.640]  US of course held out and what's interesting is that the US Senate voted
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.960]  95 to nothing against the Kyoto Accord even though Al Gore was the vice
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:23.400]  president at the time and lucky for him he didn't have to cast the deciding
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:29.880]  vote but so it was 95 to nothing against it because the US Senate saw no this is
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:33.880]  this is a socialist distribution of wealth this is this is going to cost
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:39.320]  jobs and economy and so they scrapped it completely we're now told that you have
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:43.800]  to buy carbon offsets in other words if you have sinned by having a carbon
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:48.520]  footprint and by carbon emissions you've got to buy a carbon offset which is
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:52.400]  usually a scam somebody claims to have planted an acre of grass in the third
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:55.800]  world it never happened they take your money and laugh all the way to the bank
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.800]  but they're telling you that in order to cleanse your guilt you've got to buy a
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:04.360]  carbon offset talk about carbon polluters you talk about them it's my
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:09.880]  understanding that back in 1997 when you were vice president and Ron's CEO Ken
[1:36:09.880 --> 1:36:13.760]  lay was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:18.920]  develop this type of policy this trading scheme and is that is that accurate is
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:26.440]  it inaccurate it's it's been reported I don't know but but I I met with Ken
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:32.040]  lay as lots of people did before anybody knew knew that he was right and
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:37.600]  clearly it you can see why so many of us are concerned about this type of cap and
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:43.000]  trade energy tax that would be literally turning over this country's I didn't
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  know him calling Kenny boy well you but you knew him well enough to help devise
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:51.640]  this trading scheme and obviously we know what and Ron and these big guys on on
[1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:54.560]  Wall Street like Goldman Sachs and I know you've got interest with Goldman
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:37:00.240]  Sachs no well it's that's been reported if there's that not accurate no I wish I
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:03.720]  did with executives from the you're partnered in companies with executives
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:08.400]  from Goldman Sachs well if you're not Al Gore has got to be the greatest con
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:12.760]  artist in modern history this guy claims he invented the internet even though it's
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:16.720]  on record he's a liar and he got away with it he was the pitchman that
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:21.360]  successfully sold as vice president nafta and gap that's lower the standard of
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:25.120]  living in the United States of Mexico and almost completely deindustrialized
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:30.360]  our country now he's saying you should pay him and his private company set up by
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:35.680]  Enron a carbon tax on breathing look if you want to buy Al Gore's propaganda go
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:39.320]  ahead but before you do that you should at least look into the claims he's
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:45.360]  making there was a meeting in the White House in 1998 between Al Gore and Bill
[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:52.040]  Clinton Ken lay and Lord Brown okay well who were these people well we know the
[1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:57.240]  president the vice president Ken lay of course was the president of Enron and
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:38:04.000]  Enron was a major major player in the carbon credit carbon trading and and in
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:09.240]  fact stood to make an enormous amount of money out of it and and so it was part
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:15.720]  of I think part of the collapse of Enron and Lord Brown of course was the head
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:22.240]  of the largest oil company in the world and they were looking to buy into this
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:26.600]  as is happening now where the energy companies are becoming the big promoters
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:31.440]  of oh we got to go green we got to go to alternate energies and all of this this
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:36.000]  stuff they saw a business opportunity and left onto it and one that would make
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:42.880]  them look green again when it came time for the 1200 plus page greenhouse gas
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:47.000]  emission and carbon legislation to be voted on the speaker of the house
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:51.120]  Nancy Pelosi would not let the Republicans or even members of her own
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:57.520]  party see the bill until minutes before the vote Republican minority leader John
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:02.080]  Boehner engaged in a rare house filibuster and read shocking section
[1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:06.120]  that was shocking section from the legislation I really hate to do this
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:12.840]  when you file a 300 page amendment at 309 a.m. the American people have a right
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:17.760]  to know what's in this bill and have a right to know what we're voting on
[1:39:22.920 --> 1:39:28.160]  page 48 each building code enforcement department receiving a grant under
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:32.960]  subsection a show on panel a code administration and enforcement team
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:36.960]  consisting of at least one full-time building code enforcement officer a
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:43.200]  city planner and a health planner or similar officer I can take you to
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:49.720]  Chickasaw Mercer County in my district they don't have one full-time person
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:54.920]  that works for the village all right not one look at the mandate on every city
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:40:00.240]  village in America right here in this bill so that we're not gonna tell you
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:05.800]  what the codes are gonna be but but we're gonna tell you how many people you
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:11.000]  need to hire to enforce this page 41 determine any geographic area within the
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:16.320]  contiguous United States that lacks a federal power marketing agency because
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:20.480]  you know we can't move power around the country without a federal power marketing
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:24.560]  agency we do it today but we now we have to have a new government agency to do
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:30.200]  this all California housing standards are now gonna be imposed on every
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.400]  American community you don't have the right to have your own building
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:39.520]  standards in your community or in your state hell no the federal government's
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:43.600]  gonna tell you what they are it quickly became clear why Pelosi and the
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:47.240]  Democratic leadership were desperate to keep the contents of the bill secret
[1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:52.160]  before the vote now because of this underlying bill the federal government
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:58.480]  will virtually have control over every aspect of lives for the American people
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:05.640]  it is time to stand up and say we get to choose we choose liberty or we choose
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:10.480]  tyranny it's one of the two the underlying bill represents the tyranny
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:15.040]  and the intervention of the federal government it's our choice what will we
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:20.400]  choose today we choose liberty or will we choose tyranny and I know that we'll
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:25.960]  be facing the single moms that hurt from last summer they can't afford the
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:32.240]  gasoline bill they can't afford the propane you didn't do a great thing you
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:38.360]  hurt some really decent family struggling trying to make it and this is
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:42.600]  gonna be their death knell it breaks my heart I yield back it is of course a
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:50.360]  carbon tax on economic activity farming manufacturing real production here in
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:56.560]  the United States it would tend to shut down even those miserable remains of an
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:00.800]  industrial economy that we still have after the collapse of the Detroit
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:06.480]  automakers and their related subcontractors and so forth every home
[1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:09.920]  and business in the United States would be federally regulated and controlled
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:14.360]  mandatory home inspections will be carried out by federal inspectors and
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:18.560]  it's all at the expense of the homeowner in New York they're called the

[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:28.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:18.440]  Broadcasting Network that they will have the power to selectively enforce the
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:23.080]  new eaters on a case-by-case basis it's funny because when I tell people what I
[1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:27.080]  do for a living they the first response usually is you're with the
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:30.040]  environmental police there is no environment in New York City with this
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:34.640]  new power the green mafia can take over the entire economy through selective
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:39.560]  enforcement we know madam speaker that this national energy tax will cost the
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:45.040]  American people two trillion dollars we know that we know this was will result
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:51.960]  in a loss of 2.5 million jobs every year for the American people we know that we
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:56.680]  know this will result in a reduced standard of living for Americans we
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:48:02.640]  know that what is the point and what's the benefit the same central banks that
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:06.880]  have stolen more than 50 trillion from national treasuries across the planet
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:11.520]  are now creating a new derivatives fraud through the cap-and-trade carbon tax
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:16.800]  system that dwarfs their previous Ponzi schemes we've just watched a financial
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:20.480]  meltdown in this country the likes of which hasn't been seen in some time now
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:24.440]  if people like credit default swaps they're really gonna like the carbon
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:29.480]  swaps that are gonna occur and the carbon future swaps we spent a full day in
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:33.200]  this committee last summer talking about the manipulation of the energy
[1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:40.360]  futures market in oil we're going to create I fear another such system that
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:47.200]  people who are are have an inclination to react dishonestly to systems are
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:51.240]  going to actually have a new opportunity is that not a problem a select
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:54.920]  group of central banks are lobbying for the same legislation to be passed
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:49:00.360]  worldwide once the so-called green economy laws are in place only global
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:05.560]  megacorporations and their subsidiaries will be allowed to do business van
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:11.560]  Jones Barack Obama's first green jobs are has stated repeatedly on the record
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:16.320]  that the new green economy is only a cover for a complete revolution against
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:21.920]  capitalism and the total redistribution of wealth but what van Jones doesn't
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:26.720]  tell his sad followers is that the elite are bragging that the modern green
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:31.200]  movement was designed from its creation to destroy the middle class and
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:36.360]  transfer all wealth into the hands of a super elite they're not doing this to
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:41.720]  uplift the poor no the goal is to enslave the planet and usher in a new
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:49.680]  dark age every nation on earth is in the process of or has already passed its
[1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:54.520]  own set of carbon tax laws and regulations if their plan is successful
[1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:58.960]  every nation on earth will not only pay tribute to the powerful world government
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:03.360]  but every facet of human life will be regulated by the technocratic global
[1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:10.040]  planners under the carbon tax scheme China India Mexico and over a hundred and
[1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:15.280]  fifty other nations are exempt from the global tax system you see the bankers
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:20.480]  already own and control the third world their final target is the middle class
[1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:26.000]  of the West once they've dismantled the economies of the United States Europe
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.600]  and Japan they believe no one can stand in their way in short the new world
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:37.240]  order is a global corporate takeover in their global corporate state there is
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:44.880]  no room for individuality sovereignty or independence as their program begins to
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:49.560]  face more and more opposition lawmakers and supporters of the man-made global
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:54.760]  warming hypothesis want laws to be passed making it illegal to question their
[1:50:54.760 --> 1:51:01.200]  theories recently the head of Greenpeace was forced to admit that the
[1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:06.000]  arctic and Antarctic ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer and
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:10.960]  that this is all part of a natural process driven by the tilt of the earth
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:17.520]  and the Sun the cosmic radiation coming from space the amount reaching the
[1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:23.320]  earth is affected by the strength of the Sun's magnetic field so the magnetic
[1:51:23.320 --> 1:51:27.880]  field of the Sun is almost like a gateway controlling the cosmic radiation
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:34.120]  reaching the earth the magnetic strength of the Sun is also related to the
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:39.920]  number of sunspots so they are directly related to changes within the
[1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:45.040]  inner structure of the Sun the amount of cosmic radiation reaching the lower
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:52.680]  atmosphere creates more cloud right and and cloud forms you need to have what
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:57.800]  are called condensation nuclei that is little particles around which water can
[1:51:57.800 --> 1:52:02.880]  change from water vapor gas into water droplets minute particles that are
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:08.360]  visible in the form of clouds we've known for a long time that there was more
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:14.480]  cloud than the amount of particles in the atmosphere because we assumed it was
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:20.720]  play particles and salt particles that were creating this condensation process
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:26.440]  but there was this gap we now realize of course it's the cosmic radiation that's
[1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:30.840]  doing it so what the cosmic radiation is doing controlled by the magnetic field
[1:52:30.840 --> 1:52:35.080]  the Sun is putting up a it's like putting up a screen in the greenhouse and
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:39.640]  blocking out the sunlight and of course that then affects the temperature of the
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:44.440]  earth that's why there's a relationship between the sunspots and the
[1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:49.600]  temperature on the earth so we now know the mechanism but they completely
[1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:53.920]  ignore that more than 31,000 scientists from across the United States
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:59.760]  including more than 9,000 PhDs from the fields of climatology atmospheric
[1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:05.240]  science earth science and hydrology signed a petition rejecting man-made
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:11.120]  global warming as a scientific fraud this shattered the hoax of the so-called
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:15.640]  consensus that the mainstream media had been pushing for years that every
[1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:23.640]  scientist on earth believed that man-made global warming was a fact if the
[1:53:23.640 --> 1:53:27.600]  people are able to block their carbon tax takeover the elites agenda to
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:33.160]  establish a planetary world government will collapse to force their unpopular
[1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:37.680]  agenda upon the planet the controllers are racing to complete the construction
[1:53:37.680 --> 1:53:42.520]  of their police state control grid borrowing from tactics used in the past
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:47.080]  by communist fascist and other totalitarian regimes every form of
[1:53:47.080 --> 1:53:54.200]  classical textbook tyranny is now being implemented in the west in the
[1:53:54.200 --> 1:54:00.520]  united states the central government is federalizing local police state and
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:04.160]  local officers are in a great position to collect important information on
[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:08.200]  terrorists and their allies and the terrorist screening center stands ready
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:13.680]  to help you this video produced by homeland security is required viewing
[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:18.640]  for all departments in the u.s. and with the teamwork of local state and federal
[1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:22.640]  law enforcement we have an excellent opportunity to see the picture and solve
[1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:28.320]  the puzzle before these terrorists can strike again state county and city
[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:33.840]  police now take their marching orders directly from DHS and FEMA the videos
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:38.000]  and training manuals turn peace officers once guardians of the republic
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:42.960]  into secret police see way down there there's a woman taking photos of the
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:49.840]  dam someone called 911 and reported a suspicious person as you guessed she's
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:53.680]  gonna be a category three hit and since it's very important that we don't let
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:58.000]  her know that we know both the dispatcher and the officer need to make
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:02.520]  sure she doesn't hear the radio traffic stand by I can ask you to wait right
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:11.520]  here please every day items and activities are listed as proof that you
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:17.040]  are sympathizing with shadowy boogeymen of terror of course he's going to keep
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:21.120]  his eyes open for anything interesting or unusual in the car that would
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:26.520]  include cameras binoculars video equipment GPS maybe things like sleeping
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:31.360]  bags that suggest they're living out of the car from their inception homeland
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:36.520]  security and north com were set up to dominate the people and the states not
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:43.160]  to fight the CIA created al-Qaeda patriotic members of the military and
[1:55:43.160 --> 1:55:47.760]  law enforcement at great risk to their lives and careers have sent this

[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:21.600]  supremacist even before 9-11 FEMA was quietly indoctrinating local police to
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:25.960]  have a hatred of the founding fathers and everything our constitutional
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:29.640]  republic stands for who was the first terrorist organization in the United
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:45.320]  States you need Thomas Jefferson you mean these guys right here we asked
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:50.760]  yourself did they try to scare people yeah they tried to intimidate the British
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:55.760]  and they tried to use acts of violence your founding fathers my founding
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:59.080]  fathers were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:05.280]  because they systematically have British officials assassinate assassinate in the
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:11.600]  old Soviet Union Nazi Germany and Maoist China the police main job was not
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:16.080]  fighting crime and totalitarian forms of government the police are political
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:21.920]  enforcers or commas are as they were known in Russia it's their job to spy on
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:27.920]  the public and to intimidate the exercise of free speech once a climate of fear
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:33.440]  has been achieved the public begins to self-censor to shut down once the
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:37.080]  people have been intimidated to withdraw from the field of intellectual
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:42.160]  battle the tyrants have a free hand to expand the repression and looting of the
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:58.800]  helpless serfs
