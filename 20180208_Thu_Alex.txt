[00:00.000 --> 00:22.200]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:22.200 --> 00:30.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, this Thursday, the 8th day of February 2018 is picking off
[00:30.640 --> 00:31.880]  with a bang.
[00:31.880 --> 00:39.240]  The Dow Jones industrial average is 450 plus points down as we speak and so much more is
[00:39.240 --> 00:45.640]  also unfolding on the economic front as the globalists go into absolute complete and total
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.240]  high gear trying to shut this economy down.
[00:49.240 --> 00:56.400]  We've also got fake news alert, the stories on newswars.com and as soon as I read it,
[00:56.400 --> 01:01.240]  I just asked Kit, one of the editors to change the headlines, it's not strong enough.
[01:01.240 --> 01:08.400]  It's fake news, MSM, Trump and influx of Russians attend national prayer breakfast, CNN singles
[01:08.400 --> 01:14.600]  out 60 Russians out of 3,800 people.
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.000]  But then we looked at who was there leading the delegation of Russians.
[01:19.000 --> 01:27.960]  It's the woman funded by George Soros on record, the Russian playboy model, who is funded by
[01:27.960 --> 01:33.120]  Soros and is running against Putin.
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.760]  So that's next level.
[01:35.760 --> 01:42.880]  Soros funded group and they admit of the prominent people there, they're all anti-Putin and anti-Trump.
[01:42.880 --> 01:51.560]  They then show up and the media doesn't even tell people that, oh, by the way, this is
[01:51.560 --> 01:53.400]  the opposition to Putin.
[01:53.400 --> 01:55.200]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[01:55.200 --> 02:03.200]  So I said, change the headline to fake news, Soros funded Russians attend prayer breakfast
[02:03.200 --> 02:10.040]  to embarrass the president and don't report, that's the sub-headline, and failed to report
[02:10.040 --> 02:17.040]  that the prominent Russians that reportedly were going are anti-Putin, running against
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.040]  Putin.
[02:18.040 --> 02:21.760]  You cannot make that level of deception up.
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.440]  It's just only happens in the real world, truth is strange than fiction.
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.720]  Now that said, I knew when I saw this a few days ago when Trump said he wants a military
[02:30.720 --> 02:36.120]  parade to honor a military, that he was baiting the military, not the military, that he was
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.920]  baiting the leftists and the globalists to then show their real colors and attack the
[02:40.920 --> 02:46.760]  military, just like whenever he goes after the NFL for not kneeling, they show their
[02:46.760 --> 02:47.760]  true colors.
[02:47.760 --> 02:53.640]  He's totally and completely trolled them in a massive, massive, massive way.
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.560]  But then I remembered, I said, didn't Drudge call for a military parade?
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.480]  And then this morning I saw the headlines where they had pointed that out, Matt Drudge
[03:01.480 --> 03:08.680]  last year on May 9th said, Trump needs a military parade like in Russia.
[03:08.680 --> 03:11.960]  We haven't had it since 1991.
[03:11.960 --> 03:14.080]  And the whole point is we're supposed to be ashamed of the military, we're supposed
[03:14.080 --> 03:15.080]  to hate the military.
[03:15.080 --> 03:18.280]  I'm not saying worship the military, but if the globalists are trying to demoralize
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.480]  our country, make us hate our military, hate our police, hate our local governments, which
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.560]  is admittedly in the WikiLeaks, so they can come in with their leftist overthrow, and
[03:26.560 --> 03:29.840]  then you'll really have a military problem with leftists controlling it, it'll be in
[03:29.840 --> 03:30.840]  your streets.
[03:30.840 --> 03:31.840]  It's incredible.
[03:31.840 --> 03:35.160]  I mean, I wrote the book in Modern History on being concerned about the military being
[03:35.160 --> 03:40.800]  used for domestic control because the military alerted me to it that Clinton and Obama and
[03:40.800 --> 03:45.880]  others were trying to massively gear up to use them against gun owners and others.
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.320]  The media spun it that I was anti-U.S. military.
[03:49.320 --> 03:52.960]  When it couldn't be further from the truth, I was against our military being taken control
[03:52.960 --> 03:55.520]  of by bad folks.
[03:55.520 --> 03:59.920]  So they're trying to kill nationalism, they're trying to kill spree decor, they're trying
[03:59.920 --> 04:03.840]  to kill any type of national honor or pride.
[04:03.840 --> 04:07.840]  The Night Circuit rules, you can't wear American flags in California schools, it's a hate symbol.
[04:07.840 --> 04:10.720]  The answer is do what they don't like.
[04:10.720 --> 04:14.960]  Go back to that other end, you're nowhere near the extreme of some right-wing military
[04:14.960 --> 04:17.920]  dictatorship like they're now saying.
[04:17.920 --> 04:22.240]  And when we come back to Yenneman Square, ladies and gentlemen, Democrats are saying
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.920]  if there is a military parade, they're going to lay out in front of the tanks and trucks
[04:26.920 --> 04:30.680]  and men and women like they're fighting a communist regime.
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.480]  No, in Yenneman Square, again, the people were fighting a communist regime.
[04:35.480 --> 04:40.400]  You are the communist and the global is fighting an American free market regime.
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.120]  So, it's all coming up on this big Thursday global transmission.
[04:46.120 --> 04:50.000]  We're going to have wide open phones, we're going to watch the stock market and play clips
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.320]  from Trump's Big Prayer Breakfast and more.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:53.320 --> 04:55.040]  We're in Information War.
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.320]  Just spread all the links and live feeds to the four wins.
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.960]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:04.960 --> 05:08.920]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.240]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[05:12.240 --> 05:16.560]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.400]  particles in the gut.
[05:18.400 --> 05:20.840]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[05:20.840 --> 05:24.720]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[05:24.720 --> 05:27.920]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.440]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[05:32.440 --> 05:35.280]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[05:35.280 --> 05:39.480]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.440]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.880]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you
[05:47.880 --> 05:50.000]  can fully digest all types of meals.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.840]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[05:51.840 --> 05:54.560]  Use carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[05:54.560 --> 05:59.760]  Get it to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:24.560 --> 06:37.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 8th day of February 2018.
[06:37.080 --> 06:42.440]  I'm your host Alex Jones, member June 5th, 1989.
[06:42.440 --> 06:50.480]  The Communist News Network covered the Communist Chinese government crushing a student peaceful
[06:50.480 --> 06:56.640]  uprising calling for free speech and calling for free market reforms and religious freedom
[06:56.640 --> 07:01.960]  in China where peaceful Christians and Buddhists are held in captivity by the millions and
[07:01.960 --> 07:04.320]  their organs sold.
[07:04.320 --> 07:11.240]  For simply calling for that to stop, thousands were machine gunned and run over with tanks.
[07:11.240 --> 07:16.240]  We can pull up some of that graphic footage, but I think I'll spare the viewers and listeners.
[07:16.240 --> 07:22.720]  Two days ago, President Trump came out and announced that he was going to call for a
[07:22.720 --> 07:23.720]  military parade.
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.760]  That's why they really hate Trump because Matt Drudge had that idea, last year pushed
[07:28.760 --> 07:34.480]  it, and I know for a fact that's what made Trump even think of it.
[07:34.480 --> 07:38.200]  And see, it's the access that the people have.
[07:38.200 --> 07:43.000]  If you get a letter to Trump or if he reads something on Drudge or InfoWars and he thinks
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.160]  it makes sense, he'll look into it and he'll do it.
[07:46.160 --> 07:50.240]  Just like he learned from InfoWars that Sheriff Joe was under indictment and then had been
[07:50.240 --> 07:54.480]  convicted by a judge alone and was going to prison, he made some phone calls, couldn't
[07:54.480 --> 07:55.480]  believe it.
[07:55.480 --> 07:57.640]  He said, why hasn't that been on Fox?
[07:57.640 --> 07:59.440]  He found out it was true and he did it.
[07:59.440 --> 08:03.360]  And the White House admitted, yeah, they got the information from Dr. Jerome Corsi who
[08:03.360 --> 08:08.040]  hand-deliberated the White House and got it through to the president.
[08:08.040 --> 08:15.120]  They hate that type of access, you see, because normally it's big globalist boards.
[08:15.120 --> 08:21.440]  It's big globalist boards that decide everything and then it's given in policy and those boards
[08:21.440 --> 08:22.800]  are all in control.
[08:22.800 --> 08:26.200]  Those multinationals hand down the directive, the think tanks come up with how to deploy
[08:26.200 --> 08:30.840]  the policy, it then goes back to the boards and then back to the think tanks to be codified
[08:30.840 --> 08:32.680]  and put out in reports.
[08:32.680 --> 08:38.160]  And then those reports are adopted as the global system, policy.
[08:38.160 --> 08:40.160]  With Trump, it's what makes sense.
[08:40.160 --> 08:45.320]  An old lady hands him a news clipping in a line taking photos or he gets a news article
[08:45.320 --> 08:47.920]  from alternative news, checks into it, finds out it's true.
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.420]  He does something.
[08:49.420 --> 08:50.420]  He's real.
[08:50.420 --> 08:51.920]  He's not an elitist.
[08:51.920 --> 08:52.920]  And that's what they hate.
[08:52.920 --> 08:56.080]  Now why did I start the broadcast with Tiananmen Square?
[08:56.080 --> 09:01.200]  The left on CNN, I know it's been mentioned in the Washington Post, I've seen video
[09:01.200 --> 09:05.520]  clips by leftist activists online, one of them is on infowars.com are saying, we're
[09:05.520 --> 09:09.560]  going to lay out like Tiananmen Square in front of the tanks.
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.160]  Well, number one, those were students fighting communist and globalist and elitist.
[09:15.160 --> 09:17.240]  That's what you're supporting.
[09:17.240 --> 09:24.880]  So the students died and got run over a machine gun to be able to demonstrate peacefully in
[09:24.880 --> 09:26.720]  the supposed people's square.
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.600]  I mean, you notice nobody's in that square now and those tanks came in because they'd
[09:30.600 --> 09:31.600]  kill you if you were.
[09:31.600 --> 09:34.200]  There's a famous image of the man standing in front of the tank.
[09:34.200 --> 09:41.240]  But as soon as nightfall fell, those were local tanks that knew the locals.
[09:41.240 --> 09:46.480]  They had brought people in from a province 800 miles away and it took them time to get
[09:46.480 --> 09:47.480]  down there.
[09:47.480 --> 09:52.320]  And boy, when they got there early that next morning, when the first trucks got there,
[09:52.320 --> 09:56.320]  they started machine gunning everybody and they climbed in those tanks that the locals
[09:56.320 --> 10:00.320]  wouldn't drive over people and they ran over whole families.
[10:00.320 --> 10:05.440]  You go watch the raw footage on YouTube, you got a stomach for it.
[10:05.440 --> 10:10.120]  So now they're saying they've got at least 13 people signed up to lay in front of tanks.
[10:10.120 --> 10:17.160]  So A, these were people protesting peacefully, a murderous communist regime.
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.840]  And now you're communist in America protesting a parade for the military.
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.240]  Our military isn't coming to conquer us and run us over in the streets.
[10:25.240 --> 10:30.440]  If we had one of these parades, it's to provoke you and show how anti-American you are and
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.600]  how much you hate this country and how much you hate the military.
[10:34.600 --> 10:36.560]  So A, you're being chumped by Trump.
[10:36.560 --> 10:39.360]  You don't think the ultimate troll for goodness.
[10:39.360 --> 10:42.800]  Trump didn't know you're going to have convulsions over a military parade and we're going to
[10:42.800 --> 10:47.360]  have it and you rats are going to go out there.
[10:47.360 --> 10:48.880]  No need to stage a false flag.
[10:48.880 --> 10:50.760]  You'll probably bomb it.
[10:50.760 --> 10:54.400]  Not this particular urn, merconey, but others.
[10:54.400 --> 10:58.320]  We're leftist and anti-fire calling for violence, calling for shooting cops, CNN said when cops
[10:58.320 --> 11:00.800]  are getting killed, they said, well, they better clean their act up.
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.400]  They deserve it.
[11:05.400 --> 11:10.960]  And of course, even Politico now understands and admits it's political genius that he has
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.840]  trolled them massively.
[11:13.840 --> 11:21.320]  And you've got all these college dwellers, all these lazy, stupid, foppish, sycophantic,
[11:21.320 --> 11:31.640]  debutted pseudo-intellectuals sitting in the midst of this big rotting free market bizarre
[11:31.640 --> 11:36.160]  that they're trying to completely destroy so they can live like they do in Venezuela.
[11:36.160 --> 11:38.680]  I hear it's a nice time in Venezuela right now.
[11:38.680 --> 11:41.600]  So imagine the leftists are saying, don't have your parade.
[11:41.600 --> 11:42.600]  You can't have it.
[11:42.600 --> 11:44.960]  CNN, MSNBC are saying it's horrible.
[11:44.960 --> 11:45.960]  It's fascism.
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.560]  Oh, he's like North Korea.
[11:48.560 --> 11:51.440]  And oh, this is a show of force, a force of domination.
[11:51.440 --> 11:53.240]  We need to oppose it.
[11:53.240 --> 11:56.840]  But meanwhile, when I tried to get into the inauguration for three hours, we couldn't
[11:56.840 --> 11:57.840]  get in.
[11:57.840 --> 12:00.640]  They were beating up men, women, and children.
[12:00.640 --> 12:04.440]  The anti-fud and the Black Lives Matter who were about 99% white, by the way, I'm just
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.200]  telling you that's the fact, but they weren't at the VIP area.
[12:09.200 --> 12:10.720]  Oh, you could get in real easy there.
[12:10.720 --> 12:13.320]  So I just also go to the VIP area, even though it's on the other end.
[12:13.320 --> 12:18.720]  And then CNN said nobody was there because it took hours to get in because they blocked
[12:18.720 --> 12:19.720]  the entrances.
[12:19.720 --> 12:21.320]  And they showed that image saying nobody's there.
[12:21.320 --> 12:25.880]  Again, that's the total deception, but once people got in, it was a record crowd.
[12:25.880 --> 12:27.840]  Everything is a lie with these people.
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.600]  In Tiananmen Square, the people were opposing communism, authoritarianism.
[12:32.600 --> 12:34.760]  Trump isn't going to have his parade to occupy cities.
[12:34.760 --> 12:37.920]  It's a parade to honor the veterans, their families, those that have fallen, those that
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.360]  have been wounded, those that have been maimed, those that have been disabled.
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.120]  It's about Americanism and nationalism.
[12:44.120 --> 12:47.800]  We, the people, are taking back control of our country from the globalists, from the
[12:47.800 --> 12:49.480]  multinational authoritarianism.
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.000]  But then you see the top of people that block and spit on our reporters and attack me and
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.120]  everything else in New York at the women's marches a few weeks ago and at other events.
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.320]  Let's roll some of that, either as B-roll or with audio if it's bleeped.
[13:02.320 --> 13:07.000]  Of these folks, how they act, they can have their parades and nobody stops them.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.600]  Women dressed up as giant vaginas simulating sex acts on each other in front of children.
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.320]  That's on screen right now, your TV viewer.
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.840]  This is going on, but oh, we can't have the military parade because people like this are
[13:19.840 --> 13:28.400]  going to come block it and then spit on everybody and run around like a bunch of miscreants.
[13:28.400 --> 13:31.000]  It's a celebration of being idiots.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.200]  It's a celebration of being morons.
[13:33.200 --> 13:35.520]  It's a celebration of being fools.
[13:35.520 --> 13:41.520]  And everything they claim they oppose is what they are, cussing and spitting and yelling
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.480]  at our female and male reporters, physically attacking them, acting completely mentally
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.760]  ill, not as a small group of the overall group, full grown men running over and sticking their
[13:51.760 --> 13:58.480]  butts in the face of mentally and farting into the microphone in front of their wives.
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.840]  It's all about infantile behavior, arrested development, people living in this big open
[14:03.840 --> 14:08.960]  free system and then using that against it and then hating the very thing like mentally
[14:08.960 --> 14:13.120]  ill toddlers that have taken a huge dose of PCP.
[14:13.120 --> 14:19.200]  So here's activist Arne Merconi calls for people to lay in front of tanks as if they're
[14:19.200 --> 14:22.880]  Tiananmen Square, as if they have the same courage because the tanks are coming to kill
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.040]  them and the trucks are coming with the soldiers with the rifles.
[14:26.040 --> 14:32.720]  No, you're coming to block our free speech just like the Chinese Communist tankers were.
[14:32.720 --> 14:38.640]  You are the people in the tanks and our tanks and our military is to stop you when you have
[14:38.640 --> 14:41.680]  your violent uprisings and try to enslave us.
[14:41.680 --> 14:42.680]  Let's play that clip.
[14:42.680 --> 14:51.640]  This has become an authoritarian state and we need a grassroots effort today.
[14:51.640 --> 14:58.840]  If you can see what I've been posting over the last few hours is that journalists, politicians
[14:58.840 --> 15:08.000]  and anti-war movement groups are starting to build up the worrying, build up the story,
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  build up the tension.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.240]  We have to turn this into a three day story and what I want people to do is to commit
[15:14.240 --> 15:22.040]  just like I will that we would go to Washington DC if such a crazy insane act occurred and
[15:22.040 --> 15:27.480]  we would lay down in front of the tanks just like the heroes and the courageous students
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.200]  did in China in 1989.
[15:31.200 --> 15:33.400]  They need to hear our voices.
[15:33.400 --> 15:38.920]  This isn't clickbait for the media, this is something that the tanks were coming to stop
[15:38.920 --> 15:39.920]  free speech.
[15:39.920 --> 15:40.920]  You're trying to block free speech.
[15:40.920 --> 15:42.440]  The tanks aren't coming to conquer.
[15:42.440 --> 15:43.600]  It's a parade.
[15:43.600 --> 15:45.240]  You're not just like the people in Tiananmen Square.
[15:45.240 --> 15:49.920]  You're just like the Communist that ordered those tanks out and of course that's the stuff
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.600]  you promote at the universities.
[15:51.600 --> 15:53.000]  You are the problem.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.360]  You are the cancer.
[15:54.360 --> 15:55.800]  You are the enemy.
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.800]  You will be defeated.
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[16:04.800 --> 16:08.600]  may not be fully detected by you but the symptoms are there.
[16:08.600 --> 16:13.480]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[16:13.480 --> 16:17.000]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[18:09.320 --> 18:13.360]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.720]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.040]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[19:00.480 --> 19:03.800]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[19:03.800 --> 19:08.400]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[19:08.400 --> 19:13.920]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[19:13.920 --> 19:15.320]  and normal breathing.
[19:15.320 --> 19:16.320]  This is pollen block.
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.680]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[19:21.680 --> 19:27.720]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[19:27.720 --> 19:29.320]  and excessive mucus production.
[19:29.320 --> 19:34.200]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[19:34.200 --> 19:40.320]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[19:40.320 --> 19:45.120]  at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[19:45.120 --> 19:48.920]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[20:03.000 --> 20:24.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:24.440 --> 20:29.400]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[20:29.400 --> 20:47.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:47.800 --> 20:55.240]  Zanya Sobchak is the Russian playboy model who's running for president against Putin
[20:55.240 --> 20:59.440]  and she reportedly attended the prayer breakfast we're going to play some excerpts of in the
[20:59.440 --> 21:01.320]  next segment.
[21:01.320 --> 21:06.160]  And they said, oh look, there's Russians everywhere because Trump's a Russian.
[21:06.160 --> 21:11.080]  And then you read the prominent Russians that came, they're all a bunch of Soros open society
[21:11.080 --> 21:15.080]  funded people where they've spent billions of dollars in the State Department and Soros
[21:15.080 --> 21:20.280]  money that he swindled from different countries manipulating currency to try to overthrow Russia.
[21:20.280 --> 21:23.040]  But if you're literate about who's who, it's incredible.
[21:23.040 --> 21:30.640]  But if you turn on ABC or CBS or NBC yesterday and today, it's done, done, done.
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.200]  There's a whole bunch of Russians at the event.
[21:34.200 --> 21:35.200]  What's going on?
[21:35.200 --> 21:37.840]  Thoughts you're not working with Russians.
[21:37.840 --> 21:42.920]  But then right next to it, the same publications like Newsweek, they'll admit that Trump's
[21:42.920 --> 21:47.920]  opposition, excuse me, Putin's opposition, but also against Trump, they don't want peace.
[21:47.920 --> 21:54.280]  The Soros lady is going to the breakfast and did go to the breakfast TV presenter known
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.440]  as the Russian Paris Hilton and Putin's presidential rival has been invited to Trump's national
[21:58.440 --> 21:59.440]  prayer breakfast.
[21:59.440 --> 22:00.440]  And reportedly she attended.
[22:00.440 --> 22:04.920]  So again, they previously admitted who she was.
[22:04.920 --> 22:08.640]  They still admit she's the opposition that others are opposition, but they still run
[22:08.640 --> 22:14.840]  with headlines saying, whoa, a lot of eyebrows getting raised, a lot of Russians.
[22:14.840 --> 22:18.800]  This is the stunt they pull.
[22:18.800 --> 22:26.200]  And then you see the left foaming at the mouth saying they're going to attack the veterans
[22:26.200 --> 22:32.800]  parade that President Trump has announced that they're going to lie down in front of
[22:32.800 --> 22:38.640]  the tanks because they're heroes like the people in Tiananmen Square.
[22:38.640 --> 22:44.320]  When again, the people in Tiananmen Square were fighting communism peacefully saying we're
[22:44.320 --> 22:45.320]  not allowed to demonstrate.
[22:45.320 --> 22:46.320]  We are going to demonstrate.
[22:46.320 --> 22:51.880]  It was a student peaceful demonstration that ended in thousands and thousands killed in
[22:51.880 --> 22:57.960]  thousands and thousands then arrested and sent to prison or executed fighting leftist
[22:57.960 --> 23:00.320]  anti free speech authoritarianism.
[23:00.320 --> 23:06.480]  It is the left at college campuses across this country that first started banning words
[23:06.480 --> 23:12.640]  like the N word out of literature that was actually against racism and then moved on
[23:12.640 --> 23:18.320]  now to Martin Luther King because he said all God's children black, white, yellow, red
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.320]  and brown.
[23:19.320 --> 23:22.720]  They said, well, where's the trends?
[23:22.720 --> 23:28.040]  Where's the you've got to remove Martin Luther King's speech off the wall?
[23:28.040 --> 23:34.520]  Oh, we don't want masculine images of the football team in the sports, athletic mural.
[23:34.520 --> 23:45.840]  Take that down because it shows masculine men, toxic masculinity and it shows toxic femininity
[23:45.840 --> 23:54.520]  as they call it the stereotypes of a woman with full breast, small waist, full hips.
[23:54.520 --> 23:57.280]  They're assaulting classical feminism.
[23:57.280 --> 24:00.920]  They're assaulting classical male prowess.
[24:00.920 --> 24:06.640]  All of this is about these movements taking control of every subgroup and every strata
[24:06.640 --> 24:10.720]  and then dictating what it is to be a man or a woman.
[24:10.720 --> 24:15.760]  And I know I said yesterday that I would get to this and I will get to it at the bottom
[24:15.760 --> 24:18.080]  of the next hour breaking down.
[24:18.080 --> 24:22.920]  We've decoded exactly what this whole program is about and it's the end of human biology
[24:22.920 --> 24:27.840]  and they are now going into high gear basically admitting this entire program.
[24:27.840 --> 24:31.920]  That's what's so interesting now is they're admitting the plan going, transgenderism is
[24:31.920 --> 24:33.280]  going to make us have less kids.
[24:33.280 --> 24:34.800]  Well, that's always been the plan.
[24:34.800 --> 24:36.720]  I know the runoff in the water is good.
[24:36.720 --> 24:38.480]  It's making us have less kids.
[24:38.480 --> 24:44.680]  It is a directed program.
[24:44.680 --> 24:45.680]  There it is.
[24:45.680 --> 24:46.680]  College wants to censor Martin Luther King.
[24:46.680 --> 24:47.680]  I have a dream speech.
[24:47.680 --> 24:48.680]  Here's why.
[24:48.680 --> 24:52.440]  Yeah, they're taking down his murals or taking down his speeches or taking down quotes off
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.440]  the walls.
[24:53.440 --> 24:54.440]  It's happening everywhere.
[24:54.440 --> 24:58.400]  This hall is called Lynch Hall.
[24:58.400 --> 24:59.400]  We want that name taken off.
[24:59.400 --> 25:02.660]  It's scary because it reminds us of lynching.
[25:02.660 --> 25:04.160]  Total mental illness.
[25:04.160 --> 25:06.000]  And then they do change the name of it.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.640]  Not because the schools are scared.
[25:07.640 --> 25:09.720]  They're the ones creating the mental illness.
[25:09.720 --> 25:13.920]  They're the ones creating the war on language, the war on debate, the war on free speech,
[25:13.920 --> 25:14.920]  the war on ideas.
[25:14.920 --> 25:17.560]  And so think about this again.
[25:17.560 --> 25:23.040]  You've got leftist on CNN, MSNBC, everywhere saying Trump's an authoritarian for wanting
[25:23.040 --> 25:29.320]  to have a military parade or Trump's a North Korean or Trump's a fascist.
[25:29.320 --> 25:33.600]  Now you've got Democrats coming out saying, no, we're going to be heroes and go attack
[25:33.600 --> 25:39.040]  it and block the tanks.
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.480]  When it's not tanks coming to crush people's free speech at the university that was off
[25:43.480 --> 25:51.280]  of Tiananmen Square like the Communist did, it's a celebration for those that have fought
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.280]  and those that have died.
[25:52.280 --> 25:55.720]  They also show once a year V-Day parades.
[25:55.720 --> 25:56.720]  What is it?
[25:56.720 --> 25:59.200]  May 9th in Russia?
[25:59.200 --> 26:05.640]  For the 20 million Russians that died, but 20-something percent or more of their population in World
[26:05.640 --> 26:08.640]  War II, 22 million Germans died.
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.640]  That was well over a third of their population.
[26:12.640 --> 26:20.880]  And they show every year Putin having the Victory Day, May 9th.
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.400]  They show it and go, look, he's got a parade threatening us, Putin's got a parade threatening
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.800]  us when the French and the Mexicans and the South Africans, everybody else has military
[26:30.800 --> 26:31.800]  parades.
[26:31.800 --> 26:34.480]  People have parades for the police, they have them for fire departments, they have them
[26:34.480 --> 26:39.280]  to raise money for little kids, they have them for everything.
[26:39.280 --> 26:42.240]  Having a military doesn't make you fascist or communist.
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.760]  Having a fascist or communist government makes you that.
[26:44.760 --> 26:48.000]  It's like saying if we have police, they're all bad because police are corrupt in some
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.920]  areas of Latin America or Asia or Africa.
[26:52.920 --> 26:58.320]  So in Russia, it's called the Patriotic War and almost everybody lost family or large
[26:58.320 --> 27:00.920]  parts of their family or whole families.
[27:00.920 --> 27:06.000]  And so most people living have grandparents or great grandparents that were killed in
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  the war.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.400]  So it's called the Great Patriotic War because Russia did 90 percent of the fighting in World
[27:13.400 --> 27:14.400]  War II.
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.960]  It was all the way from the Marines and the U.S. took care of the Pacific and what happened
[27:18.960 --> 27:19.960]  in Europe.
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.040]  But the 90 percent of fighting the Nazis was the Russians.
[27:24.040 --> 27:26.320]  That was the big war in Russia.
[27:26.320 --> 27:27.880]  That's where almost all the Germans died.
[27:27.880 --> 27:30.000]  You can look it up.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.880]  That's where almost all the Russians died.
[27:32.880 --> 27:34.960]  Was in Russia and in Germany.
[27:34.960 --> 27:36.400]  That's where the big fighting happened.
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.120]  Yes, the U.S. and England drove the Russians out of North Africa.
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.520]  My dad's dad was part of that and it was heavy fighting going into Italy.
[27:43.520 --> 27:44.520]  Heavy fighting.
[27:44.520 --> 27:47.800]  It was 600,000 something U.S. I'm going from memory died.
[27:47.800 --> 27:48.800]  Big war.
[27:48.800 --> 27:51.240]  Not as big as our civil war.
[27:51.240 --> 27:52.240]  That killed millions.
[27:52.240 --> 27:58.680]  But for Russia, it's 20 plus times the number of troops lost that we lost.
[27:58.680 --> 28:02.400]  So our media then, I'm not defending Russia, I'm defending the truth.
[28:02.400 --> 28:05.280]  That's what Victory Day is, not what our media says.
[28:05.280 --> 28:07.920]  It shows how it's all lies.
[28:07.920 --> 28:11.560]  They send the lady running against Putin.
[28:11.560 --> 28:14.640]  They send the lady running against Putin.
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.440]  To the prayer breakfast to say, look, he's a Russian, Trump's a Russian because he's
[28:18.440 --> 28:19.720]  got people there.
[28:19.720 --> 28:21.200]  This is the deception.
[28:21.200 --> 28:22.720]  This is the manipulation.
[28:22.720 --> 28:27.720]  And now the very universities that are bringing in Soviet style or communist Chinese style
[28:27.720 --> 28:32.040]  censorship and bans on free speech saying no demonstrations for conservatives and no
[28:32.040 --> 28:36.920]  white day at the school and kicking the professors out and true malice like stuff, they're the
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.360]  ones coming like Tiananmen Square and shutting down the free speech in the square.
[28:41.360 --> 28:46.480]  And now they take a communist event like Tiananmen Square and conflate it and project it onto
[28:46.480 --> 28:51.640]  Trump if he has a parade or if Russia has a parade when it's the very people that love
[28:51.640 --> 28:55.520]  Tiananmen Square and the crushing of free speech, the American left that are allied
[28:55.520 --> 28:59.960]  with the communist Chinese that are engaging in this entire operation.

[33:31.520 --> 33:40.480]  Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from them4wars.com studios.
[33:40.480 --> 33:45.360]  It just hit me today like a ton of bricks, hit me so hard.
[33:45.360 --> 33:51.120]  I was thinking about the hypocrisy of leftists in this country with antifa hitting people
[33:51.120 --> 33:55.960]  and they had with bike locks, stabbing people, bombing things, attacking their cars, spitting
[33:55.960 --> 34:01.480]  on my reporters, dumping coffee on my head, CNN having them on saying violence is good,
[34:01.480 --> 34:03.680]  against the right wing.
[34:03.680 --> 34:11.040]  It just hit me that they are like the communist Chinese at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.040]  When they go out and engage in violence to stop our free speech, anytime libertarians,
[34:16.040 --> 34:20.960]  conservatives, Trump supporters, you name it, try to have an event, antifa even comes
[34:20.960 --> 34:28.360]  out with AK-47s in Austin and won't let my reporters on the Capitol grounds to be able
[34:28.360 --> 34:34.320]  to cover a woman who was killed by an illegal alien and the illegal alien gets off.
[34:34.320 --> 34:39.160]  We go to a vigil and they are attacking men, women, and children and pushing them and hitting
[34:39.160 --> 34:43.480]  them and not letting them get into the event and the police stand there and look on while
[34:43.480 --> 34:48.880]  the left intimidate and antifa calls for killing cops and cops are getting shot in the back.
[34:48.880 --> 34:52.640]  All this weatherman style tactic and then they've got the nerve to have professors and
[34:52.640 --> 34:59.440]  leftist activists on CNN, MSNBC, we played clips of some of them earlier saying Trump's
[34:59.440 --> 35:04.640]  a fascist, lay in front of the tanks if he has a military parade.
[35:04.640 --> 35:09.360]  When it was the communist Chinese coming in to the university that's right there, their
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.280]  biggest university in China, right off Tiananmen Square, it was the student groups wanting
[35:13.280 --> 35:17.680]  free speech, wanting to be like America, wanting to have free market, wanting to have religious
[35:17.680 --> 35:22.320]  freedom and they got run over, they got killed, they got massacred.
[35:22.320 --> 35:27.840]  Once the sun went down and we all know that and the left is doing that on a micro level
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.000]  all over the country everywhere and they're doing it all over the country to our free
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.040]  speech and then they set up and say we're going to block a military parade tanks, implying
[35:38.040 --> 35:43.040]  tanks are coming to kill them when it's honoring the veterans that have fought and been wounded
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.480]  and died and their families that have given up so much.
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.280]  They're the ones again trying to keep us from going into the inauguration.
[35:51.280 --> 35:54.240]  They're the ones attacking families, they're the ones spitting on us, they're the ones
[35:54.240 --> 36:01.360]  hitting us, they're the ones attacking women and just dragging them off into mobs to be
[36:01.360 --> 36:07.240]  physically have seven or eight bones broken and stopping rallies and stopping free speech
[36:07.240 --> 36:11.840]  and stopping Milo from speaking and stopping Ann Coulter and trying to stop me from speaking
[36:11.840 --> 36:14.560]  and trying to stop Mike Cernovich.
[36:14.560 --> 36:21.200]  They are flaming out of control evil authoritarians, stopping free speech just like in Tiananmen
[36:21.200 --> 36:26.160]  Square and doing it with force and beating people up.
[36:26.160 --> 36:29.480]  We're showing some of the footage here this is nothing compared to the footage I mean
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.480]  the bike locks and the women being dragged off and women being beaten over the head
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.520]  with Mexican flags and you have blood coming out of people's heads all of it we've seen
[36:37.520 --> 36:47.480]  it and then they've got the nerve to say we're the ones like Tiananmen Square, we're the
[36:47.480 --> 36:52.440]  ones who are going to face down tanks as if the tanks are coming to kill them and we
[36:52.440 --> 36:57.080]  have a parade and then they're going to be the ones blocking other people's speech and
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.640]  then saying they're heroes like Tiananmen Square standing up for speech when the left
[37:02.640 --> 37:08.000]  are the ones calling for violence and carrying it out everywhere they now have 50 people
[37:08.000 --> 37:20.840]  just by this one academic individual, Arne Mcconnie to carry this out it's unbelievable
[37:20.840 --> 37:24.440]  and the media is so distorted the public say that just like Tiananmen Square they're in
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.200]  front of the tanks when again the Tiananmen Square they were coming to crush the free
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.600]  speech you're the ones getting in front of the free speech blocking it because you can't
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.720]  stand to see people have public events you don't control you are like the communist Chinese
[37:39.720 --> 37:46.760]  and guess what you're allied with them and guess what the weathermen say they say they
[37:46.760 --> 37:51.360]  wanted communist Chinese style takeover in this country they say they want that event
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.760]  they say they want that to unfold and again we're just showing when they did block the
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.680]  tanks during the day you can type into the search engine if you want to see the massacre
[38:00.680 --> 38:05.400]  at Tiananmen Square massacre footage night time footage tanks just running over a bunch
[38:05.400 --> 38:11.360]  of people shooting people men women and children dad all over the place and then some little
[38:11.360 --> 38:18.160]  effeminate thug with his little high tech capitalist computer watch in his little sports jersey
[38:18.160 --> 38:25.280]  can sit there and direct everyone to be heroes like Tiananmen when he is the tanks at Tiananmen
[38:25.280 --> 38:29.280]  coming to crush the free speech he is the tanks of Soros and the leftists coming to
[38:29.280 --> 38:35.800]  stop our military parade to honor our veterans and the fact that we let scum like this do
[38:35.800 --> 38:44.800]  that is on us and you can see it when they have the parade the news will be heroes like
[38:44.800 --> 38:49.960]  Tiananmen when they're the leftist they back to communist Chinese they're banning free
[38:49.960 --> 38:56.120]  speech at the colleges everywhere they are exactly what they say they're opposing another
[38:56.120 --> 39:07.200]  leftist dirt ball telling us that they are out there standing up against authoritarianism
[39:07.200 --> 39:17.160]  when they are what they're supposedly opposing it's sick isn't it how immoral and how distorted
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.560]  and how twisted and how upside down and how deceptive but do you think this this this
[39:22.560 --> 39:29.800]  guy has pronounced his name do you think he is even conscious enough or self aware enough
[39:29.800 --> 39:36.800]  to know what a contradiction he is get him off the screen I can't look at it anymore
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.000]  he goes we will be like the people you know since I played him so much let's let's play
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.200]  his whole statement here so you can actually hear it from his own disgusting mouth how
[39:45.200 --> 39:50.120]  he wants to stop our free speech and then he'll be like a hero like the people of Tiananmen
[39:50.120 --> 39:57.440]  Square standing up for free speech and being killed this is becoming or an author authoritarian
[39:57.440 --> 40:03.880]  state and we need a grassroots effort today if you can see what I've been posting over
[40:03.880 --> 40:13.480]  the last few hours is that journalist politicians and anti-war movement groups are starting to
[40:13.480 --> 40:19.800]  build up the the the the worrying build up the story build up the tension we have to turn
[40:19.800 --> 40:25.880]  this into a three day story and what I want people to do is to commit just like I will
[40:25.880 --> 40:32.880]  that we would go to Washington DC if such a crazy insane act occurred and we would lay
[40:32.880 --> 40:39.840]  down in front of the tanks just like the heroes and the courageous students did in China in
[40:39.840 --> 40:46.440]  1989 they need to hear our voices this isn't clickbait for the media this isn't something
[40:46.440 --> 40:53.780]  that the big shots do this is something that you and I can do now I've been watching some
[40:53.780 --> 40:57.760]  of the comments under my feet some people say oh I don't have the money to do it oh

[47:14.360 --> 47:29.920]  raging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[47:29.920 --> 47:34.680]  war think about how smart trump is but think about how smart matt drudge is i mean matt
[47:34.680 --> 47:41.480]  drudge there's all sorts of stuff i've learned behind the scenes kind of matchmaking different
[47:41.480 --> 47:48.480]  things a different talk show host for different events different different explosive ideas
[47:48.480 --> 47:52.240]  for the good and it was matt drudge as i did have a military parade haven't had one in
[47:52.240 --> 47:57.800]  18 years it'll trigger the leftist and i know for a fact that's been pushed in the white
[47:57.800 --> 48:03.920]  house directly from drudge and now trumps announcing it and the left flips out and says you're
[48:03.920 --> 48:07.880]  an authoritarian like north korea but then they say don't criticize north korea it's
[48:07.880 --> 48:15.760]  not bad if north korea has a corrupt military that doesn't make us bad and we're taking
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.120]  back control of our country the military under leftist control they've been preparing them
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.040]  for gun confiscation we knew about all that because the military would always give me
[48:25.040 --> 48:30.520]  the documents they'd give them to the nr a and stuff 10 15 20 years ago and people couldn't
[48:30.520 --> 48:36.400]  believe in the nr the nr a did not want to be that political they would just sit on it
[48:36.400 --> 48:41.960]  more and more we would get the documents out of the marine corps out of the army how do
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.040]  you think we knew how to be at all those places some of them secret operations and the media
[48:47.040 --> 48:52.800]  would spend it jones hates the military no i hate globalists getting control of it because
[48:52.800 --> 49:00.520]  that's how authoritarianism takes place tyranny will come to your door in a uniform free societies
[49:00.520 --> 49:05.040]  also have military and police and they're always going to have problems because people
[49:05.040 --> 49:11.880]  have problems and we're all failed fallen people at one level but if you let corruption
[49:11.880 --> 49:20.600]  take hold and you organize it over the people it's called the t word tyranny and so i am
[49:20.600 --> 49:27.120]  so excited because just like hey you shouldn't take a neater in the national anthem that's
[49:27.120 --> 49:31.920]  disrespectful oh it's my free speech and great people don't go to your football game and
[49:31.920 --> 49:37.520]  that was a fight they have with the president they lost a fight they have with america they
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.680]  lost and so trump knows america is under attack he knows the family's under attack he knows
[49:41.680 --> 49:48.240]  globalism is demoralizing us so he has to invoke our nationalism to show how they want
[49:48.240 --> 49:51.920]  to get rid of the borders like trump said sure we'll legalize the dreamers they can
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.800]  prove they're not criminals they went no no fascist we want totally open borders no borders
[49:57.800 --> 50:03.560]  and all people's be able to come here that was two weeks ago and suddenly folks even
[50:03.560 --> 50:09.040]  in mainline polls go well trumps being reasonable you're not being reasonable also when he came
[50:09.040 --> 50:12.280]  out and said that he'd always said that during the campaign the media misrepresented it
[50:12.280 --> 50:16.120]  so when he said they went oh look you're lying you said to port all mexicans they're all evil
[50:16.120 --> 50:21.160]  really show me the videotape show me the audio it doesn't exist it's a lie so see it is credits
[50:21.160 --> 50:25.440]  that lie and it's credits the other lie that they're not being reasonable that of course
[50:25.440 --> 50:31.280]  if you've been deported five times and been convicted of rape you are gonna be deported
[50:31.280 --> 50:37.480]  we're not gonna make you a dreamer that's total common sense but see it's a cult the
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.080]  globalist want to break our borders that's why it's a crime in germany or sweden or other
[50:41.080 --> 50:45.120]  areas i have stacks of news today where they rape people they kill people and the media
[50:45.120 --> 50:51.520]  is told do not report it was a muslim invader don't even report it was a migrant first call
[50:51.520 --> 50:56.800]  them refugees then migrants then don't call them muslim then don't say who they are at
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.840]  all they fought for days to cover up that was an illegal alien deported two times before
[51:01.840 --> 51:09.920]  that killed that linebacker for the cults over the weekend we're fighting just for our
[51:09.920 --> 51:15.960]  ability to have speech and talk about what's going on and so trump invokes this to go we're
[51:15.960 --> 51:21.880]  gonna have a military parade to honor our veterans and the fallen and their families
[51:21.880 --> 51:28.760]  boy you can't have that we can have the illegal aliens march we can have all the liberal marches
[51:28.760 --> 51:33.720]  nobody tries to stop those but anybody else tries to march here comes the left to beat
[51:33.720 --> 51:38.600]  you up and the cops stand by and if you raise a hand to fight back you're arrested in blue
[51:38.600 --> 51:43.800]  cities as fast as you can snap your fingers and the cops say we're sorry we've been ordered
[51:43.800 --> 51:52.040]  to stand down on video that's how these cowards operate a hundred to one with police protection
[51:52.040 --> 51:55.840]  in blue cities you imagine all of america being under this where they can beat up and
[51:55.840 --> 52:02.160]  attack anybody they want we've got leftist brutality beyond anything you see with bad
[52:02.160 --> 52:07.400]  apple cops i've experienced i've been punched and hit and spit on and attacked with coffee
[52:07.400 --> 52:13.160]  and i'm a pretty big guy i i almost tell million and people the reporters don't go out they
[52:13.160 --> 52:17.080]  don't know we're going out then they make tv shows where it's info wars is the name of
[52:17.080 --> 52:22.280]  the show a reporter like millie gets drug off and raped and then the jury lets her go
[52:22.280 --> 52:27.520]  let's them go said she deserves to be raped that's law and order last week their message
[52:27.520 --> 52:33.280]  is we're gonna hurt you we're gonna attack you and we're gonna let you go these juries
[52:33.280 --> 52:39.720]  in these in these in these swamp cities like dc and la and san francisco we're gonna lay
[52:39.720 --> 52:43.840]  lay lay lay and shoot women in the back say they didn't get away with it we're gonna have
[52:43.840 --> 52:50.040]  simulated rapes of women and hope that actually starts she deserved to have be gang raped
[52:50.040 --> 52:56.800]  by a line of men this this info wars reporter on the show the name of the shows info wars
[52:56.800 --> 53:02.360]  it's set in a fictional uh city like what happened in charlottesville it's a millie weaver
[53:02.360 --> 53:09.480]  reporter saying the stuff info war says word for word even makes sense what she's saying
[53:09.480 --> 53:17.000]  and she gets raped and thrown in a trash can thrown in a dumpster with blood all over
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  and the jury said and so it's it's about wimps being able to come out and attack and have
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.600]  their day in seattle in san francisco in austin and no it's their day of cowardice their day
[53:28.600 --> 53:33.280]  to bully their day to attack their day to be vicious their day to hurt speech their time
[53:33.280 --> 53:42.400]  to hurt their time their time to simulate war coming up i'm gonna play prayer breakfast
[53:42.400 --> 53:45.880]  clips and a bunch of other amazing clips that i haven't even gotten to the over the top chris
[53:45.880 --> 53:50.920]  come on jim jordan battle over democrat memo we've got just so much but but just the left
[53:50.920 --> 53:54.320]  trying to kill our speech and attacking us everywhere and then saying they're like victims
[53:54.320 --> 53:57.360]  at tanham square when they're gonna go try to block a veterans parade when they're the
[53:57.360 --> 54:04.840]  ones blocking free speech again it's just too rich it's a perfect inversion of reality
[54:04.840 --> 54:11.240]  upside down land i've been calling it upside down land for 20 years and they got these
[54:11.240 --> 54:17.320]  shows you know like um one on netflix whether it's upside down people go is that is that
[54:17.320 --> 54:22.360]  from stranger things no that's that's just everybody talks about upside down land that's
[54:22.360 --> 54:27.240]  what the globalist are it's an inverted dimension that's what satanism is that's what a pentagram
[54:27.240 --> 54:34.280]  is the pentagram is an upside down pentacle a pentacle symbolizes humans ahead two arms
[54:34.280 --> 54:43.240]  and two legs the powerful powerful symbol inverting it is about it upside down and them siphoning
[54:43.240 --> 54:49.640]  the energy off of the inversion because it creates major dark energy major destruction
[54:49.640 --> 54:54.920]  major the universe is not in order so these weak people go in and go let me flip this
[54:54.920 --> 54:59.600]  upside down because they're so weak even though they only get a tiny bit of the evil power
[54:59.600 --> 55:07.880]  that's created by it they still kind of go warming their hands to the fire of evil down
[55:07.880 --> 55:14.680]  briefly ladies and gentlemen we have launched a new site fortified supply.com and and it's
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.440]  in full or site they censored us off google ads and everything so i thought you know let's

[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:14.240]  war it's alex jones well there's a lot to talk about there's the president's prayer
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.600]  breakfast where they sent the lady running against latimer putin to it with some other
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.560]  russians and the media said look trump's got a bunch of russians as it hit his event
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.520]  he's a russian man that is just incredible how they've successfully though gotten where
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.600]  trump won't meet with putin even though he should have already met with him six eight
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:41.280]  months ago he's got all the other major g8 leaders it's crazy they have successfully
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:48.640]  launched a mccarthyism 50 times bigger and a hundred percent legitimate mccarthy it turned
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:54.200]  out from the russian files were classified was dead on but as soon as he said oh there's
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.600]  rich elites in the u.s. in the state department helping the the the they were helping the
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:05.520]  leftist that had colonized russia they were helping the leftist that our globalist elites
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:12.480]  had funded 1917 that's in the russian textbooks now that's in major u.s. textbooks as well
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.560]  like tragedy and hope but tragedy and hope is only for state department officials to
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.080]  read only a thousand copies were printed because they were confused they're like we fight communism
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.600]  but we secretly fund it yes it's full spectrum dominance let us explain that to you well
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:32.480]  trumps about stopping that and obviously he can't put the brakes to it immediately everything's
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:39.560]  too entrenched but knowing how the scam works knowing how the beyond machiavellian system
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.600]  of funding radical islam to take over other islamic areas destabilize those areas then
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.520]  use that wave to take the liberties in europe and use that as a pretext of an invade the
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:56.160]  middle east full spectrum dominance it's hey i don't have any morals i'm gonna be super
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:02.560]  corrupt super evil and i'm gonna wage war against everybody but myself and consolidate
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.360]  total control and you look at the globalists that run this thing they have horribly unhappy
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:15.360]  children they're completely screwed up but their evil is so massive and so big and so
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:25.800]  strong and so intense that the average person's blind to it just like we only see in a limited
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.820]  spectrum of light on the light spectrum well if you can't see something with your eyes
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:38.200]  right off spectrum you can't pick up ultra violent radiation you can't pick up hundreds
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.440]  and hundreds of different types of things in the light spectrum and things that are
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.200]  outside the light spectrum it doesn't exist for you just like radio waves just like cell
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:53.440]  towers it's all here it's all here with us right now and out of sight out of mind and
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:00.480]  so they hope that people aren't picking up all this and they think you're too stupid
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.560]  to ever be aware of it now i went into a whole rant earlier about we just joined us about
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.960]  the left attacking free speech all over the country like they're the communist chinese
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.600]  coming into Tiananmen Square to crush the students who want to free speech it's the left crushing
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:20.160]  free speech all over campuses beating people up saying no white day or no whites allowed
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.440]  you know in what at the Missouri university or at evergreen up in washington i mean this
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:31.360]  is really going on this isn't pockets and now it's up to 50 people this this academics
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.480]  got ready to lay down in front of the tanks like like the tanks are coming at the military
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:39.960]  parade trumps gonna have to attack them but ran paul has a really good point and he's
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:46.160]  right trump needs to bring the troops home from places like afghanistan they are downsizing
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.320]  the troops in iraq we need to pull out of a bunch of these foreign military bases and
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:57.200]  we need to cut those areas that are offensive and they're part of this big globalist empire
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.840]  that we've been paying for and getting none of the none of the dividends from and we need
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:07.640]  to bring a lot of the troops home and then have a parade for say a hundred thousand troops
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:14.560]  being brought home from around the world that's only less than a third and and and then celebrate
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.640]  those are still in combat and then all the rest of it i mean i agree usually the military
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:27.880]  parades are you know when world war two is over or when we pull out of iraq in 1991 the
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:34.520]  military parade because it's over well i get what trumps doing to have one because we
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.920]  haven't had one in 18 years to thank our military for what they've done but there needs to be
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:44.920]  at least the symbolism and more than token more than tokenism of a substantive number
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:52.680]  of troops pulled out of these far flung places where we've got military bases so we all know
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:59.080]  really why so cia hit teams can infiltrate locally and kill people you know i've got
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:03.720]  some talking points here about caveman from info wars life dot com but instead of going
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.280]  on those talking points let me just give you what i've experienced personally from all
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:12.120]  the wives tales in every culture we know that the bones have the essence we know chicken
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.680]  noodle soup is great for people that are sick again in every culture this has been reported
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:23.560]  because it works and there's no way to quantify how strong this is but the amount of bone
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:30.600]  protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.560]  is incredible ladies and gentlemen whether it's for your joints whether it's for your
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:40.520]  arteries and your veins whether it's for your brain whether it's for energy this ladies and
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:47.160]  gentlemen is the strongest most concentrated bone broth formula out there and it's amazing
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.280]  find out for yourself today at info wars store dot com what you do for your family
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:06:01.320]  and again i want to thank you all for your support you are funding the information war in 2018
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:10.920]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving this
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:25.800]  transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:34.760]  transmitting worldwide it's alex jones well we're going to continue to follow the stock market
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:43.720]  and what's happening to it today while we are live here on air that is going to be unfolding
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:50.360]  it's been as far down as 450 points my computer's perpetually frozen when you guys put that back on
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:55.640]  screen for me the dow jones industrial averages from cmbc police thank you uh so you can see
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:12.840]  uh right now uh how far down it is 24 272 points so that is 650 uh on the day um 620 it's gyrating
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:20.360]  back and forth there uh as we speak so we'll be uh going over all of that today as we watch this
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:32.840]  unfold it would have to go down 7800 plus points to erase all of the trump gains we've seen in the
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:40.280]  last 14 15 months since he was president elected and president but that said it is still built on a
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:46.440]  house of cards because of the very globalist policies we've seen but the real new jobs numbers
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.640]  the record new startups the thousands of companies coming back including apple that is going to mean
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.480]  massive new employment for americans but we've been in a race trump expanding the bubble because you
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:03.000]  can't just stabilize you have to expand it hope some money gets back to the people before basically
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.960]  none of it was getting back to the people and then and then hope that we innovate our way out of this
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.480]  like we've done before and trumps talked about trying to get a lot of the secret technologies
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:19.400]  and things that are seen as disruptive technologies uh back back out to the public so i want to
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:28.600]  speaking of innovation go to a very important video here that was put together by rob doing
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:37.560]  myself elon musk falcon heavy launch and spaceman's secrets decoded or really where did elon muskett
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:46.280]  the idea of firing a sports coupe uh coupe uh out into space uh with an astronaut at the wheel
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:53.560]  and that video it's a powerful little piece is up on info wars dot com elon musk falcon heavy
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:09:05.160]  launch and spaceman secrets decoded what's next for humanity and again the globalists have decided
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:13.720]  to not have a future for of and by humans and so just the idea of humans going back into space
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:20.920]  or putting an artifact into space signifies that we believe the next 20 30 40 50 100 years
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:26.520]  our technology will advance so much that we're going to catch up with probes launched in the 1960s
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.240]  and 70s like voyager and others and then we'll catch up to this car probably when elon muskett
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:41.720]  is still alive i'd guess by his 80s and that it'll be in a museum maybe on mars or maybe in new york
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:48.040]  city or maybe in dubai or maybe in p king or maybe in tokyo or maybe in who knows where mexico city
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.200]  but i gotta sneak into his vision that my children one day
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.240]  will be in a museum looking at that car that was launched into deep space a few days ago
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.680]  and of course no one noticed where this was really from it's from heavy metal
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:10.360]  and we show side by side how the idea of something could be envisioned in a 1980s cartoon
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:19.160]  an independent film it's a great great film arc typo is now manifest in reality this is a ritual
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:29.160]  not an occult ritual but a true ritual of human vision let's go to the report
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:11:08.680]  the decision was made by darpa about 30 years ago to build a future without humans
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.440]  that silicon life forms were better and that the so-called elite would merge with them bill joy
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:19.640]  was the first to warn about this in 1999 after he had a meeting with several hundred top tech
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.600]  billionaires where they had a consensus to bring in the world government dumb down the population
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.800]  and exterminate us well along comes elon muskett and of course he's been meeting with trump and
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:35.960]  others and he says we're gonna make space travel about humans again and so he launches this huge
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:43.560]  space x launch with this heavy booster rocket with this innovative tesla car that's a roadster
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:52.680]  with an image of a human or a spaceman an astronaut a cosmonaut one who walks amongst the stars
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:59.800]  this idea that humans are only empowered when they realize their potential to explore and to
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.960]  innovate and to build not to be told that we're yesterday's news and the elites are just telling
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:11.640]  us to crawl into a hole and die and that there'll be no real human evolution now there are different
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.520]  types of evolution there's the eugenics based social Darwinistic evolution that says they can
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.600]  commit any crime they want and pray on you and your family but then there is real evolution
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.360]  which is human beings taking control of their own development in fact of all the species on this
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.520]  planet we are the one species that has taken control of our evolution through the greater good
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:40.920]  through our conquest through our ideas through our art through the common knowledge of the people
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:46.840]  based sixth sense internet but the globalists come in with hollywood and this whole new order system
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:52.600]  and they suppress that and they turn us inward and they give us lots of little diversionary
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:59.160]  distractions like modern gladiatorial games and sports and hollywood stars so that instead of
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.280]  looking at the stars and wanting to have our progeny travel to the stars instead of wanting to
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:09.960]  unlock the mysteries of the atom and the universe and really fulfill our destiny to go to the next
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:16.200]  level we look at red carpets and hollywood tarts and directors and all these people as if they're
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:21.960]  god and as if they are the stars but trump and info wars and you and all of us together with
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:28.360]  elon musk are tearing aside that and making nasa and private industry and everything about humans
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:35.640]  with a guy and a really kick-ass motorcycle slash race car driver outfit right out of the 1980s heavy
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:41.160]  metal because you know there's a hat tip to that even though i haven't seen it rocketing out on the
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:49.960]  big blue black highway into the universe into life extension into endless choices into incredible
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:57.240]  discovery building a future for humans building a future by humans building a future where we
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:03.240]  continue on and exist and don't just make ourselves failures and losers the stars aren't hollywood
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:09.400]  the stars are in deep space in the sky and we're all part of it and we're all stars we all orbit
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:14.440]  this beautiful star and we're going to experience through our progeny the mysteries of the universe
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:22.200]  that god has laid out for us you're a god compared to the best ai they've got and these failed evil
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:28.120]  people believe that they can suppress you and dominate you that somehow they can use us as the
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:34.120]  master engineers to build a system to make them a god like rick herzl says i don't believe in god
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.800]  yet fool you were made by god you're an extension of god but because you're cut off from god you
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.720]  can't experience that and know that you've already arrived but elon musk and this whole launch was
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:55.400]  a ritual not satanic not pagan not not even christian but just human whatever we envision
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.960]  in a cartoon from the 80s is now manifest on the head of a big boost rocket on its way
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.480]  the universe is waiting for you you simply have to take it in your hands and decide to
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:13.480]  have a pro human pro innovation world it's built for humans by humans for humans
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:17.480]  so
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:31.000]  info wars because there's a war on for your mind we have to realize the true awesomeness of the
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.400]  middle of the universe that we're actually in rob do and i threw that together yesterday

[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:57.240]  with the fact that at first they didn't hide the fact that they were illegally spying on the president
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.640]  in his entire operation when he was a candidate they said oh we've been spying on you we know
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:06.920]  you're a russian agent and they went oh we never spied on you once he was president elect and then
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:12.600]  once he was president he found out everything in fact he found out on november 17th before he was
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:19.080]  even sworn in just a week and a half after he was elected from admiral rogers at the nsa so
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:24.280]  trump's known the whole time he doesn't leak stuff to the press like the globalist dude
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:30.280]  and and like adam schiff's reportedly has been caught doing over a hundred times
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:36.120]  seriously illegal stuff so he just sits there and lets them dig their hole deeper and that's what
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:42.840]  they've done and i've had a lot of people asking me alex why aren't you covering the bombshells as
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.200]  trump called it in a video yesterday of these new text messages and new emails that congress is
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:54.120]  releasing almost on a daily basis because we already were told by congress what was in there we
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.520]  already know we already know what they did we already know they lied we already have enough
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:04.520]  evidence to put them in jail 50 times over the the the perjury to congress the perjury to get
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:11.960]  the warrants uh the the the insurance policy the secret society uh the money paid by or to his wife
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:20.200]  two million dollars she was hired just to write the dossier at fusion gps and then she gets
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:25.960]  a large portion of two million dollars from her husband that pulls the trigger i said that back
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:32.040]  in december we played the video just yesterday now it's all over the news oh my gosh the big
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:39.880]  crime is or giving his wife millions of dollars uh yeah i don't need to see it break to know what i'm
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:47.960]  looking at see and i'm not bragging about this it's just it's crazy how they fear info wars
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.880]  because they know a lot of times i point something out and then somebody else picks it up and something
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:56.520]  that no one was looking at now gets looked at that's what they really fear is that i'm an independent
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:03.400]  person who studied the law a little bit and i'm not a rocket scientist but i know that if you give
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:12.680]  a half million dollars to an fbi agent's wife and that fbi agent is the main one investigating
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:17.480]  hillary and then covers up the investigation and tells her she's not an investigation and gives her
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:21.880]  a letter and then has a fake investigation and then he's the same one covering up all this other
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:27.000]  stuff and then he's the one running for mccabe and comey he's the number three in charge the
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:34.760]  entire fake russia gate deal and then his wife gets a half million dollars cash and they won't even
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:44.520]  say where it went now i'm not a rocket scientist but i remember three months ago pointing out
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:50.520]  one of the crew goes hey this guy's wife ran for was it governorship and got a half million
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:57.400]  dollar donation from hillary and so of course they're investigating the clinton foundation
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.840]  and of course it's coming out they did all this criminal stuff and paper play it was already in
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.800]  the wiki leaks i mean folks they're in wiki leaks saying we're going to have the alastor
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:15.080]  crawly ritual tonight and we've got blood semen and breast milk sir and then podesta asks how fresh
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:28.280]  and delicious it is i mean and what did they do they were in deep trouble so they just said oh it's
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.200]  all a pizza place over here seeing in everybody made everybody look at the pizza place that they
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:38.600]  did go to to make it all about that instead of new york and at the cabin there will be the children
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:46.520]  in the hot tub for your entertainment they're all experienced and will service you well but
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.840]  there's still children so they might give you a problem
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.800]  and you've got quentin tarantino on howard stern saying
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:10.280]  the demon roman polanski convicted and ran off for child right here got arrested in europe for it
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:16.040]  in jail now you got polanski he says oh that's no big deal that's consensual
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.400]  you know see the age of consent is 17 to 18 because you can't join the military you can't drink alcohol
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:28.680]  because you're a minor your parents have your custody and oh by the way she wasn't consenting
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:35.160]  she was drugged for the raping but see that's what even howard stern went man that's disgusting i
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:41.560]  got daughters that's pedophilia that roman polanski engaged in but that's what we're dealing with here
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:49.240]  is people that are in their own world and think we just exist for their pleasure and their enjoyment
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.960]  so fbi informant testifies moscow routed millions the clinton foundation in russia
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.600]  uranium dominant strategy well we know that and that's what's come out and it was 30 something
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:10.520]  million dollars just hillary the pedestus it's insane it's next level so we'll we'll get into
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:14.760]  all that too coming up it's a big deal but this is the kind of stuff i'm really concerned about
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:21.720]  special report u.s body brokers supply world with torsos limbs and heads the jury found that rathburn
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:29.640]  defrauded customers shipping parts infected with hiv and hepatitis
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.640]  unbelievable we're going to get to all of it but briefly because i said i'd do it
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:45.800]  tesla is a patriot type company i like elon musk but i don't like how they're going to pioneer
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.120]  the self-driving cars and just give in to all that when you say you're pro-human and i understand
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.400]  well that's innovation as long as you know we know what's going on and it's the same thing
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.320]  with the trump situation i'm all for military parade but he really needs to bring a bunch of
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.160]  troops home from these useless bases around the world that are bankrupting our country and that
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.520]  have been serving the globalist but we need to bring a lot of troops home and cut the military
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:13.160]  budget for stuff that is purely empire building and ran paul has come out and said that as well
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:18.680]  bring us troops home from afghanistan then throw the parade but i understand what trump's doing
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:24.040]  triggering the leftist to making them come out and say they're going to attack the parade to show
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:28.600]  people the internal enemy and who they really are so i'm just saying he should bring some troops home
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.760]  from iraq they're coming over my rack now it's been announced almost all of them so i guess that's
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.880]  probably what trump's got in mind you know we always think hey trump i'll do this and he's
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.720]  five steps ahead that's already been planned in fact i i bet that's what happens uh but a great
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:45.000]  idea matt drudge had a year ago now manifesting before we go any further uh once we introduce you

[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:43.720]  of efficiency and prosperity what is the secret of silent green the powdered flesh from dead babies
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:49.800]  some people believe they can cure disease because of its enormous popularity silent green is in

[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:25.000]  combination of death panels and and sales taxes i'm consistently pro-death i'm for assisted suicide
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.640]  i'm for regular zoas and i'm for whatever gets the freeway moving is spending a million dollars on
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:35.960]  that last three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the those 10
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:42.200]  teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs but that's called the death panel uh and
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.920]  you're not supposed to have that discussion they told me to uh to say that they were sorry
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:50.360]  but that you had become unreliable
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:03.000]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to its
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.640]  children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents that kind of society will
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:15.160]  also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the quizlings and the
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:22.440]  collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult the scoops are on their way
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:30.840]  the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way you will find out why soylent

[01:35:45.240 --> 01:36:07.240]  you
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.560]  from the front lines of the information ruler
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.560]  it's alex jones
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:24.680]  bitcoin today not crisis economics crisis bitcoin how would you open the book well i
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.560]  said it's the mother of all bubbles and is also the biggest bubble in human history if you compare
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:36.280]  it to say the mccp bubble or the tech bubble or tulip mania or south bubble bitcoin to tulips
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:43.240]  much worse if you look at the peak in the bitcoin was an order money to higher than tulip mania
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:49.480]  and now has crashed by about 60 percent compared to the peak of mid december has crashed 30 percent
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.760]  last week and 10 percent today and it's all the way down to zero the fundamental value bitcoin is
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:00.200]  zero i was talking with our edward robinson and our team at at crypto folks out on twitter how
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:07.000]  did they get this handle at crypto out on twitter is a bloomberg summation of this culture in a vet
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.280]  the money question today noriel is the crypto people say they can separate the crypto industry
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:21.480]  blockchain all the rest of it all everything we saw davos from the value of bitcoin can you separate
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:28.120]  crypto from the price decay of bitcoin no first of all there are already something like
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.560]  1300 plus cryptocurrencies or icos most of them are even worse and don't have any intrinsic value
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:40.760]  like bitcoin so if bitcoin is a bubble they're a bit a bubble to the power of two or three
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:45.720]  and there's all this hype about blockchain saying okay maybe bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.680]  bubble or a fad but blockchain is really a revolutionary industry has been around for 10
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:56.760]  years the only application is bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are a scam and in early days
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:02.280]  of the internet people say well in the early days yet you know yet html you have web you have email
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.200]  you had lots of other things you had millions of applications hundreds of millions using them
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:12.280]  after 10 years what they all can offer in the blockchain space nothing just a bunch of cryptocurrencies
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:18.600]  that are a scam now i stayed out of bitcoin because i don't get involved in bubbles because
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.200]  i don't want to hurt my listeners but at the same time the fiat currencies these governments have
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.760]  are even more corrupt according to robini's own standard i've had robini on before and so you see
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:35.240]  this full assault now here's the headlines get ready for most cryptocurrencies to hit zero
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:44.040]  goldman's heads wow miniapolis fed president says bitcoin is a toy for collectors bitcoin price
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:50.600]  continues to recover after pushing january and fears of crash so it seemed like it was the biggest
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:57.240]  thing in the world just a few months ago ecb officials backs bitcoin clamped down well we saw
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:02.920]  the clamp down start a few weeks ago that's now caused you to start going down joining us is
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:08.760]  roger ver of bitcoin dot com after founding several successful companies in silicon valley roger began
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:15.240]  his bitcoin journey in 2011 here's before traditional venue capital firms got involved he
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.000]  became the first person in the world to start investing in bitcoin related startups nearly
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.960]  single-handedly funding the entire first generation of bitcoin businesses he currently invest
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:29.720]  include bitcoin dot com blockchain dot com bit pay dot com kraken dot com many many many others
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:34.360]  and it's free time he enjoys competing in traditional tournaments bitcoin dot com so he's
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:39.800]  the expert to get on about this uh and and try to explain it to me maybe if he's got more time we'll
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.760]  open the phones up for a couple segments and take calls then i will i promise get to the big news
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:49.320]  i promise i keep saying i'm going to get into about what's behind the whole trans thing because
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.640]  they've now admitted what what i've said behind it but it's very important that this this emergency
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.960]  transmission go out because they're going to use this to end up censoring all speech starting with
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.040]  one word so we explain that next hour uh but roger ver thanks for coming on with us today
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:08.040]  thank you elix so where should we start you just saw that criticism those articles i read how to
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:17.320]  you as kind of the bitcoin guru respond well i've been since it was a dollar each and i remember
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.000]  hearing similar arguments about it when bitcoin hit one dollar per bitcoin for the first time people
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.240]  said bitcoin has no intrinsic value bitcoin can never be worth the whole dollar each uh
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.600]  they said all the exact same arguments that we're hearing today when bitcoin is around ten
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:34.040]  thousand dollars each well give people the history of bitcoin it's in a snapshot if you could
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:41.400]  sure so uh when i first heard about bitcoin i got incredibly excited about it but i knew
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:45.880]  that it was the first time history of humankind that thanks to this technology now anyone can send
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:50.840]  and receive any amount of money with anyone anywhere in the world instantly basically for free and
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.640]  there's nothing that anybody can do to stop it and for me uh that's incredibly exciting i think
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.760]  people should have complete control over their own money and they shouldn't be bossed around or
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:05.240]  told what they can and can't do with their own money and bitcoin was this freedom for a single
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.400]  person that's why i got involved and that's why i'm still here today because i see it as a tool
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.160]  to empower the individual and strip power away from the governments and corporations and banks
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:23.080]  around the world how many cryptocurrencies are there now that we know of there's thousands but
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.920]  there's only a few that are actually having utility at this point so the ones that people
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.960]  are actually using on a wide scale would be bitcoin core bitcoin cash ethereum and maybe a
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.320]  couple of others out there those the ones that have the most volume the most traction the most
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:39.160]  users around the world and a lot of people get confused like why would any of these virtual
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:46.680]  currencies have any value at all but the answer is simple it's useful first it will have a value
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.280]  and so bitcoin and ethereum and a bunch of these other ones they're incredibly useful people are
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:56.280]  using them for payments all over the world and the supply is limited so first they're gonna ask
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.760]  more people to use their value goes up over time not down because the supply is limited we're going
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.680]  to go to break try to fix your sky a little bit most of it's coming across this is really important
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:11.480]  tally sticks seashells then copper coins silver coins gold coins it's whatever we accept has value
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:15.720]  has value and so the magicians by the Federal Reserve and other central banks they want to
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.120]  sit there and say this is all a fraud but you guys have actually created and encoded new digital
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:26.440]  systems that has value in that and then it does contain and then transfer forward information
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.680]  that people then want to consider as a currency i think it's completely legitimate it's just a
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:36.760]  in my layperson's view and why i've never gotten any of it is it's a minefield of wild wild west
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.560]  during this period fortunes will be made they will be lost uh and so it's not been my core mission
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.120]  to be involved in this or i'd be in the stock market god not a money i could have made the
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.520]  few people i gave advice to are just blown away uh but knowing what i know politically but i just
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.320]  never stuck my toe in it because i fear regulators would come lock my butt up we'll be back stay with

[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:30.840]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:37.080]  all right roger ver the bitcoin king is uh getting his skype fixture getting on the phone we're
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.560]  going to talk to him in a minute really important and i know the last few days i said i would get to
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:49.480]  what the whole trans movements about uh and why have you say tranny facebook twitter you name it
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:56.840]  says they will ban you and we've had executives from facebook and twitter call here and it's
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:01.560]  official executives and say we don't want to ban you but you can't use that word above all other
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:07.800]  words and i'm going to explain it what's what's behind it it's not the people that men that want
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.400]  to be women or women that want to be men it has nothing to do with that it has to do with something
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:20.520]  bigger the most protected class are going to be augmented humans cyborgs you name it
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:28.920]  and you're going to have humanoids which again isn't a man and a woman with the chromosomes
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:35.000]  splicing together it's it's they're already announcing the first baby with three parents to
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.760]  be born this year they've been doing it for decades but it's it's it's not a human it's
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:45.320]  something different when you got three parents and he's oh we just changed some of these genes
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:51.320]  over here it changes the whole deal especially start mixing two women that's a whole another
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:57.800]  subject because women have double the genetic code and then some and then one extra chromosome
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:06.760]  but but also the mitochondrial dna that the men don't even have and so
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:13.400]  so they're going to they're creating new life forms and they're just creating a stampede where you
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:19.720]  don't criticize that and i made the joke a few weeks ago you know there's hundreds of new sexual
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:27.000]  preferences and facebook recognizes 50 so i said will i get in trouble if i don't know the lgbq
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:34.840]  tz l3 94 qqz 45 abcd qfp it actually came out in the news this week that people are saying
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:38.520]  it's this big long thing and if you don't know that you're hateful and you've got to add each
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.000]  new group to it and i'm just like they got groups people that want to have sex with cars
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.200]  meant to know what that group's called in fact you look up the name of the days act
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:52.840]  and then the and the headlines were where alex jones says gay men want to break in your garage
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:58.200]  and have sex with your car nothing about gay men nothing about sex with it was all about
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.920]  as they add all these new things that make us accept it like this woman wants to be blind
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.520]  we poured right now in her eye and the taxpayer pays for her to live as a blind woman that's
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:11.000]  mental illness are we going to put that on there too well it's it's happened and it'll be like the
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:19.160]  national religion to go l3q 943 abcq pblvq 543 z down to dot dot dot 345 nice i'm worried i mean
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.320]  it's just total mental illness but it's how you destroy a civilization i'm telling you it's like
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:30.200]  the south park episode you go have them you know put a fake blowhole on top of your head and uh
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:36.280]  sit on the back of you're not a you're not a dolphin you're not a penguin and there's males
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.920]  and there's females and then there's genetic mutations of hematrodites and we're not attacking
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:48.680]  hematrodites the point is is that it's happening to the animals too so we're going to talk about
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:58.280]  the plan to end humanity there it is lgbt they they found it lgbt act was pushed for lgbt qq i c a p f
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:03.160]  2k i told you'd be something like that you can't make this up and that's in major canadian newspapers
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:10.760]  you name it with the president they're saying uh people kind i mean this is an assault on biology
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:14.440]  and we have the documents going back to our guests and we're able to get the bitcoin king
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:21.400]  roger verb bitcoin.com roger you're the experts i'm just answering my layman you know troglodyte
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:27.240]  caveman questions what is this revolution uh if a month ago they said it was the biggest thing in
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:31.880]  the world bigger than golden sacks where is it now after the attempts to plunge it because clearly
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:35.240]  uh the regulators are coming out saying they're going to try to kill it i think that's what's
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:40.520]  caused the latest drop and you would see that as an opportunity to buy more yeah there's been all
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:44.440]  sorts of you know crazy stuff going on all over the world but the biggest attack on bitcoin seems
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:48.600]  to have been coming from apparently from within but i think it's actually a bunch of people on
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.840]  the outside so believe it or not if you read the original bitcoin white paper written by satoshi
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:59.560]  nakamoto it says bitcoin an electronic peer-to-peer digital cash system uh pretty clearly it was meant
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:03.160]  to be used as cash but you have a bunch of people now running around claiming that bitcoin shouldn't
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:07.880]  be used as cash it should just be a store of value but uh that's a bunch of nonsense so uh
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:12.840]  i mean let's just won't that make it take on and work if it if it if it can be converted to cash
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:17.560]  or be seen as cash yeah that's the entire point so i've been involved in bitcoin for over seven
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:22.680]  years now my entire goal from day one was to get as many people using it as cash around the world
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:27.080]  as quickly as possible and the more people they're using it as money the more difficult it'll be for
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:32.600]  governments to demonize or control or manipulated or do bad things to it uh and unfortunately a
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:37.640]  group of people from within are openly hostile to the idea of using bitcoin as cash but uh
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:42.040]  luckily bitcoin is now split into two versions of bitcoin there's bitcoin core and bitcoin cash
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:47.880]  uh bitcoin core is slow expensive to use and unreliable bitcoin cash is super fast super
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:51.800]  cheap to use and super reliable so it's not a tough decision as to which one people are going to
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.160]  start using and that's why i've been putting uh i've sold the vast majority of my bitcoin
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:53:00.520]  core coins for more bitcoin cash bitcoin.com is busy promoting bitcoin cash myself and
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:05.320]  everybody around me are busy promoting bitcoin cash because it works exactly how bitcoin did
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:11.960]  from day one and at this point bitcoin cash effectively is bitcoin uh is that proprietary
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:16.520]  or just i mean with with your holdings in bitcoin uh with your company how big is the market right
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:22.280]  now uh the total market cap of bitcoin i think it's uh bitcoin cash is the third biggest uh
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:26.520]  cryptocurrency by by market cap at the moment third or third or fourth it fluctuates from day to day
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:31.000]  what's that in dollars uh i can look it up for you real quick i don't know off the top of my head
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.760]  but it's in the billions of dollars so i was always worried it was insiders putting this out as a way
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:41.000]  to kind of let it get out there go through the kinks wall wall west and they come in with regulators
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  take over the ones they wanted but you being so deep in it is there any providence to that i think
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.560]  that's exactly what happened to bitcoin core at this point uh the entire promise of bitcoin from
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:55.560]  day one was to allow anyone anywhere in the world to transact financially with anyone else without
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:59.080]  having to get permission from anybody else and there's your your market cap story where you can
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:03.880]  see everything but uh bitcoin cash still has that promise of allowing anybody anywhere in the world
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:08.120]  to be able to transact with anyone basically for free and nobody can stop it nobody can block your
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.440]  transaction nobody can freeze your account nobody can control it in any way today bitcoin
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.640]  transactions very recently whereas how much is a 50 dollars where the average fees for sending a
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:21.960]  single transaction on the bitcoin core network there uh the average transaction fee on bitcoin
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:26.760]  cash is less than a penny each and we can see today it's up 25 percent today and where everything
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.680]  else is down by a substantial amount so what you're saying is what's so what's driving it down the
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:37.640]  the calls for regulation uh or internal subgroups trying to basically uh milk the system by bringing
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:44.440]  it into an economic uh system that it wasn't designed for so if you wanted to destroy bitcoin
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:48.680]  from the inside out you would do the exact things that these bitcoin core people have done they
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:54.200]  managed to get control of the major discussion platforms for bitcoin engage in massive censorship
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:55:00.040]  delete anybody's post who's in uh has a different opinion than their point of view uh had engaged in
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:04.680]  massive trolling on the internet just personal attacks and non-arguments just lots of name calling
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:08.840]  they've driven away some of the most passionate people from the ecosystem i was the first person
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:14.120]  the entire world to translate the bitcoin white paper into japanese uh jihon wu the CEO of bitmain
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.760]  was the first person in the world this is riveting because i'm not i'm not even a expert on this but
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:23.640]  i'm an expert on systems and that's what happened with us nationalist movements you name it and it's
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:27.000]  come out too they have these huge war rooms i don't know about the company you're talking about but
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.360]  sometimes thousands of people in office buildings with big boards up there commanding the attacks
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.760]  running them the bots then they claim the russians are doing it the russians are in the stone age
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:41.800]  when it comes to stuff like this uh and it's all big megabanks big globalists and what you're saying
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:47.720]  is uh that that it appears that that's going on that exact thing has been happening in bitcoin and
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:51.880]  they very clearly seem to have organized talking points for the trolls on twitter and social media
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:56.360]  from one day to the next they switch from one talking point that they call bitcoin cash v cash
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:00.680]  is an attack they try and say that mentally ill they have all sorts of these crazy attacks and
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:04.680]  they all come in waves where they're all on point with each other and it's just absolutely stunning
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.920]  to see that this has happened to the bitcoin ecosystem and we saw bitcoin's market share go from
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.840]  you know 90 plus percent now down to 30 percent and there's all these different cryptocurrencies
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:17.240]  now that are jockeying for position which is if you were a globalist and wanted to prevent people
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.840]  from being able to have control over their own money and want the governments to control everything
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:24.600]  this is exactly how you would do it and it's incredible all right we're gonna come back we're

[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:44.280]  culture and and that's but to bring people in to say we would get rid of this western culture
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:49.320]  that was the plan put out by the former head of the eu then became the head of the whole
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:53.720]  refugee program who died two weeks ago peter southerland that story's on info wars dot com

[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:15.400]  the majority because whites are bad and i was watching a clip on my internet this morning on
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:22.040]  vice they actually have programs where they talk about how whites are inherently evil and shouldn't
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:27.720]  be able to travel i mean this is like the most rate and it's all being directed by white leftist
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:31.800]  who want to create infighting but i digress this is short segment long segment coming up
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:38.840]  roger ver of bitcoin dot com joins us and he's getting into the whole war inside bitcoin he
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:42.840]  says the plunge in bitcoin one of many but over time it just keeps going up but why don't we show
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:47.000]  up why don't we show like a seven-year graph rate your graph on bitcoin that those exist i know
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.440]  they're out there uh you know says there's an internal war going on i don't know all the details
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:55.880]  i just know he's the bitcoin guru so we'll go to break in a few minutes for one minute and then
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:01.720]  come back go to your calls garret drew drew stefan daryl patrick if what you're saying is accurate
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:07.720]  and people say you're a credible guy you have a lot of fans then uh what is the prognosis in this
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:13.720]  in this globalist directed civil war inside crypto uh the prognosis here is that people are
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:18.040]  going to have to pick the crypto currencies that are the most useful for them in their daily lives
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:21.560]  and start using them and that's what we're seeing happen right now with bitcoin cash
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:26.120]  and uh literally you can't make this stuff up the the president of the bilderberg group
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.280]  is the lead investor in this company called blockstream that basically did exactly what
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:34.360]  their name implies they got involved they blocked the stream of transactions on the bitcoin network
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:39.640]  and did everything they possibly could to make bitcoin less useful as money these companies
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:44.440]  have uh these people have openly attacked every company that wants to use bitcoin as money they
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:49.160]  attack anybody who promotes using bitcoin as money it's absolutely uh maddening to see these people
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:53.000]  getting involved and uh most they raised a hundred and fifty million dollars from traditional finance
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.640]  companies uh and most of it came from uh you know axa and the head of the bilderberg group there
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.960]  that's uh exactly who this this money came from and it's just maddening to anybody who thinks that
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:06.040]  bitcoin should be usable as money well i've noticed that globalists love to have a double meaning
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:11.080]  like we will stream you the block we're the block stream but really it's we're blocking the stream
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:16.600]  they are i've noticed they're obsessed with double meanings like that and that seems to be
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:20.360]  exactly what we've had uh happened here with bitcoin they are openly hostile to people using
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:24.360]  it as money you actually if you just simply quote the the title of the original bitcoin
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:29.080]  white paper they get angry and they say all sorts of crazy things like no bitcoin was never meant
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:33.800]  to be used as money bitcoin can never scale on chain so people can use that as a pack of lies
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.440]  bitcoin was ready for the entire world to be able to use it it could scale on chain to support that
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:42.840]  right there today no problem at all uh and yet these people are arguing against people having
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.480]  control of their money there's the title bitcoin appear to appear electronic cash system and they
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:52.440]  mock bitcoin cash they mock the idea of using bitcoin as cash but it's right there well it's
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:58.600]  pretty obvious that it was meant to challenge the central banks as the inventor said so the Jedi
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:03.320]  mind trick of you're not wearing a blue shirt roger of course you are wearing a blue shirt i'm
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:08.920]  not wearing a mallard green shirt well actually i am it's it's it's because i mean just as a lay person
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:15.320]  on its face that's how bitcoin takes over or a cryptocurrency whoever gets in first and becomes
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:20.520]  ubiquitously traded then it's game over that's been the goal from the beginning that has been
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.040]  the goal from the beginning but these disruptors have come in and disrupted the entire thing and
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:27.720]  now people are figuring out well which currency should i use and what's happening with this bitcoin
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:32.120]  used to be fast cheap and reliable but now bitcoin core is super expensive slow and unreliable and
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:36.200]  now we have this bitcoin are you saying i should come in after the break playing the bc boy sabotage
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:42.600]  and you'd absolutely shut alex all right i again i don't really think about any other stuff i was
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:47.640]  trying to work my way through it here but it makes a lot of sense what this guy's saying news wars

[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:37.400]  two three days i got behind with big breaking news we're going to watch the stock market
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:43.640]  like where is it it was like 650 points down at the low let's keep monitoring that the dow Jones
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:49.880]  that's going on but we know that throughout history big financial interest come in and
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:57.480]  bring down things they want to take control of so how far down is the dow right now it is down 489
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:02.280]  points again it would have to be down that's just in today's trading it's down less than 2000 points
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:09.080]  the last week since this started it would have to be down close to 8 000 points to erase all of the
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:16.280]  trump gains uh so just remember that and the fellow reserve is raising rates on it to drive it down
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:20.520]  they admit they want to kill the trump recovery that is a fact but we don't just stand on the

[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:40.040]  like electricity or anything you know the dot com that is going to blast us in the next level
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:45.320]  many bubbles are good if they're based on a real technology and a real infrastructure buildup and
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:49.720]  trump isn't attempting that the globalists are doubling down to prop up the chinese communists
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:54.360]  right now but i don't see that going too well we're joined by roger verb taking your phone
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:08:00.680]  calls of bitcoin.com i again don't know all the little idiosyncratic things with different companies
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:04.920]  and groups and what they say it's for and what's happening i just know about the bigger markets
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:09.400]  and how these systems come and go and you know some of the basics about fiat currencies and
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:14.680]  like the fellow reserve has versus this uh so we're going to talk to garret uh who disagrees
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:19.640]  first and drew drew staphon daryl patrick and others but before we go to these calls any other
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:25.480]  key points you want to add roger uh very simply bitcoin cash is usable as money bitcoin core
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:29.800]  is not and it's not by design of these people that managed to take over the project and drive away
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:33.640]  some of the best most passionate people from the project and all the early bitcoin adopters that
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:37.960]  we're so excited about the liberating technology this would become for the entire world uh all
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:41.880]  of them have left the bitcoin or most of them have left the bitcoin core project at this point
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:46.200]  and most of them are with bitcoin cash at this point myself included uh gavin and rison the person
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:50.040]  that satoshi nakamoto basically turned over the project to and he left as well as a whole bunch
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:55.960]  of other early adopters of bitcoin where do you predict this fight's going uh i think because
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:01.160]  bitcoin core has succeeded in making bitcoin core not useful as money and not useful as payments
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.920]  by the end of this year bitcoin core will no longer be the top cryptocurrency i think uh
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:09.960]  one or multiple other cryptocurrencies will will supplant bitcoin core uh top spot that it has today
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:16.440]  and did i hear you right that your platform's up now because people uh don't don't don't like this
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:23.240]  um well i got involved in bitcoin because i wanted to enable every single person on the
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:27.880]  planet to have 100 complete control of their own money i started running bitcoin.com i believe back
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:34.920]  in 2015 uh or 2016 and uh we know we're quickly quickly i'm just saying on the day everything
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:40.600]  else is down but it looks like yours is up sure and not just for the day bitcoin cash is outperform
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:45.320]  bitcoin core for the day for the week for the last month for the last three months and for
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:50.600]  the last six months so bitcoin cash is outperform bitcoin uh pretty much on every time period uh
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:55.080]  so that adds credence to the market doesn't like what they're doing that they're doing and i guess
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.880]  to try to consolidate control of the market is that what you're saying um the market is you know
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:03.000]  millions of people all over the world getting involved so there's no one single player that
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.840]  i think is pulling the strings and all this but for anybody that's looking for a currency that
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.080]  allows them to send and receive any amount of money with anyone anywhere in the world instantly
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:16.680]  and without permission from anybody bitcoin cash enables that bitcoin core does not sure all i'm
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:21.320]  saying is is that is that adds credence to what you're saying that they're doing things that are
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:27.000]  driving down their own worth but they're in a consolidation phase and and so that's that's how
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.320]  the globalist operate again i don't know this group from adam i'm just trying as a layperson
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:34.840]  understand it and if you go back to the page that you head up there with all the different
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.560]  cryptocurrency uh market caps there you'll see at the very top it says bitcoin dominance at the
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.640]  very top of the screen and it'll be around 30 something percent of the even above the list
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:48.040]  that you see there at the very top there and uh it says 30 34 point something i believe it's a
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:52.200]  little bit blurry for me right there as you click on that you can see the history and it went from
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:57.560]  being 90 something percent very recently down to the 35.6 percent that it is today and that's
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:03.880]  is a direct result of these people making bitcoin not usable as money and uh guess what when bitcoin
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:08.440]  is not usable as money people are going to stop using it as money and when something is uh slow
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:12.040]  expensive and unreliable and other alternatives are fast cheap and reliable people are going to start
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:16.120]  using those alternatives and that's exactly what we've seen we've got you on because you're a respected
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:20.040]  guy out there and people say you really know what you're talking about i have to be honest again uh
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:24.280]  that this is very complex understand the basic generalities and how these systems work but i
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:28.280]  don't i can't vouch for you or the other groups want to be clear about that just because i'm not
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.080]  usually flying somewhat blind let's go to somebody that disagrees up front to add some balance to this
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:39.080]  garret in california you're on the year worldwide uh with roger verre hey alex big fan love your
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:44.440]  supplements um just want to say that bcash is just a fork of the original bitcoin and it's a scam
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:48.680]  it's a chinese scam coin that this guy roger has been arrested for some explosives and all this
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:56.440]  other crap um is trying to push his own agenda and actually take down bitcoin okay i said arrested for
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:03.960]  what he was arrested i'd love to reply to that hold on uh uh uh uh uh arrested for what he was
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:10.360]  arrested for selling explosives um his his bcash is basically just a fork of the original uh bitcoin
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:15.640]  we heard that part okay okay we'll come back to you in a minute garret uh go ahead roger so that's
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:20.200]  this guy very well could be a paid operative trying to disrupt bitcoin cash it's very simple the name
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.640]  is bitcoin cash not bcash bcash is a completely separate project not related at all to bch which
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:30.040]  is in reference to bitcoin cash in reference to me uh selling explosives on the internet that's
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:36.360]  absolutely true back in 1999 i sold firecrackers on ebay back when ebay had a guns and ammo section
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:40.600]  i also made the mistake of running for california state assembly as a libertarian saying if i were
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.000]  elected i wouldn't even accept a salary because that comes from people who are paying taxes who
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:50.040]  might not want to pay my salary and uh i complained about the atf and fbi burning down a bunch of
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:54.600]  kids to death in a church in waco texas i wound up being the only person the entire nation to be
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:58.440]  prosecuted for selling that product without a permit and now all these people that don't want
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:02.440]  bitcoin to be useful as money go and attack me because i sold firecrackers on ebay back i was
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:08.760]  about to say people don't know in most cities even in texas it's pro firecracker firework you bring
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.960]  fireworks you buy in travis county into austin it's like a felony but last time i checked
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:18.360]  excited one of my friends is a cop tell me that uh is that like a you're taking firecrackers in
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:21.240]  the back of the car to go to my parents and pop them off because you know that's a felony or
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:26.760]  something but the point is uh let's see how uh garret responds to that garret alex well if you
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.240]  look at some some of the transaction fees and some of the stuff bitcoin was originally developed to
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.640]  be open source that anybody could mine it what happened is roger vair and his buddy g hanwoo
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:40.360]  they control the miners that basically mine bitcoin and they actually won't even allow
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:45.720]  other people to mine their other bcash they basically uh have cut off the market so
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:51.400]  bcash is actually essentially controlled scam coin that's basically done in china um i only buy
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:56.680]  bitcoin i recommend everybody else to only buy btc that's the code for it buy bitcoin you can buy
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:01.880]  it pretty much anywhere but bcash is a scam don't buy it you know this is why i didn't get involved
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:06.280]  in it i understand it's got a value because it's encoded we all deserve to have our own digital
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:12.600]  systems we agree upon in any free society to to whether it's pebbles or gold or bitcoin whatever
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:16.840]  and then i just knew while while west that this was gonna become huge and explosive i said that
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:20.280]  back eight nine years you know eight years ago i learned about it seven eight years ago from max
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:25.800]  keiser but i just knew how anything while while west turns into this i didn't spend all my time
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:31.480]  studying this just to be able to get my listeners a good opinion and that's that's why i stay away
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:36.040]  from all this because it just gives me a headache roger because you seem like a nice guy he seems
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:40.120]  like a nice guy i don't know what to believe well i'll give you an example we're talking about
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:45.080]  cryptocurrencies whether or not i sold firecrackers on ebay more than a decade ago has absolutely
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:49.160]  nothing to do whether or not bitcoin cash is a useful cryptocurrency or not so why he's bringing
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:53.640]  up that point and on the point of jihad with the first person the entire world to translate the bitcoin
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:58.520]  white paper into chinese and bring bitcoin to china he sells his bitcoin mining equipment to anyone
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:03.720]  anywhere in the world can buy it the biggest supporter of bitcoin core and the the blockstream
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:09.640]  group is a company called bit fury with offices literally on pennsylvania avenue in washington
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.880]  dc they employ a bunch of people that formerly worked at the white house they don't sell their
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:19.320]  miners to anywhere bit bit bit main out of china they're mining software is open source they're
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:23.480]  mining pool software is an open source they'll sell their hardware to anybody it's very very clear
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.640]  which of these groups support free speech and open transactions and which which one's a bunch of a
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:31.640]  totalitarian tyrants that want to control people and tell them what they can or can't do without
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:39.000]  their own money who knew the future would look like this bitcoins miners china pennsylvania

[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:27.960]  i'll admit it i have a problem i will do all this research all this preparation at home and
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:31.720]  and once i get here and have all these things i want to cover and then i get stuck on a few
[02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:35.720]  big topics i never get to and i get behind i get behind on calls i get behind on stories i get
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:39.640]  behind on reports just incredibly important stuff that's why i'm hosting the fourth hour today
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:43.240]  and it's going to be particularly power packed
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:53.640]  um the biggest bombshell information has now come out people overuse bombshell this is bombshell
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:21:01.000]  explosive on obama quarter backing the illegal spying on trump and his entire entourage and
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:06.120]  i've been telling you about for over a year and a half it's now all breaking right now it's on
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:10.040]  info wars dot com and so i've been saying we already know the new stuff coming out in text
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:14.760]  messages it just confirms what we already know but to watch cnn's got me on the front page right
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:19.320]  now saying jones is putting out hoaxes with the right wing media and then they say it's a hoax
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:25.400]  that this email meant something uh it's a hoax that there was a secret society they just said it
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:32.440]  joking it was a hoax they said insurance policy so when they say hoax as you now see and you'll
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:35.720]  have one headline on the front page you go to the article it's different so it says hoax on the
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:40.120]  front page at least it did five minutes ago and i was looking at it and it just gives me a headache
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:45.400]  because they've been caught red-handed and i already have the sources that said it's going to be
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:51.320]  obama running the whole thing and just remember trump's the president now he knows all this and
[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:57.880]  admiral rogers told him everything he's just let them all lie to catch them in perjury so that's
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:03.320]  coming up we're going to your phone calls right now for roger ver dealing with bitcoin uh and the
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:11.640]  big regulators saying they're coming after it other cryptocurrencies the intermural uh wars going on
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:18.840]  within the currencies it's it's just it's just a kettle of fish drew in indiana you're on the
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:25.240]  air go ahead hey thanks elix uh first i want to say it's well known in the bitcoin community that
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:30.920]  roger ver is a scammer and this is the latest scam um just hours before this interview he
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:36.360]  manipulated the price of bitcoin cash up 25 percent just pushes narrative and i do have a question
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:41.480]  for him he's been telling everyone that craig right is the toshinakamoto the creator of bitcoin
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:46.760]  but this can be easily proven through cryptography by signing the genesis block which means
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:53.160]  proving that he mined it the first of bitcoin um he cannot do that but roger continues telling people
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:23:00.040]  that this guy is toshinakamoto which is a lie he must release the core from cyber dron the heart
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:07.880]  of our world will you release the core why haven't traded a single right will you release the cube
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:17.000]  that's right it's the cube so are you megatron roger ver are you megatron if so prepare for battle
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:23.320]  i'm not megatron i haven't traded a single bitcoin core or bitcoin cash today uh of course i'm
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:27.560]  pleasantly surprised the price is up 25 percent today but that isn't because of me and i don't
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:32.600]  know who did it but uh i i think people understand bitcoin cash is useful as money bitcoin core is
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:37.080]  not and the developers behind bitcoin core don't want it to be useful as money mainly because
[02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:41.000]  they don't even understand what made bitcoin a success in the first place uh in regards to
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.280]  me saying that craig right is toshinakamoto i have never said that publicly um i have no idea if
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:50.920]  he's toshinakamoto and i whoever toshinakamoto is wherever he is he deserves to have the absolute
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:54.760]  complete privacy because that's what he wants out of the world and whether or not craig toshinakamoto
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:59.960]  he is uh craig right is to toshinakamoto the things that he is saying is spot on they're
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:03.720]  exactly in line with what made bitcoin successful he has an incredibly deep understanding of
[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:08.200]  economics and the reasons that became became a success whether he's toshinakamoto i think he
[02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:13.240]  has someone worth listening to okay okay here's my problem see i just want to know about bitcoin
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:17.960]  and currency in the markets this is why i always stay out all this and why as soon as i get one
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:21.400]  bitcoin guessed on it's like boom boom boom boom boom more and then i'm going to be in the middle
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:27.000]  of all this i don't know who i know who the the pseudonym or whatever the japanese guy the gnome
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:32.280]  diploma whatever or or is it a real guy that's a whole another area of a soap opera that i don't
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.160]  have the brain space to be involved in with all these other big serious issues happening uh so
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:41.720]  i'm glad we're having a debate but this is why i stay out of bitcoin good lord i mean uh drew
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.120]  thank you for the call but i will say this i don't know roger furr i'd always like when the king
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:51.640]  pens a bitcoin seems like a smart guy and then all these other guys pile in so quickly they don't
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:57.080]  like him it makes my head spin what's going on here roger maybe it's an orchestrated attack
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:00.360]  maybe there are a bunch of people that have been brainwashed by the previous orchestrated attack
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:05.480]  out there anybody with any common sense you have two forms of bitcoin one is fast keeping reliable
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:10.440]  the other is slow expensive and unreliable you see how it all devolved into that discussion instead
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:14.680]  about the general future about cryptocurrencies and the establishment clearly is coming after it right
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:19.720]  now yeah and i think this is exactly what the establishment want a bunch of in fighting within
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:24.120]  bitcoin so that the or the cryptocurrency ecosystem so that people are busy fighting with each other
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:28.920]  rather than uh fending off a bunch of regulation and control by governments and uh congratulations
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:33.400]  to the disruptors that you guys have succeeded in disrupting this uh incredibly liberating tool
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:37.720]  for the entire planet but uh you've just slowed us down you haven't stopped us we're still gonna
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:41.640]  enable every single human well i think the graph shows that i mean he goes up and down but over
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:47.320]  time it's going straight up uh it is it's more useful than then dollars it's more useful than
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:50.920]  euros it's more useful than the japanese yen and there's a limited supply you don't have these
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:55.560]  central banks they can print as many as they want at any time for any reason that the supply is limited
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:59.800]  by the laws of mathematics not the promise of some politicians and we all know how good uh
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:06.680]  how much we should trust the promise of a politician uh let's go to see here stefan in
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:13.160]  pencilvania go ahead stefan thanks for calling hey alex great to talk to you i just have really
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:18.840]  one point to say uh i've been kind of i'm kind of new with the whole bitcoin phenomenon i just
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:24.120]  recently started around this december to even purchase it and one thing i do want to say though
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:29.160]  that i don't think anybody really noticed is uh on the 21st of december trump signed in that
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:34.360]  executive order targeting you know uh serious human rights abusers and offenders and since
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:39.560]  the money laundering down yeah yeah exactly so and if you actually look at the bitcoin
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:46.840]  chart on google its highest peak was at around 17 seven on december i believe 20 second it's
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:52.200]  literally the same time frame so in it from what it looks like to me i mean i know there's a lot
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:56.680]  of speculation that bitcoin is used as like a dark currency for you know underground transactions
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:03.000]  because of its anonymous you know quality uh to you know basically pass money from party to party
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.920]  without you know sure but you're saying you look at the graph from that date bitcoin starts going
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:10.840]  down right around that point i would imagine a bunch of other underground currencies did as well
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:15.880]  yeah exactly so what i think is a lot of these people that are aware that this crackdown is
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:20.200]  about to happen they're selling everything off and jumping ship like how the roth child's uh
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:27.080]  are basically there's there's the end of the polionic wars in in 1815 yeah exactly so i think
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:31.640]  that is one of the it might be a contributing factor i'm not sure i'm not an expert i just
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:35.960]  wanted to kind of calling because i had this little out of the mouths of babes brother yeah i don't
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.680]  have my head down on the weeds on this i'm kind of up here and exactly is that is that i see it
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.160]  peaking and now this and all of it tied together and i don't think trumps targeted himself but
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:49.720]  i think what he's done does go after stuff that is beneath the radar but it's you know not bitcoin's
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:53.720]  fault that isis uses it or i mean that it's just you know criminals are always going to use everything
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:59.560]  we we we can't ban guns because criminals use it uh any comments on that roger yeah the currency
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:03.240]  that's used by the most terrorists to do the most bad things around the world is the u.s dollar yet
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:07.880]  we don't hear the politicians claiming we should ban the u.s dollar uh and if these terrorists start
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:13.080]  using bitcoin instead of the u.s dollar that's a sign that bitcoin is a better form of money
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:17.240]  than the u.s dollar so it should be something that we looked at negatively when people start
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:20.840]  using bitcoin for bad things that just means that it's a better form of money than the other
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:24.520]  alternatives out there and at the end of the day people should be able to use the best form of money
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:28.840]  that's available to them well the first thing they do is every time they somebody commits a
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:31.880]  crime they go look on their computer to see if they ever visit info wars well it's one of the top
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:35.560]  hundred sites of course everybody's visited it they go oh look this person and most of time it

[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:57.080]  a fourth hour about 12 years ago just so i'd have more time for the first six seven eight years of
[02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:01.880]  the broadcast i only did three hours every day at this time and then i had a fourth hour and i had
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:07.000]  so many duties launching the info wars news center that i cut that hour for a while for three years
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:13.160]  and i brought it back about another three years ago and people host that fourth hour to kind of
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:17.960]  see who are good talk show hosts who you know who can handle a big audience and a lot of breaking news
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:23.080]  and we found a lot of great people and with that we're going to launch a new broadcast
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:29.160]  here just the next few months i tend to be live at least 20 hours a day before 2019
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:38.520]  and that is what your support your prayers and everything is helping us do here so again i salute
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:45.720]  you all and i thank you all for what you've done you know there's some subjects that are so big
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:52.920]  that i have a tendency to say i'm going to cover them and then i just don't cover it because so much
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:35:04.040]  breaks so much breaks during the show that by the time i'm three hours in i'm not really tired
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:13.800]  i'm more relaxed and then i remember the topic i was going to cover and don't feel the same outrage
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:19.560]  and then i feel like it's not a proper time to cover it i'm trying to explain why i do some
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:25.960]  of these things that i can't stand and also i know what the media's response is going to be
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:30.440]  and it's not that the media attacks me and lies about me when i cover these topics it's that
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:40.120]  it's not that i'm being attacked against me it's that i know this is the key some of these
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:44.760]  certain areas there's a lot of keys but there's compared to all the rest of the information
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:51.960]  in the world it's very rare and we have the keys we have the absolute keys we know the
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:57.800]  enemy program we understand it we're not that smart i read the books written by them
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:05.240]  them i read the books hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them and i
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:13.240]  would have been a totally different person if i hadn't stopped reading
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:17.960]  children's books when i was about seven years old and started reading
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:25.320]  adult books and it was all because my dad loved encyclopedias and he would they would not buy me
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:29.640]  very few toys and have to go you roll on to get a new bike it was good it taught me how to work
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:38.600]  but my dad would buy me any books i wanted and so i'd say i'd get home from school or after
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:43.160]  practice whatever they'd have time life books the wall wall west or time life books the occult or
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:48.760]  time life books world war two time life books vietnam time life books uh you know the manhattan
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:54.600]  project and other super science you know projects or whatever and i would those things would come
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:59.800]  so many that there was just because my dad's a big book guy the whole house was just bookshelves then
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:04.040]  funny kind of the age of tv it's not with computers you see this house now it's got a lot
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:09.000]  of bookshelves rather than like the old house in dallas and it was just walls of them and it was like
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:15.320]  i mean i read 20 volume set world war two by the time i was eight years old i mean i read it and
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:19.480]  that was just an encyclopedia on world war two well how many world war two historians actually
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:26.920]  read that you see and that's kind of entry level by 11 i was reading order of the death set 1100
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:33.480]  pages or whatever not 900 pages and shears rise and fall the third right and that was just one
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:41.240]  dalliance uh studying world war two i've probably read 200 books on world war two and i'm not bragging
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.320]  about it i just get around historians and people they don't know half of what i know and it's all
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:50.040]  embedded in there and then i studied everything else and then my dad said you want to read this
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:59.480]  zebidin brazinski technotronic era and i mean i was reading all the white papers all the top
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:07.240]  thinking tragedy and hope when i was 18 getting politically involved and some of the local old
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:12.760]  guys up here were blown away when i'd be they'd be talking about some of the stuff and i knew all
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:20.040]  about it and i remember some old guy forget his name i was at some gun round he said come on over
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:24.680]  here and he and his old wife were retirees and they were in their rv from like organ or something
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:31.240]  he said this is a rare book because back then it had not been republished but one time first
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:35.240]  a thousand for the state department and then when the plates got out about 10 000 was one of the
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:40.040]  original reprints now it's reprinted we have it in four store.com i didn't mean to do a plug on it
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.760]  and it's the one that's 1100 pages long and man you read that in like 18 i read tragedy and hope
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:51.720]  and it was like the final piece because i had read i don't want to exaggerate
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:59.480]  600 700 books on modern history ancient history warfare the roman empire the books written by
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:07.400]  julia caeser you wrote two books i read both of them there was letters back to the senate that were
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:15.240]  put into books and so i read tragedy and hope and it was like i knew what was on the next page i
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:19.560]  but it was all a secret document the state department the cia because they couldn't understand
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.080]  how their whole system was working and there he was explaining it all to them and it was like
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:27.880]  the final pieces went tick tick tick tick tick so then when i learned oh berry goldwater talked
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:33.320]  about this and ron paul knows about this those were like my buddies because they knew what i knew
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:37.240]  and then you get into the medical side of the tyranny
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:43.880]  and how they're doing that and everything else and it's like russell blalock knew a lot of this
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:49.240]  stuff brain surgeon famous very successful invented a bunch of different brain surgery so
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:54.680]  super rich and and and then he started coming on my show about 10 years ago and i ended up talking
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:59.000]  to this publisher and people and they said oh you didn't know you you basically you were the final
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.320]  step with blalock he went and read all these eugenics books all these doctorate books and then
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:06.680]  he moved out of the middle of nowhere and won't talk to anybody that's why you never hear blalock
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:12.520]  anymore i mean he would come on and lay out stuff i never even heard i was looking at it was even
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.480]  worse than i thought it's like these psychos all wrote books about this stuff is what i'm telling
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:24.600]  you and that's what's frustrating is we're not lying to you the globalists hate this broadcast
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:30.280]  because we actually read what they're planning and then we can extrapolate where they're going
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.760]  with it now because you got 90 percent of it well where the roadmap goes isn't hard to guess
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:40.040]  let's say you're coming up to mountains and your roadmap ends but you're on a highway you see the
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:46.360]  valley well the road's going to go through the valley so that's what i'm telling you folks is
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:54.840]  what's so frustrating is that the very people fighting us 99 percent of them don't even know
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:01.080]  any of this they don't understand any of it they don't know it they don't want to know it they just
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:07.560]  want talking points to repeat and get their paycheck and go home and watch netflix and that's
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:13.800]  what's so frustrating is i'll put out this info when we start the next hour six after i'm getting
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:18.920]  into it in a week it's not even that i'm trying to build it up it's not even that
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:25.880]  big an issue you already know it it's just that they're now admitting it and then they're going
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:30.280]  to have a headline alex jones hates gay people and it's not that they're attacking me with that
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:39.800]  that hurts me it's that it has nothing to do with gay people nothing and i say that on the show
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:45.240]  and then they clip it and edit it in a nazi collaborator with a funded group edits it and
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:51.000]  puts it out as a lie so you won't learn about it and then they'll have cobear and then they'll have
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:57.240]  homeland on showtime and they'll have all these shows come out and say i'm alex jones as an actor
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:02.280]  and then say horrible things out of my mouth i didn't say to psychologically inoculate you
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:05.720]  to not listen to me because i've noticed what they do
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:11.560]  do the one thing they're so scared of is the chemicals in the food and the water
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:19.720]  and the turning us into these hemaphroditic sterile creatures and that's their whole agenda
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:28.200]  and then they've got a semantical plan built into it where they're going to outlaw the criticism
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:36.280]  and the warning of this chemical biological apocalypse that is about to happen and that's
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:43.880]  the whole point is that that needs to be explained how once they get you to ban one word every other
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:50.680]  domino falls and i have their plan reverse engineered and if we don't stop them it's the
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:58.040]  end of the species this is so alien this attack info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough

[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:21.800]  from deep in the heart of texas the home coming to you from the former united states of america
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:27.960]  from deep in the heart of texas it's alex jones that's right that's an older liner before
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:32.600]  trump got in and now it's a civil war with the globalists and their factions try to get control
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:38.040]  of the country but i would love the next few years to say that things are stable enough we'll still
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:43.720]  have global forces obviously and pockets of them and we are not authoritarian so uh as long as they
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:50.040]  don't openly involve in sedition they'll be allowed to operate our our political system our
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:48:01.160]  world view our political proves of genuine success and durability and happiness are so much more
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:07.160]  genuine than they push it shouldn't be a problem but with their media semi-dominant still it is a
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:16.120]  serious problem but uh i point is i would love to be able to retire those liners because to admit
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:22.280]  we were no longer the united states of america to a great extent was the beginning of becoming the
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:27.800]  united states of america again people would hear that and they think alex is demoralizing us he's
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:34.360]  being negative that i even learned some globalists had debates about us and it was decided all
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:39.640]  their defeated let him scare the hell out of them because i know it was discussed uh having me taken
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:44.440]  out in fact i was physically attacked quite a few times in war and other things uh but but then
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:48.680]  uh but but then the decision was made by some of the combines that i was a joke just like you're
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:53.560]  a joke they think uh and that he'll just scare everybody because they knew what i was saying
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:49:03.080]  was accurate 99 percent of it none of us are perfect and so they let us operate until we were too
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:08.120]  big and it was too late and hillary clinton was up there saying what type of dark heart do you have
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:21.560]  to say the type of things i say about her see she made it personal because she knows i was having
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:28.440]  the women on that she represented men against who were little girls
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:38.360]  when those men raped them to the point of not even i mean to two women
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:43.080]  we've had on that that that she fought against in rape cases one of them was 11 years old
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:47.480]  i don't know the tales of that again but it takes a lot to take an 11 year old girl
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:55.560]  seven men raped and to wreck them and that's who hillary is so it's this big joke they
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:00.920]  launched this whole thing about how they're going to protect women everything when they're the monsters
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:06.040]  and that's why they hate us is because they know we've got their number and we're
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:13.960]  crazy enough to go ahead and just say it in fact almost no coverage of the quentin tarantino
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:22.440]  information where he on howard stern said roma polanski kidnapping drugging and raping an 11
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:28.680]  year old girl anally and he can read the police report so she bled all over the place yeah i guess
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:34.200]  she said she was consenting when she was passed out later she sure wasn't when she ran back to mommy
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:40.360]  and said i'm really hurt but according to harvey winstein's best buddy and the number one person
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:44.840]  winstein produced for all this race baiting garbage films mr mutanoid
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:56.920]  says that it was consensual for roma polanski to stick his filthy diseased proboscis into that
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:51:07.560]  little girl meryl Streep thinks it's great too because she's a sack of garbage and see you think
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:17.640]  these sacks of garbage like us here i'm her one time a top hollywood producer with one of the top
[02:51:17.640 --> 02:51:23.000]  lawyers in hollywood you know i said the name you looking up at the top threatened me and i'm not a
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:28.760]  tough i'm not looking for trouble and i i i just told him you know go ahead and fill your hand and
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:35.720]  then they were shaking in fear because everyone else grovels to these people like their god
[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:41.480]  and not all of hollywood's bad clean eastwood's awesome there's other great people they all just
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:47.400]  keep their head down live nowhere near hollywood and and battle it from afar uh take clonnie's
[02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:56.760]  woods new movie coming out review clonnie's wood 1517 to paris is an eclectic mix of patriotic
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:52:05.000]  christian and cutting edge and will resonate in the hardland job is 411 and you're like okay but
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:10.200]  glorifying this and everything you know it's cheesy no it's not not when the other thing is
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:12.520]  people saying it's okay to have sex with your children
[02:52:15.880 --> 02:52:21.080]  see they've been trying to destroy christianity destroy heroism destroy men that are willing
[02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:26.440]  to take action because these criminals are scared of that and see clonnie's wood wants to say no
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:31.720]  that's what we're proud of is people to take action in the face of overwhelming odds that's
[02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:35.000]  what we stand for he's just the right thing that's why they fear him
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  i've gotten to know people at the highest levels of hollywood and since the whole
[02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:50.840]  quasi collapse of it i've gotten to know people that are in the conservative secret society big
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:55.560]  producer some of the biggest and none of them live in hollywood none of them want to be anywhere
[02:52:55.560 --> 02:53:02.760]  near it and they try to just do decent stuff and strangely enough everything they do is a hit
[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:12.360]  isn't that crazy the most successful people long range in hollywood are the libertarian christian
[02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:17.720]  conservative patriots because you know what that's what america wants anyway see that's the crazy
[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:23.080]  thing about this is all of you people that went along with the power structure so long thinking
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:28.040]  you'd feather your own nest while you poison your own culture and it blew back on your own
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:34.200]  children don't have step one don't crap in your pool don't piss in your own pool don't piss in
[02:53:34.200 --> 02:53:39.640]  anybody's pool because if you're pissing in somebody else's pool it'll be okay for them to piss in
[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:44.760]  your pool treat people like you want to be treated but there's this attitude from the harvey wine
[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:53.640]  steams that it's okay take quentin tarantino saying it's not you know bad that little girl wanted
[02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:57.320]  it you know a little 13 year old girl and even now it turns like that's really sick i've got a
[02:53:57.320 --> 02:54:03.240]  young daughter that age you're you're making me quentin go back on this one's like no no no no no
[02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:08.200]  because the biggest thing is to say it out in the open and quentin tarantino was such a protected
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:16.440]  demon that no one but gawker picked it up and said oh jones is covered and resurfaced tarantino
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:24.360]  defending the rape of a 13 year old girl by roman polanski think about that here's audio quentin
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:29.880]  tarantino defending roman polanski 30 year old girl wanted to have it maybe scroll down
[02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:38.760]  that's what it takes is for us to put that out and then you just get one little blurb of it
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:48.360]  so oh my gosh they'll talk about some hollywood guy who's not really powerful
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:55.400]  who pushed his girlfriend's head down because she wasn't going far enough down on him and
[02:54:55.400 --> 02:55:01.240]  that's not good that's jerky and weird and i don't support it that's the big news though
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:09.400]  is a guy a little rough with his girlfriend instead of people raping little girls
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:15.240]  that they grabbed and drug and there's always women that provide the little girls that so
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:19.960]  they feel safe so there's a woman there so no one would ever believe anything happened because
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:26.360]  there's a woman there and wonder what type of women are there i think we know what type
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:30.920]  they're the big mavens of hollywood they're the scum they're the enemy they're the curse
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:32.360]  they're the problem
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:37.880]  oh there's one now
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:49.720]  um these people are sick and you have to understand they don't just want to abuse
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:55.240]  women or men or anybody they want power they want to mess with people they want to kick
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:59.080]  your pregnant wife down the stairs and have her have a miscarriage and have it done in your place
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:07.560]  with your people so that everybody can say that alex shows did it but i made a decision that even
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:12.760]  though that was 16 years ago i'm not normally a vengeful person i move forward but i decided
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:19.080]  just right in my heart now to come after you and so i am starting next week

[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:44.200]  i think the fall of that piece of crap war he has worshiped in hollywood not because his film is
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:51.800]  the very worst produced ever and they're just sophistic crap but because he's a degenerate filthy
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:57:03.240]  scumbag and i think it's time we have people on to talk about clinton tarantino

[02:59:59.720 --> 03:00:03.400]  but first obama's muslim brotherhood buddy's in trouble
[03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:08.840]  tarik ramadan a french swiss muslim academic and a professor of contemporary islamic studies
[03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:14.600]  at oxford has been denied bail as france 24 reports a french judge decided on tuesday to
[03:00:14.600 --> 03:00:19.880]  keep prominent islamic scholar tarik ramadan in detention four days after he was handed
[03:00:19.880 --> 03:00:26.760]  preliminary rape charges in cases brought by two women who had sought his counsel this is the same
[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:32.360]  sharia scholar praised by barack obama he was elected by time magazine in 2000 as one of the
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:38.280]  seven religious innovators of the 21st century and by foreign policy readers as one of the top
[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:45.080]  hundred most global thinkers ramadan describes himself as a salafi reformist essentially an
[03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:51.480]  advocate of sharia law how many times have you heard this islam just needs a reform well
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:56.920]  why does it need a reform well then it would be nicer without that jihad business look
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:02.040]  you ever noticed i think about these reformer people they're apologists for islam or they're
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:07.480]  a member of an insignificant group of muslims they just simply don't count karan is perfect
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:12.120]  syria is perfect hendith is perfect you can't reform them the doctrine is systemic it's not
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:17.240]  just a little bit tweak here or there there's no body of authority that can improve any changes
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:23.080]  you make and then it's not broken why fix it so these are the reasons that islam cannot be
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:28.760]  reformed i don't care how nice the person is who says it can be ramadan has long been criticized
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:34.840]  as an adept of takia the muslim practice of lying to non-believers to further sharia falling in
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:41.640]  love dancing all of these offend them and violence to all this is their usual response calling for
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:48.360]  civility censorship silence or respect for the offended is merely heeding the islamist demand
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:54.680]  for blasphemy laws at the expense of dissenters mr ramadan says he is not charlie or paris
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:02:01.240]  instead he says he is the those who are under investigation but most importantly ramadan
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:06.360]  is the grandson of hasan albana the founder of the muslim brotherhood after the state
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:11.000]  department had used the patriot act to bar ramadan from the united states for six years
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:16.840]  in 2010 ramadan was granted a visa by none other than an overseer of the arab spring
[03:02:16.840 --> 03:02:22.280]  secretary of state hillary clinton that same year he was a keynote speaker for the council of
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:27.960]  american and islamic relations in 2015 michelle malkin writing for the new york post wrote
[03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:35.240]  reminder the feds designated care an unindicted terror co-conspirator in 2007 in the prosecution
[03:02:35.240 --> 03:02:40.760]  of the holy land foundation and others for providing support to humas jihadist over the
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:45.720]  alleged objections of dallas area federal prosecutors the obama justice department
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:51.720]  senior political appointees declined to press terror financing charges against care co-founder
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:58.840]  omar amad i've come here to cairo to seek a new beginning between the united states and muslims
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:06.760]  around the world one based on mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:15.480]  that america and islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition instead they overlap
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:25.800]  and share common principles principles of justice and progress tolerance and the dignity
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:32.040]  of all human beings and now as it seems with many of those praised by the left to rick ramadan faces
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:37.160]  sexual assault and rape charges according to france 24 one of the four victims two of which
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:43.800]  are alleging rape against ramadan henda ayari attested that to her to rick ramadan believes
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:49.080]  that either you wear a veil or you get raped ayari said her resistance was met with violence and
[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:54.040]  spoke of her trauma after the incident and how ramadan sought to stay in touch with her allegedly
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:59.800]  the scholar told ayari she did not know how to take care of a man and that we'll have to learn
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:05.240]  ayari alleges that ramadan wanted her to be a sex slave and that he would pay for her journeys to
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:10.440]  paris after she refused to meet him again she said he threatened to attack her children but to
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:15.160]  wreak ramadan has brushed off the accusations claiming that they were a campaign of slander
[03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:21.480]  clearly orchestrated by his longtime adversaries adding to the chaos isis recently released a
[03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:28.360]  video depicting a major attack on paris declaring the conquering of paris before rome to rick ramadan
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:34.280]  a respected voice amongst muslims throughout europe is allegedly nothing less than what we
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:40.120]  can expect of the heir apparent to the muslim brotherhood network leading a seemingly unstoppable
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:52.440]  hezra into the heart of europe john bound reporting for info wars dot com we'll be back on the other side

[03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:22.920]  from the front lines of the info war i have a tendency to get into the forest instead of
[03:06:22.920 --> 03:06:26.040]  just describing it as a forest. I have a tendency to start getting into long
[03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:31.000]  historical diet thrives and giving evidentiary information out.
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:37.160]  Instead of just being Paul Revere, one is by land to it by sea
[03:06:37.880 --> 03:06:41.240]  and here come the Redcoats. So he starts riding down the road saying the
[03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:44.040]  Redcoats there. He didn't say I was there and I saw him
[03:06:44.040 --> 03:06:47.320]  landing and they were on their horses and they had troops marching with
[03:06:47.320 --> 03:06:51.320]  weapons and they had red uniforms with gold buttons and I saw the general
[03:06:51.320 --> 03:06:58.040]  behind him at least 10,000. He said to arms to arms
[03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:03.480]  the Redcoats have landed. The British are here.
[03:07:04.840 --> 03:07:07.960]  Why can't I just say that?
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:14.840]  Because they will then take what I say and twist it.
[03:07:14.840 --> 03:07:18.440]  I'm going to say this up front and they're going to ignore it
[03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:22.120]  and they're going to lie about what I'm saying because they don't want you to
[03:07:22.120 --> 03:07:25.480]  see it but I know you as an audience see it but I'm
[03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:28.920]  talking about the general public.
[03:07:32.120 --> 03:07:37.080]  It's in the white papers, it's in the text, now they're saying in the news
[03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:40.840]  that in the 50s and 60s the the decision was made that there was over
[03:07:40.840 --> 03:07:43.640]  population. They were going to adopt eugenics-based
[03:07:43.640 --> 03:07:47.720]  ideas of chemicals in the food in the water to lower fertility
[03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:50.840]  and to lower IQ to make the general public more manageable
[03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:54.440]  and that's in eco science written by the White House Science, Zara, Obama,
[03:07:54.440 --> 03:08:01.160]  Holdren in 1974. He wrote that he was trying to start decades later.
[03:08:01.160 --> 03:08:03.320]  See I'm already getting into the evidence instead of just giving you the
[03:08:03.320 --> 03:08:05.640]  general announcement then I can get into the evidence and you can research the
[03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:08.520]  evidence for yourself because don't you want to research the evidence which is
[03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:12.040]  bigger than I can even describe, bigger than I even know. There's always
[03:08:12.040 --> 03:08:16.680]  endless reams of evidence. It's so gargantuan
[03:08:16.680 --> 03:08:20.840]  that it's like standing
[03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:24.760]  on Kona, the big island in Hawaii, beautiful island chain, most remote in
[03:08:24.760 --> 03:08:29.720]  the world and saying prove to me there's a Pacific Ocean
[03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:32.760]  and I just look at you and I say well I was brought up in the 20th century and
[03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:36.120]  the 21st century and we have satellites and I flew here and it's real and it
[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:39.560]  exists and we call it Pacific Ocean. Here's the history of it and it's the
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:43.960]  largest ocean of 76 percent of our land mass covered by salt
[03:08:43.960 --> 03:08:47.000]  water, 1 percent fresh water not counting aquifers, 2 percent
[03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:50.760]  below ground and aggregate scans may have been 5 percent saying total
[03:08:50.760 --> 03:08:54.360]  really the earth is covered almost 82 percent by water and geographical
[03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:57.640]  coverage on the surface land mass but if you actually look at it like the
[03:08:57.640 --> 03:09:01.240]  skin of an apple it's it's it's it's the whole atmosphere in our entire
[03:09:01.240 --> 03:09:04.520]  ecosystem is only a very thin small area that we
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:09.000]  cohabitate upon on this third rock out from the standard
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:12.120]  yellow sun two-thirds the way out on the spiral arm and look away galaxy
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:17.240]  in deep space. I mean again knowledge is just endless you can
[03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:20.600]  always blast out from any point and have unbelievable
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:26.040]  compendiums and reams of information but here's the bottom line
[03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:33.800]  there is a biological cultural mathematical systematic attack
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:37.880]  to make having children and to make having families and to make building
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:42.360]  human societies and cultures impossible
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:47.720]  from the taxes the regulations to the work weeks to the travel to the
[03:09:47.720 --> 03:09:53.320]  chemicals and the biologicals to the propaganda to the
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:56.840]  medicalized tyranny to the brainwashing to
[03:09:56.840 --> 03:10:01.160]  start out with don't say the n-word sounds totally reasonable
[03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:04.680]  I don't say it was brought about to say it because I'm a good guy I had to look
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:07.800]  down on somebody to feel big
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:12.040]  a lot of folks you're looking down on are better than you at many things
[03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:15.560]  so why would I join that culture and then it's
[03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:20.520]  we're gonna ban nazis well I don't like nazis
[03:10:20.520 --> 03:10:23.400]  well now you're a nazi oh I'm banned now you just called me one didn't matter
[03:10:23.400 --> 03:10:28.280]  I'm not see how it works so the FCC has let's seven eight
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:32.200]  words you're not supposed to say on radio and tv it was broadcast
[03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:36.600]  but then the word training
[03:10:36.760 --> 03:10:41.960]  which was created 20 something years ago by people in that community
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:46.440]  that want to identify as women and like men like women you name it and want to
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:50.520]  do that do I hate those people absolutely not did I ever say I hated them no
[03:10:50.520 --> 03:10:54.040]  and it's not like they beat me over the head till I said I wasn't against it
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:59.320]  uh it's a lot of a destructive lifestyle heavy suicide big problems
[03:10:59.320 --> 03:11:02.680]  but I'm not even judging those people who are human beings I don't hate them I
[03:11:02.680 --> 03:11:05.640]  don't need to feel like they're bad and they have problems and I'm this big
[03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:08.760]  moral guy when I certainly am not perfect let me tell you
[03:11:08.760 --> 03:11:14.360]  I'm probably more wicked than they are in some respects if you see that as wicked
[03:11:16.920 --> 03:11:21.000]  but you look at the that word we got a call last year we
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:24.840]  recorded the vice president and Facebook Twitter and they said listen
[03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:29.000]  you can stay on but there's one thing we're gonna put this report out soon
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:35.080]  there's one thing you can't say and that's training
[03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:39.480]  now there's so much to that and I said well that's a term created by that
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:42.600]  community well Facebook and Twitter
[03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:46.920]  judged in 2017 that's a hate word so it's gone see and once you accept that
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:51.640]  you can't say the new n word then it's another word
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:56.280]  and another word but but but what why did they choose that word because
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:12:00.040]  it's trans it has nothing to do with men that
[03:12:00.040 --> 03:12:04.520]  want to be women or women that want to be men and and and all the rest of it
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:08.120]  it's once they get you
[03:12:08.120 --> 03:12:10.600]  yeah they called the police on people that said training on the radio that's
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:15.560]  that's the daily caller they arrest you in california if you say that
[03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:22.200]  once they say that now transhumanism if you study eugenics
[03:12:22.200 --> 03:12:29.560]  in 1949 they voted at the world eugenics society to call themselves transhumanist
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:33.320]  because Hitler and their funding of Hitler had made it look bad so julian
[03:12:33.320 --> 03:12:36.280]  obviously brother all is actually all that great new world stuff right about
[03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:39.000]  the early 30s they said how did you know this well it's the plan
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:43.160]  now you see it happening his brother said we've been embarrassed so now we're
[03:12:43.160 --> 03:12:46.440]  going to be transhumanists we're going to improve humans well that's your right
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:48.840]  if you think it's improvement but what it means is take control
[03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:52.440]  governmentally of human development through chemicals through biologicals
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:57.400]  through culture through brainwashing through media through education
[03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:00.840]  okay this is all their own admission this isn't my opinion
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:04.680]  this is them remember saying all this you're a radio listener the cruise is
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:07.560]  randomly searching when i say it just finding articles that say it but it
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:12.520]  enough because it's them saying it so once they get you to say hey
[03:13:12.520 --> 03:13:17.480]  don't even say a word that has to be with transitional
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:22.280]  don't even discuss human evolution whether it's self-directed that's a very
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:25.720]  human trait is to self-direct what you want to be your
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:29.480]  environment who you want to be how long you want to live what you want to do
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:34.920]  it is a very human thing to be a man and to say i want to be a woman or to be a
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:36.600]  woman and say i want to be a man i'm not saying
[03:13:36.600 --> 03:13:41.960]  that's the the human thing or a good human thing i'm saying it's very human
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:45.880]  to say i want to be something different i want to build something i want to
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:49.480]  change myself i want to that's that's what we do we control our
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:52.840]  environment with the only species that does it
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:56.440]  and whatever we envision we can end up building
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:14:00.360]  but once they get you to accept that then they can go into the schools they can
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:03.960]  tell your children you confuse their sex they can
[03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:09.080]  brainwash them for an agenda where they want to be 50 different things and i
[03:14:09.080 --> 03:14:11.960]  made the point there's these shows on history and discovery i didn't watch
[03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:16.120]  much tv and i see people who love their cars and marry them
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:19.880]  this woman loves her blender and i'm like that's just crazy
[03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:23.560]  it's a fetish it's weird whatever i don't hate that person
[03:14:23.560 --> 03:14:27.560]  now they're spreading disease having sex with the vfw his tailpipe
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:31.000]  and the headline is alex jones says gay men are going to rape your car
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:36.520]  all over the news didn't say that let's see once they say don't criticize gay men
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:39.160]  don't criticize trans then they could say don't
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:42.760]  criticize people that have four parents and aren't really people
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:47.080]  because they're not they're something new don't say you're a person see
[03:14:47.080 --> 03:14:50.200]  there's another key to understand all this take
[03:14:50.200 --> 03:14:54.200]  zoological experiments take how humans have rights animals have rights but all
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:14:57.960]  these transhuman zoological experiments they have declassified
[03:14:57.960 --> 03:15:01.560]  they've done for 40 years they declassified it 20 years ago
[03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:06.360]  that they've done it 20 years before so 40 years of human animal hybrids human
[03:15:06.360 --> 03:15:10.600]  human hybrids you know five uh genetics of men women all of it it's
[03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:13.960]  been artificially made
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:21.480]  artificially made and now if you discuss that it's artificially
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:25.400]  made or what is it or does it have rights you're done you're gone you're bad
[03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:29.880]  you're a hate monger and that's why this is a critical area they said how do we
[03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:33.640]  get them to accept men becoming women men become women becoming men
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:36.840]  because once they do that they'll accept the brain chips all of it
[03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:40.760]  splicing with animals people that really aren't people humanoids
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:44.360]  and then that's it this is it this is the total
[03:15:44.360 --> 03:15:48.520]  mainlining of in the humanities we know it and it's being forced directed at
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:51.160]  our children it's not a choice to become
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:55.640]  something new it's being forced are you happy washing your hands with harsh

[03:19:56.120 --> 03:20:02.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:16.120 --> 03:20:21.240]  alex jones here back live there is a blitzkrieg taking place against the
[03:20:21.240 --> 03:20:24.440]  human condition we're being put into an artificial
[03:20:24.440 --> 03:20:30.040]  construct for control for reverse engineering and then for
[03:20:30.040 --> 03:20:33.080]  extermination that is the admissions of the globalist
[03:20:33.080 --> 03:20:37.000]  elon muskis warned you that they worship ai gods they believe are about to
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:41.480]  show up on the scene who demands humanity be exterminated first
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:45.160]  now that said let me quantify this
[03:20:46.040 --> 03:20:49.880]  the whole trans movement has nothing to do with
[03:20:49.880 --> 03:20:56.200]  homosexual men it has nothing to do with
[03:20:56.200 --> 03:21:00.520]  trans people it has to do with attacking language
[03:21:00.520 --> 03:21:03.960]  saying you will not call someone heterosexual or homosexual
[03:21:03.960 --> 03:21:09.640]  the very debate about someone's chromosomes and biological preset is
[03:21:09.640 --> 03:21:12.120]  illegal
[03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:18.360]  so now he was a gay lad it was a gay day that language is expropriated
[03:21:18.360 --> 03:21:25.240]  from homosexual to gay just like no one will say
[03:21:25.240 --> 03:21:31.640]  cockazoid caucus mountains has nothing to do
[03:21:31.640 --> 03:21:35.240]  with saying bad things about white people or they want to change the name of
[03:21:35.240 --> 03:21:38.840]  negro medello it means black beer
[03:21:39.960 --> 03:21:43.480]  you can't use the scientific name for black people
[03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:46.360]  has nothing to do with saying they're bad because it has an in on the front of
[03:21:46.360 --> 03:21:49.480]  it so once you can't use the n-word now you can't use
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:51.800]  in
[03:21:54.440 --> 03:21:56.920]  i remember in middle school people get upset because they were doing geography
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:22:00.600]  and saying this is niger niger sounds like the n-word you see the
[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:03.800]  mental illness and the globalist psychologists are running this and they
[03:22:03.800 --> 03:22:07.240]  want to reduce world population
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:11.960]  so the taba stock institute in the 60s this is public
[03:22:11.960 --> 03:22:18.040]  we're very proud of it developed the plan for trans nation trans world
[03:22:18.040 --> 03:22:24.200]  and once you say to children in the fifth grade starting but now in the
[03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:27.160]  first grade you're a girl you could be a boy
[03:22:27.160 --> 03:22:31.320]  you're a boy you could be a girl soon then it's you can't say boy or girl
[03:22:31.320 --> 03:22:37.400]  because someone else might not be that it hurts them so what is the key
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:43.800]  this whole trans movement is about outlawing science it's about outlawing
[03:22:43.800 --> 03:22:49.480]  male and female chromosomes that is absolute scientific fact and then
[03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:53.240]  scientists come out like jordan peterson in canada
[03:22:53.240 --> 03:22:56.680]  and says listen i don't hate you if you want to be something else
[03:22:56.680 --> 03:23:01.240]  but you biologically were born as this
[03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:07.080]  and now google executives it's come out in lawsuits and they admit this
[03:23:07.080 --> 03:23:11.480]  get in front of a whole amphitheater of people last year
[03:23:11.480 --> 03:23:17.080]  and say i am a golden dragon it a female dragon
[03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:21.560]  i'm an expansive building i have yellow scales
[03:23:21.560 --> 03:23:26.440]  everyone goes you are a dragon i you have expensive building
[03:23:26.440 --> 03:23:31.960]  and that's a cult programmer if a google executive said i'm god they say you're
[03:23:31.960 --> 03:23:35.640]  a cult leader but if you chant i am a golden dragon it
[03:23:35.640 --> 03:23:39.240]  they are making you say two plus two equals five
[03:23:39.240 --> 03:23:42.360]  they are making you with all these articles like they'll have hundreds of
[03:23:42.360 --> 03:23:45.720]  articles a week like jones is insane he claims there's only two sexes he claims
[03:23:45.720 --> 03:23:48.840]  it's chromosomal he claims families existed and they just
[03:23:48.840 --> 03:23:52.360]  attacked him he's insane he's crazy they're nuts they're nuts it's a it's a
[03:23:52.360 --> 03:23:56.440]  gas lining of you not of me
[03:23:57.560 --> 03:24:02.840]  so that you give in to that and then the sky's the limit
[03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:07.640]  and then there's scientific psychological warfare technicians
[03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:11.000]  who are going to go in when people in the trans community have the highest
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:14.920]  level of suicide of any group in the world worse than veterans farmers
[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:18.040]  gay men any of it
[03:24:19.640 --> 03:24:24.200]  they have been captured they have been confused they are being abused they are
[03:24:24.200 --> 03:24:27.960]  being hurt and they're sucked into a very dangerous
[03:24:27.960 --> 03:24:32.520]  underworld of people that want to abuse them
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:38.120]  almost every quote trans person is a escort who has to have sex with dozens
[03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:41.560]  of people a day and they end up killing themselves that's a fact and then the
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:45.000]  left covers that up doesn't want to discuss that
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:48.520]  because they're using these people just like hollywood does
[03:24:48.520 --> 03:24:51.640]  just like quentin tarantino says sex with children is a bad thing if it's
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:56.040]  consensual he defends robert polanski because
[03:24:56.040 --> 03:25:02.200]  they're pigs and they want to lower barriers of families and any definition
[03:25:02.200 --> 03:25:06.840]  because now people that have been you know had pled guilty to raping little
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:10.680]  eight-year-old six-year-old girls in illinois just a few weeks ago said i
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:14.840]  identify as a child and the court's looking at it saying maybe it's legal
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:18.200]  can children have sex with each other and so if you're a 40-something-year-old man
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:22.840]  you know raping a six-year-old girl just say you're a little boy and it's okay
[03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:27.640]  you see it's all semantical games and then once you let them play games and
[03:25:27.640 --> 03:25:31.080]  tell a professor that he can't say to his students listen
[03:25:31.080 --> 03:25:34.280]  i'm not against homosexuals or heterosexuals but
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:38.840]  using the term heterosexual or homosexuals is science
[03:25:40.360 --> 03:25:44.040]  homo genius just means within your group you're a male you're with a male you're
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:46.920]  a woman you're the woman it has nothing to do with a judgment
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:51.400]  but it becomes this whole idea to make people victims and now you must accept
[03:25:51.400 --> 03:25:56.760]  every form of trans including i want to put drain oh in my eyes i'm blind and
[03:25:56.760 --> 03:25:59.960]  the national health service says yes hundreds of people a year it's growing
[03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:03.640]  to thousands they project well are blinded
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:07.240]  and the psychologist pours the drain oh in lovingly it's not abuse
[03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:10.680]  so you're not abusing a menly old person you're loving them and now the state
[03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:15.480]  pays and they're blind because they identify as a purple penguin
[03:26:15.480 --> 03:26:19.160]  it's it's it's it's the it's the deep space
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:22.040]  it's humans make this up sounds like a science fiction book
[03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:26.120]  who would come up with something like this to convince us to commit genetic
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:28.840]  suicide and i've got the articles i haven't gotten
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:32.760]  to yet where they say oh trans is good lower population actually oh who would
[03:26:32.760 --> 03:26:36.680]  have thought of that oh who would have oh it's so good
[03:26:36.680 --> 03:26:40.520]  you can't say you're a mother or father a boy or girl because that hurts someone
[03:26:40.520 --> 03:26:44.920]  your identity as male or female you're okay dump drain on your eyes okay
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:49.400]  chop your genitals off i'm not paying for it that's hate
[03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:53.400]  and if you'll capitulate to that level of insanity you'll capitulate
[03:26:53.400 --> 03:26:59.800]  to anything i am a golden dragon you are a golden dragon
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:03.480]  you mentioned a cult movie like that i am a beautiful ornate building you are a
[03:27:03.480 --> 03:27:09.080]  beautiful ornate building and that's their whole plan admitted
[03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:15.080]  to end our species as you know it using these poor people as the victims
[03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:19.480]  and you've got whole communities of abusers who are heterosexual and homosexual
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:22.840]  feeding on these desperate mentally ill people and enjoying it let's go out to
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:27.080]  break with mr. peterson the professor uh jordan peterson
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:30.840]  on national channel four and the woman of speech let's hear this
[03:27:30.840 --> 03:27:35.320]  cited freedom of speech in that why should your right to freedom of speech
[03:27:35.320 --> 03:27:41.080]  trump a trans person's right not to be offended
[03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:44.520]  because in order to be able to think you have to risk
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:48.280]  being offensive i mean look at the conversation we're having right now
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:51.400]  you know like you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of
[03:27:51.400 --> 03:27:53.720]  truth why should you have the right to do that
[03:27:53.720 --> 03:27:58.840]  it's being rather uncomfortable well i'm i'm very glad i put you on the spot
[03:27:58.840 --> 03:28:02.680]  well i'm very glad that you gave my point you get my point as like
[03:28:02.680 --> 03:28:05.720]  you're you're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:08.520]  hell's going on and that is what you should do but you're
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:12.280]  exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me
[03:28:12.280 --> 03:28:16.600]  and that's fine i think more power to you as far as i'm concerned
[03:28:16.600 --> 03:28:21.880]  except you haven't sat there and i'm just right i'm just trying to work that out i
[03:28:21.880 --> 03:28:23.880]  mean
[03:28:26.600 --> 03:28:33.480]  this pure logic ha gotcha they are given that information they are told to go
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:35.480]  with it but they can hit us and they have a bike
[03:28:35.480 --> 03:28:38.600]  blocks attack us lay down in front of military parades everything but we don't
[03:28:38.600 --> 03:28:42.360]  have speech see they're saying we're not human because we're human but if you
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:44.520]  identify as not human you suddenly have all these
[03:28:44.520 --> 03:28:49.000]  rights that sounds like an alien invasion program to me
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:53.560]  everyone but humans has rights
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:57.080]  the answer to being in control of your own health care is
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:29:01.080]  freedom from insurance become part of a group of self-pay patients

[03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:18.760]  by the end he says stop rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell
[03:34:18.760 --> 03:34:27.400]  it's so scientific it's so complete and it's admitted by the taba stock institute
[03:34:29.560 --> 03:34:31.880]  looking up on their own website they're very proud of it
[03:34:34.200 --> 03:34:39.080]  they've got it where they're teaching three-year-old boys their girls and vice versa in the uk now
[03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:47.320]  and how much they love women and women's culture and women's women don't need men
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:53.240]  and women women women we're the state we're the psych warfare chiefs come to us you could
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:57.400]  spiritually see them you're like being sucked in by the monster from
[03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:07.240]  stranger things i mean it's it's it's it's that spiritually big black spider it's how i describe it
[03:35:08.120 --> 03:35:16.200]  and it's incredibly abusive camille paglia it says he teaching five-year-olds that they're
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:20.680]  another sex we don't know what that means is child abuse well you know she's been out of favor
[03:35:20.680 --> 03:35:24.920]  for 30 years because she's not a self-destructive person she talks about these decadent cycles
[03:35:24.920 --> 03:35:28.680]  but the globalists have taken decadent cycles and codified it into a religion
[03:35:31.400 --> 03:35:35.480]  so jordan peterson you know i covered him last year when this happened and right through it but
[03:35:35.480 --> 03:35:44.600]  now they try to keep him off tv and all he says is we have two sets of chromosomes where men and
[03:35:44.600 --> 03:35:51.560]  women and women have a whole another set of chromosomes and the and in mammal species but
[03:35:51.560 --> 03:35:58.040]  in other species there's a male and there's a female and they have articles here where professors
[03:35:58.040 --> 03:36:05.160]  and others are scolded for playing jordan peterson video in class because neutrally playing a speech
[03:36:05.160 --> 03:36:15.720]  by hitler is what they compared it to and all he is is a professor a psychologist saying no there are
[03:36:15.720 --> 03:36:25.800]  men and women and that's what they're doing they're saying to say men and women exist is a hate crime
[03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:31.480]  in california passed the law that if you don't use pronouns what if i'm not good at english
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:39.960]  gz different it's like a joke i made five months ago or three months ago it was like lbgq dlz abcdq
[03:36:39.960 --> 03:36:44.600]  fgwx imz you know one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty four
[03:36:44.600 --> 03:36:49.000]  i said when is it gonna be this big long thing and sure enough they've come out with some new
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:55.320]  long thing just like i said and said you better know this it's a cult of bullying crazies who aren't
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:37:01.320]  guys that like guys or women that like women it has nothing to do with that they take our
[03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:07.480]  natural openness of the west and we're like okay yeah okay whatever you're into and as long as you
[03:37:07.480 --> 03:37:14.680]  don't mess with me do what you want and now it's bestiality it's it's everything else and it's
[03:37:14.680 --> 03:37:21.160]  all a bunch of quentin tarantino's on howard stern saying you know little girl is 13 wants to have
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:25.800]  sex with a 40 year old man it's okay and howard stern says he drugged her and quinter's alia
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:34.520]  even howard stern said man that's evil because it is because you want 50 year old men 60 year
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:38.440]  old men courting at your house for your five-year-old i'm here to see a little jenny
[03:37:41.240 --> 03:37:45.960]  and then the left gets in line with whatever the new cult thing is to genia fleckton and virtue
[03:37:45.960 --> 03:37:50.120]  signal so you you you walk into target it's an image of a little girl's butt sticking out very
[03:37:50.120 --> 03:37:56.840]  pedophilic and it says it's trans baby feminist baby we got it back there it was in i left it
[03:37:56.840 --> 03:38:02.600]  like the producer's office back there somewhere back in back in the radio office and you see it
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:11.320]  it's everywhere and it's like people that are just in to degeneracy and listen if adults
[03:38:11.320 --> 03:38:18.680]  want to do degenerate things that's your issue don't do it to children because here's the thing
[03:38:21.480 --> 03:38:23.400]  i wrote a bicycle and i've been around a block
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:33.320]  and i could have had sex with the most beautiful women in hollywood and i never did it you know why
[03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:39.160]  every time they didn't have a soul i couldn't get attracted to them because it was all fake
[03:38:39.160 --> 03:38:43.800]  and all the rest of it and let me tell you something these people have no souls they're
[03:38:43.800 --> 03:38:49.320]  not happy unless they're doing bad stuff there it is feminist baby right here okay
[03:38:52.200 --> 03:38:57.640]  and you open it up it's a baby stick and it's butt out you know i went into a pizza place
[03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:01.880]  and there was a young man who told me that he was a
[03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:09.720]  uh drag queen and my wife and i were in there a couple months ago and he said do you hate me
[03:39:09.720 --> 03:39:18.120]  because i'm a drag queen and i and i said no i really don't but i said uh i said well i saw
[03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:23.880]  that video you put out about millie weaver about the uh about the drag queen festival here in austin
[03:39:23.880 --> 03:39:31.160]  the hotel and i said yeah where you had two-year-old and three-year-old kids with men pole dancing
[03:39:31.160 --> 03:39:36.120]  shaking their ass in their face and little kids giving them money i said as a heterosexual i i don't
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:41.000]  even go to strip bars but i've been to them obviously in my life in college i said i would never
[03:39:41.880 --> 03:39:48.760]  sit there and bring my three-year-old to a strip bar they wouldn't let them in to begin with
[03:39:48.760 --> 03:40:03.080]  to go up and stick money in the panty line of a woman or a man and the individual was so jacked up
[03:40:03.080 --> 03:40:12.760]  on the spiritual thing of being a woman and being into that and we embryonicly began as women
[03:40:12.760 --> 03:40:18.600]  that they weren't even listening they was like a spirit it was just completely caught up in it and
[03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:25.640]  i said i got the video that's obscene and he and he is just a man he goes well i hear you
[03:40:27.320 --> 03:40:35.160]  but i know all the top drag queens and started naming i'm like he was naming to me the names of gods
[03:40:35.160 --> 03:40:43.640]  and see that's what this is is this is people who know we're an open tolerant society who
[03:40:43.640 --> 03:40:49.000]  aren't happy and nothing ever delivers them to make them happy so they're telling us like a cult
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:54.120]  you're gonna worship jim jones that that's really what it was because i said i don't hate you as a
[03:40:54.120 --> 03:41:03.160]  person and i've been around the block probably more than you've been around the block and i'm
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:08.680]  telling you where you're going is destructive and i care about you and it's like i don't care
[03:41:08.680 --> 03:41:15.240]  i know you don't hate me but you're not going to stop us and my wife was basically just shaking her
[03:41:15.240 --> 03:41:23.080]  head and then i got the well i'm eating the pizza was strutting around in front of us business
[03:41:24.120 --> 03:41:29.160]  and it's just like those lesbian women that time when shane steiner strongest guy i know
[03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:38.120]  know can bench press 400 pounds like 30 times okay and he's not even big he's solid muscle
[03:41:38.120 --> 03:41:44.840]  jiu-jitsu all day long i'm in the main event bowling and and it was like for family bowling
[03:41:44.840 --> 03:41:50.280]  and pool and and video games and there's these 100 pound lesbians and i don't mad they're women
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:54.440]  like i'm not attacking them it was their lesbians and they got duck sass haircuts like james dean
[03:41:54.440 --> 03:41:59.320]  and they got cigarette packs over their arm and we're trying to pull and they're over their
[03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:04.440]  hitting on his wife you know saying things to her right in front of us like we don't exist
[03:42:04.440 --> 03:42:08.440]  you got some guy that'll tear your arm out of your socket you got me i mean i'm not a pushover
[03:42:09.320 --> 03:42:14.040]  and there's these 100 pound women pretending to be men and trying to muscle in on his beauty queen
[03:42:14.040 --> 03:42:18.760]  wife and she just said this is a joke she's laughing at him and we left that's what i'm saying
[03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:25.720]  it's an act of dominance if you if you're around this stuff you realize they're like oh we get
[03:42:25.720 --> 03:42:36.120]  you're not against us we're taking over and you're like okay uh and we could take on 500 of you in

[03:42:40.600 --> 03:42:46.520]  goodwill and they're gonna program us all they want is for us to submit to them and it's whatever

[03:43:16.840 --> 03:43:22.920]  efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen species top scientists agree that aging
[03:43:22.920 --> 03:43:30.200]  is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants
[03:43:30.200 --> 03:43:35.880]  found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market the stronger the antioxidant
[03:43:35.880 --> 03:43:41.240]  the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals

[03:47:46.120 --> 03:47:53.400]  that's just a little bit more the download need to lose close to 8 000 points to erase the last 14

[03:48:00.680 --> 03:48:11.640]  average comma 0 56.58 down 836 juicy points and the federal reserve swore last friday they were
[03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:17.960]  going to raise rates this year three times and they haven't done it never did that to obama in
[03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:24.280]  eight years but they're doing it now you know our real wealth is our genetic wealth our real wealth
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:29.160]  is our family wealth our real wealth is our connection to god and i and i've wanted to root
[03:48:29.160 --> 03:48:34.600]  the stock market i wanted to root the new jobs trump's doing a yeoman's job working hours that i at
[03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:43.320]  44 couldn't work that he does at 71 a true titan you know most men don't want to honor other men
[03:48:43.320 --> 03:48:47.560]  and their strength but trump's strength is our strength he's totally real my spirit knows it
[03:48:47.560 --> 03:48:53.880]  and the evidence shows it doesn't it so this is a big time right now
[03:48:53.880 --> 03:49:02.040]  and they know trump's weakness is that he wants us to win he wants to show the win he wants to
[03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:05.480]  prove he's real he's very dog-like second he's like a
[03:49:08.920 --> 03:49:13.000]  oh what's the famous dogs will kill themselves going out of snow for days st bernard
[03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:20.280]  and st bernard i don't mean that as an insult to be connected to a dog they say
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:23.960]  someone's dogged dog like it's one of the highest compliments there is
[03:49:28.200 --> 03:49:35.320]  and uh what really matters is they don't get your children they don't get you
[03:49:36.680 --> 03:49:40.760]  russia has been under incredible sanctions for 15 years not going long and that made them stronger
[03:49:41.480 --> 03:49:46.440]  so i want to go these routes to try to bypass this and you know fix it and turn it back on and
[03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:52.200]  take care of the people and everything but whoever said america deserved all that because
[03:49:52.200 --> 03:49:59.880]  the fact that we've gotten so much delivered to us in one year and trump's approval rating's
[03:49:59.880 --> 03:50:05.080]  not at 75 shows where we minded oh but i just heard a car wreck sound we're a record skipping
[03:50:07.240 --> 03:50:09.400]  they had a whole index of polls last week
[03:50:09.400 --> 03:50:15.160]  that showed trump was at 70 to 79 points in scientific polls
[03:50:17.240 --> 03:50:20.840]  they're doing nine to 15 point more samples for democrats i don't even know how that's
[03:50:21.880 --> 03:50:23.080]  90% support
[03:50:25.320 --> 03:50:29.800]  he broke their back with that speech we broke their back you broke their back
[03:50:29.800 --> 03:50:33.800]  they're bullying all their scientific evil we broke their back with god's help
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:40.840]  and just like clockwork like i said last friday i said they're gonna raise those
[03:50:40.840 --> 03:50:44.760]  rates we can see it plunge next week that was rocket science man
[03:50:49.560 --> 03:50:51.080]  it's just looking at the facts
[03:50:53.880 --> 03:50:59.080]  the globalists have bet everything on communist china because it's evil it's oppressive
[03:50:59.080 --> 03:51:03.480]  it's dominating it's totally outlawed christianity they didn't do that under mal
[03:51:03.480 --> 03:51:08.680]  this year they announced it's all banned after the pope said to all the catholic priests give
[03:51:08.680 --> 03:51:12.920]  all your information over to the government he helped them roll them up i mean what an antichrist
[03:51:17.720 --> 03:51:23.800]  so this is an epic time to be alive right now you're gonna see who's who i just prayed to god
[03:51:23.800 --> 03:51:31.000]  to strengthen me because even the elect could be deceived that what's coming in the next few years
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:36.600]  the next decade the next i got a gut feel the next 20 30 years this is gonna be pretty much
[03:51:36.600 --> 03:51:43.000]  wrapped up don't you yeah 20 30 years that's the length of this age that's the overhang of the old
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:47.640]  era and then the whole new era not the establishment new age everything they have is a counterfeit
[03:51:47.640 --> 03:51:52.920]  there is a real new age with jesus christ at the head of it and if you read what's in revelation
[03:51:52.920 --> 03:51:57.720]  and don't know that was a divine warning so that you'd hopefully listen because you have free will
[03:51:57.720 --> 03:52:04.600]  god gives you free will but we're god's children and then god feels i don't want to say guilty but
[03:52:04.600 --> 03:52:12.840]  has a mastery of logic you're gonna be given free will but you're going to be given warnings
[03:52:12.840 --> 03:52:18.200]  because god loves you just like you love a plant in your house or you love your dog or you love
[03:52:18.200 --> 03:52:23.240]  your child even more god loves a sparrow more than you can imagine as the bible says imagine how much
[03:52:23.240 --> 03:52:32.200]  god loves you god made you in his mind but because god loves you so much you've been given free will
[03:52:32.200 --> 03:52:39.480]  as a true sentient being with unlimited potential in the spot time space continuum not through
[03:52:39.480 --> 03:52:45.480]  yourself but through the species and when you realize you're an individual but you are a collective
[03:52:45.480 --> 03:52:51.880]  not a collective put on an individual you are an individual who creates a collective
[03:52:51.880 --> 03:52:59.720]  which is called teamwork it is the fusion of individualism with the collective is the magic
[03:53:00.600 --> 03:53:09.080]  the true fusion of the human experience and everything the enemy does is to sabotage that
[03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:19.720]  innate power and try to shackle it show that fallen individuals under the dominion of the
[03:53:19.720 --> 03:53:26.680]  fallen one take a look where we're at yeah yeah exactly deep space the fallen one that's all there
[03:53:28.200 --> 03:53:34.520]  trying to sabotage an amazing thing that's happening you don't just think god creates
[03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:39.160]  something beautiful and magic like this with all its potential that we can't even imagine
[03:53:39.160 --> 03:53:44.680]  and then there aren't bad things because of free will in the universe they can't mess with god
[03:53:44.680 --> 03:53:55.320]  but can try to infest one of the eggs but that's the big joke god sits back and says
[03:53:56.120 --> 03:54:01.240]  you're going to test that and it's got free will so that the argument that god is a sadist
[03:54:01.240 --> 03:54:08.520]  from some i could see but reality is about struggle true sadism is creating robots unconscious
[03:54:08.520 --> 03:54:14.360]  things that don't matter this is the great will and the fact that god will put us in the bacon
[03:54:14.360 --> 03:54:21.000]  grease is a blessing we all know animals that are fed at the park become unhappy bloated and corrupt
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:26.440]  those that defend themselves are beautiful look at the falcon and the tree and you wonder how
[03:54:26.440 --> 03:54:31.400]  can something be so beautiful and so majestic it's so incredible because it's born out of pure
[03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:38.840]  simplistic beauty and complexity unfathomed because the simplicity is the complexity and then you
[03:54:38.840 --> 03:54:45.480]  stare upon it and then you look at some diseased fat japanese monkey that everybody feeds they
[03:54:45.480 --> 03:54:51.240]  can hardly walk by the hot pool it sits in and it's a mean and throws crap at the visitors that feed
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:57.720]  it they give it all the food it weighs 200 pounds it should weigh 100 pounds and the visitors come
[03:54:57.720 --> 03:55:01.960]  to give it food it throws crap at them and utters gibbering curse words
[03:55:06.600 --> 03:55:13.960]  god has given us the gift the fire of promethean consciousness it all lays out before us
