[00:57.000 --> 01:02.640]  hunting rights and land rights in missouri he's coming on because all over
[01:02.640 --> 01:05.200]  the country not just missouri but they're fighting it there they're now
[01:05.200 --> 01:09.160]  telling landowners and this is really a federal initiative to the states that
[01:09.160 --> 01:12.840]  not only do you have to buy hunting and fishing licenses but you've got to
[01:12.840 --> 01:17.720]  basically pay a fine and a fee and and and sign up with the government and
[01:17.720 --> 01:21.600]  register your land to even be able to hunt on your own land not to have
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.760]  hunters on your land to hunt yourself on your own land they are just massively
[01:26.760 --> 01:30.680]  increasing the amount of game wardens and department of land management
[01:30.680 --> 01:34.680]  groups around the country most states it's been decades since they've ever
[01:34.680 --> 01:38.680]  prosecuted any type of commercial poaching operation it isn't about
[01:38.680 --> 01:42.360]  poaching we have deer and coyotes in every major city running out in front of
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.160]  cars people are dying in every major state every day from hitting deer it
[01:47.160 --> 01:51.280]  isn't about managing the wildlife it isn't about stopping over hunting or
[01:51.280 --> 01:55.480]  grazing or anything like that it is about control and taxation all across the
[01:55.480 --> 02:00.160]  country hunting licenses are going way up and they're telling folks on the
[02:00.160 --> 02:04.640]  news you know they say it's a privilege to hunt it's a privilege and they tell
[02:04.640 --> 02:08.320]  you driving's a privilege they tell you owning a gun's a privilege and they can
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.840]  sell the public that it's a privilege and then they'll be able to basically get
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.120]  one over on us and bring in a greater level of feudalism and tyranny it is
[02:18.120 --> 02:22.720]  not a privilege to own a firearm it is not a privilege to hunt on your own land
[02:22.720 --> 02:27.920]  it is not a privilege we are not slaves of this corrupt degenerate bureaucracy
[02:27.920 --> 02:32.640]  that has taken over our nation so we'll be talking to Russell Wood coming up in
[02:32.640 --> 02:40.440]  about three hours from now on that subject in the fourth hour today in the
[02:40.440 --> 02:45.840]  meantime boy is there a lot of news in front of me today US Corps of Engineers
[02:45.840 --> 02:52.080]  caught harassing activists on the internet and this is from WWL television
[02:52.080 --> 02:58.200]  and they did the same thing we do the Army Corps of Engineers the Marine Corps
[02:58.200 --> 03:03.680]  sitcom the Army psychological warfare divisions they don't care they've been
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.800]  told that it's okay to engage the American people the military has admitted
[03:07.800 --> 03:11.640]  in press releases that they're quote fighting this information on the web and
[03:11.640 --> 03:17.040]  it is illegal under federal law but they still do it they don't care and they
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.120]  put their handles in the message boards in the comments when they lie about you
[03:22.120 --> 03:27.200]  and threaten you and spend things about you and then you can just Google their
[03:27.200 --> 03:31.080]  handles and you'll be on their own Facebook websites of their own Army
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.480]  subpage or on Myspace and there they are in their uniform and then this
[03:36.480 --> 03:40.520]  particular watchdog group and the media this particular TV station they went and
[03:40.520 --> 03:45.960]  tracked the IPs back not just the handles not just their user names but the IP
[03:45.960 --> 03:50.840]  addresses directly to the Army now we have this tens of thousands of times a
[03:50.840 --> 03:55.320]  day info wars dot com prison planet dot com are being hit by military IP
[03:55.320 --> 03:59.760]  addresses and government IP addresses national security agency CIA foreign
[03:59.760 --> 04:09.440]  governments the Kremlin the Japanese diet most of that is just people in
[04:09.440 --> 04:12.200]  government who are fans of the show or interested in what we're doing or
[04:12.200 --> 04:15.360]  somebody following a link from another website and you know just surfing the
[04:15.360 --> 04:19.720]  web but a lot of it we've been able to track it directly back is coming out of
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.960]  SMPCOM and Northcom and these guys go on there and say we're going to kill you
[04:23.960 --> 04:29.880]  you're a traitor you're a communist there is no North American Union there
[04:29.880 --> 04:34.280]  there is no plan to put military on the streets it doesn't matter if it's on the
[04:34.280 --> 04:38.080]  news when we report it they go on and say we're liars so they're running psyops
[04:38.080 --> 04:41.320]  against us and let me tell you something boys and girls it is not working
[04:41.320 --> 04:45.400]  you're just showing everybody who you are so that's one of the articles I only
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.080]  got into one of them there's about 20 important stories in front of me so we'll
[04:49.080 --> 04:53.560]  cover that Kissinger calls for world government again on Charlie Rose Bush
[04:53.560 --> 04:59.560]  is saying the automakers have to be nationalized stay with us
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.720]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:04.720 --> 05:08.000]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.560]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:11.560 --> 05:14.840]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.680]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:18.680 --> 05:22.200]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:22.200 --> 05:26.000]  for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.640]  the telephones and email they voted to print $850 billion at least out of
[05:30.640 --> 05:34.720]  thin air this money now owns the America and European banks the exploding
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.480]  inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[05:38.480 --> 05:42.600]  blast the cost of the sessions particularly food beyond many Americans
[05:42.600 --> 05:46.440]  reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread
[05:46.440 --> 05:51.040]  doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are
[05:51.040 --> 05:55.240]  skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[05:55.240 --> 05:58.880]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[05:58.880 --> 06:02.440]  money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices
[06:02.440 --> 06:06.480]  to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be
[06:06.480 --> 06:10.160]  ready everything is zeroing it on food one third of Americans have to choose
[06:10.160 --> 06:14.000]  between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.920]  takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[06:17.920 --> 06:20.840]  listening it's very important for you understand that by having a supply of
[06:20.840 --> 06:24.440]  storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[06:24.440 --> 06:28.760]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one
[06:28.760 --> 06:32.080]  is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you you know we
[06:32.080 --> 06:35.920]  foods direct comm is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli
[06:35.920 --> 06:39.760]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half

[07:22.520 --> 07:27.960]  U.S. Corps of Engineers caught harassing activists on the internet
[07:27.960 --> 07:33.080]  mainstream news Kissinger Obama crisis could yield opportunities for New
[07:33.080 --> 07:39.400]  World Order automakers to get 17.4 billion but Ford doesn't want it because
[07:39.400 --> 07:42.720]  it says the federal government will take control of the companies and hand it
[07:42.720 --> 07:47.000]  over their private cronies pro sovereignty party reluctant about
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  pledging allegiance to the Queen Globe and Mail reports that yes the Queen
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.840]  really does run Canada and they have a new party being sworn in as a minority
[07:56.840 --> 07:59.760]  member in the parliament and they're saying they don't want to swear allegiance
[07:59.760 --> 08:04.720]  to her they thought the country was free and not under colonial rule a manual
[08:04.720 --> 08:11.560]  talk directly to the governor of Illinois Blagojevich of course he did
[08:11.560 --> 08:17.080]  this is being reported by the Chicago Sun Times I mean Rahm Emanuel Barack
[08:17.080 --> 08:22.920]  Obama and of course governor Blagojevich all came up together and Rahm
[08:22.920 --> 08:27.680]  Emanuel was both of the men's handlers I mean their best friends so of course
[08:27.680 --> 08:34.400]  there was a deal to sell the Senate seat to Jesse Jackson Jr. or others we know
[08:34.400 --> 08:37.400]  that they were all in the bidding doesn't we don't know they were
[08:37.400 --> 08:41.440]  individually even involved but the power but was above them were this is how
[08:41.440 --> 08:45.800]  government works this is what government has turned into there's now a story out
[08:45.800 --> 08:51.680]  Nobel Prize probe launched and it's talking about you know where was the
[08:51.680 --> 08:57.400]  Nobel Prize purchased because the new Nobel Prize for medicine is going to

[09:06.360 --> 09:09.800]  companies are continually caught doing this is only the tip of the icebergs
[09:09.800 --> 09:14.760]  we'll be reporting on that as well big story I just mentioned yesterday I want
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.840]  to spend some more time on today with Richard Gage when he joins us and yes
[09:18.840 --> 09:22.480]  we have April Gallup's phone number we've been calling her since yesterday we
[09:22.480 --> 09:26.400]  missed a call back from her so we're playing phone tag with her she was the
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.880]  Pentagon specialist who was there and I clearly knew that a plane according to
[09:30.880 --> 09:34.120]  her did not crash into the building she's now filed a suit remember about six
[09:34.120 --> 09:37.560]  months ago she was on trying to raise funds on air from the listeners and I
[09:37.560 --> 09:40.640]  guess you did come through so they filed a suit alleging that it was a
[09:40.640 --> 09:46.800]  government conspiracy to carry out the attacks and so she's now filed that
[09:46.800 --> 09:55.160]  lawsuit we'll be going over that as well today also this story broke about two

[12:11.080 --> 12:15.720]  play this clip and then stop it periodically and make comments U.S.
[12:15.720 --> 12:19.680]  Corps of Engineers caught harassing activists on the Internet this is
[12:19.680 --> 12:28.600]  only the very surface of what's going on with the disinformation cores from
[12:28.600 --> 12:33.480]  Homeland Security from North Com and from every branch not just of the
[12:33.480 --> 12:37.880]  military but every other federal agency admittedly has billions the smallest
[12:37.880 --> 12:43.480]  agencies have billions billions according to congressional reports
[12:43.480 --> 12:51.080]  billions of dollars for fake news PR propaganda fake newscast and paid
[12:51.080 --> 12:58.880]  bloggers huge office buildings across the United States are filled with paid
[12:58.880 --> 13:03.880]  propagandas with scripts to follow to attack land rights groups second
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.920]  amendment groups hunting rights groups groups that want to control our borders
[13:08.920 --> 13:13.560]  and groups that are against the North American Union and they go around you
[13:13.560 --> 13:17.720]  know we can post a link to CNN and Vicente Fox saying yes it's a North
[13:17.720 --> 13:21.760]  American Union yes we're setting it up and out of a financial crisis we will
[13:21.760 --> 13:25.640]  get it that's what the SPP said three years ago we had to sue to get the
[13:25.640 --> 13:29.560]  documents that's how we know what was going to happen because we get their
[13:29.560 --> 13:33.640]  own documents now we would post that link just one example and there would be
[13:33.640 --> 13:37.640]  hundreds of posts under it in the comments saying your liars this is fake
[13:37.640 --> 13:43.120]  this video isn't real we would post the SPP documents from four-year suits and
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.920]  with a link to judicial watch that originally got them they will come in
[13:47.920 --> 13:51.840]  the army will come in other bureaucracies will come in and they will say you
[13:51.840 --> 13:55.360]  are a liar you are scum you're a communist you're making money off this
[13:55.360 --> 13:59.680]  you're a liar it's classic come and tell pros let's go ahead and roll this clip
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.880]  and we'll analyze this newscast next on night watch levies.org says it has
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.880]  discovered attacks posted on its blogs are coming from inside the Army Corps
[14:09.880 --> 14:14.000]  of Engineers. Just a few days ago I discovered some solid evidence that
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.840]  showed that the US Army Corps of Engineers had been systematically logging
[14:17.840 --> 14:21.920]  on to my blog and leaving comments that are attempting to shift
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.360]  responsibility for the New Orleans flooding away from the civil engineering
[14:25.360 --> 14:43.400]  profession and instead on to the citizens who live here some technical
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.120]  problems with the lottery we'll bring that to you later on good evening I'm
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.960]  Dennis Waltering in for my cause and I'm Lucy Bustamante so should government
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.560]  computers be used to attack citizens who are working to hold government agencies
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.440]  accountable that's the question levies.org is asking after its founder says
[14:58.440 --> 15:02.040]  she discovered computer equipment at the Corps of Engineers has been used to
[15:02.040 --> 15:08.280]  send messages attacking her group the citizens watchdog group levies.org
[15:08.280 --> 15:12.960]  operates two internet blogs and in recent months the group's founder Sandy
[15:12.960 --> 15:17.200]  Rosenthal says she's noticed increasingly ferocious attacks against her
[15:17.200 --> 15:22.560]  levies.org and its supporters in messages from at least two screen names
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.560]  they go after my credibility and they accuse me of making making making up
[15:27.560 --> 15:32.560]  data levies.org has strongly criticized the US Army Corps of Engineers for the
[15:32.560 --> 15:36.400]  levy failures that led to catastrophic flooding after Hurricane Katrina and
[15:36.400 --> 15:40.960]  Rosenthal says the recent attacks on her blogs have had a recurring theme they're
[15:40.960 --> 15:47.400]  trying to send and that message is that the locals blocked the Corps's wishes
[15:47.400 --> 15:52.920]  all right stop right there back it up a few seconds okay number one this is not
[15:52.920 --> 15:57.360]  the or the Army Corps of Engineers fault let's get that straight so there's
[15:57.360 --> 16:01.040]  always red herrings within red herrings within distractions within
[16:01.040 --> 16:07.880]  diversions wheels within wheels on this the federal government squandered and
[16:07.880 --> 16:13.920]  stole the money in contracts and that came out the local county government the
[16:13.920 --> 16:20.640]  parish government the city government as well was involved stealing the money
[16:20.640 --> 16:26.080]  giving the bids to their cousins and brothers and and and and family members
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.440]  and that's all come out on record this has all been intensely investigated that
[16:30.440 --> 16:34.560]  is a red herring we're not we're not playing this clip here to talk about
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.040]  who's really at fault for all of this we're talking about the military in the
[16:39.040 --> 16:45.760]  United States going into blogs and attacking people and attacking this
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.560]  organization so there's enough blame to go around now the Army Corps of
[16:49.560 --> 16:54.320]  Engineers was not involved with FEMA going in and cutting police and fire
[16:54.320 --> 17:00.800]  department radio and cell phone internal towers now and the local police at gun
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.680]  point had to post guards and then they caught FEMA cutting the fence coming in
[17:04.680 --> 17:09.840]  again to hack down with fire axes the major police radio communication center
[17:09.840 --> 17:17.960]  now they cut it as the hurricane was over the city then it went past dumped
[17:17.960 --> 17:21.720]  all the rain that came in broke the levees some suspicious things there and
[17:21.720 --> 17:25.720]  witnesses of bombs going off the federal government admits that what back in the
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.920]  20s they did blow the levees so that's also where that idea comes from we don't
[17:29.920 --> 17:37.160]  know the point is we do know that FEMA wanted things to be a disaster so they
[17:37.160 --> 17:41.160]  cut police communications and that's why two-thirds of the police just went home
[17:41.160 --> 17:46.400]  because their radios were down their radios were off and then it came out two
[17:46.400 --> 17:51.760]  days later that FEMA had cut all the communications as the storm hits now now
[17:51.760 --> 17:54.480]  why would they do that you know that adds evidence that they probably did blow
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.520]  the levees and you say why to have a big disaster to say they screwed up to have
[17:59.520 --> 18:03.520]  a beta test a laboratory test they admit it was a laboratory test about gun
[18:03.520 --> 18:07.480]  confiscation bringing troops in under FBI command bringing black water in
[18:07.480 --> 18:11.640]  bringing Israeli Mossad in oh you didn't know Israeli Mossad that was actually up
[18:11.640 --> 18:19.680]  on PBS we've played that clip here with Bill Maury's so all of this is going on
[18:19.680 --> 18:25.560]  all of this is happening and FEMA cut the lines and then the police finally
[18:25.560 --> 18:30.520]  days later had to fix it and guard it they wouldn't let other good branches or
[18:30.520 --> 18:34.600]  or branches the military trying to do a good job like the Coast Guard was trying
[18:34.600 --> 18:39.560]  to bring in you know thousands of gallons of diesel they were blocked
[18:39.560 --> 18:42.800]  firefighters and police groups all country that showed up they were blocked
[18:42.800 --> 18:47.080]  because FEMA wanted to have the biggest crisis they could there to say oh look
[18:47.080 --> 18:50.000]  we screwed up we need even more power and that's not come out when we come back
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.640]  that's a side issue the main issue is government bureaucracies agencies not just
[18:55.640 --> 19:00.480]  the military they are on the web full-time private groups that are
[19:00.480 --> 19:05.120]  contracted are on the web full-time attacking anyone that criticizes the

[23:55.040 --> 23:59.040]  all out there full-time battling the American people that's why half the
[23:59.040 --> 24:01.720]  billboards us here on the country now our government propaganda turning your
[24:01.720 --> 24:04.400]  neighbors turning your neighbors if they spank their kids turning your
[24:04.400 --> 24:07.960]  neighbors if they smoke pot spy on your neighbors oh the government loves you
[24:07.960 --> 24:11.520]  all the government's good the messages it's just everywhere you know report
[24:11.520 --> 24:14.840]  illegal guns shows a picture of a revolver your neighbor then thinks the
[24:14.840 --> 24:18.720]  guns are illegal when they're not creating a perception that that normal
[24:18.720 --> 24:22.280]  behavior is illegal because we have a criminal system that wants an excuse to
[24:22.280 --> 24:25.760]  feed on us and most good people if the government shows up with an official
[24:25.760 --> 24:29.480]  badge in uniform and says you've done something wrong people will put up with
[24:29.480 --> 24:33.720]  tyranny if it has that official cover let's go back to a little bit more of
[24:33.720 --> 24:39.240]  this news piece about the Army Corps of Engineers going around engaging in a
[24:39.240 --> 24:47.160]  block ops blocked the cause wishes and and thus that the locals are responsible
[24:47.160 --> 24:51.200]  for the flooding a comment sent by someone using the screen name overwrought
[24:51.200 --> 24:56.480]  last Thursday says quote sure blame the core for the floodwall failures but who
[24:56.480 --> 25:00.000]  do you blame for your own stupidity for putting your families in such a
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.400]  situation a comment from a user with the screen name stevo nollens on
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.040]  November 18th says quote you have chosen core bashing to persuade enough
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.240]  underinformed people that Katrina was a federal flood then the rest of the
[25:13.240 --> 25:17.840]  nation will pour even more money into the sinkhole of New Orleans Rosenthal
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.280]  was curious and who could the comments be coming from so she plugged the
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.640]  screen names into an internet search to find out yes I was absolutely amazed the
[25:27.640 --> 25:33.960]  first thing she turned up was this this is headquarters US Army information
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.600]  system command then an even bigger surprise she discovered the computer
[25:38.600 --> 25:44.440]  gear some of those messages came from belongs to us a c e the US Army Corps
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.280]  of Engineers okay that's enough that's enough you can watch the rest of it up
[25:48.280 --> 25:56.560]  on prison planet dot com and info wars dot com the issue here is not the thing
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.880]  being debated it's that the military runs around masquerading as average citizens
[26:01.880 --> 26:05.280]  engaging in this type of propaganda and that's nothing you can go to info wars
[26:05.280 --> 26:10.160]  dot com prison planet dot com you know the prison planet forum and they'll be
[26:10.160 --> 26:14.720]  in there saying I can't wait to kick you civilians teeth in I can't wait to
[26:14.720 --> 26:20.600]  kill you yes it's a new world order I mean just you know you're Alex is a
[26:20.600 --> 26:26.120]  communist al-qaeda and we are going to kill him and then we go check the IP
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.840]  address folks it's from the military and then you can check it it's not just from
[26:30.840 --> 26:35.560]  the soldiers you know on their off-time music computers it's from commands it's
[26:35.560 --> 26:42.320]  from North com it's from sent com mainly and sometimes and you go to YouTube
[26:42.320 --> 26:47.360]  they don't even care they'll put their handle on there and people say well you
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.480]  could you know somebody could be faking their handle no they'll be on their
[26:51.480 --> 26:56.080]  saying kill Alex Jones kill the you know the Patriots you know the new world
[26:56.080 --> 27:01.840]  order is good or the new order doesn't exist then you Google their handle and
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.240]  it takes you to their myspace their Facebook or other sites and they're
[27:06.240 --> 27:12.000]  saying similar stuff next to their picture on their own page I mean they'll
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.880]  even post videos of troops and contractors killing innocent Iraqis
[27:17.880 --> 27:22.240]  those hundreds of videos of a machine-gunning families shooting cars up
[27:22.240 --> 27:26.240]  and they're laughing and then they'll always have weird heavy metal music with
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.680]  other fan videos for the military showing the troops slaughtering people I
[27:30.680 --> 27:35.920]  mean this is just dark stuff these guys have gone completely over to the dark
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.520]  side now certainly the majority of the military is not like that but the social
[27:40.520 --> 27:44.120]  engineers they sift through all these people and they take the unstable
[27:44.120 --> 27:48.880]  psychopaths the sociopaths the the psychopathic sadist and they promote
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.120]  them in the command position so that came out with 29 palms in the mid 1990s
[27:53.120 --> 27:57.400]  they said will you fire on US citizens under PDD's under presidential decision
[27:57.400 --> 28:02.320]  directives will you confiscate guns for national security emergency and 76% said
[28:02.320 --> 28:07.400]  no well they took the 24% that said yes and they promoted them and they put them
[28:07.400 --> 28:12.240]  into the FBI they put them into the DEA they put them into FEMA and they now
[28:12.240 --> 28:19.480]  have giant armies and they also fence them into private mercenary firms not
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.080]  just doing military things but but but intelligence gathering spying black ops
[28:24.080 --> 28:28.960]  dirty tricks and so the number of them is unknown but we know to coordinate
[28:28.960 --> 28:32.440]  between them they have 26,000 preachers brainwashed to work with them until
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.560]  their flocks to stand down to hit the streets TV and radio and 23,000
[28:36.560 --> 28:40.760]  corporate executives who've been given shoot-to-kill orders against US citizens
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.120]  under orders show I mean this is a huge invisible empire all around us that work

[28:49.320 --> 28:53.240]  chapter on that front when we get back and people having the police come after

[32:25.920 --> 32:34.720]  dragging on but that train keeps rolling all down the
[32:34.720 --> 32:43.960]  San Antonio when I was just a baby my mama told me son always be a good boy
[32:43.960 --> 32:50.080]  don't ever play with guns but I shot a man we know we are back live thank you
[32:50.080 --> 32:56.800]  for joining us on this Friday the 19th of 2008 only 12 days left in this year
[32:56.800 --> 33:07.800]  ladies and gentlemen okay automakers to get 17.4 billion dollars but all those
[33:07.800 --> 33:13.440]  are our loan guarantees still the economy will be in shambles and people
[33:13.440 --> 33:18.880]  won't be able to buy automobiles or even pay for the cheap gas the White House
[33:18.880 --> 33:23.600]  announced a 17.4 billion rescue package for the trouble Detroit automakers that
[33:23.600 --> 33:27.520]  allows them to avoid bankruptcy and leaves many of the big decisions for the
[33:27.520 --> 33:33.280]  incoming Obama administration this is out of the Wall Street Journal that's a
[33:33.280 --> 33:36.760]  nice way of telling folks it's being nationalized and if you read the plan
[33:36.760 --> 33:41.120]  it says the White House think of the power over those unions over all those
[33:41.120 --> 33:45.240]  millions of workers three million workers think of the power that will give
[33:45.240 --> 33:50.080]  the fascist running our country you notice Bush is setting it up for him
[33:50.080 --> 33:55.960]  passing the baton to Barack Obama and then they can play games with the
[33:55.960 --> 34:00.400]  workers they can use the workers as a political weapon speaking from the
[34:00.400 --> 34:03.840]  White House president George W. Bush said the administration decided against
[34:03.840 --> 34:07.920]  forcing a bankruptcy to compel cost-cutting but in the language it
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.600]  says they can force a bankruptcy in order to avoid the risk that consumers
[34:11.600 --> 34:14.960]  would desert one or more of the companies and touch off an industry
[34:14.960 --> 34:18.880]  collapse deepening the current economic downturn in the midst of a financial
[34:18.880 --> 34:23.360]  crisis along the US auto industry collapse is not a responsible course
[34:23.360 --> 34:27.640]  of action Mr. Bush said and he goes under ordinary economic circumstances I
[34:27.640 --> 34:30.960]  would say this is the price of failed companies must pay remember he said
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.480]  that right before the banker takeover eight weeks ago and I would not favor
[34:34.480 --> 34:37.240]  intervening to prevent the automakers from going on a business the president
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.240]  said but these are not ordinary circumstances the deal would extend
[34:41.240 --> 34:44.520]  thirteen point four billion in loans the General Motors and Chrysler LLC in
[34:44.520 --> 34:48.160]  December and January another four billion likely available in February it
[34:48.160 --> 34:53.240]  would also provide the government with non voting warrants although the exact
[34:53.240 --> 34:57.240]  amount was unclear immediately Ford Motorco has said it doesn't need short
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.880]  term assistance the deal is contingent on companies showing that they are
[35:01.880 --> 35:06.280]  financially viable by March 31st if they aren't the loans will be called and all
[35:06.280 --> 35:11.600]  funds will be returned official said and it goes on to say the deal
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.880]  generally tracks key provisions the bailout legislation that nearly passed
[35:15.880 --> 35:21.720]  Congress this month but in relatively lenient and allowing the companies to
[35:21.720 --> 35:26.240]  show their viability it defines viability as having a positive net
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.800]  pressure valve a way of gauging the company's worth taking into account all
[35:31.800 --> 35:37.800]  the future obligations so what's happening here is they're going to give
[35:37.800 --> 35:43.600]  this 17 billion dollars to begin with to GM and Chrysler Ford doesn't want it
[35:43.600 --> 35:48.440]  because if you really read the legalese it says the president and the
[35:48.440 --> 35:53.520]  Department of Commerce and Department of Treasury and others will have the power
[35:53.520 --> 36:00.840]  to force bankruptcies or other serious decisions over the automakers the two
[36:00.840 --> 36:07.680]  that are talking about taking the funds now remember what happened with the
[36:07.680 --> 36:10.800]  banker takeover bill known as the banker bailout eight weeks ago and again we
[36:10.800 --> 36:14.240]  haven't gotten new numbers in two weeks now two weeks ago the last numbers we
[36:14.240 --> 36:20.280]  got was 8.5 trillion taken by the Federal Reserve that US taxpayers will
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.040]  have to pay back at interest and they are telling Congress and the media even
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.320]  under lawsuits a four-year lawsuits and the feds have ruled saying no it's
[36:30.320 --> 36:34.680]  secret that no one will be told where the money went but the companies
[36:34.680 --> 36:39.800]  themselves are bragging hundreds of billions of dollars that we know of
[36:39.800 --> 36:45.760]  of the trillions has been publicly given to the brokerage firm and big
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.920]  central bank employees I mean some of these CEOs have gotten hundreds of
[36:50.920 --> 36:56.080]  millions of dollars a piece so right in front of everyone they are giving
[36:56.080 --> 37:02.800]  themselves bonuses and huge increases in their overall pay packages same thing
[37:02.800 --> 37:09.720]  the house just passed a huge pay increase for the Congress Hillary Clinton
[37:09.720 --> 37:14.360]  has been confirmed as you know for Secretary of State or is being confirmed
[37:14.360 --> 37:19.600]  that that doesn't seem to matter that under the Constitution you can't leave
[37:19.600 --> 37:24.880]  the Senate in your term and go to another branch that you have raised the pay
[37:24.880 --> 37:31.160]  of and the Senate what last year raised the pay of the executive does it matter
[37:31.160 --> 37:35.360]  if that's felony violation of federal law US code Constitution clearly in the
[37:35.360 --> 37:39.440]  subsections they just don't care again they are completely lawless they are
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.880]  practicing legalese to set precedence to break any law they want whenever they
[37:44.880 --> 37:53.480]  want so remember they told us look just give us this unlimited power that the
[37:53.480 --> 37:58.960]  bill states and we promise will be transparent we promise we will tell
[37:58.960 --> 38:04.240]  you everything we're spending it on we promise that we won't give CEOs our
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.240]  employees bonuses or pay increases in fact there'll be pay cuts but none of
[38:08.240 --> 38:14.040]  that was in the bill the 500 and something page bill well I went and
[38:14.040 --> 38:18.960]  scanned over it I read the versions we would always be reading the two or three
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.000]  or four-day old version while they were voting on the newest version but days
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.120]  after it passed sure enough it was just like the other versions it said that they
[38:27.120 --> 38:30.560]  are omnipotent above the law that the Federal Reserve can issue its own
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.160]  treasuries that they could basically seize any part of the economy they want
[38:34.160 --> 38:38.760]  that they could take quadrillions you know thousands of trillions if they
[38:38.760 --> 38:42.080]  wanted to they can fully debase the currency but remember in the in the
[38:42.080 --> 38:46.000]  short term they're busy buying up real assets and in taking the money and
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.880]  leveraging it in more derivatives actions and openly buying up insurance
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.160]  companies that are healthy and banks that are healthy regional banks that
[38:55.160 --> 38:58.760]  didn't get involved in the derivatives that are doing quite well the remember
[38:58.760 --> 39:01.440]  they have the head of Goldman Sachs in an interview with the New York Times a
[39:01.440 --> 39:05.440]  month ago bragging don't you have a man this is great for us we're buying up
[39:05.440 --> 39:09.440]  good banks and insurance companies and well we're gonna you know pay our
[39:09.440 --> 39:13.760]  employees more now they are laying off the service ends when you hear Bank of
[39:13.760 --> 39:20.960]  America and Citibank and Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase when you hear that
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.400]  they're laying off 20,000 here 30,000 there 40,000 the year 50,000 there
[39:25.400 --> 39:29.800]  they're laying off and you go read it it's in the news I mean the details are
[39:29.800 --> 39:35.480]  there they're hiring low-level they're getting rid of the low-level people that
[39:35.480 --> 39:42.080]  would give you retail loans that would help you get a housing loan or a car
[39:42.080 --> 39:48.720]  loan or a business loan you know bank tellers they're closing bank branches so
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.800]  their retail end because they don't need you anymore they're killing the old
[39:54.800 --> 39:58.320]  economy they're consolidating it they are destroying it by cutting off
[39:58.320 --> 40:04.560]  liquidity so they can buy it up for pennies on the dollar and the FDIC the
[40:04.560 --> 40:10.040]  federal depositors insurance corporation just yesterday announced a new
[40:10.040 --> 40:14.400]  regulation it's not a lot but they have unlimited power it's tyrannical illegitimate
[40:14.400 --> 40:18.240]  power but they have it that oh by the way no new banks this is in the Wall
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.600]  Street Journal no new banks are allowed to open so this is a banking
[40:22.600 --> 40:26.400]  consolidation there are lots of groups and companies and individuals that are
[40:26.400 --> 40:31.480]  cash rich that didn't get invested in all these scams but they're not allowed
[40:31.480 --> 40:35.880]  to go out and start new banks so this is a vertical integration a blowing out of
[40:35.880 --> 40:40.560]  the insolvent banks consolidating them and under the three majors in the US the
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.720]  five majors worldwide and then forcibly buying up solvent banks and insurance
[40:45.720 --> 40:50.920]  companies at the regional and local level and how are they doing that well
[40:50.920 --> 40:55.760]  if a Texas bank for instance I know one case just a few weeks ago didn't want to
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.000]  sell but federal regulators came in and said we're going to be real easy on all
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.440]  your executives and we're going to give you sweetheart jobs within the larger
[41:02.440 --> 41:08.040]  infrastructure it's a corporate takeover and if you don't do it here are the
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.840]  federal regulators they're going to white glove inspect you see the laws are
[41:12.840 --> 41:16.420]  written where nobody can follow all the laws and then selectively the elites can
[41:16.420 --> 41:19.840]  break all the laws do whatever they want break the serious laws but then
[41:19.840 --> 41:23.400]  anybody who doesn't play ball with them well they can be destroyed by the
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.840]  bureaucracy and see the globalists have to destroy the globalists have to
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.400]  destroy or buy up your local banks because they have to have liquidity cut
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.200]  off for the public and so if you have hundreds and hundreds of solvent local
[41:37.200 --> 41:40.160]  and regional banks that are quite wealthy that are still going to be giving
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.240]  loans still going to be financing business and construction they have to be
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.040]  bought up so the management changes so that doesn't happen so again this is a
[41:49.040 --> 41:53.280]  military strike with military precision all of this is being done this is
[41:53.280 --> 41:58.680]  economic warfare which will then go into physical military occupation and
[41:58.680 --> 42:01.360]  oppression just as our military has been used in hundreds of other third world
[42:01.360 --> 42:05.480]  nations to carry out the same chain of events they've just been going at a
[42:05.480 --> 42:08.480]  slower pace here in the United States being more careful about it because we
[42:08.480 --> 42:14.320]  are quite a system to bring down and very dangerous in our death rows now a lot
[42:14.320 --> 42:22.720]  is being said about the fifty billion dollars that Mr. Madoff stole from his
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.000]  family his sons and predominantly Jewish charities and investment groups
[42:28.000 --> 42:34.840]  Steven Spielberg the list goes Mort Zuckerman the list goes on and on but
[42:34.840 --> 42:40.840]  the banks are being very secretive about their investments with him worldwide in
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.720]  the United States the Bank of Scotland Bank of England all of them German banks
[42:45.720 --> 42:50.400]  Russian banks Dutch banks I mean the list goes on and on there's hundreds of
[42:50.400 --> 42:56.680]  there's lists on the web listed in the news they won't release just how much
[42:56.680 --> 43:02.480]  they've been exposed but it is rumored to be well in excess of 50 billion or
[43:02.480 --> 43:07.760]  more itself now remember that's only one guy and they're trying to act like now
[43:07.760 --> 43:13.280]  he was just some bottom-feeder nobody know this was the founder and the former
[43:13.280 --> 43:19.440]  head of the Nasdaq the second largest stock exchange on the planet this guy
[43:19.440 --> 43:25.480]  had central banks of the world investing with him and the media is now
[43:25.480 --> 43:28.840]  having to admit in the Wall Street Journal in the times of London and other
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.640]  publications that all the major brokerage firms were doing what he was
[43:32.640 --> 43:38.000]  doing that all of the major banks were doing this so so what he was doing was
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.960]  kosher what he was doing is is what the system is engaged in I mean look at it
[43:44.960 --> 43:49.160]  we've got all these governors you're getting arrested we've got all this
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.720]  corruption I mean every day in the local paper in Austin it's some quasi private
[43:54.720 --> 44:00.520]  utility running scams the PEC review that tells past abuses of power and then it
[44:00.520 --> 44:05.560]  lists just millions of dollars missing and gone stolen that's just some local
[44:05.560 --> 44:09.720]  lower you know per analysis electrical authority some of the low-level thing I
[44:09.720 --> 44:15.760]  mean it's just it's a crime machine it is a horde of locusts in in three-piece
[44:15.760 --> 44:20.560]  suits that took over our governments took over our counties and cities ratcheted
[44:20.560 --> 44:29.640]  up all these taxes which were then paid into the city county school district
[44:29.640 --> 44:36.040]  water district coffers and then 60 plus percent on average was invested into
[44:36.040 --> 44:42.760]  private funds and and it's incredible after a city manager rips off a city he
[44:42.760 --> 44:47.120]  then gets a job from 150,000 a year to a million a year at the very same
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.800]  brokerage firm he sells the city out to then you wonder why there's suddenly
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.280]  cops everywhere writing tickets while they're suddenly fines and fees in the
[44:54.280 --> 44:58.080]  city grabbing people's houses it's because these greedy bastards are stealing
[44:58.080 --> 45:01.680]  your money and putting it directly into their pockets to understand the guys in
[45:01.680 --> 45:04.960]  suits come take over your city they raise the taxes and they pay the taxes
[45:04.960 --> 45:11.160]  directly to themselves while the budget that you hear about it's only 35% on
[45:11.160 --> 45:13.720]  average of the money they're actually getting they have big newscasts and
[45:13.720 --> 45:17.400]  discussions about the budgets on TV but never about the double set of books the
[45:17.400 --> 45:27.120]  comprehensive annual financial reports and so now they have set up a system to
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.600]  finally destroy the free market in the United States and to blame what they've
[45:30.600 --> 45:33.320]  done on the free market when there's nothing to do with the free market this
[45:33.320 --> 45:39.160]  is white collar hardcore crime and so for the military for the police a lot of you
[45:39.160 --> 45:43.960]  listening in austin or in kansas city or upstate new york or california or florida some
[45:43.960 --> 45:46.960]  of you been listening on stations have been carrying us for more than 10 years
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.000]  continually you heard me i mean i made a film nine years ago comprehensive annual
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.560]  financial reports exposed it's on dvd at info wars dot com they'll watch that and
[45:57.560 --> 46:01.280]  we lay out the double set of books how they're planning in the future we say in
[46:01.280 --> 46:04.960]  the next 10 years we have their own documents to implode the economy we
[46:04.960 --> 46:10.520]  show you all the evidence how when they were done transferring the majority of
[46:10.520 --> 46:14.760]  the wealth out of the people out of the free market out when they were done
[46:14.760 --> 46:18.480]  shutting down our factories and moving them overseas when they fully had us
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.680]  where we were a deader nation public private and corporate they would then
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.000]  move all the money offshore and then implode the united states and buy up the
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.560]  the raw assets the land the value and then socialize everything is the banks
[46:32.560 --> 46:35.280]  issue all the money they can do whatever they want and make everybody
[46:35.280 --> 46:38.160]  basically have government jobs or work for a corporation that's government
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.920]  funded so we are literally feudal serfs and slaves that's what elites do
[46:42.920 --> 46:47.560]  throughout history and that's what these guys have now done so for police and
[46:47.560 --> 46:51.440]  military when your standard of living plunges which already has when your
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.760]  life is destroyed when your children have no future do not sit there and say
[46:55.760 --> 47:01.320]  you weren't told i reach on the web alone through the videos and the
[47:01.320 --> 47:04.960]  audios and the websites hundreds of millions of people every year and I'm
[47:04.960 --> 47:08.040]  just one guy in this fight there are thousands of other prominent groups and
[47:08.040 --> 47:12.720]  websites and filmmakers doing just wonderful jobs as well you've all seen
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.120]  this information you heard us tell you exactly what happened years ago we are
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.520]  credible we are accurate instead of you apologizing and coming to us and asking
[47:22.520 --> 47:26.640]  what you should do you go on info wars dot com and present planet dot com and
[47:26.640 --> 47:34.920]  you talk about how i'm a trader how many to be killed listen you work for made
[47:34.920 --> 47:40.040]  off you know the guy that just stole conservatively over a hundred million
[47:40.040 --> 47:45.560]  dollars and if he'd steal that from Steven Spielberg if he'd steal that
[47:45.560 --> 47:49.360]  from pull and by the way read the list police funds i mean you may not care
[47:49.360 --> 47:52.840]  about me or even your own family but you should at least care about yourself i
[47:52.840 --> 47:57.480]  mean they are you understand you're not going to get your pension funds you're
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.600]  going to get a tiny fraction of it not just through inflation but but the total
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.920]  check you are going you are being cheated now these are swindlers they
[48:06.920 --> 48:10.320]  don't care about you they're just going to use the military to suppress the
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.160]  public so that we can never get back control of our government and bring them
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.440]  to justice seat these criminals know that they i mean the whole time i mean
[48:19.440 --> 48:22.240]  they've been running these ponzi schemes here since the fifties with the
[48:22.240 --> 48:27.560]  chicago 1313 double set of books model that we cover in comprehensive angle
[48:27.560 --> 48:34.800]  financial reports exposed we've been covering it since then and and since
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.000]  the fifties they set up this model it went nationwide by the mid fifties so
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.640]  more than 50 years tens of trillions of dollars a year sucked out of local
[48:44.640 --> 48:49.200]  economies put into the globalist coffers internationally they're offshore see
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.600]  they're there crushing nations destroying countries starting war selling
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.120]  weapons to both sides it's all about a monopoly game they've got to bring down
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.080]  the sovereign wealth the sovereign engines of of creativity and the free
[49:02.080 --> 49:06.000]  market in countries so that they can sit above all the nations and play us off
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.480]  against each other and they knew 50 years ago what they were doing was
[49:11.480 --> 49:16.040]  completely criminal in a financial coup d'etat look who made up the cia wall
[49:16.040 --> 49:21.000]  street when it was set up in 147 and so they've known the whole time and so just
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.960]  like when a bank robber goes in a bank he pulls out a gun he says hands up well
[49:26.960 --> 49:29.680]  that's what they've done with the police in the military and the tasers and the
[49:29.680 --> 49:33.440]  checkpoints and then the brainwashing that all of this is good and for own

[54:36.600 --> 54:40.320]  people now again the military and the police have to ask themselves are you
[54:40.320 --> 54:45.600]  going to go with the offshore brokerage firms and banks that have openly stolen
[54:45.600 --> 54:50.960]  8.5 trillion just through the banker takeover and all these other brokerage

[54:54.840 --> 55:00.000]  billions of dollars that we know of separately they have destroyed us this
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.000]  is already irrevocable we're going to go into a depression the question is through
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.640]  that depression will they be able to grandstand as the saviors and bring in a
[55:09.640 --> 55:17.720]  police state and get everybody basically on a government mammary gland and again
[55:17.720 --> 55:20.800]  what did Henry Kissinger say what the club of Rome say what does the CFR say
[55:20.800 --> 55:23.960]  what does the security and prosperity partnership with the North American
[55:23.960 --> 55:27.520]  Union say over and over again in their documents that I cover an in-game and
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.800]  other films they say we will create a world financial crisis that will bring
[55:33.800 --> 55:38.520]  in our world government publicly with the banks openly running the planet and
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.600]  taxes paid directly to them that means you will pay carbon taxes and other
[55:42.600 --> 55:47.200]  taxes directly to the private banks the private intergroup the bank of England
[55:47.200 --> 55:53.880]  basically is what controls the world financial system and then they will issue
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.960]  bonds that have greater value than government bonds basically our government
[55:58.960 --> 56:03.040]  bonds again last week New York Times we are seeing amazing things the New York
[56:03.040 --> 56:08.600]  Times coming out and saying that you will buy your bonds not from the Treasury
[56:08.600 --> 56:12.080]  of England not from the Exchequer not from the Treasury in the US not from
[56:12.080 --> 56:16.040]  the German Treasury but from the Bundesbank from the Federal Reserve from
[56:16.040 --> 56:21.120]  the Bank of England oh it says Bank of England but it's not of the government
[56:21.120 --> 56:25.040]  of England it says Federal Reserve but it's not federal it says Bundesbank but
[56:25.040 --> 56:29.400]  it's not German it's not government they have been the government for a long
[56:29.400 --> 56:33.440]  time now they're just flexing their muscles and fully imploding the
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.800]  situation and they state that they are going to destroy the world's currencies
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.280]  and come out with a new global partially gold-backed currency you'll still have
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.760]  your nation's currency but it will be set every day by the central banks it
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.640]  will be a one-world currency controlled by them all currencies regulated and
[56:51.640 --> 57:00.360]  controlled by them and that they are then going to issue everyone a national ID
[57:00.360 --> 57:04.400]  card it's already globally standardized it's really a world ID card to track all
[57:04.400 --> 57:07.720]  your purchases everything you do there's going to be a worldwide sales tax
[57:07.720 --> 57:12.120]  they're going to have the income tax on top of it every purchase you make

[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:35.320]  knowledge and information a prisonplanet.tv membership you just go sign up
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:41.200]  yourself and create your own username and passcode and then with that username
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:45.960]  and passcode just you know create a simple username and passcode write that
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:50.600]  in a card and say hey this is a great online video subscription service with
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:54.320]  films and super high quality like Terror Storm and Endgame maybe even do a print
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:01:59.240]  out about each film and put it in the card and say you know this is your gift
[1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:01.880]  I hope you'll use it all you got to do is go to the site enter the username and
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:06.320]  passcode and you're in there thousands of pieces of media just a huge library of
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.480]  information and really the biggest one we've seen out there and in the highest
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.040]  quality and regardless even if they don't use it because I'd say 30-40%
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:19.480]  probably or just lazy or busy watching football or you know busy taking Prozac
[1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:24.240]  doesn't matter you've gotten a prisonplanet.tv membership because you
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:30.760]  can use the passcode as well six people can use the passcode that's how many and
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:37.840]  then it times out you can have six simultaneous users with your passcode so
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:42.560]  I hope you share it I mean in fact in fact you could buy a membership $5.95 a
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:48.120]  month do a trial $5.95 for a month give that passcode to five other people and
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:51.480]  then just explain to them they can't give it to anybody else or it'll time out
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:55.160]  the reason I can't give it to everybody is because we don't have the funds for
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:59.160]  the bandwidth you know we have it right now we're super high quality you know
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:03.480]  loads really fast streams and a whole bunch of different formats and we're
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:06.920]  going to get even bigger servers in the near future as long as the funds allow
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:11.400]  and so now you know we do encourage you to share it with a few folks and spread
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:17.320]  the gift of knowledge and information so again there's still time we're five
[1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:23.120]  days away from Christmas to get a card put the passcode in there or send
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:27.560]  somebody a Christmas card and then below it say here's your passcode here's your

[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:19.840]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:23.120]  red line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:26.960]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:30.280]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail
[1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:33.840]  out for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:38.440]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print $850 billion at least
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:42.440]  out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:46.200]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:50.240]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:54.440]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:58.720]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:02.480]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:06.200]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:09.800]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:14.080]  but chocolate prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be
[1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:18.000]  prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.280]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:25.480]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:28.440]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:31.640]  having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot
[1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:35.120]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:38.920]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:42.320]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:26.840]  probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:33.400]  the people are more
[1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:39.560]  perceptive to information to the truth than they have ever been in our history
[1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:50.560]  since 1775 1776 and I am seeing no exaggeration I've probably seen 20 or
[1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:58.480]  more top forecasters you know hedge fund owners you name it saying we're gonna
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:07:02.680]  have 1776 and there's gonna be a revolution in this country the IMF is
[1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:07.680]  saying it they're all saying it I don't see how the system is going to be able
[1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:13.680]  to to legitimately poses our saviors when it's clear to everyone that private
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:17.520]  banks of hijacked the country a long time ago they're now completely taking us
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:24.520]  down they are totally criminal they're all a bunch of made-offs I can't imagine
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:29.800]  how the police and the military and the public or anybody for that matter is
[1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:34.080]  going to go along with these guys into the dark night into the dungeons of the
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:39.280]  New World Order when we all know it's not in our best interest and that's why
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.080]  we got Bob Chapman the largest newsletter in the world until he retired back
[1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:45.960]  in the 90s now he's back one of the biggest in the world again the
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:49.880]  international forecaster.com he was at one time was the largest golden silver
[1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:53.680]  broker in the world and he's one of the grandfathers of the modern Patriot
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:57.480]  movement involved for 50 years he was Gary Allen's partner they put out an
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:01.160]  undare call a conspiracy which millions and millions of copies of that one out
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:08.040]  that's the thing that woke me up back in 1992 as I was a senior in high school
[1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:14.840]  and here he is with us he's just done so much worked with Jeopard Griffin and
[1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:19.000]  many others and he's no longer even in the United States he long time ago got
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.480]  out here saying this country is going to be completely imploded by the New World
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:25.960]  Order so Bob Chapman was also in military intelligence during the Cold War
[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:34.240]  before he got into brokerage Bob you know I was just mentioning the fact of how
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:38.200]  was the establishment going to be able to put perfume on this pig and sell it to
[1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:42.560]  us I mean when New York State's announcing 88 new taxes on soda drinks
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:48.600]  and food and iPods and I mean just other counties and cities and states
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:53.120]  hundreds of new taxes how are they going to get away with this why are they so
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:09:01.880]  mad dog crazy well of course the governor of New York inherited that job
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:08.120]  and the the damage it was done to the state economy like so many other state
[1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:15.040]  economies particularly California was done by predecessors poor planning too
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:24.960]  many employees too too much in their retirement plans in they were too generous
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:31.120]  let's put it that way I mean I know people who personally who are retiring
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:36.080]  from being offices and police departments that are going to get a hundred
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:40.960]  thousand dollars a year in retirement income and that to me is how can anybody
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:47.520]  how can any city or town afford such things or states of that matter I I
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:53.680]  think that there's going to be a tremendous discontent and I think the
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:10:00.160]  people in New York State who are very heads up people I think they're going
[1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:06.120]  to scream and yell and say hey look Wall Street and banking is what got us
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:09.840]  into this mess let them pay for it and so I think you're going to get a
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:16.600]  reaction and how far it'll carry remains to be seen but the people realize
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  exactly what you're saying and the receptivity towards the truth which is
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:29.680]  only coming to them from the alternative media such as our program and
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:37.600]  others like it and the newsletters but the people are listening and they're
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:46.400]  looking for answers and I think that the chances of we'll call it a fiscal
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:55.200]  revolt are great and I think that this thing you talk about that is perfumed
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:01.480]  and has lipstick I think that they're not going to be able to get away with it
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:09.720]  and I think when the American public finds out things like AIG and Bear
[1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:16.400]  Stearns and Fannie and Freddie and Citigroup these companies were burnt
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:23.400]  bankrupt years ago and people within government knew it the latest fiasco
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:32.840]  that you via name and that off I do not think it was a Ponzi scheme I think it's
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:40.280]  a scam and I've been in touch with people who also share my thoughts on that
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:46.200]  and it may come out that that's what it was and of course the SEC looked the
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:50.680]  other way well explain Bob Chapman what it means you know this is in the Ponzi
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:56.680]  scheme this is just outright theft outright theft I have a letter from a
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:01.760]  man who is a Jewish subscriber to my publication who brings me some
[1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:08.680]  unbelievable information and it's laid out in tomorrow's issue in a letter to
[1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:14.000]  the editor this actually sent me three letters and he's really upset because he
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:19.160]  says that the money has been funneled through Israeli discount for bank to
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:24.080]  Israel well of course it has this wasn't done by accident the SEC new years ago
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:28.360]  what he was doing and this is a classic thing Israel the Israeli elite do
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:34.680]  robbing their own trusting people that is one of their favorite tricks well he
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:39.240]  brings that out and it's even come out as you know for really upset well it's
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:43.880]  even come out in the Wall Street Journal that big international banks were
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:47.760]  working with Madoff and knew full well what he was doing and now you know that's
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:51.200]  why none of these banks or brokerage firms will have any transparency can
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:55.160]  you speak to that because because they're all involved in just you know not
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.200]  just selling bad securities or securitized debt derivatives they're
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:04.560]  just involved in money laundering gun running as you know some of the federal
[1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:12.320]  whistleblowers have said I mean this is just if they're outright criminals
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:18.720]  running things absolutely and you know you just looked like also as an adjunct
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:23.160]  to that you look at what's going on in Afghanistan it's the opening opium
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:29.880]  that's what it's all about a billions of dollars a year in profits hundreds
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:34.560]  hundreds of billions of dollars a year in profit so so 93% of the world's
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:39.160]  opium Bob let's continue along the lines though of Madoff and this is the
[1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:43.800]  founder of the New York of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in New York this is you
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:47.520]  know a top-level guy working with all the big brokerage firms and they knew
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:51.480]  exactly what he was doing because they're doing the same thing and I guess
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:55.000]  if we get mad and say we don't like you stealing all the money they'll just say
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:59.640]  hey meet the army you know meet the Marine Corps and the Army Marine Corps
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:02.560]  these guys aren't sophisticated enough the generals are crooks and know what
[1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:06.040]  they're doing they're not sophisticated enough you know to understand what's
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.720]  happening unless we tell them that's right and I mentioned that other program
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:15.720]  I go on with Drew Reigns and our entire audience is active and retired
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:20.760]  military people and oddly enough a number of people from the State Department
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:26.160]  and they know what's going on because we speak like you and I speak on this
[1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:30.800]  program about what's going on it's a whole revelation to these people and I've
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.720]  kept on doing the program because I'm trying to help these young men and women
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:41.280]  who have no financial experience on what to do like yesterday I'm going to
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:46.360]  re-enlist do you think I should do so and if I do what do I do with my bonus
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:51.720]  those kinds of questions and I'm there to try to help them okay Bob specifically
[1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:57.160]  with the Madoff give us more details I mean clearly there's been blurbs in the
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:00.920]  news that he was he was the front man for something larger and was funneling the
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:06.400]  money through foreign banks the Bank of Scotland and others overseas what's the
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:12.520]  evidence for this money going to Israel I don't have that and the person who sent
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:18.200]  me the information did not include that so I can't say I have to treat it as a
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:24.080]  rumor at this stage because I don't have a company document well I mean where
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:28.240]  where would the some news is saying 50 some news is saying a hundred billion of
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:32.560]  exposures but the banks won't talk I mean where would that money go I mean same
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:36.200]  with Enron we knew they were taking it out the back door before they imploded
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:41.800]  it I mean we know this money just isn't disappearing where did it go can't answer
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:48.080]  that I don't know with Enron or with this deal either I mean these people are
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:56.920]  pretty crafty they're not stupid and they're the the elite of the crooks Bob
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:16:01.680]  in in short how do you see this playing out you know Mac I keep asking that
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:05.080]  question of all the experts we have on how do you see this Bob Chapman how do
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:09.360]  you see this unfolding I think the public's gonna find out what they've done
[1:16:09.360 --> 1:16:15.200]  I don't think they can hide this one I think they're gonna get caught and that
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:20.240]  is going to make the American and international public even more jaded
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:27.680]  toward the finance and banking industries and I think you know there's
[1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:33.080]  going to be a howling from the public of where it'll go remains to be seen but
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:36.960]  maybe people will finally get up some gumption and go to Washington start
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:41.880]  banging on their congressman's doors and say look stop taking these payoffs from
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:46.920]  banking and and finance and insurance companies and represent us and if you
[1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:52.200]  don't do that yeah you know you're never gonna go back into office whether
[1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:56.040]  that'll work or not remains to be seen because the amount of money that's been
[1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:59.920]  given away and will continue to be given away through lobbyists and otherwise
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:05.040]  campaign contribution contributions is absolutely enormous Bob they've bought
[1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:10.760]  and paid for Bob as the police fired teachers city county state worker funds
[1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:16.280]  as they find out they've lost 30 40 50 60 percent you know university pension
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:20.560]  funds as they discover this what we're seeing them say is okay we'll just raise
[1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:24.760]  taxes to make up the difference greedily robbing what's left of the free
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:30.320]  market greedily having men in uniform go out and steal and squeeze it out of the
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:33.840]  public to pay themselves don't they understand that at a certain point it's
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:36.360]  all just going to collapse and the money's not even going to be worth
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:42.400]  anything yes they do and I think they're going to be able to find a way to get
[1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:46.720]  around that and I get news for them it's not going to work this time there's too
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:51.400]  many people who know what they're doing and when much more of the public finds
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:56.280]  out they're going to be in fence especially when they've lost their homes
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:03.280]  their cars and they're on the street absolutely Bob Chapman's our guest

[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:13.480]  specifically made off Suns reported him that never made sense to me but now it's
[1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:17.920]  making a little bit more sense because they knew the Ponzi scheme was going
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:22.600]  down they knew they wouldn't be held accountable the 50 billion the 50 billion
[1:23:22.600 --> 1:23:30.520]  plus the other banks won't talk about where it is and this individual who you
[1:23:30.520 --> 1:23:35.480]  say's got a insight on this continue tell folks what you told me during the
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:42.520]  break well he calls it a Meyer Lansky scheme and the the person who wrote
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:48.880]  these two are is Jewish and so it it lends to me much more credence than
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:52.600]  normal and he's been great at coming up with information in the past on other
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:58.160]  issues rumor has it that the main directors of Madoff's firm all had
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:03.120]  fraud insurance policies with loads of London a Madoff criminal indictment was
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:08.520]  necessary in order to activate the fraud insurance coverage rumor has that that
[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:12.960]  both of Madoff's sons were in on it also rumor has that that the judge he
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:18.040]  appeared before was enlightened as to what was really going on the made idea
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:23.240]  here is that Madoff is trying to steal the same money twice is skilled man
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:28.800]  malpractice of the highest order so it is not really a Ponzi scheme no mistakes
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:34.560]  were made it was more like a Maya Lansky scheme everything is going exactly to
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:39.840]  plan so that's like Silverstein with the 911 attacks and then he collects $9
[1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:46.520]  billion off of the attacks exactly off of a $200 million investment and he goes
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:50.720]  on to say that Madoff actually stole closer to a hundred billion and that
[1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:55.840]  most of this money is still intact in Israel as your it was per your recent
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:59.960]  reporting regarding the Russian oligarchs which are actually the Rothschild
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:05.440]  oligarchs also rumor has it that most of the Jewish charities claiming to have
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:09.520]  been swindled by Madoff have offices in Israel and that they'd be it being
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:14.800]  notified that the money they claim he stole is immediately available to them
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:19.760]  in Israel it is further rumored that the so-called Hollywood celebrity clients
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:24.800]  that were defrauded would be made good from Israeli sources that in many of
[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:28.640]  these Hollywood victims who are told in advance by Madoff that their money was
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:33.760]  being transferred to Israel because the USA was going down there are also rumors
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:40.160]  that they in the EU banking circles that only misunderstandings between them and
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:45.720]  Madoff would be made good Michael McKasey's son he's the head of the
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:52.840]  Justice Department is the lead lawyer for Madoff's key operative so as per your
[1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:57.400]  recent reporting we are looking at three to five years from Madoff are
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:01.400]  possibly a paid for pardon by Bush before he leaves office well we know
[1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:05.440]  that's what's happening and we know Madoff went out there and is robbing you
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:12.680]  know low-level charities pension funds Jewish groups but the media is not
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:16.240]  discussing or debating where this money even went and now they're saying the
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:19.640]  US government may come in and bail out the investors so they would be double
[1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:23.240]  paid the money goes to Israel they get paid to the back channel and then they
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:27.440]  get paid by the US government on top of it with taxpayer money it gets even
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:33.800]  better room a hazard that Madoff made all of his so-called Ponzi scheme money
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:39.320]  disappear via the New York City branch of the Israeli discount bank which is
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:43.600]  owned and controlled by the Bromperman family the key pins of the Zionist
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:49.160]  Matrix were all involved in the scam to make money disappear Madoff was
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:53.040]  National Treasurer of the American Jewish Congress and also the New York City
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:58.200]  branch of Yeshiva University his big buddy at Yeshiva was a guy named Psy
[1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:05.400]  Sims actually Mearns who also happens to be a director in Kingpin and the Israel
[1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:10.360]  Discount Bank of New York Madoff was chairman of the Sims Business School at
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:16.560]  Yeshiva University with his partner Psy Sims Mearns Israel Discount Bank is at
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:22.120]  the epic epic center of the 9-11 funding food chain along with the
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:27.160]  Bromperman family in the Mossad all these fanatical Zionists involved in the
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:34.200]  9-11 atrocity see 9-11 as a crimes of Zionist Patriots type event like the
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:38.040]  blowing up of the King David Hotel it was full of hundreds of sleeping British
[1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:42.760]  soldiers at the time that they did in order to further the interest of Israel
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:48.720]  the expense of the United States and the 3,000 victims of 9-11 who came from 72
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:54.320]  countries as I do not see this as addition or as treason and as such all

[1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:45.960]  many others that are patiently holding but I wanted to ask you before we do
[1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:50.920]  that every week or two another brokerage firm goes under another mega bank goes
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:56.720]  under scores a little banks go under or banks that are solvent are bought up by
[1:31:56.720 --> 1:32:01.720]  the crime syndicate what is the next shoe to drop have you gotten any more
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:08.120]  intel on dollar devaluation bank holidays in February or March of next
[1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:14.320]  year well I got a letter this morning from someone who works for a company in
[1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:21.560]  Chicago a subscriber and he said that anything that the Fed does or the
[1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:27.680]  Treasury does in relation to new currency new bills and it has to be run
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:32.360]  through them first because they have to do certain things to make it happen and
[1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:36.080]  they were waiting for a new hundred dollar bill that comes through but that
[1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:41.280]  was put off indefinitely but what he says is there's nothing on the plate so
[1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:46.600]  to speak at the moment and I've been hearing rumors from people that perhaps
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:56.680]  in after mr. Obama becomes president that there might be a a financial event
[1:32:56.680 --> 1:33:02.360]  where they might devalue the dollar and use something else but he says you know
[1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:07.000]  if they're going to do something else it's got to come through us and there's
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:12.280]  nothing on the agenda well I want to be clear I want to be clear though in the
[1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:16.000]  mainstream news a few weeks ago when they had their Bretton Woods to they
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.920]  stated that they're still going to keep all the same currencies it's just that
[1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:24.120]  the governments are going to agree to devalue them all in unison together so
[1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:31.040]  that would be digital money that that's true and that could very well happen at
[1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:37.120]  that time and so speaking in terms of just dollars would be incorrect based
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:44.280]  upon that in logic and that would be you know 64 and a half percent of all the
[1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:50.560]  reserves of all the countries are in us dollars so the dollars devalued everybody
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:58.520]  else gets devalued at the same time so there could be a simultaneous devaluation
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:04.560]  of all currencies whether it'll they'll go to a digital matrix remains to be
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:12.920]  seen what else do you see unfolding in the economy in the short term and
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:19.480]  incidentally I don't think that that's going to happen in January you know my
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:26.200]  reasoning and logic and research tells me that things got to get worse before
[1:34:26.200 --> 1:34:30.920]  they pull that and so I think that that's down the road but it's certainly on
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:36.040]  their agenda to like you say what's happening here I think after the first
[1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:41.520]  of the year the stock market will go lower golden silver will go higher there's
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:49.920]  going to be more scandals city group is bankrupt it's my guess that JP Morgan
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:57.480]  chases as well and Goldman Sachs and all of these monies that the Fed won't tell
[1:34:57.480 --> 1:35:01.680]  anybody where the money went or what they received in collateral even on court
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:07.640]  order that shows you their arrogance that all went to the banks and of course
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:12.840]  they paid their bonuses and a dividend and fatten their balance sheets and they
[1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:16.760]  are still making loans to their best clients well that's the issue I mean
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:21.320]  that's the issue the Federal Reserve is openly on the news saying we're above
[1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:25.880]  the law we rule the United States will issue our own t-bills you know
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:29.160]  everything will be sacrificed including the US Treasury looks like they may go
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:34.520]  ahead and have it you know be downgraded in its credit rating and then many
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:40.040]  people should be praising us I mean we've been exposing everything that would
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.320]  happen everything that would unfold with total precision we told them that the
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:48.840]  public they were gearing up the military to be used against the American people
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:55.040]  and now they are announcing and you know that's the that's the crux of the
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:58.480]  issue when they're really getting ready to use the military in a big way against
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:01.880]  the people they have to come out and announce it and spend it and say it's a
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:05.760]  good thing they can't just have them like out of a jack-in-the-box suddenly
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:11.000]  appear they have to do you know some groundwork preparing the public and for
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.600]  decades they've been quietly preparing and acclimating the public and now
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:21.160]  they're launching it on us Bob that tells me we're going into D-Day here well I
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:25.360]  think it's going to take more troops at home I think troops are going to be
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:30.840]  transferred from Iraq not only here in the United States so to speak but also to
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:34.960]  Afghanistan because I think they're going to widen that war deeply into
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:40.320]  Pakistan and Iran still is not off the table the Israelis want to go after
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:45.600]  them because they want to expand in the Middle East and so you have all these
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:51.440]  configurations going on and at the same time if they do do that a distraction if
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:57.320]  you may a very expensive one not only in money but in in lives they'll have a
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:03.320]  draft and they'll do that to get the young fighters off of the streets and so I
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:08.920]  think those things are going to happen before troops are used in the United
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:13.160]  States and and total depression sets in so you're talking about two or three
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:17.440]  years out still this is just more of the preparatory phase year to two years out
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:22.400]  it you know we'll be able to tell by what they do what their actions are well
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:26.880]  by the way Bob Bob this is not your opinion what you're just saying for
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:31.360]  decades they've been quietly preparing for civilian youth corps and a domestic
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:37.960]  military force Clinton Bush and then now Obama and he's on record and so is his
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:42.440]  chief of staff who's openly a foreign agent publicly they're so arrogant
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:47.760]  they're saying everyone will serve the old the young there's going to be an
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:51.200]  elder core there's going to be a green core there's going to be a million
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:56.160]  person military style spy core and they're open and people will need jobs so
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:38:00.200]  they're going to be drafted conscripted brought into this and they'll find the
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:03.680]  nutcases and criminals and control freaks they need to enforce it so this is a
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:08.280]  nightmare what I call almost Soviet style thing that they're planning to set up
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:12.040]  so what you just said I'm just backing it up that's what they're saying they're
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:18.240]  going to do well I think that that is exactly what they want to do but the
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:23.440]  timing is what we're talking about and I don't know I just think it's going to
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:29.480]  be longer and it all depends on how the events unfold they can't control
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:34.160]  everything the things that happen that they can't control a good example was
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:39.040]  year ago June when Meredith Whitney come out and said city banks assets not
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:43.960]  what they should be and I'm not I'm taking a buy off the stock and I think it
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:47.360]  will go lower well let's start at the credit crisis everybody started to look
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:51.800]  at everybody's books and say hey you know they're all like that they're all
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:56.040]  broke and that's what happened that's what got this whole ball rolling but not
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:39:00.920]  for one second did power structure behind government the Illuminati did they
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:04.800]  think that somebody like her would step forward and say hey the emperors got no
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:10.800]  clothes on but Bob there's more than that I mean again we infiltrated
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:14.240]  Bilderberg almost three years ago and they were planning to pop the subprime
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:18.360]  mortgage and have a global consolidation a global crisis where they could then
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:23.320]  quote offer the solution I even have a Henry Kissinger clip where he just said
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:27.720]  it again last night on Charlie Rose or two nights ago was posted on Google last
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:32.080]  night where he says this great crisis will help bring in our new world order
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:37.600]  and we've seen them laying the groundwork for all of this and we saw them eight
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:40.080]  weeks ago almost nine weeks ago come out and say we're going to have a
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:45.600]  depression and when the president and and and the president you know to be
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:50.160]  elect he was a president like yet Obama said the same thing and the head of the
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:53.280]  Treasury and the head of the Fed said that that finally was the coup de
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:56.920]  gras that destroyed confidence they knew what they were doing when they did
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:01.560]  that I mean they knew they could get the yes vote in Congress they didn't need to
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:06.080]  do that so they want to plunge us into this I mean I think this may be a area
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:09.960]  where we disagree because because I've seen the IMF and World Bank documents I
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:12.840]  know you've seen them they've done this in third world nation for third world
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:19.320]  nation I mean they engineer these things or do we disagree no we don't
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:24.120]  disagree it's just timing and I just don't know how quickly that can happen
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:29.280]  and the way I see it at the moment it's at least six months away but they can
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.920]  expedite it maybe they'll have a devaluation like you you've talked
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:37.560]  about they're saying they may do that I mean that's in the news that's right
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:43.840]  and so they may do it in January or they may do it in June we just don't know
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:49.720]  but what would be the underlying premise is that is their intention to do it as
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:53.080]  quickly as possible why are they telegraphing I mean hundreds of world
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:58.760]  leaders from Colin Powell to vice president elect Joe Biden saying it's
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:01.600]  gonna be horrible you're not gonna like it it's gonna be unpopular with the
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:06.000]  left and the right but just get ready and and the Obama's saying I am the
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:10.480]  change you know you me physically but you're not gonna like the change it's
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:15.240]  gonna be sacrifice and his bewildered zombies are still just smiling up at him
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:18.720]  like poor pathetic dogs that are about to have a bullet put in their head you
[1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:24.320]  know on the back 40 I mean what are these horrible things that they're getting
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:28.280]  us ready for or or are they just telegraphing to their minions hey you
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:33.720]  need to get prepared and get get in a position I think it's probably both and
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:40.160]  it's acclimation it's brainwashing people to get ready to accept something
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:46.120]  pretty nasty and at the same time signal the others who aren't in the core of
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:51.720]  planning and thinking that hey this thing's getting ready to come down Ron
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:55.400]  Paul said on this show two days ago it's in an article on info wars.net by
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:41:59.200]  Steve Watson governments that want to take over undermine our liberties and
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:02.440]  gain more power always use a fair factor they did that leading up to the war in
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.000]  Iraq they do it on foreign policy now they're doing it on monetary economic
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:09.520]  and financial problems and he went on to say that this could lead directly to
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:15.440]  fascism that they plan to nationalize basically all of the major industries to
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:18.880]  fully control the population so you won't really have a quote government
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:25.960]  job officially but but the government will be signing your paychecks agreed
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:31.160]  that's what Congress is saying I think it's already well underway and it
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:36.080]  started in the banking and finance industry and that's what Congress is
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.920]  having hearings every week for the last month and a half they're saying oh to
[1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:44.200]  save your pension funds to save your 401ks we will take them over and then
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:48.240]  they say tax them reduce the amount you get and then give you a pit in the back
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:52.720]  so so I guess is all these things go belly up by design it's all just handed
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:57.920]  over to the government and that's part of why they're taking stock and the
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:02.840]  companies that they're nationalizing good God and they create the money and
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:09.800]  credit and continue to give it to say city corp and an AIG etc and they keep
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:12.920]  on getting a larger and larger piece of the company so the government owns a
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:16.320]  company Bob don't they know that they can't you know put hundreds of new
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:19.880]  taxes on everybody when we don't have it and then just send SWAT teams to take
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:24.560]  our houses I mean don't they know don't the cops know that they are gonna get
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:30.840]  crushed between the public and and and the cockroach elite they serve I don't
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:36.400]  think the that the law enforcement realizes some do but most don't they
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:42.880]  just think they're doing a job and I hope to listening to the program so they
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:47.440]  can find out that there is other reasons why they're being trained to do
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:52.440]  things that they don't normally do and they better watch out because it's not a
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.760]  big good spot to be in but see that shows the premeditated nature not just that
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:43:59.640]  we have the documents of the cops in military won't go check articles I
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:03.400]  wrote ten years ago or five years ago or six months ago and all of it has come
[1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:07.000]  true and won't see that I'm just telling you what the establishment war planners
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:11.440]  are planning at least you know think well why have we been trained for riot
[1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:15.360]  control and for financial collapse years ago if this is just some organic
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:20.120]  thing that just started they have set this whole thing up I think the only
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:24.480]  debate we can have is whether or not they've now lost control and I think
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:27.920]  there is some evidence that they are losing control because as things fall
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:31.680]  apart you've got this criminal class of white-collar criminals running the New
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:36.040]  World Order and they're just all greedily stealing and grabbing whatever they
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:41.320]  can to protect themselves well just mad off situation can blow it right wide
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:45.760]  open and I think they're gonna get caught I think the revelations are
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:52.840]  going to come out and if you I'm sure that you noticed that 12 years ago all
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:58.320]  of this was brought to the attention of the FCC and they did nothing of course
[1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:07.240]  and then and then early in the 21st century the woman who was taken over as
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:17.080]  the head of the CF of the FCC Mary can't think of her name at the second she
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:25.240]  had hired one a matter of sons and so you know this incestuousness goes on
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:30.280]  and on how obvious does it have to get as the establishment is totally criminal
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:34.680]  a bunch of criminals on record stealing everything in front of us and in
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:38.400]  threatening the public with the military and the police if we don't acquiesce to
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:42.080]  it this is insane let's take some calls Clark just hung up in Arkansas so let's
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:46.440]  go to Michael in Illinois than Alan Dave Mark Ronnie and others you're on the

[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:12.320]  doing around the nation and what I'm doing is fighting for a new law that got
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:16.240]  passed in the state of Illinois where perpetrators of rape are paying a
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:21.960]  lifetime long-term care for victims and I'm bringing awareness about this and
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:27.640]  I've called state-to-state the coalition are well see me ma'am ma'am send me some
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:35.000]  information at at info wars.com thank you I appreciate that call let's talk to
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:39.920]  Alan in Oregon Alan you're on the air welcome hey thanks for taking my call
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:43.920]  Alex thanks for calling I've been listening to you for a few years now
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:50.200]  and following you pretty closely and prison planet TV member I was wondering
[1:46:50.200 --> 1:46:54.480]  if you could maybe elaborate on something I've been researching and I
[1:46:54.480 --> 1:47:00.600]  found that on the bank for international settlements the central bank and forum
[1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:05.640]  for all the central banks Bernanke sits on their board as well as Timothy Geithner
[1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:10.800]  the newly appointed Obama Treasury Secretary then you go over to the World
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:16.120]  Bank and you've got US governor of the World Bank Hank Paulson and then at the
[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:21.640]  IMF you've got Hank Paulson as the US governor as well as Bernanke as his
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:26.320]  as his alternate and then explain how this works well okay let me hear a
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:32.720]  question was what is your take on that and then if you could maybe tell me that
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:36.760]  document that you were mentioning yesterday 2001 IMF document that predicts
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:41.280]  the writing I'd love to look that up I haven't been able to find it okay it's
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:46.600]  it's the BBC and a bunch of other newspapers reported in late 2001 Greg
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:50.560]  Palace was one of them News Night which is the equivalent of their nightline did
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:56.200]  a hour-long TV show on it thousands of pages of documents came out BBC released
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:02.560]  a few dozen pages of it and then was had injunctions put on them because it was
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:06.400]  internal not to release any more of it but then I interviewed Palace who saw
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:11.560]  all of them and it was just how they go in and implode economies by design how
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:16.360]  they want to destroy middle classes how they want to cause economic degradation
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:21.400]  that then causes rioting so that total confidence is lost and then martial law
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:25.800]  can be declared and then yeah that's how it works you have these private central
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:30.320]  banks of the world owned by a handful of families and then they all sit in the
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:34.000]  international regulatory bodies and the international make of settlements is
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:38.840]  kind of the arbiter between some of the different factions and then they take our
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:44.720]  tax money out of the Western world and go and loan it to third world nations to
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:49.080]  then get them into debt say a billion dollar investment of our tax money in
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:55.000]  Nigeria turns into 45 billion with interest so I mean there that's the
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:00.760]  international banking system I'm not really sure about your question okay
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:05.680]  well that's that seems thumbs it up I can look up that let me give you the
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:11.320]  actual headline of one article World Bank documents consume Argentina all right
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:14.000]  we'll be back with Bob Chapman stay with us more your phone calls straight

[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:39.440]  that it just it's incredible to be aware to know what's going on to be
[1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:48.160]  concerned and then to realize that the general public on average knows
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:50.920]  something's wrong and knows the crooks from the government but they have no
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:55.920]  idea just how serious or just how bad it really is just thank God we've got our
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:52:59.960]  guns because they would do what they did in the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or
[1:52:59.960 --> 1:53:02.920]  communist China and we didn't have the guns they just come in and start
[1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:05.760]  murdering everybody and if you think the US is any different in the other
[1:53:05.760 --> 1:53:10.600]  country got nothing coming they would just absolutely have their way with us
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:13.800]  if it wasn't for the fact that three or four percent of the population is
[1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:17.640]  ready to get into a shooting war and the establishment knows that and they're
[1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:22.480]  gonna probably go ahead and go for broke because they're so arrogant and I just
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:26.080]  feel sorry for the stupid thugs and we're trying to enforce it because you
[1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:29.280]  put people's back up against the wall and they don't have any choice they're
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:32.960]  gonna they're gonna stand up against you in a big way we're talking to Bob
[1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:38.680]  Chapman right now and we're taking folks phone calls right now let's go ahead
[1:53:38.680 --> 1:53:44.720]  and who's up next John I got a big call list here Mark in Texas you're on the
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:49.680]  air Mark welcome thanks Alex really really appreciate what you do and I
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:53.400]  always like to try to tune in when Bob's present and Bob I just say a great big
[1:53:53.400 --> 1:53:57.840]  hello for you and thanks for your advice you're always spot on just keep
[1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:07.920]  doing what you're doing Bob well we do what I'm doing well you make it
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:11.040]  possible for others to keep doing what they're doing so from our own little
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:15.120]  corner of the world we're doing it and I appreciate it well thank you so much
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:19.400]  sir anything else no I usually have plenty to say but for some strange
[1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:22.320]  reason must be because I'm talking to Bob and you at the same time I can't
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:26.160]  seem to come up with anything hey listen that happens me all the time I've got
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:29.840]  so much going on in my head so many questions so many points that I'm
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:33.880]  almost speechless because it's so over the top to have private banks running
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:38.560]  the military who are offshore openly destroying your nation laughing at you
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:42.800]  it it makes my head spin but we've just got to continue to fight forward and
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:45.680]  try to reach out to as many people as we can and then I can't believe that the
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:50.480]  whole population doesn't just rise up I mean this is so off the chart but again
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:54.120]  it's been done incrementally so the public's been trained to take almost any
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:55:01.480]  insult let's talk to Ronnie in Texas you are on the air with Bob Chapman thank
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:07.600]  you sirs and thank you for having Dr. Paul on this Wednesday and actually
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:11.680]  quoting from him today and as well as Bob Chapman here and that's really
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:17.600]  fantastic and I want I wanted to mention to you mr. Chapman is about what you
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:22.840]  said the Meyer-Lansky scheme and you kind of defined it as everything is going
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:29.520]  exactly as planned and that was very indicative of or it reminded me of this
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:33.960]  book that I'm trying to share with others that is the final judgment the
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:39.880]  missing link in the JFK conspiracy assassination by Michael Collins Piper and
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:44.320]  I'm wondering if you've read it you actually Alex Jones here that today
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:48.680]  mentioned one of our inadvertently mentioned the Judas Goats which is the
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:53.240]  title to another one of Michael Collins Piper's books but oh god I wish I
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:55.640]  wouldn't have done that he'll claim I'm attacking him or something look I
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:59.880]  appreciate your call it's so crazy I had somebody call it to the day and say
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:02.560]  why are you talking bad about and I don't even know what you're talking
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:07.960]  about you know I say Judas Goat and I'm talking about somebody or I I I said
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:11.400]  Ted Anderson's offering gold deals so good it'll destroy his competition I had
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:15.200]  two gold broker companies call and say why are you trying to destroy us and I
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:20.080]  said I'm not talking about you it's a figure of speech good God and Judas
[1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:24.560]  Goat is a very old term you know dealing with somebody leading somebody into
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:29.040]  the slaughter but yeah answering his question specifically if you know what
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:39.720]  he's talking about Bob yes I I know of the books and I've read them and they're
[1:56:39.720 --> 1:56:44.920]  very revealing and that's about it all right thank you so much I'll be attacked

[1:58:59.720 --> 1:59:03.800]  seem like it's connected but I you know you're talking about the attack on the
[1:59:03.800 --> 1:59:10.800]  middle class I had a van to where I became aware curiously of the absolute
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:16.240]  attack on the look on the poor I've been trying to get word to you Alex but I'm
[1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:21.160]  glad Bob's here because I think there's a kind of a connection I put up a
[1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:29.320]  website called gassingamerica.com and what that's exposing is an attack on
[1:59:29.320 --> 1:59:33.820]  the very poorest of society what what what we call the disposables and tell
[1:59:33.820 --> 1:59:38.560]  us what's happening well I had a family contact me with a definitely ill child I
[1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:43.520]  diagnosed it investigated beyond the medical profession which seems to be
[1:59:43.520 --> 1:59:48.720]  complicit with this they stand you know a lot of what's going on I don't have a
[1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:53.880]  lot of time to tell me the family was being poisoned by carbon monoxide and
[1:59:53.880 --> 2:00:01.600]  it's by design HUD has placed a regulation in place where people living in
[2:00:01.600 --> 2:00:06.640]  manufactured or mobile homes and that's the low end of society or the poorest
[2:00:06.640 --> 2:00:12.480]  they are being poisoned by deliberation with fumes coming from their furnaces
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:18.040]  and right now I'm in a panic because Native Americans vets and everybody poor
[2:00:18.040 --> 2:00:22.760]  people blacks the Katrina people are being poisoned because a fresh air
[2:00:22.760 --> 2:00:27.280]  opening is three feet away from the exhaust of the furnace look on the
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:31.200]  website I've been trying to get you to look at that Alex well yeah listen I
[2:00:31.200 --> 2:00:34.960]  appreciate your call I'll check it out it sounds interesting so many times
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:40.640]  regulations that bureaucrats make up so that they're in charge end up causing
[2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:43.760]  serious problems in society I don't know if they're trying to gas people by
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:49.360]  design with deadly carbon monoxide but I do know that 43 percent of Native
[2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:53.520]  Americans were sterilized just in the 70s under George Herbert Walker Bush's
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:00:57.240]  program that he started under Richard Nixon and that's on record and I know
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:04.640]  the CBC reports they are killings Indian children at these reservations and at
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:07.960]  these government homes for them and they and when they're caught they say well
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:12.600]  we're supposed to do it you know this is eugenics so yes look the government is
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:16.120]  predatory it's trying to police and military to hate the public it is a
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:20.640]  group of criminal predators carrying out criminal activities against us Bob
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:27.360]  Chapman I agree completely and it's getting worse and worse each and every
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:36.760]  day it's just yesterday I saw a picture in the the Arizona Republic of military
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:44.680]  people full gear and weaponry working with police similarly units and so you're
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:49.560]  absolutely right it's just an ongoing in the large inning thing well it's worse
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:53.800]  than that the the Arizona operation includes troops from eight other nations
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:58.200]  they have foreign troops and it's in major newspapers that they will use
[2:01:58.200 --> 2:02:01.920]  foreign troops against the American people and they're hiring foreigners for
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:06.560]  the military private mercenaries and aggravated felons you cannot make up
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:11.000]  tyranny that bad I mean it looks like they're trying to just do the most evil
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:18.520]  takeover in history Bob it certainly is again a pack of psychopathic criminals

[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:13.840]  now on the side stay with us
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:19.320]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:22.600]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:26.160]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:29.440]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:33.280]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:36.280]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:40.160]  bailout for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:43.680]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty
[2:03:43.680 --> 2:03:47.600]  billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:51.800]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:55.760]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:00.440]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:04.440]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:08.680]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:12.520]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:16.120]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:20.280]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:24.320]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:28.000]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.160]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:35.080]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a

[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:50.280]  Network my great crew here in mission control in Austin Texas and John Harman
[2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:56.800]  up in Minnesota we're getting April Gallup on either sunday or monday we had
[2:06:56.800 --> 2:07:03.760]  her on the show if you remember about four or five months ago and we raised
[2:07:03.760 --> 2:07:10.280]  money for her on the air for so she could sue the federal government you know
[2:07:10.280 --> 2:07:14.880]  for basically staging the terror attacks and she's got a very very strong case she
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:18.840]  was inside the Pentagon and so we're going to be covering some of that with
[2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:23.720]  Richard Gage in the next 50 minutes as well Richard Gage a few years ago founded
[2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:29.200]  I guess about a year and a half ago architects and engineers for 9-11 truth
[2:07:29.200 --> 2:07:33.920]  and he's gotten hundreds and hundreds of members of architects and engineers
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:38.320]  structural engineers to join his organization there also other
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:42.760]  organizations with hundreds of members of scientists and physicists and others
[2:07:42.760 --> 2:07:48.440]  coming out and showing that clearly a building 7 and tower 1 and 2 on 9-11
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:54.200]  were controlled demolitions and now mr. Gage and many others have been
[2:07:54.200 --> 2:08:00.680]  vindicated because NIST latest report has had to admit that there was freefall
[2:08:00.680 --> 2:08:04.680]  involved they denied that in building 7 freefall falling at the speed of gravity
[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:08.920]  as Richard has always said they tried to spend it and claim 14 seconds now they've
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:13.480]  had to cut that in half and they're admitting that it did fall at freefall
[2:08:13.480 --> 2:08:19.280]  speeds and so again the scientific questions are making a lot of scholarly
[2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:22.960]  individuals with a lot of letters but behind their name look at the raw data
[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:26.320]  architects and engineers and scholars around 11 truth and many others have
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:33.560]  gotten published reports in peer-reviewed journals detailing their findings and
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:36.400]  some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals out there have
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:42.720]  found their findings to be conclusive and he's fresh back from a tour of Europe
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:47.360]  to crowds of hundreds and in some cases thousands of people he's also spoken in
[2:08:47.360 --> 2:08:51.320]  New Jersey and New York you know brought into town by by police officers and
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:56.480]  others to talk to folks and he's gone through a lot of attacks to bring you
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:01.400]  this information so I want to salute Richard Gage for all his fine work and
[2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:05.440]  commend him another example of what a highly motivated focus professional
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:09.960]  person can do in the defense of not just this republic but in the defense of
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:13.640]  those that were murdered on 9-11 and now the millions that have died around the
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:18.080]  world in the war on terror of the million-plus Iraqis that have died in the
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:23.760]  name of that lie and false flag is now a household term self-inflicted womb and
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:28.520]  wound is now part of the nomenclature and now it comes out in major
[2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:32.600]  publications that Cheney wanted to stage terror attacks on US ships just six
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:36.320]  months ago as a pretext to attack Iran thank God the military got the word out
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:40.760]  and stopped that and we now know that's why Admiral Fallon resigned he was not
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:46.320]  going to be part of attacking US ships with fake Iranian patrol boats so a lot
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:50.720]  is happening and the truth is coming out an international television in England
[2:09:50.720 --> 2:09:58.160]  in Germany in Japan in Russia in the Middle East or in in in just all over
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:02.680]  the world are airing well-produced shows showing the evidence that 9-11 wasn't
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:07.120]  inside job so we are winning this fight and one of the frontline warriors one of
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:10.600]  the most successful getting the truth out has been Richard gauge so Richard
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:14.960]  good to have you with us thank you Alex it's just great to be with you again I
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:19.800]  can't tell you I'm really excited well we've gone over the the evidence of
[2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:23.320]  control demolition in all three of the towers and not just the eyewitnesses but
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:28.400]  the scientific evidence but can you recap the last six months since you were
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:33.240]  on with us what has happened with NIST NIST having to go back on their
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:39.160]  previous reports and where the scientific investigation is right now yes
[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:45.400]  well NIST came out with their draft report of World Trade Center 7 the
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:50.720]  third high-rise that came down not hit by an airplane came down in the
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:57.280]  afternoon about 5 20 on 9 11 and we'll talk about how it came down but seven
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:03.480]  years later finally we have a draft report in August in which they they
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:08.760]  try to document that it was 40 percent of gravity that the building came down
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:16.840]  now upon questions by physicist David Chandler and scientist Dr. Stephen Jones
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:22.600]  they publicly had to backtrack and fumble their way through the the conference
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:28.120]  and in their final report which just came out in November last month they
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:34.720]  acknowledge that in the first two and a quarter seconds this 47-story building
[2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:45.120]  drops at freefall speed which is eight stories now prior to this and in August
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:50.560]  they said publicly that it couldn't have fallen freefall speed because had it
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:53.880]  that would mean the structure would have there would have been no structure and
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:58.680]  so now they're acknowledging freefall speed but they're not saying well there
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:02.800]  must not have been structure there in other words what they're basically
[2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:09.240]  acknowledging to the 9-11 truth movement in the world is that the structure
[2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:15.640]  had to have been removed for those eight stories because a building cannot fall
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:20.440]  at freefall speed and convert all of its gravitational potential energy
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:27.640]  to kinetic energy and do any other work it can't crush the 40,000 tons of steel
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:31.960]  that was in the building that was designed to resist any type of collapse
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:37.920]  and again this was the FEMA command bunker overbuilt for strength CIA FBI
[2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:42.840]  Defense Intelligence more than 20 secretive federal agencies based there
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:50.440]  their largest section offices outside of Virginia and Maryland in the world well
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:56.400]  that was on the 23rd floor yes it was a very highly secure bunker with complete
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:02.600]  with the all that they needed in the way of electricity water and back up
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:08.400]  electricity reinforced windows against all kinds of hurricane and so forth but
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:14.640]  all of this was abandoned on the morning of 9-11 for tripod to a terror attack
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:19.560]  drill they had already moved out abandoned they'd already moved out the
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:24.560]  night before most of their operations out of the pier as FEMA said because they
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:31.320]  were doing a top-off to drill a tripod to drill for a terror attack yes we
[2:13:31.320 --> 2:13:35.560]  understand that there were hundreds of FEMA employees the day before 9-11 in
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:40.800]  preparation for a mock biochemical attack in downtown Manhattan and we are
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:46.800]  wondering if that is just a coincidence or not but the 550 architects and
[2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:51.640]  engineers who are demanding a real investigation do try to stick with the
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:56.320]  technical evidence that we're not conspiracy theorists so we really do want
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:00.920]  others to investigate these matters and we're glad that you're one of them
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:05.320]  let's talk about that matter next of the 550 and now a year and a half joining
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:08.880]  your group and how it's growing exponentially but before we go there
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:13.560]  I'm not an architect I'm not an engineer but you know this is the main show that
[2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:16.280]  brought up the building seven controversy day one I remember hearing the
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:19.640]  news as I was driving in my car back to the studio saying they're gonna bring
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:23.120]  building seven down the Solomon brothers they're gonna have a control
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:26.960]  demolition so it doesn't damage other buildings other people remember those
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:32.200]  reports the false reports BBC Fox CNN reporting it had fallen before it fell
[2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:37.600]  but I wanted to be specific here you know watching what what Nista said first
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:40.600]  they said free falls impossible because that would have to be explosives only
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:44.680]  explosives can you know do that because as it falls it takes time to crush you
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:50.000]  know the next level and you know the basic science shows that but we have
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:53.600]  footage now of the entire building falling they love to show a video from
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:57.480]  you know a mile away with a building in the way we only see the first you know
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:01.760]  25 stories or so because the other 20-something stories are below the
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:06.200]  field of view but in the other videos we've timed it and you know it is
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:11.000]  falling in a little more than six seconds I mean you can take your watch
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:16.440]  you can time it and you know that's how fast it falls so even this now backing
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:20.720]  off and saying okay for a few seconds it was at freefall it looks as if that is
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:27.600]  another deception well I don't follow you they acknowledge the free fall but
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:31.400]  they are certainly are being deceptive about the implications of that well not
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:35.080]  just that they're saying that the free fall was only partial but when I watch
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:39.800]  the videos it's a continual free fall not just of age stories but 47 oh oh
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:45.280]  yeah no it actually does slow down I encourage your listeners to look at the
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:50.120]  10-minute video that says it's piling up at the bottom yeah it begins to slow
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:55.160]  down after about two and a half seconds just slightly it is almost free fall for
[2:15:55.160 --> 2:16:00.360]  the next two three seconds and then it slows down a little bit more so it is
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:04.800]  very close to to free fall all the way you would expect that as it actually did
[2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:08.440]  meet resistance they blow the four floors out it falls in on the rubble and
[2:16:08.440 --> 2:16:12.400]  then you finally do have some slowing yes they're counting on the weight of
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:16.880]  the building to be harnessed to do most of the destruction so we we have
[2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:21.560]  witnesses who have heard explosions at the base of the building presumably those
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:26.440]  lower eight floors we don't really know a real investigation would get at the
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:31.000]  heart of this and also to how they might have planted such explosives but we do
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:36.360]  know that the lobby they had access to the lobby they which is not occupied they
[2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:40.880]  had access to the fifth and sixth floor which is mechanical floors complete
[2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:45.520]  access and through the elevator shaft they could have had access to the entire
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:49.880]  core structure of the building without being detected that was a spook facility
[2:16:49.880 --> 2:16:52.640]  well we're gonna break and come back and then I'm gonna attempt to give you the
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:55.720]  floor there's just so many issues I want to bring up here with Richard Gage the
[2:16:55.720 --> 2:16:59.920]  founder of architects and engineers for 9-11 truth over 500 members now and
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:05.440]  growing of structural engineers and architects very very powerful group of
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:10.280]  of accredited men and women that cannot be ignored and we'll talk about the
[2:17:10.280 --> 2:17:15.200]  deceptions in the NIST reports and why they've been so deceptive and why they
[2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:19.440]  claim there was no molten metal when the government's own studies and their own
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:25.960]  photographs admit there was molten metal stay with us heart disease is on the

[2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:34.240]  war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:38.760]  enemy bin Laden this is his MO we have to look to the Middle East we have to look
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:42.960]  to this home of bin Laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:46.640]  look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:50.840]  States some u.s. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:56.760]  engaged in spying in and on the u.s. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have
[2:18:56.760 --> 2:19:01.440]  been detained and Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:05.560]  the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence network warnings and war

[2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:35.520]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical
[2:19:35.520 --> 2:19:39.640]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw for
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:43.280]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:47.680]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions
[2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:51.120]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book the creature from
[2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:55.080]  Jekyll Island congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:19:59.560]  know about central bank power a gripping adventure into the secret world of

[2:21:18.520 --> 2:21:29.080]  that's 1-800-313-6400 today we are back live with Richard Gage okay not
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:33.760]  wasting any time Richard continue with NIST and their deceptions for those that
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:36.880]  don't know who NIST is you might want to tell them who they are and then I want
[2:21:36.880 --> 2:21:39.440]  you to spend some more time on the explosive growth and the published
[2:21:39.440 --> 2:21:46.280]  papers peer reviewed by architects and engineers for 9-11 truth yes we have
[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:51.400]  missed so acknowledging freefall we were asking all of your listeners to write
[2:21:51.400 --> 2:21:57.280]  letters to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and mostly to
[2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:02.680]  government officials and media officials highlighting the dichotomy of
[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:07.280]  what they're saying on the one hand and what they're not saying on the other
[2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:13.520]  that that this could only have been a bike explosive control demolition it's
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:18.120]  it's it's critical that we get a real investigation and we're asking also all
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:23.440]  of your listeners to email every architect and engineer they can find and
[2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:30.160]  with the link to the the video that documents this deception on the part of
[2:22:30.160 --> 2:22:38.400]  NIST and the link the video can be found on YouTube at our account which is AE 9-1-1
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:45.120]  truth so go to YouTube and look for AE 9-1-1 truth you'll see a listing of our
[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:50.280]  videos the most prominent one that's received 20,000 hits is this physics
[2:22:50.280 --> 2:22:56.040]  professor David Chandler who and in this 10 minute video documents this it's
[2:22:56.040 --> 2:23:00.960]  really important and by the way this this is our international boycott YouTube
[2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:06.320]  day today because they've been censoring a lot of people but on this day I would
[2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:10.280]  encourage our listeners to go get the video you've posted there and post it
[2:23:10.280 --> 2:23:14.680]  on blip TV live link and a bunch of others we're trying to get folks to have
[2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:18.320]  an exodus away from YouTube we're gonna stay on YouTube and keep fighting them
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:23.080]  but to prepare people to try to build up some other big mega sites because of the
[2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:28.360]  censorship of YouTube openly announcing they are now run by the ADL and they
[2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:32.560]  decide what goes up and what doesn't they've been banning my videos restricting
[2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:35.600]  them doing a lot of other bad things and banning a lot of 9-11 truth videos but
[2:23:35.600 --> 2:23:39.520]  a side issue the boycott of YouTube is going on today that's why my channel is
[2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:44.960]  shut down right now but please continue with with some of the deception that
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:48.840]  they're involved in that till you guys are exposing well you brought up molten
[2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:53.920]  metal as well and this is one of the critical pieces of evidence that is
[2:23:53.920 --> 2:24:01.240]  denied by NIST in fact before NIST took over the investigation a FEMA had done
[2:24:01.240 --> 2:24:06.200]  their own investigation and interestingly enough their conclusion
[2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:10.920]  first of all is that flyer which is their best hypothesis of how this
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:17.280]  building came down has a very low probability of occurrence what do you
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:22.080]  do when your your your best hypothesis has a low probability of occurrence you
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:27.040]  look for another hypothesis in fact they found some evidence and documented
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:34.160]  it very well for the explosive control demolition with a new type of
[2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:40.960]  material and incendiary called thermite this stuff has there's evidence all
[2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:46.160]  throughout the World Trade Center of thermite in fact there there there is
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:53.000]  several tons of molten metal found by the first responders found by the World
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:57.920]  Trade Center structural engine Leslie Robertson and associates of his and
[2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:02.160]  other structural engineers document the melting of steel and how do you get all
[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:08.040]  this molten steel when we're talking about thousands of degrees above what we
[2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:10.840]  know what's going on and the people are standing in the wounds in the buildings
[2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:15.320]  waving their arms it's not melting them how does it melt these big four foot
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:19.280]  around girders then we have the video of the molten steel the proper
[2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:24.320]  coloration the studies have been done pouring out founting out like a foundry
[2:25:24.320 --> 2:25:29.040]  we have the firefighters on TV saying it was just like a foundry like inside of
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:33.800]  volcano just molten metal everywhere and then for weeks we have this molten
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:39.280]  metal yeah absolutely and FEMA documents the melting of the steel the hot
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:43.440]  sulfur corrosion attack turning three-quarter inch girders into Swiss
[2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:48.040]  cheese this is documented by Abel Hassan Asthani the structural engineer who had
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:53.440]  unlimited access out there where does all of this melted steel come from and more
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:58.720]  even more importantly what did NIST do with this documentation in appendix C
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:04.720]  of the final FEMA report in May of 2002 they eject it it is not a part of the
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:09.360]  official record they cannot afford to acknowledge this molten metal in fact
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:13.480]  their lead structural engineer John Gross denies that there's any evidence or
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:17.760]  witnesses of molten metal he denies this publicly when there's dozens of
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:21.840]  witnesses and plenty of photographic evidence as you cited flowing out of
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:26.320]  the right south tower near the jet plane in the local student group PNAC a
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:32.080]  project for a new American citizen they got a few years ago question him about
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:35.440]  that and he said there is no molten metal it didn't matter they had the video
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:39.640]  there we're trying to show him and now there's all this footage of molten
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:44.760]  metal but still they're in denial about it they're gonna have to at some point
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:48.760]  acknowledge that it exists and come up with some excuse what we've heard so far
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:53.800]  is oh well the fire was down in the debris and it was so insulated that it
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:58.400]  got hotter and hotter and hotter which is physically impossible that's not how
[2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:02.980]  it works things cool in entropy all right we'll be right back with Richard
[2:27:02.980 --> 2:27:09.080]  Gage long segment coming up in your phone calls on 9-11-1800-2599-231 stay
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:18.520]  with us we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:28.960]  September 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:34.000]  ground Sierra and we knew what to do at least we thought we did truth rising as
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:38.760]  a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:46.800]  tell their story. Whitman EVA director on the 18 made a statement that the air
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:51.960]  was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:56.280]  brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters. He
[2:28:56.280 --> 2:28:59.960]  had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown he takes his hand
[2:28:59.960 --> 2:29:05.560]  off and you hear three two one and it was boom boom boom boom boom. This is an
[2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:11.880]  emergency transmission worldwide download truth rising at prisonplanet.tv and

[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:20.840]  don't expose the government-sponsored terror they're going to commit more acts
[2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:26.920]  and bring in martial law. Attention this is an extremely urgent self-reliant

[2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:38.760]  engineers for 9-11 truth is our guest next hour we're gonna get into the attacks
[2:30:38.760 --> 2:30:47.080]  on property rights and hunting farming organic farms organic small country
[2:30:47.080 --> 2:30:53.560]  stores being raided by SWAT teams now having your own chickens I guess will be
[2:30:53.560 --> 2:30:56.800]  an al-Qaeda crime here in this police state where they don't want any of us to
[2:30:56.800 --> 2:31:00.360]  be self-sufficient Richard Gage is our guest your calls coming up here in just
[2:31:00.360 --> 2:31:06.320]  about 10 minutes at 1-800-259-9231 please only on 9-11 and government
[2:31:06.320 --> 2:31:18.320]  sponsored terror issues questions for our guest Richard specifically where do you
[2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:22.400]  see 9-11 truth going in the future we have April Gallup filing a suit she was
[2:31:22.400 --> 2:31:25.960]  in the Pentagon one of the heroes you know showing with her evidence it's an
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:31.360]  inside job and then how they persecuted her when she started asking questions it
[2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:36.760]  seems that 9-11 truth is only growing and growing and growing Richard Gage it's
[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:42.280]  growing by millions every year as a matter of fact we we had to as you
[2:31:42.280 --> 2:31:47.600]  mentioned the Europeans brought us out we had national coverage in Madrid and
[2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:54.400]  it's it we were to sell out crowds and in half of the the European cities that
[2:31:54.400 --> 2:31:59.880]  they're they're more awake over there and the media is less controlled in many
[2:31:59.880 --> 2:32:06.240]  of the areas of Europe not all by any means we have we expect to have a thousand
[2:32:06.240 --> 2:32:10.800]  architects and engineers signed on demanding a real investigation by late
[2:32:10.800 --> 2:32:17.440]  summer and we will take the petition to Washington DC whole and take a lots of
[2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:21.640]  members of the 9-11 truth movement with us hold the press conference at the
[2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:28.120]  National Press Club and present the petition to Congress so we we hope to
[2:32:28.120 --> 2:32:32.200]  also have hundreds of our architects and engineers there with us so that's a
[2:32:32.200 --> 2:32:39.360]  big push for us there's a large conference for 9-11 happening in
[2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:48.000]  Australia also in November and a very important conference in Denver American
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:52.960]  transparency you must know about that one coming up in February so there's
[2:32:52.960 --> 2:32:58.560]  there's a lot going on a lot happening I wanted to make sure I realized I left
[2:32:58.560 --> 2:33:02.680]  some of your listeners hanging relative to this molten metal because some people
[2:33:02.680 --> 2:33:06.640]  say well who cares what what does that mean well it turns out that this is not
[2:33:06.640 --> 2:33:12.640]  melted steel it turns out that it's not aluminum from a jet airplane it's
[2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:17.680]  molten iron it's iron this stuff is brought up in iron while the component
[2:33:17.680 --> 2:33:24.320]  of structural steel is this is not that this is the byproduct of thermite this
[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:31.560]  is a pure iron with elements of aluminum sulfur manganese fluorine and even 1-3
[2:33:31.560 --> 2:33:36.080]  diphenyl propane interesting is found the Eric Schwartz of the EPA says they've
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:42.040]  never found that before all of this is the key signature chemical signature of
[2:33:42.040 --> 2:33:47.440]  thermite a high-tech incendiary which is used by the military to cut through
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:52.280]  steel like a hot knife through butter and not just my but thermate the specific
[2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:55.840]  type they don't just find the thermate residue they're finding the thermite
[2:33:55.840 --> 2:34:00.640]  residue and it's not just a thermite or a thermate residue either it is a very
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:06.160]  high-tech form of thermite thermate it with nano-sized particles found in
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:12.240]  unignited chips red on one side gray on the other unbelievable dust samples so
[2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:16.300]  we're even finding part of the unignited explosive the thermate and then it
[2:34:16.300 --> 2:34:21.720]  turns out some of the people at NIST just so happen to be former NASA experts in
[2:34:21.720 --> 2:34:27.160]  thermate couplers explosive bolts for separating intercontinental ballistic
[2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:32.640]  missiles and large booster components in their second and third stages just so
[2:34:32.640 --> 2:34:38.400]  happens that there's of just a few experts in the world on thermate they
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:44.080]  just so happen to be the people over at NIST that's interesting it's very
[2:34:44.080 --> 2:34:48.040]  interesting and you can read more about that on our website on the technical
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:54.320]  articles Kevin Ryan has done some incredible work our website is a e911
[2:34:54.320 --> 2:35:02.480]  truth.org and people can also purchase the DVD to get more information we have a
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:09.040]  two-hour DVD on all of this evidence it's all laid out for you absolutely tell
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:13.600]  folks they can get that there at the site yeah right on the left side of the
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:20.440]  website a e911truth.org the evidence is listed for you on the right side
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:25.880]  there's plenty of very important articles the PowerPoint presentation that I
[2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:31.560]  have used in 80 different presentations around the country and in Europe and
[2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:37.640]  Canada is there you can step through like 500 slides very carefully read all
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:43.080]  the information what is the establishment trying to do to stop you or
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:47.600]  discredit you I know that Mythbusters is doing a two-hour special National
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:51.960]  Geographic is doing a special they wanted me to be part of it but it's a
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:57.960]  guy that does hit pieces on Patriot groups and on JFK researchers and so
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:01.120]  there's no point being interviewed so we can edit it all together I believe you
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:06.640]  were interviewed by these guys though so there's a whole group and that's just
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:09.920]  two of the shows there's several other big shows being produced trying to
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:16.520]  counter us right now yes and I'm not so sure that the gentleman that interviewed
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:24.680]  me for the National Geographic two-hour TV 9-11 documentary is producing a hit
[2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:31.040]  piece on this particular subject he has seemed fairly well convinced to me and
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:34.960]  gave us every benefit of the doubt and asked us a very friendly interview
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:42.000]  right I have you seen the films he's made no get ready okay time and time again
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:46.560]  people say oh the BBC was so nice and I go no I've seen I go look at what they
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:53.720]  made the past he is a specialist in going after alternative media and I did a
[2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:59.640]  whole show about their lathe is inside the you know a limo special that aired
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:07.280]  on Discovery Channel a few weeks ago and just the whole thing is a misrepresentation
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:12.800]  and then I interviewed Robert Groden who was the expert one of the experts in
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:16.720]  the world but helped make the film JFK was the main consultant on that
[2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:20.680]  technical consultant Oliver Stone and he was there when they were in Dallas with
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:24.320]  the car doing their shots he said but that's not where the shooter was he was
[2:37:24.320 --> 2:37:31.520]  here but wait I mean I mean it just goes on and on so well just get ready my
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:36.960]  friend look what cross our fingers and hope for the best I guess huh absolutely
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:40.560]  we will do that incidentally for some reason my computer's gone dead that had
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:45.840]  the collars on it so we'll the network I am that to the guys when you guys bring
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:48.800]  me a sheet with those collars on it because I want to go to those here in
[2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:57.600]  just the next few minutes Richard there's so many other facets to this other
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:38:00.920]  points in your research that you haven't made that we need to go over and then
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:05.880]  secondarily second I would like you to speak about the explosive growth of your
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:12.800]  organization oh you bet well relative to building seven let's let's complete
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:17.880]  this because it's not just the fact that we have freefall which one is only one
[2:38:17.880 --> 2:38:24.960]  of the many smoking guns this building 47 stories high begins immediately its
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:29.960]  descent and it falls symmetrically and smoothly nearly straight down and almost
[2:38:29.960 --> 2:38:34.280]  into its own footprint this is a feat that only a handful of companies in the
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:40.000]  world can can even accomplish and it is in itself proof of control demolition
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:43.920]  because you in order to bring a building straight down you have to take out in
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.760]  this case the 23 core columns within a tenth of a second of each other
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:53.360]  synchronistically time floor by floor that's the only way you can get it to
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:39:00.000]  come down straight so that is a second smoking gun if you will indeed also we
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:04.440]  have throughout all the whole ground zero all of this dust that blanket at
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:09.680]  lower Manhattan has these tiny iron-rich microspheres smaller than a human hair
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:15.160]  most of them this could only have come from an aluminum thermic event because
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:20.240]  they have the chemical ingredients once again of ignited thermite so there's
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:25.040]  no way that these did this all of this dust 20 minutes away in the Brooklyn
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:30.080]  Bridge up on top of the skyscrapers two three blocks away and filling all of the
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:35.680]  apartments could have these billions of these spheres well how do they get to be
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:41.040]  spheres well in liquid does this it surface tension forms itself into a
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:47.240]  sphere so in an explosive event this molten iron which is the byproduct of
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:53.040]  thermite is dispersed atomized and and it this is how this happens it's the
[2:39:53.040 --> 2:39:57.240]  only way it could happen we're told well the welders down on the site cutting the
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:02.440]  steel could make spheres well they can't make billions of them and send them
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:08.880]  20 minutes away to the Brooklyn Bridge he did these explanations make no
[2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:13.680]  they can't magically have the spheres be made up of the exact compounds in
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:19.840]  explosive thermite that's right and attached to the unignited chip as found
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:24.920]  in the dust by Dr. Stephen Jones and documented in peer-reviewed journals
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:31.200]  like the the open civil engineering journal and others it's now now what
[2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:36.560]  effect is this having I mean you've gone in a year and a half upwards of 500
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:40.640]  plus members I interview you in the film Truth Rising and you know then you had a
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:46.080]  couple hundred members now you've got over 550 members and as these are
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:48.880]  published in peer-reviewed journals you know that's not you guys writing this
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:55.200]  your findings are being seconded by prestigious journal after journal it
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:40:59.160]  seems like the establishment's got a big problem here Richard
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:06.600]  yeah I hope so but in if if we're having the the the dialogue in a vacuum and
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:10.880]  it's not being published by the mainstream media then is it happening
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:15.360]  if a tree falls and no one's there to hear it in the forest does it make a
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:19.200]  sound you know well in the past it didn't now the alternative media is
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:22.400]  annihilating the mainstream media that's why they're moving in with internet to
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:28.200]  in an attempt to shut down the original free web yeah and it's a huge problem I
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:32.160]  mean we have to become our own media I know you're the major proponent of this
[2:41:32.160 --> 2:41:36.000]  and we have to get this evidence out to the American people and it's going
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:41.640]  mostly I think word word of mouth in addition to alternative media internet
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:46.120]  it is happening and there is pressure from underneath if you will on the
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:49.800]  mainstream media so every once in a while they have to respond to it or
[2:41:49.800 --> 2:41:53.280]  they look like they're not doing their job and they don't want to have that
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:57.400]  appearance do they so we get national geographic to respond whether it's a
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:01.960]  hit piece or not dbc doing their hit piece and people get to see building
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:05.880]  7 coming down for the first time because it's never been played after the first
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:12.160]  day on 9-11 absolutely I've talked about your organization itself that you
[2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:23.040]  found and then I want to phone calls yes we are a nonpartisan group of 5 560 I
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:29.400]  think now they're architects and engineers licensed and or degreed and we
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:35.920]  are looking at all of these pieces of evidence and virtually every architect
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:41.780]  or engineer we show this information to ends up agreeing with us if they're
[2:42:41.780 --> 2:42:48.000]  willing to sit down with it for a half an hour or an hour or in some cases two
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:53.200]  hours is the length we've been speaking they they they go my god why didn't I
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:57.360]  know about this you know well there's lots of reasons for that but do you
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:03.400]  agree with the technical science-based forensic evidence yeah I have to how
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:09.240]  then then let's get an investigation to find out what the other issues are such
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:15.960]  as obviously if this is thermite and in no Alcada didn't have access to these
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:22.000]  buildings Alcada didn't have access to this high-tech nanothermite we're
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:26.160]  talking about some kind of other operation and the architects and
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:30.120]  engineers don't speculate too much beyond that because it's beyond our
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:34.840]  technical credibility but what we can do is provide the tools for your listeners
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:41.120]  to take the AE 9-11 truth.org link with the power of our 560 technical
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:46.080]  professionals to their friends to their to the media to their congressman and
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:51.000]  and really start to to move this through they say we take a look at this you know
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:54.120]  you don't even have to say I'm a conspiracy theorist and here's my
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:43:59.600]  conspiracy and so you say here's a group of technical professionals look at what
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:03.520]  they're saying well I'm to them does it make any sense to you I found that's one
[2:44:03.520 --> 2:44:06.560]  of the best things to do is say my film in-game or terror storm any of the work
[2:44:06.560 --> 2:44:10.840]  I've done you know folks that go out and just say hey this is pretty wild stuff
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:15.400]  tell me what you think about it and then you depoliticize it and then they watch
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:20.360]  it or tell them hey this is controversial this is you know suppressed stuff so
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:24.680]  that they'll watch it and then you unlock a mind and that is priceless I want to
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:29.320]  go to some phone calls for you now let's talk to Warren in California Warren
[2:44:29.320 --> 2:44:32.920]  you're on the air with the founder of architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth
[2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:38.320]  Richard Gage hello yes sir yeah I want to make this short but it's gonna take a
[2:44:38.320 --> 2:44:44.440]  while I went on Google and I put in Global Hawk and I went down to images
[2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:50.240]  and there's about 20 or 12 pages of thumbnail pictures of various pictures
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:55.160]  of the Global Hawk and about third of picture down it says Global Hawk hits
[2:44:55.160 --> 2:45:01.560]  Pentagon and it has a explosion and then there's a website under it then on the
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:08.440]  next page there's one Global Hawk Pentagon 9-11 and it's painted in American
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:13.040]  Airlines paint scheme well there's a lot of debate about what happened to Pentagon
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:16.280]  and the way they covered up the videos the way the witnesses said they smelled
[2:45:16.280 --> 2:45:23.160]  cordyte or you basically gunpowder explosives you know that is a major
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:26.800]  issue there and we've covered it we've got April Gallup coming on next week
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:30.360]  who's followed suit over this she was in the Pentagon and didn't see any plane
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:34.400]  didn't see any wreckage and they told her to shut up about it but you know the
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:38.480]  stronger evidence really is the control demolition and then separately the fact
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:42.720]  that our government which is illegitimate has staged terror attacks over and over
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:45.960]  again that are declassified and admitted I mean there are hundreds of examples
[2:45:45.960 --> 2:45:50.720]  where they admit they staged terror attacks on our troops on our ships or
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:53.960]  on other countries to blame it on their enemies we have an illegitimate
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:58.360]  government that's doing this a group of terrorists and so I find that to be the
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:02.880]  strongest politically to make people understand it that well hey you know I
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:09.280]  mean about my cop and I'm looking for a serial killer and you know we find a
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:13.840]  murder that has the same MO of the other serial killings then we know we go look
[2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:17.280]  at the usual suspect and these guys have done this over and over again so that's
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:23.560]  why we do that Richard Gage your comments on the Pentagon you're right it is a
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:28.840]  little bit of a mess Alex there's clearly caught cover-up going on at the
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:34.040]  Pentagon they had hundreds of cameras that would have told us what did or
[2:46:34.040 --> 2:46:40.960]  didn't hit the Pentagon and they're not releasing them only the unclear five
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:47.800]  frames it's a joke they came and took the FBI after five or ten
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:54.120]  minutes the cameras from the hotel and the gas station nearby so we have
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:59.200]  enough very hard evidence as you mentioned at the three worst structural
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:05.920]  failures in modern history the the high rises that have not been properly
[2:47:05.920 --> 2:47:11.200]  investigated and then that have their own set of cover-ups to go with and and so
[2:47:11.200 --> 2:47:16.760]  the there's some controversy within the 9-11 truth moving about the Pentagon so
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:21.080]  our particular organization focuses on the high rises instead where there is
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:26.960]  very little controversy about the mechanisms for how these buildings
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:31.120]  were taken down alright Warren thank you so much anything else from California
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:35.040]  alright he's gone let's talk to well we're gonna go to break here when I come
[2:47:35.040 --> 2:47:39.360]  back quickly out of Randy Ralph we're gonna Derek first it says he's a
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:42.720]  structural engineer I don't know if he agrees or disagrees Michael Lino and
[2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:47.240]  Kevin and mass in the next hour we've got a bunch of land rights feudalism
[2:47:47.240 --> 2:47:51.160]  issues as we're all basically being driven off the land micromanaged the
[2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:55.160]  king has sent out swarms of agents to eat out our substance as the founders
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:48:01.120]  complained in 1776 on the Declaration of Independence signed July 4th but I want
[2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:03.760]  to hold Richard Gage Richard I know you got a busy schedule can you stay five
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:09.080]  minutes in the next hour oh you bet now okay good and then we're gonna get the
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:13.400]  president of property rights Congress of Missouri Russell Wood on they want you
[2:48:13.400 --> 2:48:16.240]  have to register your premises to be able to hunt on your own land and pay
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:18.920]  fines and fees and they say it's a privilege to hunt on your own land
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:23.360]  separate from having to get all the little permission slips the license
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:27.760]  since from the king toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health there in
[2:48:27.760 --> 2:48:31.680]  the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat the products we use in the
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:36.480]  objects we touch exposure is impossible to avoid heavy metals build up within the
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:40.880]  body over a period of time causing poor health however with Keelorex they can be
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:44.840]  mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner Keelorex was developed
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:48.440]  based on Dr. Alan Greenberg's clinical experience with heavy metal poisoning
[2:48:48.440 --> 2:48:53.640]  during his 25 years of medical practice Keelorex does not contain EDTA and is
[2:48:53.640 --> 2:48:57.560]  made from all natural ingredients enhancing the body's natural mechanisms
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:01.120]  for excreting heavy metals and preventing their reabsorption Keelorex
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:05.000]  contains antioxidants to protect the liver kidney central nervous system and
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:09.360]  immune functions and effectively mobilizes mercury and 15 other heavy metals
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:13.800]  including aluminum arsenic lead and more find out what Keelorex can do for you by
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:21.400]  calling 1-800-675-4568 or visit us online at C-H-E-L-O-R-E-X dot com that's
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:27.240]  Keelorex dot com today the day unlike any other in the long course of American
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:32.320]  history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on
[2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:38.040]  September 11th. Who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:42.280]  Middle East we have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:45.640]  film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:49.480]  inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:55.240]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:50:00.200]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:04.080]  hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:07.640]  intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much

[2:52:06.320 --> 2:52:10.880]  this transmission. Let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Michigan. You're on the air with
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:17.000]  Richard Gage. Go ahead, Randy. Hi, Alex. First, I'd like to thank you and not Richard for
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:22.240]  spreading the 9-11 movement strong so long. I know people are saying it's seven years
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:28.160]  or it's been a while, but my question for Richard, I'd just like to know the name of
[2:52:28.160 --> 2:52:32.480]  some of your more year books. I had a comment after that as well. Well, several videos have
[2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:36.640]  been made with Richard's work and we have those available at infowars.com. Their latest
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:44.480]  film is 9-11 Blueprint for Truth, available at ae911truth.org. Richard? Yes, that's true.
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:49.720]  It's all right there. We have not written a book yet. All right. We'll relate to that
[2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:57.000]  question. I purposely go to the library to ask for 9-11 related books. So when the library
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:59.880]  is crowded, I'll get weird looks from the librarian because I'll know the title of
[2:52:59.880 --> 2:53:03.320]  the book and I'll say, well, what books do you have from Vince and Boogly Elsie? So then
[2:53:03.320 --> 2:53:06.800]  she has to say the title and people will look at me like, what? President Bush wanted for
[2:53:06.800 --> 2:53:13.440]  murder and I kind of pull a backwards trick for that. I first off recommend going to see
[2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:17.360]  Endgame first for anybody that's getting into this because if you watch it, it kind of starts
[2:53:17.360 --> 2:53:22.000]  and gives you, you know, it resets the history so you really know what happened before you
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:25.480]  go see all this 9-11 stuff and you can see how it relates. Yeah, it gives it to you at
[2:53:25.480 --> 2:53:28.960]  a historical perspective. Got to jump good to hear from you. Let's go to a structural
[2:53:28.960 --> 2:53:34.120]  engineer, Derek from Texas. You're on the air with Richard Gage. Go ahead, Derek. Hi,
[2:53:34.120 --> 2:53:38.200]  Alex Richard. Thank you so much for letting me on your air and thank you so much for
[2:53:38.200 --> 2:53:43.880]  all the great work that y'all do. Thank you. As a correction, I'm not a structural engineer.
[2:53:43.880 --> 2:53:48.360]  That's usually a civil engineer's test. Okay, well my screen just said that so somebody
[2:53:48.360 --> 2:53:52.840]  said that or something close to that for the person answering the phone. Yeah, I'm a mechanical
[2:53:52.840 --> 2:53:57.360]  engineer but I do, as a certified welding inspector, go to building the structures and
[2:53:57.360 --> 2:54:02.720]  review the structural engineer's recommendations and enforce the contract documents by making
[2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:07.560]  sure that they get followed. Now write a report that says that the structural engineer's recommendations
[2:54:07.560 --> 2:54:13.160]  are followed or not followed and make recommendations as to how they can be remedied. But I want
[2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:18.000]  to get to the quick and skinny about the NIST report that came out just a couple months
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:24.880]  ago. What we're suggesting is that this column 79 on floor 23, which had many attachments,
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:29.240]  this is a column that was attached to, or excuse me, a floor beam which they said expanded
[2:54:29.240 --> 2:54:33.720]  from linear thermal expansion from these office fires. And as far as my knowledge, the only
[2:54:33.720 --> 2:54:39.880]  thing inside these offices are normal consumables like books, papers, carpet, etc. Which smolder
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:47.800]  and burn at 800 degrees, 900 degrees, all hail thermal expansion, a new scientific development
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:53.400]  in the history of building fires. Yes, and they're suggesting that all this overcame
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:59.080]  a connection at column 79, which was also attached to four other floor beams as well
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:03.720]  as the deck connections which are all welded. The joists, which are about every two feet,
[2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:08.680]  they're all welded. And there's many, many connections, not to mention a five inch thick
[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:15.600]  concrete slab that has reinforcement of steel, rebar, or post tension tendons. What we need
[2:55:15.600 --> 2:55:22.000]  to do is have a finite element method survey that's applied to this geometry and then put
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:26.320]  different initial load conditions in and run the FEA software and say, we already know
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:31.480]  that this is silly, but a good FEA survey will prove this is silly. And this is something
[2:55:31.480 --> 2:55:35.560]  that I've promoted on Neocon radio and I enjoy doing it when I can.
[2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:40.360]  Well, the criminals running the government, it's not our government, they engage in a
[2:55:40.360 --> 2:55:46.520]  cover-up of everything, so we can't find out specifically Richard Gage.
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:52.800]  We have to get the information from this in order to do the FEA and they are closing it.
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:58.720]  It is not available whatsoever. They've locked it up and this is a public investigation and
[2:55:58.720 --> 2:56:05.720]  this information must be made public. All right, stay there. We'll be right back.
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:34.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the New World
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:43.600]  Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:49.320]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[2:56:49.320 --> 2:56:52.200]  that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:59.200]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:56:59.200 --> 2:57:00.200]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:06.640]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:22.640]  at prisonplanet.tv. In-game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[2:57:36.640 --> 2:57:43.160]  Final segments with Richard Gage, architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, commenting on
[2:57:43.160 --> 2:57:46.640]  what the last gentleman was saying, Richard, before we go to a few final calls.
[2:57:46.640 --> 2:57:55.040]  Well, he was highlighting the unviability of the thesis of NIST. First of all, the photographic
[2:57:55.040 --> 2:58:00.640]  evidence of the fires on the 12th and 13th floor indicate that the fires were out for
[2:58:00.640 --> 2:58:06.600]  the last hour and a half of the life of the building and yet their fire simulations fraudulently
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:15.440]  shows massive fires around Column 79, as you suggested, for well more than the 20-minute
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:21.920]  duration of the fire can exist in any one place because it consumes the low quantities
[2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:22.920]  of consumables and moves on.
[2:58:22.920 --> 2:58:28.880]  It creeps around, but they have this continuous across the board, massive inferno.
[2:58:28.880 --> 2:58:35.040]  Yes. And so this massive inferno, let's say, okay, maybe it was there, but it's not just
[2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:38.480]  one building, it's not just one building, it's three doing this.
[2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:44.040]  Yeah, but in Building 7, what they're saying is that this fire elongated the beams, pushed
[2:58:44.040 --> 2:58:50.080]  the girder off its seat on the column, and then that caused floor 13 to fall, and 12,
[2:58:50.080 --> 2:58:57.520]  12 to fall, and 11, et cetera, for nine floors inside the building, leaving Column 79 unbrazed
[2:58:57.520 --> 2:59:03.680]  and so then it buckles. But all of this action would have deformed the exterior of the building,
[2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:08.240]  and that's not what happens. But it does happen in their computer model, interestingly enough.
[2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:13.880]  There's severe warping indentation and bulging, and tipping, actually, of the upper part of
[2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:19.480]  the building. They could not get their computer model to match what actually happened in the
[2:59:19.480 --> 2:59:24.560]  video because clearly that building would have tipped over in any kind of collapse caused
[2:59:24.560 --> 2:59:30.360]  by fire, and that's why they don't even show us what happens above about the 20th floor
[2:59:30.360 --> 2:59:33.840]  because it was clearly tipping as a result of all the bulging and indentation on the
[2:59:33.840 --> 2:59:34.840]  exterior.
[2:59:34.840 --> 2:59:39.440]  All right, let's go to a final call. Mike in Illinois, Mike, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:59:39.440 --> 2:59:44.160]  Yes, thank you, Alex. I appreciate it. Richard, I have a couple of questions for you. I'm
[2:59:44.160 --> 2:59:48.680]  going to try to make it brief because I know the time variable here. I remember seeing the
[2:59:48.680 --> 2:59:53.240]  trade centers come down. They look like trees being turned into sawdust from the top down,
[2:59:53.240 --> 2:59:58.480]  which was sort of incredible to me, and I know that I don't actually believe that the
[2:59:58.480 --> 3:00:05.840]  permit could alone do this. There had to be some other asset to it. You have 550,000 tons
[3:00:05.840 --> 3:00:13.040]  being turned into dust, which is just unbelievable. I understand it was built in a bathtub, so
[3:00:13.040 --> 3:00:17.960]  if this had fallen into this bathtub, it might have cracked the bottom.
[3:00:17.960 --> 3:00:22.960]  Here's the deal. Instantly, as it starts collapsing tower one and two, not just seven,
[3:00:22.960 --> 3:00:28.520]  only as tower one and two start detonating with blast squibs, clearly four or five, in
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:34.480]  some cases, 10 floors below, it's pulverizing with explosive force. Little fires don't eject
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:41.080]  pyroclastic flows of pulverized office furniture, desks, people blown into tiny pieces. Richard
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:42.080]  Gage.
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:48.520]  They don't eject four and 20-ton perimeter steel beams, 55 miles an hour exiting instant
[3:00:48.520 --> 3:00:54.120]  acceleration out of the sides of the twin tower, landing 600 feet away. That doesn't
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:01:00.000]  happen, but I think the caller's suggesting that there's something in addition to high-tech
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:04.760]  thermite, which becomes very explosive, by the way. We don't know because the tests aren't
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:07.760]  available to us. This is very new stuff, only...
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:12.520]  We just know the official story doesn't match the science on any area.
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:18.440]  That's correct, but it could be that the explosive nature of the high-tech thermite
[3:01:18.440 --> 3:01:24.960]  could be enough. I mean, we don't really know. We don't necessarily have evidence of
[3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:31.840]  high-energy explosives like C4 or RDX. There could be something else going on that's high-tech
[3:01:31.840 --> 3:01:36.840]  and more explosive, but who knows? We have the evidence for high-tech thermite. Let's
[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:37.840]  run with it.
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:40.520]  Thank you, Mike. We're out of time. Kevin, Jim, and others will get to you later. Everyone
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:44.560]  old or not. You can leave as we're getting into some other subjects, but Richard Gage,
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:48.560]  I want to have you back up again in the near future. We commend you for your tireless work
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:53.000]  for the truth and for liberty. 9-11 has been used to destroy our Bill of Rights and Constitution
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:57.720]  and launch us on a path towards criminal world government, and only by exposing this great
[3:01:57.720 --> 3:02:03.240]  new mythos they've created, this new religion of tyranny, can liberty then grow again in
[3:02:03.240 --> 3:02:09.720]  our fine land and worldwide. I commend you, my friend, and we salute you via Kandiyos.
[3:02:09.720 --> 3:02:11.920]  Thank you, Alex. It's an honor to be with you always.
[3:02:11.920 --> 3:02:16.400]  Honored to be with you. Take care, Richard Gage. We'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:20.400]  get into the feudalism being set up as the people are being treated like third-world
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:21.600]  surf slaves.
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:26.640]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to
[3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:30.640]  be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent,
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:34.560]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:38.440]  your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:42.880]  of your family. In any emergency, if you simply prepare, our elected representatives wanted
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:47.400]  a good old boy bailout for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:52.280]  They turned off the telephones and emailed. They voted to print $850 billion at least
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:57.160]  out of thin air. This money now owns the American and European banks. The exploding inflation
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:02.200]  that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities,
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:05.120]  particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:09.800]  In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:14.800]  until it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems
[3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:19.480]  as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing
[3:03:19.480 --> 3:03:23.640]  to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less food but
[3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:28.120]  jack up prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:32.080]  and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One-third of Americans have to choose
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:37.320]  between buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared,
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:41.040]  get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very important for
[3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:44.320]  you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:49.320]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:53.680]  and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:58.040]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:03:58.040 --> 3:04:02.280]  salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost
[3:04:02.280 --> 3:04:09.320]  of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit

[3:04:57.240 --> 3:05:09.120]  Hey, I got to finish my lunch in that three minute break ladies and gentlemen. I love
[3:05:09.120 --> 3:05:17.880]  live TV in here. It's great at prisonplanet.tv. I remember about 15 years ago when the Forest
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:25.480]  Service, Department of Land Management, local Game Wardens started setting up SWAT teams.
[3:05:25.480 --> 3:05:29.400]  All out in the back of a boat, fishing would have guys run up a man with a small child
[3:05:29.400 --> 3:05:35.800]  that was in I think the NRA magazine a few years ago, pointed machine guns at him. They're
[3:05:35.800 --> 3:05:39.920]  rating farmers and ranchers claiming they don't have permits for organic eggs. They're
[3:05:39.920 --> 3:05:47.640]  rating local co-ops that are selling their eggs or milk and they're hiring all these
[3:05:47.640 --> 3:05:53.560]  bureaucracies. It's just radically expanding and now when you talk to a Game Warden because
[3:05:53.560 --> 3:06:02.640]  we have a piece of property we've had since 1829 in East Texas, Mexican land grant, they're
[3:06:02.640 --> 3:06:07.000]  rude. They'll pull up at the deer camp. They'll get out and go, I want to see everything they're
[3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:14.800]  doing. I want to make sure the tags are right on this deer. It just goes on and on and on.
[3:06:14.800 --> 3:06:26.080]  My uncle, the landowner with the tag on the deer was driving it for my great uncle to
[3:06:26.080 --> 3:06:30.040]  the local processor. They got it, but they wanted to have it turned into sausage that
[3:06:30.040 --> 3:06:34.160]  was taking it. State police jumped on him, screamed at him, acted like he was a criminal
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:37.880]  so you're going to jail and then told him it was illegal for him to be transporting
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:42.880]  a deer that wasn't his and he said, I'm the landowner. I know the law and I'm taking
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:47.760]  it here. It didn't matter if my uncle was even known to the state police officer and
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:52.400]  our family had been there forever. It's about letting us know we're trash and scum and that
[3:06:52.400 --> 3:06:58.400]  they own us. Now, it's not enough that they now run a background check on you when you
[3:06:58.400 --> 3:07:05.160]  buy a license all over the country. Feds pushed at states past it, most of them. So now if
[3:07:05.160 --> 3:07:11.600]  you hadn't paid your child support or if you've got some background or you can't go buy the
[3:07:11.600 --> 3:07:17.360]  hunting license and the hunting license is everywhere just exploding in price. This is
[3:07:17.360 --> 3:07:20.680]  all designed to go after law abiding people. So see, they train you how to be a slave,
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:26.520]  how to be a surfer just like in jolly old England where only the nobles could hunt.
[3:07:26.520 --> 3:07:30.040]  Now they want you and it's happening all over the country to register your property just
[3:07:30.040 --> 3:07:35.080]  like the animal ID of the premises ID. And when you register, you waive all these rights
[3:07:35.080 --> 3:07:38.680]  and now not just the game boardens, but the forest service and others so they can come
[3:07:38.680 --> 3:07:44.720]  on your land without warrants whenever they want. I mean, this is criminal and these are
[3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:49.400]  nothing but parasites. The deer jumping out in front of cars, killing people every day
[3:07:49.400 --> 3:07:55.400]  across the nation. Wolves, coyotes are running wild in Austin. You walk out back my house
[3:07:55.400 --> 3:08:00.000]  in Southwest Austin every night and hear the coyotes going wild or eating people's dogs
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:05.080]  and cats. They pay trappers thousands of dollars per deer to come trap the whitetail
[3:08:05.080 --> 3:08:09.680]  flying to Mexico. They're so stressed out with the time they get there, they die. So
[3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:13.280]  they're not letting humans be predators. They're not letting anything else happen. Everything
[3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:18.680]  is falling apart. And I'm aware of a case similarly where they're trying to pass things
[3:08:18.680 --> 3:08:23.880]  like this in Missouri and people are fighting back there in Missouri against this and Russell
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:30.640]  Wood is the president of the property rights Congress. And again, you have to register
[3:08:30.640 --> 3:08:35.280]  your farm. You have to register your ranch. It can be 10 acres. If you want to put a deer
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:39.760]  blind out back, you know, for your grandson, you go register with them and you wave all
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:44.040]  your rights and they say it's a privilege. And then of course, they can start finding,
[3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:48.480]  feeding and taxing. So I briefly wanted to have him on for about 15, 20 minutes to talk
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:52.640]  about that because even if you don't hunt, you know, you've been conditioned to hate
[3:08:52.640 --> 3:08:55.600]  hunting just like they did in England. Now they've been hunting there. They're back to
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:08:59.560]  feudalism, but the king can, you know, the queen, the royals can still hunt. They ban
[3:08:59.560 --> 3:09:03.320]  most forms of hunting. You can go buy a steak at the store and that's okay, but don't shoot
[3:09:03.320 --> 3:09:07.880]  it yourself. It's supposedly cruel. Again, they want to dehumanize us. They want to kill
[3:09:07.880 --> 3:09:13.200]  our rural culture. They want us totally under their control. Now, in the 20s and 30s when
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:17.200]  we had the depression, 90% of people were agrarian on the land, self-sufficient and
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:20.960]  7 million starved to death, according to a major university study that was out a few
[3:09:20.960 --> 3:09:26.000]  months ago. Now 90 plus percent of us live in the cities and of the 10% that live in
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:30.480]  the country, only half of those are 5% of the country or what you call self-sufficient
[3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:35.440]  and they want to shut that down. And again, words can't describe all the things that are
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:39.600]  happening, the harassment. You try to go to a national park or state park now. The rangers
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:44.280]  are rude to you because humans are bad. We're bad. We're not supposed to be out there. We're
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:49.640]  evil serfs. This is a mode of control of the population, but the good news is in Missouri,
[3:09:49.640 --> 3:09:55.840]  they're beating these initiatives. In Texas, we're gilded and it's very sad. Our people
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:10:01.640]  have become very cowardly and slave-like. There's no law you have to have the animal
[3:10:01.640 --> 3:10:07.000]  ID federally, but all these states have adopted it. Many have Texas adopted it and there's
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:10.800]  no law, but they still come and harass you and when you sign it, then you waive your
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:14.720]  rights to your property, $1,000, $2,000 a day fines if a cow dies and you don't report
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:19.840]  it. You have to put chips in all your animals, but the big agribusiness doesn't, so it's
[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:25.040]  meant to bankrupt the small farms and ranches. They're now SWAT teaming again, organic farmers.
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:29.520]  That's coming up in 20 minutes. This is very, very serious. I wanted to preface that before
[3:10:29.520 --> 3:10:35.120]  we bring Russell Wood up. Russell, good to have you here, sir. Tell us exactly what you're
[3:10:35.120 --> 3:10:37.040]  facing there in Missouri.
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:43.560]  The conservation department is trying to get some new regulations in place and the way
[3:10:43.560 --> 3:10:51.080]  the latest department is set up here, they're free of the legislature. Our lawmakers really
[3:10:51.080 --> 3:10:57.480]  have almost no control, well, virtually no control over their rules, regulations and
[3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:07.960]  or their spending. They've been giving a never ending $0.18 sales tax with no control from
[3:11:07.960 --> 3:11:14.360]  any elected officials. It's theirs to spend, so they are pretty much free to do as they
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:20.440]  please and right now they're proposing a new set of hunting regulations on deer and
[3:11:20.440 --> 3:11:31.600]  turkey where they say for one thing that you must own at least 80 acres to qualify for
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:42.840]  a no cost landowner deer permit, deer tag or turkey tag. This is something that we're
[3:11:42.840 --> 3:11:49.320]  just simply not going to, we're just not going to stand for. They're also saying that we
[3:11:49.320 --> 3:11:59.480]  must register our property. If we want to hunt on our own property, the way they say it,
[3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:08.040]  they say landowner hunters wanting to receive landowner deer and turkey permit privileges.
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:15.880]  They're going to extend us a privilege. We must first register our property with their
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:25.480]  landowner registry and on this registering they want, now this is off of their literature,
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:35.880]  they want property location, section, township range, they want number of acres at that location,
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:45.080]  they want the status of each person there whether it's immediate household, whatever,
[3:12:45.080 --> 3:12:51.880]  then they will be able to have their point of sale system so that when you walk in there,
[3:12:51.880 --> 3:12:57.800]  they have verification that you actually own land. They say that people have cheated on
[3:12:57.800 --> 3:12:58.800]  this before.
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:04.840]  It's always how we all have to be treated like criminals, guilty until proven innocent
[3:13:04.840 --> 3:13:10.560]  to stop a few quote sheets. You heard me do that whole rant earlier, sir, about the way
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:14.680]  they're treating people, the way they're acting, all these new bureaucrats, they're just, they
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:19.080]  need to get off our back and just what you just read, they're saying it's a privilege
[3:13:19.080 --> 3:13:24.040]  to hunt on your own land because it's our land, you pay property taxes on it and then
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:28.440]  we come in there and then we give you permission to hunt on your own land.
[3:13:28.440 --> 3:13:35.240]  If you want to receive permit privileges, yeah, yeah, but they close this little part
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:41.440]  by saying requiring persons to declare their specific land ownership up front will make
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:48.960]  it now get this easier for department personnel to verify land ownership. They don't say
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:53.000]  anything about this is a good deal for managing livestock.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  They don't, I mean,
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:58.880]  Hey, how about you go to the state and get half these people fired in this economy? I
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:03.600]  mean, you know, there's no commercial poaching going on that I know of anymore. All they
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:08.000]  do is harass people. They can go arrest good old boy shooting deer off the highway on other
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:11.560]  people's property all day. You know, that's fine and dandy, but no, they're there to
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:16.600]  harass. You can tell they hate landowners. They hate America. They're a bunch of communist
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:21.800]  filth and I'm calling them out. Get out of our country. You dirtbag trash. We're not
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:24.000]  in 1200 England.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:31.280]  They, they, during their whole tirade on this, it's all about money and they make veil threats
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:38.000]  at what programs they should discontinue and so forth. Their director, the director gets
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  paid 150,000 a year. They have 2300 employees.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:52.760]  Oh, just 2300 parasitic environmental wackos. Again, they don't care about real environmental
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:58.400]  problems. I've run into them. These are hate filled sandal wearing long haired communists.
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:01.760]  I'm not saying you're bad over sandals have long hair, but that type and they go get a
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:07.000]  gun in a uniform and they literally folks. I've run into them. They are scum. Go ahead.
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:13.440]  Well, so many of these, you know, the old conservation game wardens we used to have around
[3:15:13.440 --> 3:15:19.120]  here actually were interested in the wildlife and in managing wildlife and that sort of
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:20.120]  thing.
[3:15:20.120 --> 3:15:24.400]  Well, I heard Gary Brownfield talking about it himself. He worked, you know, for one of
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:29.040]  these big, you know, in Missouri. I mean, you know, he was, and he said you couldn't
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:32.720]  have paid them in the sixties when he was there to go out and do stuff like this and
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:33.720]  harass people.
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:38.760]  So many of these new ones are they're the younger folks that have never been off asphalt
[3:15:38.760 --> 3:15:39.760]  in their life.
[3:15:39.760 --> 3:15:43.400]  Yeah, they come out of the big cities. They hate America. They hate hunting and they're
[3:15:43.400 --> 3:15:48.240]  here to harass landowners. They need to get their ass off our property.
[3:15:48.240 --> 3:15:57.720]  But the, our response to this is that we will buy no deer or turkey tags, period. And there
[3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:06.160]  will also be no hunting on our property, on our private property by anyone who has a deer
[3:16:06.160 --> 3:16:07.160]  or turkey tag.
[3:16:07.160 --> 3:16:11.480]  And you guys have successfully used that tactic before. If all these greedy creatures care
[3:16:11.480 --> 3:16:13.720]  about some money, you'll just boycott them.
[3:16:13.720 --> 3:16:20.480]  We're just not going to buy their tag. We're going to post our land so that no one can
[3:16:20.480 --> 3:16:25.720]  hunt there, accept ourselves or stay there, sir. We're going to come back and talk more
[3:16:25.720 --> 3:16:31.360]  about what you're doing on the other side. Stay with us.
[3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:35.200]  Everyone knows that omega three should be an essential part of our daily diet with so many
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:39.440]  different methods of consumption. How do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your
[3:16:39.440 --> 3:16:43.920]  daily intake? The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:44.920]  answer.

[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:36.560]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven
[3:17:36.560 --> 3:17:37.560]  was an inside job.
[3:17:37.560 --> 3:17:41.040]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:17:41.040 --> 3:17:45.640]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? It was engineered by you, David
[3:17:45.640 --> 3:17:50.160]  Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR, and Lisa D'Arc Chateau.
[3:17:50.160 --> 3:17:55.480]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[3:17:55.480 --> 3:17:57.040]  to grow at our own door.
[3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:04.040]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:07.040]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:18:07.040 --> 3:18:13.040]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:16.040]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:18:16.040 --> 3:18:21.040]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[3:18:21.040 --> 3:18:22.040]  anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:35.040]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:37.440]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:18:37.440 --> 3:18:42.600]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:45.640]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:18:45.640 --> 3:18:49.920]  Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:53.840]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:18:53.840 --> 3:18:57.600]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:18:58.920]  from Jekyll Island.
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:03.000]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:07.920]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:09.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:14.120]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[3:19:14.120 --> 3:19:18.960]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:22.040]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[3:19:22.040 --> 3:19:26.840]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:30.320]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:19:30.320 --> 3:19:34.600]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:35.600]  alkaline environment.
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:41.240]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[3:19:41.240 --> 3:19:45.720]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[3:19:45.720 --> 3:19:46.880]  of disease.
[3:19:46.880 --> 3:19:51.520]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:19:52.600]  loss of weight.
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:19:55.600]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:58.840]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[3:19:58.840 --> 3:20:02.760]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[3:20:02.760 --> 3:20:07.040]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[3:20:07.040 --> 3:20:08.040]  it.
[3:20:08.040 --> 3:20:09.040]  Do your part.
[3:20:09.040 --> 3:20:11.600]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[3:20:11.600 --> 3:20:16.240]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:20.400]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[3:20:20.400 --> 3:20:27.000]  Order your bottle of Alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:55.400]  Russell Wood, I want to have you back on for a full hour to go over this more in the future,
[3:20:55.400 --> 3:20:59.640]  the short segment we have more about your fight against these people.
[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:02.600]  I mean, look, it's time for us to stop being so nice too.
[3:21:02.600 --> 3:21:05.760]  When you see these DNR people or these game wardens are out of control, I'd walk right
[3:21:05.760 --> 3:21:09.800]  up to them in a little cafe and say, I'm tired of you enslaving this country and sucking
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:10.800]  off of us.
[3:21:10.800 --> 3:21:14.760]  It's time for us to start shunning them and being aggressive like our founding fathers
[3:21:14.760 --> 3:21:15.760]  did.
[3:21:15.760 --> 3:21:16.960]  Not just saying, well, we won't hunt this year.
[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:21.160]  I know people have done that in other states and I remember a few years ago in Missouri,
[3:21:21.160 --> 3:21:26.320]  isn't there something similar along these lines that made them back off?
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:29.320]  No, I don't think so.
[3:21:29.320 --> 3:21:30.320]  I don't remember it.
[3:21:30.320 --> 3:21:31.320]  I've seen some other cases.
[3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:32.320]  I mean, I'll tell you what makes me mad.
[3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:36.200]  I read the stories about states where they don't pass the animal ID or premises ID to
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:40.920]  waive all your rights and go under their control and then they'll tell, okay, the 4-H club,
[3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:44.480]  you've all got to sign your parents' property over to us so you can't show your cows or
[3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:45.480]  pigs.
[3:21:45.480 --> 3:21:51.120]  And then a little girl shows up with her pigs, she wins, they wait and they grow up.
[3:21:51.120 --> 3:21:54.760]  They grab her, put her hands behind her back and throw her off the property to make it look
[3:21:54.760 --> 3:21:56.160]  like she's a criminal.
[3:21:56.160 --> 3:21:57.160]  These are bullies.
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:21:58.760]  I mean, you know about those cases, I bet.
[3:21:58.760 --> 3:22:05.680]  Oh, yeah, we've had, yeah, we're, I'm deeply immersed in this animal ID thing, yeah.
[3:22:05.680 --> 3:22:11.840]  Yeah, it's, and it comes from all angles, it comes from every side, doesn't it?
[3:22:11.840 --> 3:22:13.360]  Well, that's why I'm angry.
[3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:15.200]  I mean, it's feudalism.
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:16.640]  It's total serfdom.
[3:22:16.640 --> 3:22:17.640]  Yeah.
[3:22:17.640 --> 3:22:21.560]  Well, in the minutes we've got left, how do folks contact you?
[3:22:21.560 --> 3:22:22.560]  How do they get involved?
[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:24.360]  We're on a few stations up in Missouri.
[3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:25.640]  How do people support you?
[3:22:25.640 --> 3:22:32.240]  Well, if they'll just, I'll give them my phone number and they can just call and we'll be
[3:22:32.240 --> 3:22:35.200]  getting word out as we progress.
[3:22:35.200 --> 3:22:40.000]  We hope to be getting some no trespassing or no hunting signs fixed.
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:45.480]  All this is the same wording on me no hunting here because of Department of Conservation
[3:22:45.480 --> 3:22:50.560]  Regulations, that sort of thing, you know, so, and you're getting a whole bunch of signs
[3:22:50.560 --> 3:22:51.720]  made up to do that.
[3:22:51.720 --> 3:22:52.720]  Yes.
[3:22:52.720 --> 3:22:53.920]  Now, now your organization is pretty big.
[3:22:53.920 --> 3:22:54.920]  How many members?
[3:22:54.920 --> 3:23:00.280]  Well, we have, it's hard to say we're not a real close knit group.
[3:23:00.280 --> 3:23:07.480]  We have well over a thousand property owners and involved and we get more than that when
[3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:10.760]  we start having rallies and gatherings, you know.
[3:23:10.760 --> 3:23:11.760]  That's right.
[3:23:11.760 --> 3:23:15.000]  You guys have had some big victories in Missouri against these criminals.
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  Yes, we have.
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  Yes, we have.
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  Yeah.
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  Tell folks about those briefly.
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:22.600]  Okay.
[3:23:22.600 --> 3:23:32.840]  The one major one that we had had to do with the watershed district that had been put into
[3:23:32.840 --> 3:23:40.600]  effect legally, a freestanding entity with the rulemaking rights and privileges established
[3:23:40.600 --> 3:23:42.920]  by the state.
[3:23:42.920 --> 3:23:50.680]  We didn't know about this until it was already already in effect and we went to work with
[3:23:50.680 --> 3:23:59.000]  legislators and pointing out what they had really done and as happens too often, it had
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:05.080]  been faster without those voting for it, really realizing what it said and what it did.
[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:12.000]  And we were able to get that to get that reversed and give the count nine counties were brought
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:16.880]  into this one big district and some of the county commissioners didn't even know it was
[3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:17.880]  going on.
[3:24:17.880 --> 3:24:18.880]  Hadn't even been contacted.
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:30.480]  As I say, we did get that reversed to prevent establishing a freestanding unit with the
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:36.280]  ability to make laws governing that district and then they were to let people know what
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:37.280]  the rules were.
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:39.120]  This is a coming thing.
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:48.800]  This is an offshoot or actually an integral part of the agenda 21 concepts of doing away
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:56.600]  with county boundaries and here in Missouri right now, they're trying to blur the line
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:03.960]  between Missouri and Arkansas on watershed issues.
[3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:10.880]  And we're so involved with this national animal identification system and the efforts
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:16.160]  combined efforts, not just us, but others, we've been able to get a law pasture in Missouri
[3:25:16.160 --> 3:25:24.880]  to prevent mandatory premise registration for national animal identification system.
[3:25:24.880 --> 3:25:28.760]  That's right because there's not a law, but by color of law, they try to fool and terrorize
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:30.800]  people into thinking there's a law.
[3:25:30.800 --> 3:25:34.720]  You have to pass a law saying this is a fraud, there isn't a law.
[3:25:34.720 --> 3:25:45.080]  Yeah, and the USDA has issued directives to the veterinarians and so forth to go ahead,
[3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:50.280]  now this is their wording, they say go ahead and assign a premise number to those who do
[3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:56.160]  not want one and put an elastic by saying it was not with their consent.
[3:25:56.160 --> 3:26:03.440]  And that's indentured servitude, making the professionals go out and enforce things that
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:04.440]  aren't even laws.
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:07.520]  Let's do a minute or two on the other side if you can because I want to give out your
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:09.480]  phone number so folks can contact you.
[3:26:09.480 --> 3:26:16.360]  Russell's also a former school teacher, owner of cable enterprises, owner of radio stations
[3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:21.320]  and movie theaters and he's out there fighting big brother.
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:29.240]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:33.760]  Hello, I'm Steve Scheng.
[3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:38.000]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:40.760]  they should be finished stocking up on food.
[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:44.920]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that were
[3:26:44.920 --> 3:26:49.480]  desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:51.360]  increasingly hot water.
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:53.760]  Well snap out of it, we now have a deadline.
[3:26:53.760 --> 3:26:55.960]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:00.600]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about
[3:27:00.600 --> 3:27:05.360]  January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to
[3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:07.760]  make unpopular decisions.
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:12.000]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:14.200]  prior to the inauguration.
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:19.360]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:23.640]  Ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:28.360]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:27:28.360 --> 3:27:32.680]  Hi, this is Steve Scheng.
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:35.280]  The spirit of America is independence.
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:38.000]  The greatest gift of independence is food.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:42.840]  Over one-third of Americans can't afford to buy food and pay their other expenses.
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:46.440]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or cancelled.
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:51.400]  Last year the eFoodsDirect holiday food unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with
[3:27:51.400 --> 3:27:52.800]  a great price.
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:57.920]  This year to quickly complete our food supply preparations, eFoodsDirect has created a very
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:28:00.200]  serious holiday unit.
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:05.520]  This super food supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:06.640]  more food.
[3:28:06.640 --> 3:28:10.520]  That's safe food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries.
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:15.040]  Gift certificates are available for shipments that will not arrive by Christmas.
[3:28:15.040 --> 3:28:18.000]  Food is the gift of life and love this holiday season.
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:23.920]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:27.040]  That's 800-409-5633.
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:30.840]  That's 800-409-5633.
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:36.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:37.620]  against this country.
[3:28:37.620 --> 3:28:39.720]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:28:39.720 --> 3:28:41.840]  But who is the enemy?
[3:28:41.840 --> 3:28:42.840]  In Latin.
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:43.840]  This is his MO.
[3:28:43.840 --> 3:28:46.960]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:51.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:54.200]  networks inside the United States.
[3:28:54.200 --> 3:28:58.680]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:28:58.680 --> 3:29:00.840]  in and on the U.S.
[3:29:00.840 --> 3:29:04.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:29:04.440 --> 3:29:09.960]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:14.000]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:16.200]  much more, fabled enemies.
[3:29:16.200 --> 3:29:21.120]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of
[3:29:21.120 --> 3:29:23.720]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:49.960]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:29:49.960 --> 3:30:10.080]  I've only got about 26 and a half minutes left in the broadcast today, I could talk for
[3:30:10.080 --> 3:30:19.920]  hours with Russell Wood, former president of the Ozark chapter of a group that is fighting
[3:30:19.920 --> 3:30:24.240]  against the NIS, the animal ID, the premise society, all of it.
[3:30:24.240 --> 3:30:28.080]  Russell Wood, go ahead and fire out the phone number for Missourians out there that are
[3:30:28.080 --> 3:30:30.040]  listening and people around the country.
[3:30:30.040 --> 3:30:33.680]  Similar things are happening everywhere that are fighting against this feudalism, forcing
[3:30:33.680 --> 3:30:39.280]  people without a law to have animal ID, microchips in their animals, premise society, making you
[3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:41.320]  register your property and be able to hunt on your own property.
[3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:47.040]  Then we're going to go to our next guest and the director, Maurice Thompson of the Buckeye
[3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:52.240]  Institute for Constitutional Law, and that deals with this amazing case that WorldNet
[3:30:52.240 --> 3:30:54.440]  Daily and others have been covering.
[3:30:54.440 --> 3:30:56.160]  Well, WorldNet Daily finally got on it yesterday.
[3:30:56.160 --> 3:30:57.160]  We've been covering it for two weeks.
[3:30:57.160 --> 3:31:03.880]  We're going to have armed officers raid home, hold mom kids for six hours overselling organic
[3:31:03.880 --> 3:31:11.280]  eggs and things like that, SWAT team holding them at gunpoint for more than six hours.
[3:31:11.280 --> 3:31:16.040]  We'll talk about that with a constitutional law expert who is filing a case against this
[3:31:16.040 --> 3:31:20.480]  particular state that's done this, and there's just too many of these cases, even cover them
[3:31:20.480 --> 3:31:21.480]  all.
[3:31:21.480 --> 3:31:24.440]  We're just covering a few of them today, people being arrested or fined or feed for giving
[3:31:24.440 --> 3:31:25.440]  their neighbors milk.
[3:31:25.440 --> 3:31:27.480]  I mean, it's total control.
[3:31:27.480 --> 3:31:32.120]  This whole thing is pointed at the American people, but Russell Wood, give out your number
[3:31:32.120 --> 3:31:35.960]  for folks that want to be able to help you fight back against what's happening.
[3:31:35.960 --> 3:31:48.840]  My number, area code 417-948-2379, and we're getting some no hunting posters made up that
[3:31:48.840 --> 3:31:54.520]  we hope to get distributed throughout the state to let them see that these are areas
[3:31:54.520 --> 3:32:02.840]  that are going to be taken out of use for those who buy their tags from the state, let
[3:32:02.840 --> 3:32:04.840]  them go hunt on state property.
[3:32:04.840 --> 3:32:07.840]  All right, give your number out again one more time, sir, and then I want to have you
[3:32:07.840 --> 3:32:11.040]  back up, because I know you've been leading the fight in Missouri against the animal ID
[3:32:11.040 --> 3:32:14.960]  and premises ID successfully, so I want to have you back up separately in the next few
[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:18.240]  weeks on that subject, but I'll give your number.
[3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:19.240]  417-948-2379.
[3:32:19.240 --> 3:32:25.000]  All right, Russell, we'll talk to you again soon.
[3:32:25.000 --> 3:32:26.000]  Thanks for the time.
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:27.000]  Thank you.
[3:32:27.000 --> 3:32:28.000]  You bet.
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:29.000]  Now, I want to hurry.
[3:32:29.000 --> 3:32:31.640]  I got a few sponsors I want to tell you about that make this broadcast possible, and then
[3:32:31.640 --> 3:32:35.200]  we're going to go to our next guest who's holding patiently.
[3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:37.880]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, eFoods Direct.
[3:32:37.880 --> 3:32:40.840]  They are the best storeable foods company out there bar none.
[3:32:40.840 --> 3:32:45.760]  The longest continually operating, non-GMO, clean, healthy food.
[3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:49.360]  In these uncertain times, you need to have storeable foods, you need to be prepared,
[3:32:49.360 --> 3:32:54.160]  you need to be off the grid, because, again, we're going into a deep recession, could be
[3:32:54.160 --> 3:32:55.760]  a depression.
[3:32:55.760 --> 3:33:00.260]  There's so many reasons to have storeable food, firearms, and to be self-sufficient, so please
[3:33:00.260 --> 3:33:04.000]  go to eFoodsDirect.com, you'll never have to stand on the bread line.
[3:33:04.000 --> 3:33:08.320]  If you have your own bread at last more than 10 years, it's high quality, no MSG.
[3:33:08.320 --> 3:33:16.560]  Your toll free number to call them is 800-409-5633-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:33:16.560 --> 3:33:24.640]  Then there's also another great sponsor that we have that I want to tell the listeners
[3:33:24.640 --> 3:33:27.680]  about, and that is Acola Bloom.
[3:33:27.680 --> 3:33:35.560]  And Acola Bloom is an atmospheric water generator, and it grabs the water out of the air, seven
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:42.040]  plus gallons a day with their smaller units, and then puts it through five different, well
[3:33:42.040 --> 3:33:46.240]  really seven filters, because one filter has three elements, but five separate filtration
[3:33:46.240 --> 3:33:50.880]  systems, and it's the purest, cleanest drinking water you can find anywhere.
[3:33:50.880 --> 3:33:52.600]  I have one in the office, one at home.
[3:33:52.600 --> 3:34:02.240]  I absolutely love them, acolablue.com, e-c-o-l-o-blue.com, or 866-585-4044, 866-585-4044, and all over
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:07.760]  the nation on this feudalism issue of the people being enslaved with classical tyranny.
[3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:11.360]  They're trying to tell folks they've got to register their wells, or put meters on their
[3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:16.360]  wells, or tax them for their wells, even water wells for their homes, in some cases hundred
[3:34:16.360 --> 3:34:19.720]  year old wells, well they're not going to be able to stop you getting water out of the
[3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:20.720]  air.
[3:34:20.720 --> 3:34:26.640]  Of course, I don't want to give them any ideas, e-colablue.com, or 866-585-4044.
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:28.600]  We have to become self-sufficient.
[3:34:28.600 --> 3:34:32.400]  The establishment certainly doesn't want that to happen.
[3:34:32.400 --> 3:34:38.000]  Okay, we are joined next by Maurice Thompson, director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:41.520]  Law, working with the Buckeye Institute.
[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:47.400]  The case of the Man of Storehouse, a few years ago, this farming family, organic farmers,
[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:52.920]  started buying other peoples and producing their own organic foods, eggs, and things
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:56.480]  like that, and they had a little storehouse in their home, and they would sell a few thousand
[3:34:56.480 --> 3:35:01.080]  dollars a month to their neighbors, or they would pull together to buy organic food and
[3:35:01.080 --> 3:35:03.320]  bring it into their community with just a few of their neighbors.
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:08.680]  Well, they got SWAT-teamed brutally, and again, I see these cases all the time.
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:14.880]  I mean, we can have thousands dead on the Texas border from the drug war, we can have
[3:35:14.880 --> 3:35:18.840]  all sorts of corruption everywhere, trillions being stolen by brokerage firms, just out
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:23.360]  and out criminality, but the system is all focused on squeezing the cattle, milking the
[3:35:23.360 --> 3:35:24.760]  American people.
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:27.720]  So Maurice Thompson, thank you for coming on with us.
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:28.720]  No problem, Alex.
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:29.720]  How do you do?
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:30.720]  Good, sir.
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:32.880]  Break down the facts of what happened in this case.
[3:35:32.880 --> 3:35:35.840]  Tell us about why you've joined the case and where this is going.
[3:35:35.840 --> 3:35:36.840]  Certainly.
[3:35:36.840 --> 3:35:40.760]  Well, let me talk about that latter part first, and then I'll come back and circle around
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:41.760]  to the facts.
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:45.080]  First of all, your segue into this couldn't have been any better, even your advertisements,
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:49.360]  because that's what this is really about, is the most basic and fundamental of human
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:50.360]  rights.
[3:35:50.360 --> 3:35:55.480]  And it's a battle over what behavior we can engage in without a government permission
[3:35:55.480 --> 3:36:01.360]  slip, and this simple behavior is the behavior that our grandparents engaged in, Americans
[3:36:01.360 --> 3:36:05.240]  for generations have, which is riding down the road and picking up some food from the
[3:36:05.240 --> 3:36:07.560]  local farmer.
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:13.200]  The Buckeye Institute is an organization in Ohio dedicated to limited government, dedicated
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:17.560]  to free markets, and generally the right to be left alone by the government, so long
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:19.960]  as you're not hurting anybody else.
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:25.400]  The reason we picked up on this case is because it implicates a couple really important concerns.
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:29.520]  One that I've already mentioned, which is what activity, what basic activity really
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:34.520]  deserves to be licensed and can be licensed under the Constitution.
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:39.720]  And the second is, when is it constantly tuitionally permissible for officers to use this kind
[3:36:39.720 --> 3:36:44.240]  of force in raiding somebody's personal home?
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:48.520]  Now if I can circle back around and talk about the facts of this case, the Stowers family,
[3:36:48.520 --> 3:36:53.560]  the family lives in a very rural Amish part of Ohio, they themselves aren't Amish, but
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:58.040]  they're very religious, they have a great number of children in the house, they have
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:37:02.160]  eight of their own children, six are young and still live there, and four grandchildren
[3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:06.720]  that are staying in the home, why the second oldest son is over serving in Iraq, his wife
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:09.040]  is staying with them.
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:13.400]  The religious at home school, their children, they are classically independent, off the
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:17.600]  grid people, they don't rely on the government for their food or for their education.
[3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:21.920]  They've run this co-op, this family run food co-op for six to seven years, and they have
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:27.680]  their own 20-some-acre small farm where they have sheep, that they butcher for meat, and
[3:37:27.680 --> 3:37:30.840]  goats, and they can get milk from them as well.
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:36.640]  And they've also got connections to Amish farmers who have grass-fed cattle, and pastured
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:43.040]  chickens, and pesticide-free produce, and they procure all these things through their
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:44.040]  co-op.
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:48.080]  Those of Stalin wouldn't have liked this, Hitler wouldn't have liked this, for those
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:53.240]  that don't know, authoritarian states always shackle and control small farms.
[3:37:53.240 --> 3:37:55.480]  They hate people being independent.
[3:37:55.480 --> 3:38:02.040]  This is 180 degrees the opposite of what this republic is supposed to be, this is outrageous.
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:07.560]  That's exactly right, you know, Thomas Jefferson envisioned a nation of small farmers.
[3:38:07.560 --> 3:38:13.320]  And right, exactly, and now what we have is small farmers being squeezed by these regulations,
[3:38:13.320 --> 3:38:18.840]  and you know, it's one of two things, it really is either a government interest in really
[3:38:18.840 --> 3:38:22.640]  tightly controlling the food supply, or it's just government as a big dumb animal that
[3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:25.280]  backs its way into an unsafe situation.
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:28.400]  Well, to interrupt, I have a lot of their own documents where they say they've got to
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:32.720]  break down the family, break down the farm, the family's a disease, and they know people
[3:38:32.720 --> 3:38:37.200]  are exiting the cities, they're kind of going into Amish light by the hundreds of thousands
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:42.080]  a year, they see that trend going into the millions a year, I'm considering evacuating
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:45.520]  to the countryside, and I live right here in Austin, Texas, just because the cities are
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:51.360]  so degenerate, the culture is so evil, the crime is exploding, and they don't like it.
[3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:54.760]  The system does not want people going back to the land.
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:38:59.360]  Well, but it's not, you know what, it's not just nefarious government officials, it's
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:04.640]  government officials who are persuaded by special interest groups, and government really
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:09.440]  should not be the pliable tool of special interest groups, but all too often it is.
[3:39:09.440 --> 3:39:12.960]  If you look at the regulation that they're charged with violating, they're charged with
[3:39:12.960 --> 3:39:16.320]  being a retail food establishment without a license.
[3:39:16.320 --> 3:39:20.920]  First of all, they're not even a retail food establishment, they're basically a members
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:26.240]  only, private membership organization buying club, it's as though, you know, if you and
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:30.360]  I want to buy the right kind of beef from an Amish farmer, we have to buy the whole
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:31.360]  cow.
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:32.360]  You know what I'm saying?
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:33.360]  This is free association.
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:34.360]  Right.
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:38.040]  If I want to go buy a duck or a chicken or a cow or a pig or their eggs, or if I want
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:44.840]  to get together with 10 families to pool money to buy organic food, I mean, this is ridiculous.
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:45.840]  This is disgusting.
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:46.840]  That's exactly right.
[3:39:46.840 --> 3:39:47.840]  Let's get into the right.
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:48.840]  I'll quit interrupting.
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:49.840]  That's exactly right.
[3:39:49.840 --> 3:39:55.320]  And you know, the thing I was going to mention is that there are actually 22 exemptions to
[3:39:55.320 --> 3:39:59.540]  this retail food establishment law, but you know, as Nobel economist Milton Friedman
[3:39:59.540 --> 3:40:05.200]  pointed out many years ago, the guys that are writing the licensure laws most of the
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:11.560]  time are the industry people themselves and their lobbyists, everybody with a lobbyist
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:15.360]  sits down at the table and writes the law and guess who gets left out of that process?
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:23.560]  The small family farmer, the organic co-operative runner who doesn't have a lobbyist down in
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:26.880]  Columbus or down in Washington to exempt them.
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:29.880]  So you've got a number of people, you know, the government will argue this is a public
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:35.160]  safety issue, but the truth is there are a whole slew of people who run more dangerous
[3:40:35.160 --> 3:40:39.680]  food operations, if dangerous at all, than the Stowers family.
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:43.480]  Well, look, they've shut down most of the family farms with regulations.
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:48.080]  We know Animal ID and Primitive Society was openly written by big agribusiness to put
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:51.240]  expenses on small farms and ranches to bankrupt them.
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:52.880]  That's what big corporations always do.
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:56.080]  Let's get into the right itself and where you're going with this.
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:40:57.080]  Absolutely.
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:00.600]  Well, it's important to know some of the facts leading up to the right.
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:03.920]  The health department came out and investigated these people and we don't know why.
[3:41:03.920 --> 3:41:06.200]  There was never a report filed against them.
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:07.600]  None of their members are disgruntled.
[3:41:07.600 --> 3:41:10.520]  They're very, very happy with the product they get from this family because the food's
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:12.840]  cheap and it's good for them and they're happy.
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:17.720]  Just how dare Americans be working with their neighbors and selling chicken eggs.
[3:41:17.720 --> 3:41:18.720]  That's Alcada.
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:20.520]  The government's got to run everything.
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:21.520]  Right.
[3:41:21.520 --> 3:41:25.320]  God forbid we have freedom to contract among consenting adults who want to protect their
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:26.920]  own health interests.
[3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:32.680]  Well, you know, there was never any report filed, but the health department came out,
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:34.640]  said they might need a license.
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:38.240]  The family responded by writing a letter to the health department asking for clarification
[3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:39.520]  on the law and asking for evidence.
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:43.160]  Well, just being able to write probably angered the health department because the general
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:44.160]  public's on it.
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:45.160]  Well.
[3:41:45.160 --> 3:41:48.360]  Flora and Prozac are going, they said, look, we got one that knows how to write.
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:41:49.800]  Send a SWAT team immediately.
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:41:51.400]  That's Alcada for sure.
[3:41:51.400 --> 3:41:53.120]  Well, the health department didn't like it.
[3:41:53.120 --> 3:41:54.120]  You're right.
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:56.680]  Because whenever individuals defend their rights against the government, the government's
[3:41:56.680 --> 3:42:00.000]  never too happy because these people have some imperial hubris about them.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  They do.
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:04.400]  They don't like, the director of the health department didn't like the tone of the letter.
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:06.920]  So he brought in a hire because it was inquisitive.
[3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:08.040]  It wasn't nasty at all.
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:09.480]  We have a copy of it.
[3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:10.480]  And he brought in a hire.
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:11.480]  You write me a letter, boy.
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:12.480]  I send a SWAT team.
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:16.880]  You think in America, you can write a letter to the government, I'm sending our men to
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:17.880]  show you.
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:23.680]  Well, first they sent an Ohio Department of Agriculture official who basically treated
[3:42:23.680 --> 3:42:26.120]  this like a drug investigation.
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:29.960]  He went undercover and tried to join the co-op as a member.
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:32.000]  Of course, they could, you know, they could.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:35.520]  Yeah, they're shifting their whole fake war on drugs that they admit was really meant
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:36.640]  to get spies.
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:39.480]  Now they're shifting it onto organic farmers, see?
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:40.480]  Right.
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:43.880]  War on drug tactics are dangerous and they have been for a long time.
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:48.160]  And now we do see some of the issues with that where these same drug war tactics are
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.920]  being used against people who everybody now has to acknowledge are not a danger to anyone.
[3:42:53.920 --> 3:42:55.400]  These are peaceful, real people.
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:42:56.400]  No, no.
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:42:57.400]  It's evil.
[3:42:57.400 --> 3:42:58.400]  And these same tactics are being used.
[3:42:58.400 --> 3:43:01.200]  However, he surveilled them, he attempted to join their co-op.
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:02.200]  He's a stuzzy spy.
[3:43:02.200 --> 3:43:03.200]  This is like Russia.
[3:43:03.200 --> 3:43:04.200]  Spying on a little farm.
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:05.200]  Go ahead.
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:06.200]  Right.
[3:43:06.200 --> 3:43:08.440]  And for two hours, he tried to arm-twist them and to join the co-op.
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:09.440]  They told him no.
[3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:11.400]  He told them a bunch of lies.
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:16.040]  He told them he had a sick mother and these eggs, these unpastured chicken eggs would
[3:43:16.040 --> 3:43:17.040]  make her better.
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:19.080]  You know, can you please share these with me?
[3:43:19.080 --> 3:43:22.080]  They said they really weren't interested in dealing with him because they're a private
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:24.560]  membership organization.
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:25.560]  He continued to twist their arm.
[3:43:25.560 --> 3:43:26.560]  He wouldn't leave their house.
[3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:29.640]  Eventually, they said, here, just take the eggs and get out here, please.
[3:43:29.640 --> 3:43:34.440]  That's like the Mennonite farmer that said, okay, I'll give you milk.
[3:43:34.440 --> 3:43:35.440]  That's it.
[3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:36.440]  Swat team, baby.
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:40.920]  And that was in Ohio case two, I believe, in the same Ohio Department of Agriculture
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:42.640]  that is engaging in these activities.
[3:43:42.640 --> 3:43:46.360]  They're very much a rogue agency that's very much out of control and needs to be reigned
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:47.360]  in.
[3:43:47.360 --> 3:43:48.360]  You're exactly right.
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:54.120]  And so, you know, he basically, nine times out of 10 when I hear the word entrapment,
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:43:57.520]  it doesn't interest me because I think it's a little overblown.
[3:43:57.520 --> 3:44:02.200]  But this is a real case of the government manufacturing a crime over eggs to catch a
[3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:03.200]  crime.
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:04.200]  Exactly.
[3:44:04.200 --> 3:44:07.560]  How many times growing up did we pull over and buy eggs at some little place where they're
[3:44:07.560 --> 3:44:08.560]  selling eggs?
[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:09.560]  Exactly.
[3:44:09.560 --> 3:44:10.560]  You can't do that in America.
[3:44:10.560 --> 3:44:11.560]  You've got to buy it at Walmart.
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:12.800]  You've got to buy a radiated egg.
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:14.920]  How dare you pull over and get a fresh egg?
[3:44:14.920 --> 3:44:15.920]  Oh, my God.
[3:44:15.920 --> 3:44:16.920]  You probably know.
[3:44:16.920 --> 3:44:21.560]  There is no more fundamental of right, especially when you're talking about basic food.
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:23.400]  You know, it really doesn't get any more fun.
[3:44:23.400 --> 3:44:26.400]  But these parasites, tell them what the parasites did.
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:34.000]  Well, based upon this one alleged sale of eggs, this retail sale, quote unquote, the
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:40.520]  OD agent went and procured a search warrant and then he exaggerated the situation and
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:45.680]  got the right to search the family's entire personal residence, not just the part where
[3:44:45.680 --> 3:44:47.400]  the co-op was.
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:53.960]  So on December 1st in the morning, armed officers surrounded the house and then went
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:56.360]  in with guns drawn.
[3:44:56.360 --> 3:45:01.520]  The lead officer was a violent fugitive task force officer at his specialization.
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:03.880]  Well, these are violent people.
[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:04.880]  That's right.
[3:45:04.880 --> 3:45:07.880]  People that make eggs, I mean, I have chickens or al-Qaeda.
[3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:09.880]  Well, that's their duty for the country.
[3:45:09.880 --> 3:45:17.680]  Black helmets and machine guns, oh God, Americans with eggs, oh Lord, oh God, what am I going
[3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:18.680]  to do?
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:25.120]  Well, and you know, the thing is, if the police had no reason to be so forceful or to be scared
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:28.880]  and wetting themselves with concern over this family, except that FEMA teaches them that
[3:45:28.880 --> 3:45:31.400]  rural people are terrorists, have you seen those training videos?
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:36.520]  Well, if you look at the definition of terrorism in the Ohio revised code and then you compare
[3:45:36.520 --> 3:45:43.440]  it to what happened to these people, you may find that that fits the facts of the crime.
[3:45:43.440 --> 3:45:44.440]  That's right.
[3:45:44.440 --> 3:45:47.920]  Under the new Federal Patriot Act, any action that's a misdemeanor basically in Section
[3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:51.080]  802, but tell folks, aiming guns at the children.
[3:45:51.080 --> 3:45:57.480]  Well, to be fair, Alex, some of the blog facts initially reported were overblown, but that
[3:45:57.480 --> 3:45:59.320]  doesn't diminish the significance of those.
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:00.720]  So these armed men, what did they do?
[3:46:00.720 --> 3:46:01.720]  What did they do?
[3:46:01.720 --> 3:46:02.720]  Right.
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:06.360]  This wasn't, this was not a SWAT team, but it was police using SWAT-like tactics.
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:11.240]  They burst through into the house after the door was opened before they obtained any kind
[3:46:11.240 --> 3:46:13.160]  of consent to enter.
[3:46:13.160 --> 3:46:14.480]  They burst through the house.
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:19.000]  They locked it down as though it were enemy battle territory.
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:24.560]  They ushered the whole family by force into one small room where numerous agents from
[3:46:24.560 --> 3:46:29.000]  health departments and from the Department of Agriculture came in, combed over their
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:32.680]  entire personal residence, took all of their personal food.
[3:46:32.680 --> 3:46:38.480]  This is a family of 10 who had just butchered a large part of their herd of sheep, and they
[3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:40.280]  took all of this meat from this family.
[3:46:40.280 --> 3:46:42.120]  And I'm sure the government targeted it.
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:45.600]  I'm sure they targeted them to try to bankrupt, and that's also a tactic.
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:46.800]  That's actually exactly right.
[3:46:46.800 --> 3:46:49.760]  They were trying to set up some sort of controlled buy, and they were waiting for this meat to
[3:46:49.760 --> 3:46:53.440]  get back to the family to do this, and of course they had to wait so long that they
[3:46:53.440 --> 3:46:57.320]  were outside of the scope of the warrant, which had actually expired by the time they
[3:46:57.320 --> 3:46:58.320]  did this.
[3:46:58.320 --> 3:47:00.040]  So they're in the house.
[3:47:00.040 --> 3:47:03.960]  They take all of this, they take the personal computers of the family, they take the personal
[3:47:03.960 --> 3:47:10.880]  cell phone, they take everything from this family, and they still have a lot of these
[3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:11.880]  things.
[3:47:11.880 --> 3:47:15.960]  They've just given back some of the computers and cell phones, but they've kept the rest,
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:17.760]  and they're now looking to press criminal charges.
[3:47:17.760 --> 3:47:18.760]  All right, stay there.
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:21.560]  I'm going to skip this break for the Prison Planet on TV viewers.
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:23.840]  Everybody else, we're back in three minutes.
[3:47:23.840 --> 3:47:30.720]  With our guests, stay with us.
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:35.760]  All right, sir, we're going to skip this break, and we come back to the full audience.
[3:47:35.760 --> 3:47:36.760]  Some stations aren't with us now.
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:40.320]  I want to give out your website for folks to support you and to help you.
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:44.520]  And again, I'm trying to illustrate how absurd all this is with all of my screwing around,
[3:47:44.520 --> 3:47:45.520]  but I'm not screwing around.
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:49.280]  I mean, this is for folks that don't know, is this not, I mean, as a constitutional lawyer
[3:47:49.280 --> 3:47:52.200]  yourself, classical Stalinist tyranny?
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:54.240]  Well, here's the real problem.
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:47:57.400]  I think that you're, I think you're fairly correct.
[3:47:57.400 --> 3:48:01.560]  And you can, you know, the whole argument that this is a public safety issue is undermined
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:04.960]  by the fact that there are 22 exemptions to the law.
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:08.920]  I mean, and these are people that are treated no differently than the Stowers, or they treat
[3:48:08.920 --> 3:48:13.120]  their food no differently than the Stowers, other than it's an unconventional.
[3:48:13.120 --> 3:48:14.800]  Why were the police so jacked up?
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:19.320]  I mean, why were they relishing, putting so much manpower, not into missing children,
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:25.120]  not into car thefts, not into home invasions or rapes, but casing and spying and tracking
[3:48:25.120 --> 3:48:27.400]  egg cellars?
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:32.320]  It's really not clear whether they're trying to enhance their own bureaucratic self-interest,
[3:48:32.320 --> 3:48:36.440]  trying to justify their existence as a bureaucracy.
[3:48:36.440 --> 3:48:40.920]  It's really not clear, but here's the important thing to know about your fourth amendment right
[3:48:40.920 --> 3:48:46.760]  when it relates to search and seizure here is that, you know, these paramilitary raids
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:52.320]  are on the rise, and they're on the rise for offenses like this, alleged offenses like this,
[3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:55.200]  that at best are licensure law violations.
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:48:59.760]  And the police don't have the right to use this kind of force on peaceful people.
[3:48:59.760 --> 3:49:04.680]  The reason that this not going to announce rule was put into place, and the only reason
[3:49:04.680 --> 3:49:10.120]  that it can be violated are when there's either one, worry that the evidence is going to be
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:15.160]  destroyed, or two, there's worry that the people inside are armed and dangerous and
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:17.360]  going for their guns.
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:21.120]  And there is never any indication that these people were going to destroy evidence.
[3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:25.440]  But see now they say, now they say you're a gun owner though, that's their excuse to
[3:49:25.440 --> 3:49:26.520]  go after you.
[3:49:26.520 --> 3:49:32.160]  Well, you know what, I wouldn't have been surprised to have seen that in the affidavit
[3:49:32.160 --> 3:49:35.440]  that procure the search warrant, but not even that much was alleged.
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:38.240]  There was no allegation in the affidavit that these people were dangerous.
[3:49:38.240 --> 3:49:42.360]  Now have they given back their food, or are they just letting it all spoil?
[3:49:42.360 --> 3:49:48.640]  Well, right now they're, I've been told they're storing it in undisclosed location somewhere,
[3:49:48.640 --> 3:49:52.320]  and they say that it's being kept frozen.
[3:49:52.320 --> 3:49:53.320]  We don't know.
[3:49:53.320 --> 3:49:55.800]  We've had, I wouldn't be surprised.
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:49:59.800]  We've asked for the food back, and we've asked for compensation in the event that they won't
[3:49:59.800 --> 3:50:00.800]  give the food back.
[3:50:00.800 --> 3:50:01.800]  Well, you're suing it now.
[3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:02.800]  Absolutely.
[3:50:02.800 --> 3:50:06.560]  So when we come back in the final five minutes, I'm going to try to shut up and let you finish
[3:50:06.560 --> 3:50:12.240]  up what really happened inside of there for the six plus hours, and now where this case
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:16.640]  is going, and then of course give out the Buckeye Institute website, the Center for
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:21.360]  Constitutional Law for our substantive audience so they can, and then I'll have you back sometime
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:24.800]  in the near future for a full hour to explain to people their basic rights that if we don't
[3:50:24.800 --> 3:50:30.040]  fight for, we'll disappear, here we go.
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:41.000]  If you don't fight for a right, it dies, we must animate our liberties, our freedoms,
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:46.440]  and the tyranny unfolding against humanity right now is just off the charts.
[3:50:46.440 --> 3:50:51.360]  You know, in the behind the scenes talk on PresidentPlanet.TV with our guest, Maurice
[3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:56.840]  Thompson, constitutional law scholar, and a director over there at the Constitutional
[3:50:56.840 --> 3:51:03.920]  Law Center with the Buckeye Institute.
[3:51:03.920 --> 3:51:09.120]  You were talking about paramilitary raids on peaceful people for, you know, tiny things
[3:51:09.120 --> 3:51:13.840]  that might be a $50 fine, though they had exemptions.
[3:51:13.840 --> 3:51:16.560]  Finish up with that and then what happened in the raid and then where the lawsuits going
[3:51:16.560 --> 3:51:18.120]  and give folks the website.
[3:51:18.120 --> 3:51:19.120]  Sure, Alex.
[3:51:19.120 --> 3:51:22.920]  I'll reiterate what I told you over the break, and that is that one of the things we're fighting
[3:51:22.920 --> 3:51:27.160]  for here are people's Fourth Amendment rights.
[3:51:27.160 --> 3:51:33.360]  And you know, courts have spoken to this issue over and over again for hundreds of years,
[3:51:33.360 --> 3:51:37.200]  and that is that there is a man's home is his castle, and there's a certain amount of
[3:51:37.200 --> 3:51:42.160]  dignity and privacy that people are allowed to be entitled to in the home, and that prohibits
[3:51:42.160 --> 3:51:49.400]  these kind of Russian forced paramilitary-style raids unless they're absolutely necessary,
[3:51:49.400 --> 3:51:52.440]  and they're necessary either where there's imminent danger that the evidence is going
[3:51:52.440 --> 3:51:56.720]  to be destroyed or where there's imminent danger to the police because people might
[3:51:56.720 --> 3:51:58.400]  go for their guns.
[3:51:58.400 --> 3:52:01.840]  Here there was no allegation of that, and more and more common, we're seeing these kinds
[3:52:01.840 --> 3:52:06.560]  of raids on people where there is no worry about evidence and no worry about danger.
[3:52:06.560 --> 3:52:10.400]  And we believe that that actually violates the People's Fourth Amendment rights because
[3:52:10.400 --> 3:52:15.680]  even if you've got a search warrant, the search and seizure has to be conducted reasonably,
[3:52:15.680 --> 3:52:17.560]  and we think that's inherently unreasonable.
[3:52:17.560 --> 3:52:20.520]  So finish up with what happened in the house and where you're going from now.
[3:52:20.520 --> 3:52:21.520]  Sure.
[3:52:21.520 --> 3:52:26.480]  Well, the authorities come in, they seize all the family's personal food supply, and
[3:52:26.480 --> 3:52:30.520]  they take a bunch of other food that actually belongs to other members of the co-op who
[3:52:30.520 --> 3:52:34.960]  haven't picked it up yet, since it had been delivered perhaps.
[3:52:34.960 --> 3:52:40.200]  They keep the family for six hours in this small part of the house as they do all these
[3:52:40.200 --> 3:52:41.200]  things.
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:45.560]  Small children who, being homeschooled, are used to a peaceful environment and never
[3:52:45.560 --> 3:52:49.960]  experience such a thing and are still a little bit shook up not to mention how the parents
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:50.960]  view it.
[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:56.440]  Well, they take all these things, and they take off eventually.
[3:52:56.440 --> 3:52:58.400]  They took computers too, right?
[3:52:58.400 --> 3:52:59.720]  They took the family's personal computer.
[3:52:59.720 --> 3:53:03.320]  They took the computers that the homeschool lessons are on, and they took the computers
[3:53:03.320 --> 3:53:08.440]  that the daughter uses to talk to her husband who's fighting for our country in Iraq.
[3:53:08.440 --> 3:53:11.800]  They took all the family's personal cell phones.
[3:53:11.800 --> 3:53:16.880]  They took way more than they had a justification to take, and this happens pretty commonly.
[3:53:16.880 --> 3:53:21.720]  Again, these are drug war tactics, and this was a drug war-style raid, and now we're
[3:53:21.720 --> 3:53:22.720]  taking expansion.
[3:53:22.720 --> 3:53:25.000]  Right, we're seeing the expansion of those tactics.
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:27.840]  And you were telling me they won't give the food back now, so who knows what's happened
[3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:28.840]  to it.
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:29.840]  What does this go?
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:30.840]  You're suing them now.
[3:53:30.840 --> 3:53:31.840]  What are you suing them for?
[3:53:31.840 --> 3:53:32.840]  How do we support you?
[3:53:32.840 --> 3:53:33.840]  Well, here's what's important.
[3:53:33.840 --> 3:53:34.840]  Is it the family?
[3:53:34.840 --> 3:53:36.600]  Is it a religious, peaceful family?
[3:53:36.600 --> 3:53:37.760]  They're not out for blood.
[3:53:37.760 --> 3:53:39.320]  They're not even out for money.
[3:53:39.320 --> 3:53:43.960]  Arguably, they have a strong Section 1983 action for money from the officers for the
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:46.840]  violation of the constitutional rights, but they want two things.
[3:53:46.840 --> 3:53:53.080]  We're suing for an injunction declaring that these kinds of paramilitary raids on peaceful
[3:53:53.080 --> 3:53:57.760]  people are inherently unconstitutional and have to be stopped.
[3:53:57.760 --> 3:54:03.080]  We're suing for the court to declare that, and we're also suing for a declaration that
[3:54:03.080 --> 3:54:08.480]  small family farms and co-ops do not require a government permission slip and are in fact
[3:54:08.480 --> 3:54:13.760]  exempt from the licensure law or need to be exempt under the licensure law, because
[3:54:13.760 --> 3:54:18.880]  under equal protection, these kinds of licensures were required for a large, giant eagle or a
[3:54:18.880 --> 3:54:19.880]  Walmart produce.
[3:54:19.880 --> 3:54:20.880]  What are they going to do?
[3:54:20.880 --> 3:54:24.600]  Start raiding guys selling firewood or beef jerky or watermelons?
[3:54:24.600 --> 3:54:25.600]  How about lemonade stands?
[3:54:25.600 --> 3:54:27.600]  I mean, it could be anything, but there's no logical way.
[3:54:27.600 --> 3:54:28.600]  All right.
[3:54:28.600 --> 3:54:29.600]  Fire out the website.
[3:54:29.600 --> 3:54:31.760]  I want to have you back up for a full hour after the holidays to track what's happening.
[3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:34.480]  Fire out the Buckeye Institute so folks can support it.
[3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:38.920]  It's www.buckeyeinstitute.org.org.
[3:54:38.920 --> 3:54:42.560]  We do need help with cases like this, and we want to bring more of these cases in the
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:47.680]  future, so any donations are great, and we can also donate to the family of people ear
[3:54:47.680 --> 3:54:49.880]  market for that purpose.
[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:51.080]  We're happy to take on these cases.
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:55.200]  We're happy to hear from people who have similar cases, and there's a video on their
[3:54:55.200 --> 3:54:57.520]  stowers and our legal filing for their too.
[3:54:57.520 --> 3:54:58.520]  Buckeyeinstitute.org?
[3:54:58.520 --> 3:54:59.520]  Correct.
[3:54:59.520 --> 3:55:00.520]  Thank you, sir.
[3:55:00.520 --> 3:55:01.520]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[3:55:01.520 --> 3:55:02.520]  Have a great weekend.
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:03.520]  And all of you have a great weekend.
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:06.840]  We'll see you back live, 4 to 6 p.m. Sunday, and back here live on Monday.
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:12.840]  Every broadcast starts now on InfoWars.com.
