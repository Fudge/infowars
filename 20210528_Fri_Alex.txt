[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  You say that you wanna go to a land that's far away
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  How are we supposed to get there with the way
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  That we're living today?
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  You talk lots about God
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  Freedom comes from the call
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  But that's not what this bitch wants
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  Not what I want at all
[00:48.000 --> 01:04.000]  I want money, power, and glory
[01:04.000 --> 01:30.000]  I want money, power, and glory
[01:30.000 --> 01:39.000]  I want money, power, and glory
[01:39.000 --> 01:59.000]  I want money, power, and glory
[01:59.000 --> 02:18.000]  I want money, power, and glory
[02:29.000 --> 02:37.000]  Tomorrow's News
[02:37.000 --> 02:56.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones
[02:56.000 --> 03:12.000]  Nothing can stop the truth from coming out
[03:12.000 --> 03:24.000]  The tectonic forces of good versus evil are triggering massive cultural and spiritual and financial awakenings like a volcanic eruption
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday, May 28th global transmission
[03:30.000 --> 03:38.000]  Roger Stone was set to come on today with a lot of inside details of the Deep States plan to indict the president by July 4th
[03:38.000 --> 03:49.000]  That's our big exclusive news, and the fact that we're bringing this out may make them move the goalposts because they don't like showing how incredible our information and research is and our sources
[03:49.000 --> 03:57.000]  But Roger has some extremely sad news, he broke down crying on the phone yesterday morning telling me after he confirmed at the doctor's office
[03:57.000 --> 04:06.000]  His wife has been diagnosed with stage 3 cancer in her lungs and it has spread to different parts of her body
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  So definitely needs some prayers, exclusive, just broke, and we posted it on infowars.com
[04:12.000 --> 04:26.000]  So Roger Stone will be joining us, and I don't even want to look at Twitter as this news goes out, I'm sure the left will be celebrating with extreme pleasure like they always do being the satanic death-loving garbage that they are
[04:26.000 --> 04:34.000]  But we're going to pray that she have a miraculous recovery and see if that's in the cards in God's plan
[04:34.000 --> 04:47.000]  OK, we just have massive news, it's just a huge transmission today on so many fronts, that's just two of the tidbits of really hard of information, but there's a lot more
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  But it's best to get ahead of things, isn't it? It's best to know what's on the side of that door that's about to get blown wide open
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, tomorrow's news, today

[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  Big Brother
[06:12.000 --> 06:25.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny? Well so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[06:25.000 --> 06:45.000]  When my father was complaining as a young boy working on his father and mother's ranch and farm, his father, my grandfather would say to him, David, did you ever hear about the man that had no shoes and felt really sorry for himself to meet
[06:45.000 --> 07:02.000]  a man that had no feet? And here I was the last few days feeling not sorry for myself, but just blown away by the evil of the deep state and things that for a lot of reasons I agree with my advisors, I'm not putting out on air, but we have the deep state, the Democrats
[07:02.000 --> 07:17.000]  literally trying to put me in jail, not for the Capitol, but other things, trying to set me up, trying to pay people to lie about me, and trying to trick me to blackmail me to pay people off for things I didn't do, I'm not stupid
[07:17.000 --> 07:35.000]  So I've got to play this game where I go report it to the FBI, when they try to set me up with Russians that are really FBI, or when they try to set me up with child porn, or things even worse, okay, and so believe me, if you want to know why Trump couldn't get any support in the Capitol
[07:35.000 --> 07:57.000]  and in the White House, and why he couldn't get things done, he got a lot done, but not with his leadership, he had to get done himself, it was because everyone around him was being harassed, everyone around him was being threatened, everyone around him was going through the process that I have not been enjoying for six years
[07:57.000 --> 08:10.000]  That's why people claim, oh, you support Trump because you make so much money when you do it, no, we have actually barely been able to operate and stay on the air in support of Trump
[08:10.000 --> 08:22.000]  That's why it makes it very bittersweet when they steal the election from him, despite all the things we've done and the sacrifices you as a listenership have gone through as well, and our affiliates and so many others, we've all been persecuted
[08:22.000 --> 08:35.000]  But we're not victims, we're overcomers, but it's very frustrating then when Trump does something like go along with the vaccine plan that isn't a vaccine, because he knew they were holding the economy hostage and said, oh, it'll be years till we have it
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  That was their plan to then force a vaccine passport, force a digital ID, if he could make them bring it out early, that plan would fall apart
[08:42.000 --> 09:01.000]  And that's basically what Trump did, but I don't like that middle way, he should have just come out and said it's all a fraud, not that the virus doesn't exist, but that it's not very deadly and not gone along with it, but he did go along with it
[09:01.000 --> 09:13.000]  But before we completely blame Trump at first, I knew it was man-made, I knew it came out of Wuhan, I knew they were exaggerating it, but I still was concerned the first few months in February and March and April
[09:13.000 --> 09:32.000]  And when Trump was saying this is made up virus, this isn't a threat at all, I said, no, it's real, it's not as deadly as they say, but they're going to try to say that Trump didn't protect the country, I said, Trump, you need to shut down the flights from Asia, you need to shut the borders down, or the left's going to blame you for COVID
[09:32.000 --> 09:51.000]  And we were right about that, and so Trump then overcompensated too much into being pro-genetic engineering, so-called vaccine, and so when you're in the arena and you're getting sand thrown in your eyes, you're getting stabbed, you're getting overrun, and you're fighting 10-1
[09:51.000 --> 10:07.000]  And instead of just a gladiator coming out of the bleachers, or a gladiator coming out of the pit, out of that black door that opens up, imagine three or four chariots come rolling out and they're shooting at, you know, arrows at you
[10:07.000 --> 10:22.000]  Like in the movie gladiator that's based on real events they actually did, they would flood the Coliseum routinely with water, 10 feet deep and have ships fighting each other and burning and killing for everybody's entertainment
[10:22.000 --> 10:35.000]  Well imagine Trump's out there by himself basically, and out of these doors just come bigger and bigger attacks, tigers and elephants, and so it's easy to go, oh look, he should have done this, he should have done that
[10:35.000 --> 11:00.000]  But know this, it's the big headline on infowars.com, we can put it up on screen for you here in a little while, it is the show title of the day that the deep state is planning to indict President Trump on or before July 4
[11:00.000 --> 11:17.000]  The word is they're going to indict him going into the July 4 weekend to make that the dominant news, because they know in Arizona and other states the news proving total election fraud has already come out is going to be certified and confirmed
[11:17.000 --> 11:30.000]  And they're going to want to totally overshadow that with indictments by the George Soros operative who swore if she got elected that she would prosecute Trump and put him in prison, Leticia James
[11:30.000 --> 11:49.000]  And I would also look for the southern districts of New York, the FBI and federal grand juries to then indict, sometime after that you're going to see state indictments and then you're going to see federal indictments against Don Jr, Rudolph Giuliani and then the president
[11:49.000 --> 12:05.000]  Because they have to discredit him because he's set to basically when any primary he wants, Town Hall has an excellent analysis of it with these numbers, all Trump has to do is declare his 2024 run and the GOP primaries are over
[12:05.000 --> 12:15.000]  The first time Jackson ran for president they stole it from him and it was well known. So the next time he ran he won by an even bigger landslide
[12:15.000 --> 12:26.000]  And arguments that Trump can be too old in a few years to run around the window because they have a babbling stuttering crypt keeper as the puppet in chief right now
[12:26.000 --> 12:39.000]  And so we have that from sources that are very high up in the southern districts of New York and inside the state of New York. I already have that for my sources
[12:39.000 --> 12:51.000]  And I'm going to leave it at that. I mean I can tell you Republicans are blown away or being told you either join with the New World Order or you too will be indicted next
[12:51.000 --> 13:04.000]  Because if you can indict a former president and had an election stolen from him over 20, 30 year old tax valuations on properties because you always undervalue a property for property tax and then overvalue it when you sell it
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  That's not illegal, that's business, but that's what they're getting ready to indict Trump on and it's just unbelievable
[13:12.000 --> 13:22.000]  With Hunter Biden and the laptop and documents came out yesterday from the laptop that Biden was in the meetings with the Chinese, of course he was
[13:22.000 --> 13:31.000]  There's emails of him saying don't talk to me, talk to my son to former FBI director Louis Free. That's who you give the money to
[13:31.000 --> 13:41.000]  So we are literally overrun by criminal scum and that's why the Chinese won't even talk to Biden, they won't even talk to the Secretary of Defense because they own them
[13:41.000 --> 13:49.000]  In that Asian culture of the Chinese particularly, it's all about who has the power. Same thing with the Japanese system. They know they own Biden
[13:49.000 --> 13:59.000]  So they won't even return his phone calls, talk to him, won't even set up meetings because they don't even want to flaunt the fact that they also own them
[13:59.000 --> 14:09.000]  So we are all in different purposes. America is captured. We are under globalist Chinese occupation and we thought we were too big to fail, too big to fall
[14:09.000 --> 14:20.000]  America is all in and they are preparing to indict the real president, the 45th president, who's been told you keep having those rallies, we're going to indict you
[14:20.000 --> 14:29.000]  Well, his rallies have been announced in Florida and Texas and a few other states and so the way to do this is to take it head on and Trump is going to take it head on
[14:29.000 --> 14:40.000]  And so are we. They plan to arrest us shortly after that, which is fine. I'm extremely honored to be in this position. I mean, that's like winning 50 Oscars
[14:40.000 --> 14:48.000]  I mean, I don't want an Oscar. I don't want to be part of the fake system. It's like winning 100 Nobel prizes. I don't want those. You get those for launching wars
[14:48.000 --> 14:58.000]  I don't want the system's Pulitzer prizes. I don't want any of that. I absolutely want to stand up against evil. And so I don't look forward to being fed into a meat grinder
[14:58.000 --> 15:08.000]  But you know what? That's what it took to build this country and that's what it'll take again. And so I will never be with those timid souls that crouch down and lick the hand and kiss the hand to quote Patrick Henry that feed them
[15:08.000 --> 15:20.000]  But with those in the arena and I'm extremely honored with all of you and to work with the true president who's got his own problems but he's just a man but he's a man that has done what he believed was right
[15:20.000 --> 15:30.000]  And you know a man by his enemies and so that's what's happening. Roger Stone has got more on this as well. He's got the same information I have and so from separate sources we'll be talking to him
[15:30.000 --> 15:39.000]  We've been playing this a few days but he did go to the doctor yesterday and confirm that his amazing wife Nadia does have a stage 3 cancer that has been testicized
[15:39.000 --> 15:49.000]  And so he asked for your prayers. A statement on that is broke first at Implewars.com if you want to see that and obviously imagine what the Twitter crowd is going to do with that
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  There's such bloodthirsty little demons. Alright we'll be right back on the other side Implewars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best selling products have been sold out for 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 7 months
[16:05.000 --> 16:15.000]  It's not a gimmick to make you buy the products. I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  Because they're great products and we're coming back and getting more and thank you for the support
[16:18.000 --> 16:28.000]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's pollen block or whether it's Super Bowl Vitality or Vaso Beats, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world
[16:28.000 --> 16:36.000]  We're not going to lower the quality of our products and so we just can't offer them but thank God it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  Because suddenly a lot of products have been sold out for a long time are back in stock and one of them is pollen block
[16:42.000 --> 16:51.000]  It takes a long time to get into pollen block but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like allergies, it's from France, it's a special proprietary system
[16:51.000 --> 16:58.000]  This is the highest quality pack of stock, Implewars.com, store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points, check it out

[17:59.000 --> 18:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:21.000 --> 18:29.000]  All our times have come
[18:29.000 --> 18:36.000]  Fear but now they're gone
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  Seasons don't feel the rhythm
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  Not due to wind, the sun and the rain
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  There's the headline exclusive each day planned to ignite Trump on July 4th
[18:49.000 --> 19:05.000]  Roger Stone, Alex Jones live on air to discuss the New York run Soros plan to indict former president on phony charges
[19:05.000 --> 19:16.000]  Globalists are planning and coordinating that to overshadow the news of election fraud that is coming out
[19:16.000 --> 19:23.000]  Now, we're going to play a report after Roger leaves us at the start of the second hour
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  That is another big story
[19:27.000 --> 19:37.000]  In all of these huge things that have come out about COVID-19 and the deadly gene therapy so-called vaccines
[19:37.000 --> 19:47.000]  Again, they could call injecting somebody with poison just straight up arsenic or cyanide and call it a vaccine
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  And people would go take it and die if they called it a vaccine
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  The public would say trust the science and take it
[19:53.000 --> 19:59.000]  If you called a gallon of gasoline a vaccine, someone would pour it on themselves and light themselves on fire
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  Self-immolation, I'm not joking
[20:01.000 --> 20:09.000]  There's a percentage of the public that the media told them to go jump off a cliff, they would do it
[20:09.000 --> 20:16.000]  But what's really dangerous is they're organizing those idiots into brigades of individuals that will do anything they're told
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  And then try to force us to submit as well
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  That has a name, it's called tyranny
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  And there are always control freaks throughout history and throughout civilization
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  And throughout societies that seek to get control of masses of people and engage this type of activity
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  Because it's what they want to do
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  It's what the satanic force is pushing for
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  So we have a very important clip of a scientist, Pierre Gilbert, French scientist
[20:43.000 --> 20:47.000]  Over 25 years ago
[20:47.000 --> 20:55.000]  Warnings specifically of crystals in vaccines designed to basically turn the public into Alzheimer's zombies
[20:55.000 --> 21:02.000]  And I've got a bunch of studies right here for TV viewers, COVID-19 RNA-based vaccines and the risk of prion disease
[21:02.000 --> 21:11.000]  By major universities and major institutions and a bunch of articles about it as well
[21:11.000 --> 21:17.000]  But instead of just having it in French, we've got subtitles that we've translated into English
[21:17.000 --> 21:26.000]  And we are going to be playing that at the start of the next hour and tying it in to the obvious
[21:26.000 --> 21:32.000]  Here is the puppet in chief yesterday
[21:32.000 --> 21:41.000]  President Biden saying that we've got to, you know, get ready for the next big disaster
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's that every hospital bed will be filled with people with Alzheimer's within just a few years
[21:47.000 --> 21:56.000]  Now, he says basically 10 years, same thing that AOC says, end of the world in 12 years, that was two years ago
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  That two or work a year ago said, end of the world in 11 years
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  Now it's 10 years, what's 10 years?
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  The year 2030, 2031, that's the great reset
[22:11.000 --> 22:20.000]  Agenda 2030 is where you have the mass depopulation goes into overdrive, after births
[22:20.000 --> 22:28.000]  And so you see Agenda 21 starts with the launch in 2020, the takeover in 2021, the world ID
[22:28.000 --> 22:37.000]  The year is non-essential, launching the force inoculations, beginning at all, the world social credit score
[22:37.000 --> 22:48.000]  And then by 2030, we will be living in billions being killed or already killed
[22:48.000 --> 22:59.000]  And what does Klaus Schwab say, he says you'll have a global health pass and then to have your pass updated after you have it for two years, it's a face scan attached to your pass
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  You will have to have an implantable microchip
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  And now it's on 60 minutes, you will have an implantable chip, it's all being announced
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  And it goes in and rewrites the genetic cut of your body
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  And now we have footage, I never got to yesterday, we'll play it in a moment
[23:18.000 --> 23:28.000]  First we're going to play Biden of villagers in India chasing the government out
[23:28.000 --> 23:37.000]  With their government vaccine that's killed so many and hitting the government bureaucrats, the medical tyrants on the head with sticks
[23:37.000 --> 23:48.000]  But look at that photo they just put on screen of Klaus Schwab and Prince Charles, Prince Charles is one of the leaders of depopulation like his father, Prince Philip called for world depopulation
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  Using a deadly virus, they tell you what they're going to do and look at those swollen red cheeks
[23:54.000 --> 24:08.000]  You don't just get that when you put out on a yacht or out golfing, get those swollen red cheeks like that when you've gotten a big juicy transfusion of blood
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  And the Royal Family takes transfusions of children's blood, that's admitted
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.000]  But there is the Klaus Schwab that says you will eat bugs, you will drink sewage and you will like it
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  You will have nothing, you will own nothing, you will like it, that's why they're announcing all this dystopia
[24:22.000 --> 24:31.000]  There's all these headlines today, the public wants animal human hybrids, they want human animal clones
[24:31.000 --> 24:41.000]  You're like no I don't, you want sewage, you want to cut your son's genitals off, you want
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  They're just bringing us into hell, they're invoking it all
[24:45.000 --> 24:56.000]  Here is Biden telling you that in 10 years every hospital bed will be filled with people who are 20 years old, 30, 40, 50
[24:56.000 --> 25:04.000]  Because the crystals are growing in their brains, that's what crystal proteins
[25:04.000 --> 25:12.000]  That your cells now produce a crystal protein that eats your hearts, your lungs, your brain, everything
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  And it will take longer to eat those young children's brains, but they'll, by the time they're 20, they won't know who they are
[25:18.000 --> 25:27.000]  But boy if you're 60, 70, you already had some plaque that naturally grew in your brain, or natural prions you picked up from eating processed foods
[25:27.000 --> 25:37.000]  Well now they, those are cluster points, like nuclei that form clouds, a little bit of potash or a little bit of barium salts, aluminum dioxide
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  Spray it out of a jet engine, forms a false cloud, an artificial cloud, well this forms little protein clouds in your brain
[25:43.000 --> 25:53.000]  And then you have the same symptoms old Joe Biden has, the perfect mascot for a nation and a world under prion attack
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  And here he is telling you about the prions
[25:56.000 --> 26:11.000]  If you do something about Alzheimer's in America, every single solitary hospital bed that exists in America as the nurses can tell you, every single one will be occupied in the next 15 years in Alzheimer's patient, every one
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  You hear that? And that's a little inside thing he's been brought in on
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  He's been told, sir, we have nanobots that can cure you, so he's signing off on all of it
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  And now they're announcing, oh we're gonna just, without approval, start giving you nanobots, we may just spray them on you for your own good
[26:27.000 --> 26:34.000]  And you hear about San Francisco, and you hear about Toronto, and you hear about London, oh they're giving little kids shots at school without asking their parents
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  It's totally illegal, but you know it's for the greater good
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  And they announce, oh, we're just gonna give the kids nanopatches, oh that's in the news today
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  You just put it on you and it puts chips into your blood, and oh my god, it's so trendy
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  So fun, so good, so anti-establishment, so antifa
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  To, you know, take what Prince Charles and Bill Gates want into our bodies
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  You know, Bill Gates is our doctor and pediatrician now
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  You know, I'm cutting an ad right now, and I've been here on the Saturday cutting these, I've done a terrible job
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  Because I just cut like five ads, and I didn't tell people the most important part
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  No, it's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months, and it's back at stock, and it's 40% off
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  Or how the supply chain broke down, and how it almost bankrupted us, but thank god it finally came in
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  Or how it cleans up your mitochondria, and makes your telomeres last longer, and can regrow nerves
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  You've got to go research DNA Force Plus, no, it's not that
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  The reason I just cut all those ads, and forgot the most important point
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.000]  The Superdoll Vitality's back at stock, 50% off, the Prospector's back at 40% off, the Alpha Power's back at 50% off
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  The Ultra-12, I'm gonna be 12, take another tongue, it's incredible, is back also 50% off
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  Or Vazel beats back 50% off, no
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  Instead, we've got double-patriot points and free-shipping store-wide, double-patriot points
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  Free-shipping store-wide on top of the huge sales
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners this broadcast
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  And then I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  And how they launched COVID-19 as a bio-weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  And saying we're gonna have $1,500 to try to make people wear masks
[28:21.000 --> 28:28.000]  I could tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the M4 war
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day special for the next week only
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  With store-wide free-shipping, double-patriot points and DNA Force Plus is back in stock
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  Sold out for 7 months, 40% off, super-mobile mentality, 50% off
[28:46.000 --> 28:52.000]  Prostigard, 40% off, Albu power, 50% over 12, 50% Vazel beats 50%, free-shipping and
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.000]  Patriot points and Fauci and Bulwar and its incredible products and George Soros hates it! Ha ha!
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.000]  Bio-remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.000]  By accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants
[29:10.000 --> 29:17.000]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio-remediation products to the everyday consumer
[29:17.000 --> 29:24.000]  Their first product they are launching is called Bio-Septic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  Bio-Septic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors
[29:29.000 --> 29:38.000]  This stuff lives in your septic system, it's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products
[29:38.000 --> 29:45.000]  Due to its revolutionary patent and delivery system, Bio-Septic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms
[29:45.000 --> 29:51.000]  Visit thebio-pros.com today and protect your septic system, that's thebio-pros.com
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled
[29:55.000 --> 30:17.000]  Thebio-pros.com
[30:26.000 --> 30:33.000]  For home the bell tolls by friends, well it tolls for us all
[30:33.000 --> 30:40.000]  And Roger Stone joins us here today, they are coming for President Trump, they know the election was stolen
[30:40.000 --> 30:46.000]  They know the evidence is coming out, President Trump was just on a syndicated radio show and said what happens when the people find out
[30:46.000 --> 30:53.000]  All these states are gonna flip, does that mean you go 3.5 years with someone destroying our country?
[30:53.000 --> 30:58.000]  We've got some of that interview coming up, well Roger Stone has his sources, I have mine
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  But you can also listen directly to the New York Attorney General put in by Soros
[31:03.000 --> 31:08.000]  Running on, I will indict Trump, give me the man, I'll find you the crime
[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  And so I've got sources in the New York Southern District, because that's federal
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  But this is state, but the word I've got is after the state hits to give more legitimacy
[31:19.000 --> 31:27.000]  It's ridiculous, you've got Louis III giving $100,000 to Hunter Biden for access to his father when he was vice president
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  To add credibility to that, they're gonna have a federal indictment as I'm told
[31:30.000 --> 31:36.000]  So I was told by my sources in the next month, I called Roger the other day and he said well come on air and tell you what I know
[31:36.000 --> 31:43.000]  I've been seeing basically similar things but no one's sure but they may back this off now because we're on air literally doing this
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  Because they don't want people to know how staged this all is, so Roger was gonna be joining us on this subject
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  But he got some very serious news that needs prayer and support yesterday
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.000]  They already had some tests, they went back to the doctors and got the news yesterday
[31:57.000 --> 32:01.000]  And Roger's a real soldier, a real trooper, still coming on the air today
[32:01.000 --> 32:04.000]  So he said well I might as well then just break the news here
[32:04.000 --> 32:10.000]  We've also posted a statement by his pastor, Reverend Randy Cougans, at infowars.com
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  So Roger, thank you for joining us my friend
[32:13.000 --> 32:20.000]  Alex, I'm delighted to be here and let's cover the sad news first and then move on to politics
[32:20.000 --> 32:30.000]  It is with a heavy heart that I confirmed that my wife of 30 years, Nydia Betran Espinosa Stone
[32:30.000 --> 32:39.000]  Nydia Stone has been diagnosed with stage 3 cancer which appears to have spread to her lungs
[32:39.000 --> 32:46.000]  She has I think both the best medical and holistic advice and care you could have
[32:46.000 --> 32:54.000]  Charlene and Ty Bollinger, good friends of ours, really pioneers in the area of truth about cancer
[32:54.000 --> 33:00.000]  Have been an invaluable resource as have the people at the University of Miami
[33:00.000 --> 33:08.000]  She is a warrior, she is a fighter, she's an excellent spirit, she is facing this
[33:08.000 --> 33:15.000]  It was stoicism, with bravery, with her faith, it is a very difficult time
[33:15.000 --> 33:21.000]  But I know that millions and millions of people are praying for her as they prayed for me
[33:21.000 --> 33:31.000]  I have seen a miracle in my own lifetime, God answered my prayers when I was the target of a politically motivated witch hunt
[33:31.000 --> 33:38.000]  In an effort to ensure that I died of COVID-19 in a rural Georgia prison
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.000]  God answered my prayers and gave President Trump the strength to free me, to make me a free man
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.000]  And now I pray to God that he will save the life of my beloved wife
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  This is a difficult time, now the good news is, although we lost most of our insurance
[33:58.000 --> 34:07.000]  Most of her medical care will be covered, but the cost of holistic care and the many natural supplements
[34:07.000 --> 34:13.000]  And regimens that can help fight cancer are things that we cannot afford today
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  Plus, thanks to the Muller Witch Hunt, we're still struggling to recover our balance
[34:18.000 --> 34:28.000]  My podcast begins June 1st at Excluded.com, also at StoneColdTruth.com
[34:28.000 --> 34:35.000]  We are working very hard to get back on our feet, and this is a blow, I must tell you, this is a blow
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  But God can do anything, and we are fervently praying
[34:39.000 --> 34:48.000]  A statement put out today by my spiritual advisor, Reverend Randy Coggins, I think sums this up very nicely
[34:48.000 --> 34:55.000]  Well, I mean, I tell you, it was well known back in the 80s, early 90s, had the biggest mansion in DC
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  But you got out of lobbying, or the top lobbyist, probably in the world, that's admitted even in the New York Times at the time
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  But you got out of it, you were sick of it, you left when Manafort and others stayed in
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  And you're a proud man, you've never really made a big deal about this, but you live in a small apartment now
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  They took everything with the false prosecutions and the rest of it, I've been persecuted as well
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  And it's the listeners that do keep us on air, and you didn't have the money for your podcast equipment
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  So we got it for you, sent it to you, because your voice needs to be heard
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  That's what the system has done, so we're all praying for your amazing wife
[35:28.000 --> 35:37.000]  Great children and grandchildren, and this is a serious situation, reading the full statement, dealing with the diagnosed with stage 3 cancer
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.000]  Which has spread to her lungs, and so we'd definitely be praying for her and supporting you guys
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  Let's now get into why you were originally coming on, Roger
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  Again, I called you this weekend and we talked more, they are intending, aren't they, to indict President Trump
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.000]  And you've read the tea leaves, you've got no one's exactly sure, but we know they've got a target date of right around July 4th
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.000]  Because I know they know that Trump's planning to bring out the total evidence of election fraud around that same date
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  And the globalist loves symbolism, don't they?
[36:07.000 --> 36:17.000]  Well, I would be shocked if they did not come forward with a fabricated indictment for bank fraud or tax fraud against the former president
[36:17.000 --> 36:23.000]  By Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, an elected Democrat
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  The son of Cyrus Vance Sr., the worst Secretary of State in American history
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  The man who botched the Iranian hostage crisis under Jimmy Carter
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  By the way, Cyrus Vance is not exactly a non-corrupt politician himself
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  I will be breaking a number of stories at my new podcast, Get Stoned
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  Also at Band TV regarding Cyrus Vance, he has a very interesting political history
[36:48.000 --> 36:55.000]  If they want to go after the president on fabricated charges, then we will establish that this is a partisan witch hunt
[36:55.000 --> 37:04.000]  The idea that they would even have the effrontery to try to claim that the president, or I should say his real estate company
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  Inflated the value of certain assets in order to borrow against it
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  Well really, what's 55 Wall Street worth?
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  It has no mortgage, what is it worth? 250 million? 300 million?
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  I guess it depends on the appraiser, but this is the kind of crap that they are stooping to
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  Well, plus if your appraisal isn't real, the banks won't give you the damn loan
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  Well, let's be very clear
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  In other words, as you said earlier, you show the man, I'll show you the crime
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  They're allowed to root through this man's business record of 40 years in which he built a real estate empire second to none
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  Combing for a crime, they have no evidence of a crime, they have no probable cause
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  It is disgraceful, but I do think it is going to happen
[37:50.000 --> 37:58.000]  And don't be surprised if the announcement comes at the exact time that we learned the truth about Maricopa County, Arizona
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  Don't be surprised, because I see that coming
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  Well, I'm told by people very close to it that indeed they intend to do it
[38:04.000 --> 38:13.000]  And that they're shooting for honor around July 4th to really rub it into our faces as a declaration of their takeover, the Chinese takeover of America
[38:13.000 --> 38:23.000]  Their real problem is, you can already see that demand for recounts and reexamination of the irregularities and the anomalies in this election
[38:23.000 --> 38:29.000]  Are bubbling up in Georgia, in Wisconsin, in Michigan, and other states
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.000]  The truth, it can never really ever be concealed, the American people demand the truth
[38:35.000 --> 38:44.000]  Now what will happen then, I don't know, but I'm sorry, it is absolutely true that 1.4 million absentee ballots are mailed out in Pennsylvania
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  And 2.2 million come in, not possible
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.000]  There are precincts in Philadelphia in which more people voted than are registered to vote
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  That's not a right-wing conspiracy theory, that's a fact
[38:58.000 --> 39:06.000]  It is extraordinary that across all these states at the exact same time, they're the dump of these mail-in ballots
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  Oh no, that's just a coincidence
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  Here's why the mainstream media is so childish
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  Oh no, there's no evidence whatsoever of election fraud
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  And if you think so, you're a conspiracy theorist, you might even be a domestic terrorist
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  Why do you fear examination?
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  Why do they fear an investigation?
[39:26.000 --> 39:33.000]  If they're so confident that the data is accurate and that there are no anomalies and no irregularities
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  Why are they fighting tooth and nail against any fair examination of these ballots?
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  Let's talk about how this is going to unfold the reaction of the American people
[39:41.000 --> 39:47.000]  Polls show more and more over 70-plus percent of Republicans, over 30 percent of Democrats believe the election was stolen
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  And each week the numbers grow as evidence comes out, the majority of Americans know the truth
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  And resting Trump isn't going to shut the truth up
[39:57.000 --> 40:05.000]  I don't really need to sell you on how beat-concentrate is really good for your heart, good for your liver, good for your lungs, good for your cardiovascular system and your brain
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  It's well-known and so beat supplements are amongst the best sellers out there
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  So I went out to a top lab and I said, what is the strongest beat-concentrate?
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  You can do a copy of the popular formula you have
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  They explained that their formula had a certain percentage and I said, just like with body's ultimate turmeric formula
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.000]  Where the average competitor is at 5% or humanoid, I said no one else does, 95% that's the highest level
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  I said give me 95% or humanoid, didn't even cost much more
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  And we have 95% or humanoid
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  Well, it's the same thing here, this is a very strong beat extract
[40:37.000 --> 40:45.000]  And it's very good for your body, good for your heart, and it's back in stock, Bazzo Beats at infowarstore.com, 50% off

[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you how amazing Polymblock is

[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  Where it's got 5 stars and people love it
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  Polymblock is a proprietary formula from France where they just learned
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  By happenstance that quail that eat a certain diet
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  Produced eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  Or what folks call allergies
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  It's back in stock, it's been sold out for a long time, it's very hard to get
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  Despite that, it's 40% off, we have store-wide free shipping right now

[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  And I know you're going to become a regular customer because everybody else that's gotten it basically has
[43:57.000 --> 44:21.000]  This stuff really, really works
[44:21.000 --> 44:27.000]  And I think that, you know, frankly, I think there's going to be a big problem because when people find out
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  That all of these states are going to flip
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  Does that mean you go three and a half years with somebody that's destroying our country?
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  Well, that's the question, what happens when you find out that it was rigged and it was stolen?
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.000]  I mean, you know, all I do is I sit back and watch and other states now are doing the audits
[44:47.000 --> 44:53.000]  That's Trump today on the Wayne Allen route program, he censored everywhere else to talk radio
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  Newsmax and a few other channels
[44:55.000 --> 45:05.000]  Oh, and Facebook announced any Republican putting Ted Cruz that tried to have a 10-day investigation on January 6th
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  They were having that vote, which Democrats tried to do four years previous, the exact same thing
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  For that sin, they're not allowed to campaign on Facebook
[45:13.000 --> 45:18.000]  And about a month ago in Australia, members of their parliament, multiple ones now
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  Are not allowed to say we don't want forced inoculation
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  You're not allowed to have an opinion about that
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  You're not allowed to say it came from the Wuhan lab either
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  This is just beyond police state, beyond censorship, beyond 1984
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.000]  You know, the president of Microsoft is warning Rodger Stone, here on the Alexandria today
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  That we're going to have 1984 because of AI
[45:41.000 --> 45:47.000]  Well, Rodger, I think we're already basically seeing real 1984 now
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  And the Democrats are all over the news saying, hey, we're getting ready to indict Trump
[45:51.000 --> 45:57.000]  I don't see how Leticia James could swear as attorney general that she would be elected to put him in jail
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  That was her main plank
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  And now to see the state of New York, the city of New York, the feds, all of them sharpening their knives
[46:06.000 --> 46:14.000]  This is just insane with the overwhelming evidence of Biden literally being a Communist Chinese agent
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  No, Alex, I agree with everything you just said
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  I must tell you, I'm really impressed with the power of infowars
[46:20.000 --> 46:26.000]  Because right now, my phone and my email are blowing up with patriots
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  Telling me that they're praying for my wife, that they've learned it about her situation
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  Here on the Alex Jones show
[46:33.000 --> 46:42.000]  Folks who do want to help us, I should say, should go to stonefamilyfund.com
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  We need your prayers more than anything else
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  We need your help, but God bless you for stepping forward
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  God bless you for your prayers and your best wishes
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  Anyway, to go back to politics, you're absolutely right, Alex
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  This is a police state
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  This is political retribution
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  We see it in their efforts to crucify Matt Gaetz
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.000]  When there is no evidence whatsoever that Matt Gaetz has done anything wrong
[47:12.000 --> 47:18.000]  Other than some guy who did do something wrong, who they're squeezing now to lie about others
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  That great patriot Matt Gaetz being crucified without evidence
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  Now they're going after the President of the United States
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  You may have not seen this, but the Secretary of the Army under Joe Biden
[47:29.000 --> 47:35.000]  Has opened a new investigation into General Michael Flynn and his contacts with the Russians
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  Which is absurd because Robert Mueller had unlimited cash
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  An army of 600 Ivy League Republican hating lawyers
[47:44.000 --> 47:51.000]  And could find no evidence that that great American patriot General Flynn had done anything wrong
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  So what we see here is Witch Hunt 3.0
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  The Witch Hunt to go after the greatest President since Abraham Lincoln
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  And why are they doing this? It's very, very clear
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  They're afraid of Donald Trump
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  They're afraid he might run again
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  They're afraid he might beat their ass in an honest election
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  That's why they seek to smear him now
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  It is reprehensible, it's disgusting
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  And the American people should really not tolerate it
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  We need honest, fair, transparent elections
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  Had we had them in 2024, this great man would still be in the White House
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  And America would not be in decline
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  But if you look at what's happening under Joe Biden
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  Gas prices skyrocketing out of sight
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.000]  Food prices, steel, up, copper, up, oil, up
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  And meanwhile around the globe, you notice our adversaries are pushing us
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  You see, they feared Donald Trump
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  But now the North Koreans are retesting their weapons
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.000]  The Chinese are threatening our ships in that part of the world
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  As well as Taiwan
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  The Iranians are more obnoxious than usual in their threats against us
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  What's going on in the Middle East
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  Where Joe Biden appears to be on both sides
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  I'm with Israel, 100%
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  But I'm not sure he is
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  There's evidence that he's not
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  So we're being tested in the foreign realm
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  We're being tested domestically
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  Big tax increases coming, folks
[49:27.000 --> 49:34.000]  They have taken one of the greatest, most robust, most vital economies in American history
[49:34.000 --> 49:40.000]  When record job growth, record wage growth, the lowest levels of unemployment
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  Among all groups, African Americans, Hispanics, women, Asian, everyone
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.000]  They're destroying a model economy brought to you by President Donald J. Trump
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  With the able assistance of Larry Kudlow
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  They're destroying this before our very eyes
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  And America sees it
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  So even though they stole the election
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.000]  All the numbers coming out, there's a big article in Town Hall with these numbers
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  It says that all Trump has to do is announce
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  And he'll be the primary victor with like 90% of the vote in every case
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  But these numbers, all Trump has to do is declare a 2024 run
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  And the GOP primaries are over
[50:19.000 --> 50:26.000]  And anybody he backs is now winning by 60, 70, 5 points record levels
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  Like green out of Georgia
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  And so the system has to go after him
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  But that will cause an even bigger awakening
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  I mean, this is just fantastical to watch Joe Biden announced new gas taxes
[50:39.000 --> 50:45.000]  No mining allowed to America, for the rare earth minerals, for the batteries
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  I mean, this is just a total destruction of the country
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  Destruction of the borders, destruction of everything
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  No, it's absolutely true
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.000]  And that's the story behind this New York prosecution
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  They don't think the Democrats aren't looking at these polls
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  They still can't get over 2016
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  Hillary Clinton spent almost $2 billion between soft and hard money
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  To estimate at best Donald Trump
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  With far less experience as a candidate for public office
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  May have spent, including independent spending, somewhere around $375 million
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  And he won, going away
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  So they fear that he's going to run again
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  And therefore they hope to damage his reputation even further
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  Through these bogus indictments in New York
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  Cyrus Vance Jr. What do you hear some of the things this guy has done?
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  He's not an unbiased, honest law enforcement man or a prosecutor
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  He's a partisan Democrat
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  And he's acted like one, let's say that
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  Well, Roger, I mean, when it came out in the New Hunter Biden emails
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  Which they admit are real, and the FBI do this the whole time
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  But they can't investigate themselves
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  The FBI director, the former director, Louis Free, saying
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  I want to do business with you, Vice President
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  I've got foreign clients for lobbying
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  And then he goes, well, here, give my son $100,000 and he puts it in there
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  And that's just part of it
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  I mean, this is complete bribery publicly
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  And so they're corrupt, they know they control the FBI
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  And they control most of the judges, and so the sky's the limit
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  I mean, we have a complete criminal mafia running our country
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  That double as Chai Khan agents
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  You know, when I read that exchange, I lived in Washington for 30 years
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  I've seen a lot of brazen stuff in my lifetime
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.000]  But the former FBI director has caught red-handed bribing a public official
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  Bribing the number two public official in the United States
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  Stunning, by the way, no charges will be brought against Louis Free
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  Because we have a two-tiered system of justice in this country
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.000]  If you're a Republican, if you're a Christian, if you're a conservative
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  You support Donald Trump
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  Well, you know, they'll send you to prison for jaywalking
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  But Ron Rosenstein lied to Congress when he said
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  No, I didn't approve the investigation and indictment of Roger Stone
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  And I produced the document that he signed October 17, 2018
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  In which he did
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  That's a material lie
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  When is he being prosecuted? I'll tell you when, never
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  That's when
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  All right, Roger, give us an update in the next few days
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  Please come on with a Sunday or Monday
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  We're all praying for your amazing wife, Roger
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  I can't wait to you launch your own podcast
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  It'll also be syndicated and posted when you do it every day
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  At band.videoandfreeworldnews.tv
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  Thank you so much, and please give your wife my best
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  And folks, please give us a hand
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  Go to stonefamilyfund.com
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  I'm a great believer in the holistic approach
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  An all-natural approach to cancer
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  It does have a cost
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  But we're going to pursue that route
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  So I need your help, folks
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  God bless you, God bless you, Alex
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  For handling this with the dignity that you have
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  And God bless America
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  There's my wife being pulled outside of our home
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  By the FBI for the CNN cameras
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  With boats, helicopters, and 40 agents
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  Unbelievable, she too is a warrior
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.000]  God bless you, Alex
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  Thank you, Roger
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  All right, we're going to start the next hour
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  And I've just got to reset and cover it all
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  It's not that I'm choking
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  I've got too much bombshell news here
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  I mean, I'm going to try to get to it all
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  It's totally insane
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  And wait till you hear about the prions
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  That are in the vaccines news
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  That's coming up, and please don't forget
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  And Roger didn't use the panhandle
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  They've basically bankrupted him
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  So please support him
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  Please keep us on air
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  It's worldwide free shipping for Memorial Day
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  Double-patriot points

[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  I share with you the viewers and listeners
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  The facts of where Info Wars is
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  And it's always a complex picture
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  But I do my best to explain it to you
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  Because you are the patrons
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  That make all this possible
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  So in short, the world's awakening
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  The spiral of censorship, Info Wars
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  Has never been more influential
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  And has never had a bigger effect
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  Exposing the global's agenda and fighting it
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  But that's dead
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  The COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  Has almost shut us down
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  Because most of the best-selling products
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  Which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  And others, have been sold out for up to seven months
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  Well, guess what?

[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  Up and down the planet right now
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  Their entire agenda of depopulation
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  Poisoned vaccines, it's all coming out
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  And yes, I'm risking my life
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  And yes, this is very dangerous
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  But it's worth it, I'm very honored to be in the fight
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  So thanks for keeping me in the fight
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  And our great crew here at InfoWars

[56:46.000 --> 57:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  Well, Jack Posovic's got a new book out
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  He's not a sponsor
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  I want to read the book
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  He won't even call me back to buy some of the book
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  I like the piece he did on Antifa
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  And he's got a new book out
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  The video is excellent, so I'm going to air it right here
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  Here is Antifa is not a myth
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  Antifa has been violent
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  And has been launching revolutions for decades
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Here's Jack Posovic's latest work
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  Some people say Antifa is just an idea
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Some people say Antifa is a myth
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  In mainstream media, they collude with big tech
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  To bury the truth about Antifa
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  But ignoring the rise of the black flags in America
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.000]  That's a great mistake
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  So who is Antifa?
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  Where they come from, how they fund it
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  And most people don't ask these questions
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  I don't have to ask it
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  I lived it
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  And I wrote the book on it
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  Let's go
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  Antifa aren't Democrats
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  They're not Republicans
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  They're anarcho-communists
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  They only want one thing
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  The overthrow of the U.S. system
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  By any means necessary
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  The original founder of Antifa was actually a German
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  A Soviet agent named Ernst Thalmann
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  In Weimar Germany
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  Thalmann was the leader of the German Communist Party
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  The founder of the Red Front
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  And in 1932, he created Antifa Shista Action
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Under the two-flag emblem
[58:44.000 --> 58:48.000]  The first Antifa targeted the government of their time
[58:48.000 --> 58:49.000]  The Weimar Republic
[58:49.000 --> 58:52.000]  Which, as we all know, ultimately ended with the rise
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.000]  Of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  Thanks, Ernst
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  Communist China in the 1960s
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  Saw a new form of revolution
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  A student movement called the Hongwei Bing
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  The Red Guards
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  They took to the streets to remake society
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  And they called it social justice
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  Chairman Mao called the Red Guards from all across China
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  To overthrow traditional Chinese culture
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  To go after the teachers, the business owners
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  Even their own parents
[59:24.000 --> 59:30.000]  As a result, somewhere between 5 and 10 million Chinese citizens
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  Were murdered to solidify the rule of the CCP
[59:34.000 --> 59:39.000]  All in the name of revolution
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  In the 1970s in West Germany
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  The notorious Badr Meinhof Gang
[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  Was another extension of anarcho-socialism that appeared
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.000]  They were also known as the Red Army Faction
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  This was a group of radical extremists
[59:53.000 --> 59:56.000]  Who conducted a series of terrorist attacks
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  Funded by the USSR
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  This wreaked havoc on the entire region for years
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Before turning to a life of terrorism
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  Ulrich Meinhof was a left-wing journalist
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Funny how that works
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  During the Syrian Civil War
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  Some Antifa militants even traveled to the Middle East
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  And trained and fought with Kurdish communists on the battlefield
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  In what was known as the Rojava Revolution
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  And then they came back to America
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  With what they learned
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  You won't see this on CNN
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  And now, Antifa is right here in America
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Armed Antifa actually tried to create their own country
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Within the city of Seattle, Washington
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Called the Chaz
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  And instead of shutting them down
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Local police were ordered to abandon their precinct
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  The result? Absolute mayhem
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  But it wasn't until shots were fired
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Women assaulted
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Homeless people murdering each other
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  And teens were shot dead in the streets
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  That the city finally intervened and shut it down
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  I know because I was there
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  I've been inside the black box
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  I was standing next to Raz Simone
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  When he'd locked and loaded in Chaz
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  I came face to face with Antifa leaders
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Wanted to kill me in Lincoln Park, Washington, D.C.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  I know firsthand Antifa is very real
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And they've been around for a very long time
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  The first step to defeating these violent anarchists
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Is to actually admit they exist
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Joe Biden, if you think Antifa is just an idea
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Read the new book
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  I'd be happy to deliver you a copy
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Once you're done reading Hunters
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  We have the receipts
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  They're all right here
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  All right, that's your job, Jack.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  I can't wait to read the book
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I can't wait to carry it if he gets back with me
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  You know, the devil's greatest trick
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  The total world didn't exist
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I've got some really good news
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  For the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  And then I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  How the Globals are getting exposed
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  And how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  The puppet president Biden
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  And saying we're gonna have $1,000 fine
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  To try to make people wear masks
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  I could tell you about all of that
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  But why shouldn't I instead
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Tell you about the super good news
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Concerning the M4 war
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen

[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Broadcasting Worldwide
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  It's Alex Jones
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Live from Austin, Texas
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Thank you for joining us
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  On this live Friday, May 28th
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Transmission
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  I am your host Alex Jones
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  And the dots have been connected today
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:57.800]  the planets have aligned, the answer has been
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:05.320]  compensated and has been revealed in crystal clear 2020
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:11.800]  vision. So let me give you the preface and then I will get into the evidence
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:13.960]  here.
[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:20.760]  We know that the so-called COVID-19 vaccines,
[1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:24.280]  whether they be virus vector delivered or
[1:04:24.280 --> 1:04:31.480]  mRNA or not vaccines and that they at a revolutionary level
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:35.560]  do not try to teach the body how to defeat a damaged or
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:39.640]  neutralized attenuated virus or bacteria.
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:43.320]  That instead it goes in and programs the body
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:50.520]  how to respond to the shell of the virus which is made of an extremely
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:57.640]  common protein in the body. So your body is being taught to have
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:01.240]  an autoimmune response and there's many different ways it can do that
[1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:05.720]  to that. That's why top scientists came out when they learned what was in these
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:10.840]  injections but there are just injections
[1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:13.960]  and warned this is going to cause brain damage, blood clots,
[1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:17.880]  Alzheimer's type diseases, heart attacks and eat holes in your lungs and they had
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:20.920]  all these studies from Russia, China, the US,
[1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:25.240]  Europe, the UK, Mexico, it goes on and on.
[1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:28.760]  Where they've tried an industrial poultry production particularly
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:32.360]  to create a vaccine to stop bird flu they can come through and kill
[1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:38.680]  almost your entire facilities, ducks or chickens.
[1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:43.480]  So they've been trying this for 50 years they've been trying with mRNA for 20
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:49.400]  okay so giving you some background here but here's the
[1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:51.960]  boil down.
[1:05:55.640 --> 1:06:00.200]  They knew all this this is extremely well studied
[1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:03.320]  the big UT study and others funded by Fauci
[1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:09.240]  2012 and they said don't give people a so-called vaccine
[1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:12.280]  to counter and they studied three different types of vaccine three
[1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:15.800]  different ways to cause an autoimmune response to the
[1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:19.960]  spike protein of the virus on COVID viruses,
[1:06:19.960 --> 1:06:27.480]  SARS viruses, same virus, same family and they said extreme caution
[1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:31.560]  it kills the rats, it kills the mice, they have strokes, they have heart attacks,
[1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:35.160]  they have blood clots in their lungs. What's in the news today?
[1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:40.120]  This is every hour news comes out. BBC presenter dies from blood clots
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:44.840]  after AstraZeneca vaccine in the brain had extreme headaches for a week and
[1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:47.880]  then died the doctors say they believe it killed her.
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:51.560]  What the supermodel that just died same thing massive stroke
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:54.040]  brain bleed.
[1:06:54.840 --> 1:06:57.320]  Comprende?
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:03.000]  Now let's give you the latest there's a Gregory's report just went live
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.680]  will the COVID vaccine complete the zombification
[1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:10.840]  of America IQ is dropping sperm counts dropping
[1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:14.760]  cancer rates exploding well the answer is
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:23.400]  yes it will here is medicine.hsc.wvu.edu major universities
[1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:27.640]  RNA helps create zombie cells cause cancer
[1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:31.480]  says WVU researcher
[1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:36.440]  that's the WVU Cancer Institute and School of Medicine.
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:40.360]  This of course is from before they launched their COVID op before it was
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:43.800]  politically incorrect to tell the truth about it and it creates
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:49.240]  prions that are artificial synthetic cells and the problem of putting
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:54.440]  synthetic RNA in synthetic viruses synthetic organisms
[1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:59.400]  is they start growing and if they run into anything similar to themselves
[1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:05.640]  they start growing like crystals because they are crystals
[1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:09.560]  that's why you don't feed cows dead cows because they don't have stomachs to
[1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:14.120]  deal with it it passes through prions grow in their flesh
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:18.440]  around the spinal cord in the brain so you don't want to eat a cow's brain that
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:21.000]  has it or meat that's up against the spine
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:26.600]  because you get that it goes into your brain starts growing and you're bye bye
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:29.960]  so i studied this again last night for several hours and again this morning
[1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:33.640]  for over an hour and it's all right there
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:41.320]  not a possibility a guaranteed effect highly studied the system knew this
[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:45.800]  and there's prions growing right there the system
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:51.400]  knew this and is injecting the west who's the enemy of the global to get rid
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:53.400]  of us black white old young doesn't matter gay
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:57.560]  straight doesn't matter with a system that will eat your brain
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:01.320]  with crystals might take five years with a child might take a month with
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:06.200]  somebody that's already got crystals in their brain these attached to
[1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:11.560]  so i mean they they did it folks and and that's why
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:15.560]  biden just announced that within 15 years
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:19.400]  every hospital bed will be filled with people and they're now saying all simmers
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:24.440]  is common at age 20 because it's plaques in the brain from aluminum
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:30.040]  prions it's a cocktail of things pesticides
[1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:33.880]  phthalates and it's not killing us fast enough
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:37.640]  so they went ahead and hit us with this and that's right out of the major
[1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:40.200]  institute i got a bunch of other articles studies
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:44.600]  on it here for you shocking study reveals mRNA COVID-19 vaccines
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:48.760]  may progressively generate your brain from prion disease
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:51.640]  here's an actual another study microbiology infectious diseases
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:54.840]  COVID-19 RNA based vaccines the risk of prion disease
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:58.440]  i mean this is well known okay
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  so there you go i mean they shut down england and made them kill almost all
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.280]  their cows and sheep because a few hundred had prions
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:09.320]  all they had to do was just kill the ones that had it but instead they just killed
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:11.640]  them all
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:17.160]  but instead they now inject you with synthetic prions
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:22.760]  so you can get synthetic spongiform encephalopathy
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:27.720]  and so your brain after you've been injected after this degenerates
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:31.160]  will look like the brain on your screen on the left hand side
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:35.080]  the Alzheimer's patient i guess you're right
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:40.120]  so there it is and you're not going to be causing problems anymore
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:44.600]  so the virus is real it has great gain of function to infect you
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:49.320]  so everybody gets scared and takes a vaccine for the virus's shell
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:54.280]  that is a prion delivery system and so
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:58.040]  here's the the key we're going to have to and i said this six months ago i said
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:00.520]  a year ago i said when everybody gets Alzheimer's or
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:04.360]  neurological type disorders they're going to claim that COVID's eating the
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:07.640]  brain that they're going to start some new viruses
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:10.440]  no one will point out it's the vaccine
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:14.680]  for any scientist to try to be censored and the people that are dying never want
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:17.480]  to admit that's the sign of somebody under this delusion
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:21.080]  under this programming is when they get hurt the left always defends their
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:24.600]  abuser Stockholm syndrome and so this is just going to be a
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:28.360]  nightmare scenario and this is the end of civilization
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:32.600]  you've got to get to rural areas i've got to do you've got to dig in soon
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:36.360]  this is already the deaths already happening see if the crystals grow too
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:39.400]  fast or there's an autoimmune response too fast
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:43.320]  there's a whole range of things the people die within days or hours hours or
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:47.000]  days weeks sometimes and it's always the same
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.320]  science is clear but for the most people it's just
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:56.040]  it lays it lays little goodies in there and there's a major study showing
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:01.800]  electromagnetic resonance through tissue can then actually
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:06.200]  activate them to grow so they obviously have cures for this as well
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:10.680]  but the elites have that you're not going to get it they can then use the 5g
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:13.960]  and other systems to then resonate with the
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:17.960]  crystals and make them grow there's a lot of studies on that
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:21.240]  so now you understand they can now they put the crystals in you
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:24.520]  and they're going to slowly kill you but if they want they can take you and put
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:28.360]  you in a chamber you think it's just a regular gel cell they flip a switch
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:31.720]  and it makes the crystals grow so fast that the month you're dead
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:35.080]  and we have top scientists for you on the other side to lay that out so
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:39.480]  prepare to die that's why they don't care that you know they're
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.960]  criminal that's why they don't care that you know they're chinese agents
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:45.160]  because this is america under attack in europe and australia
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:48.920]  this is the end these are chinese globalist agents this is it
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:52.280]  this is it and it'll take the years to die and they'll go we don't know what's
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:54.520]  doing it and it lays down it collapses society
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:57.640]  gerald in south carolina go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:01.720]  hey alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:05.000]  reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:08.920]  i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:13.880]  and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:18.680]  living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:21.400]  almost killed me living defense brought me back
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:25.240]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:30.280]  as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:36.680]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:41.320]  nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:44.440]  betray one another and shall hate one another that's
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:48.520]  right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:51.960]  this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:14:00.360]  god created this country your voice counts when you share
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:03.240]  information be it over the internet or in person
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:07.160]  it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:10.760]  they know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:13.960]  important than ever to use every tool we've got

[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:02.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:12.920]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host and this is beyond an emergency
[1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:16.600]  situation uh what what's happening to humanity is
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:20.920]  so bad it's so horrible that despite the incredible persecution
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:24.200]  they're launching at us behind the scenes i'm completely calm and feel
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:26.440]  blessed to even be aware of what's going on
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:30.360]  but that's how bad this is is that it's unspeakable
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:33.880]  and notice all of the news they have to admit locally yeah whole nursing homes
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:37.480]  get the mRNA shot or the other ones they all do the same thing and they
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:40.840]  create an autoimmune response uh you know to this protein
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:44.120]  and then starts the replication of the protein and then they just go just don't
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:48.280]  worry we're you know everything's fine and people get so incredibly sick
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:51.320]  and suddenly they have brain fog nobody at the nursing home is going to eat
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:56.200]  dinner anymore or lunch or breakfast and people start dying
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:00.680]  but young folks and old folks everybody else are having heart attacks and
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:07.320]  strokes over and over and over again you know the one child policy targeted
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:14.120]  girls in china over 100 plus millions killed
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:17.640]  and then now they've targeted all the world boys with the autism with with
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:21.560]  what they did with the vaccines with the autoimmune response of the brain and
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:24.600]  the gut that was tailored and now this is hitting
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:29.160]  girls actually more the numbers are showing side effects are worse
[1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:32.280]  because uh it's targeting the uterus the brain but
[1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:36.200]  women are having just young women healthy women bleed outs of the brain
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:41.480]  intense headaches because uh the body is eating itself and these these
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:44.520]  crystals are growing and they start cutting through
[1:16:44.520 --> 1:16:48.040]  the blood vessels the capillaries in the brain
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:51.800]  and it's very painful to be murdered like this with the crystals growing in
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:55.480]  your brain it's right out of a horror movie and then finally they sever the
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:17:00.680]  large enough uh vessels that you bleed to death
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:03.560]  and they can't help you they do emergency brain surgeries in the brains
[1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:08.040]  they say are just liquefying so i'm so sorry about this i i know they
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:11.160]  bill gates said he was going to kill us i mean they they
[1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:14.520]  ploswab said they were going to kill us i mean that's what leader caprio goes
[1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:18.360]  and hangs out with him he's all for it he he loves it he says
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:23.000]  so yeah he's part of it as well so i mean there you go these people who want
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:26.440]  the art for themselves they think you're stupid and they think they can just
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:30.520]  carry this out and get away with it so there you go see a lot of folks are
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:34.600]  joining them because they think they'll be protected boy they don't have a lot of
[1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:37.320]  sense do they
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:45.720]  no they don't have a lot of sense they got sense to take over but not sense of
[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:48.840]  what's going to happen down the road so let's go ahead and go to greg risa's
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:52.280]  report it's short but then we'll we'll we'll take what i've said here the
[1:17:52.280 --> 1:17:55.800]  last few seconds and put it together with it but another more lengthy report
[1:17:55.800 --> 1:18:02.280]  but he just did the translation of it into english
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:08.280]  out of french this is pierre gilbert will the cova vaccines complete the
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:13.720]  zombification of america canadian professor named pierre gilbert
[1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:19.560]  in 1995 video and there's been a lot of other scientists and others that have
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:25.960]  said similar things i just showed you medicine dot hsc dot wvu dot edu
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:33.640]  rna helps viruses create zombie cells cause cancer says wvu research
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:37.480]  and then i got all the studies and stats confirming all of that but
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:43.320]  here is the doctor from the vault
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:51.400]  in an old video from 1995 a theology professor named pierre gilbert
[1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:55.800]  warned of mandatory vaccines that would turn recipients
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:00.600]  into zombies he speaks in french so i will translate
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:04.600]  into biological destruction there are the organized tempests
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:09.640]  on the magnetic fields what will follow is the contamination of the blood
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:15.240]  streams of mankind creating intentional
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:21.480]  infections this will be enforced via laws that will
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:26.120]  make vaccination mandatory and these vaccines will make
[1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:32.280]  possible to control people the vaccines will have liquid crystals
[1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:37.320]  that will become hosted in the brain cells
[1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:43.880]  which will become micro receivers of electromagnetic fields
[1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:49.000]  where waves of very low frequencies will be sent
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:53.800]  and through these low frequency waves people will be unable to think
[1:19:53.800 --> 1:19:58.120]  you'll be turned into a zombie zombie don't think of this
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:07.880]  as a hypothesis this has been done think of rwanda
[1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:11.640]  there isn't much information i could find about pierre gilbert
[1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:17.880]  but what he said 26 years ago certainly rings true today
[1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:22.440]  in 2016 the guardian published genetically engineered
[1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:26.920]  magneto protein remotely controls brain and behavior
[1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:30.760]  here we can see zebrafish larvae that have been injected with magneto
[1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:37.240]  being manipulated with magnetic fields in march of 2020 defense one
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:40.600]  published an article on how hydrogel biosensors
[1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:43.800]  are ready to be injected into people's bodies
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:49.800]  funded by darpa and bill gates if you search magnetic nanoparticles
[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:53.800]  you will find several articles and videos explaining the so-called benefits
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:58.200]  of this invasive technology that can control parts of the human body
[1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:05.720]  via external frequencies livestock needs to be branded and tracked
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:09.720]  and the enslavement of humanity is voluntary
[1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:13.800]  which is why the so-called vaccines are voluntary
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:17.080]  and sadly there seems to be millions of people
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:21.080]  eagerly lining up to be state property
[1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:26.440]  for Reese report dot com this is greg reese absolutely find all of his reports
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:29.880]  mirrored at Reese report dot com in the greg reese section of band
[1:21:29.880 --> 1:21:34.520]  dot video very important now what do we tell you a few months ago in general
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:37.000]  flinn former head of defense intelligence former national security
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:40.280]  advisor the president came out and said this is dead on it's a war game
[1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:47.000]  spars 2025 2028 and in that i have right here on the desk it says
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.760]  that the vaccine will cause mass neurological problems and mass all
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:54.040]  timers that will cause a global
[1:21:54.040 --> 1:21:58.040]  revolt but that'll be okay because it was going to collapse civilization
[1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:01.560]  so in their drill that's actually set for 2020 2023
[1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:05.560]  they just move it forward neurological symptoms
[1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:09.320]  neurological symptoms all timers type symptoms
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:13.240]  will be caused by the vaccine they tell you in the john hopkins
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:17.720]  war game and then the former head of defense intelligence saw
[1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:20.920]  our two-hour report and said it was one of the most important things he'd ever
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:23.640]  seen and concurred we'll play that when we come back but
[1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:27.080]  as people understand we're not joking around here
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:30.920]  we're not playing games we're not just saying this to be shocking
[1:22:30.920 --> 1:22:35.000]  this is a fact i just showed you university studies mainline reports
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:39.320]  all of it now what was that professor showing if you look he's showing
[1:22:39.320 --> 1:22:42.840]  articles that stuff was in the news back at the time they were
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:46.040]  developing all this just like the human animal clones
[1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:48.680]  i don't know what he's projecting on screen but it's a magazine probably
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:51.960]  popular science because i read similar crap like that back then
[1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:55.640]  they're trying to get us ready for all of this and they
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:58.840]  say it decades before because they've already got it developed then later they
[1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:02.360]  bring it out when they're ready to go operational
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:06.120]  so you can just flip this switch now when somebody's got enough of these growing
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:08.120]  in their brain by gates says it may take three
[1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:13.080]  shots to where you just to make somebody fall down if you want and that's what
[1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:15.960]  they found with the jellyfish you notice they put jellyfish
[1:23:15.960 --> 1:23:19.720]  genome in the Pfizer shot and they said why they said
[1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:22.120]  it's sacred
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:28.040]  bioluminescence lucifer ease they call it uh you have the southern chemical
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:32.360]  i mean you can't make this up okay they even give it names like lucifer
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:35.880]  so oh you're gonna glow in the dark all right so
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:40.680]  you've been warned folks and the more we learn the worse it gets so pray to god
[1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:43.560]  remember your churches aren't churches they're globals run they're gonna tell
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:47.240]  you while you're dying it's of the lord and to take microchips and the
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:50.280]  pedophilia is good that's coming next hell a lot of the churches are already
[1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:55.480]  saying we'll be right back stay with us info wars delivers

[1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:12.200]  islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects
[1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:16.920]  according to ancient samoan legend kava was given as a gift by the sun god
[1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:20.440]  tagaloa who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:24.520]  and creator of the universe the samoan people would drink kava tea during
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:28.200]  social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little

[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:38.840]  arrest bill gates
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:42.600]  so understand this the attack on america is bigger
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:45.720]  if you were receiving this transmission individually
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:49.880]  ladies and gentlemen you are the resistance
[1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:54.520]  again that is from back in april of last year and several other clips of us
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:58.280]  saying arrest bill gates arrest fauci and then we go on to say it came from the
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:02.760]  wuhan lab it's the pretext that then give you some type of tainted poison
[1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:06.440]  vaccine which has always been their holy grail and their in game
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:10.440]  from their own admissions and now we know that indeed that is
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:15.480]  the case but before i go back to some more of those clips
[1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:22.200]  from the archive here only on a shown show i wanted to
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:29.160]  play for you general flinn a couple months ago after he'd seen my report
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:35.880]  from years ago 10 years ago predicting the
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:38.120]  fact that they were going to do all this but i didn't predict it
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:41.960]  they told us their plan they told us they would depopulate us using a poison
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:46.920]  vaccine and what they're going with is a protein
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:50.520]  that destroys your uterus destroys your testicles destroys your brain destroys
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:57.720]  your heart your lungs just makes you a blithering zombie
[1:28:57.720 --> 1:29:01.400]  with raw holes all in your brain so that finally
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:04.760]  these fallen creatures like bill gates and others
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:11.400]  can feel like that they are superior to everyone so here is
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:17.000]  general flinn the things that i would recommend for people to go look at
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  and i don't care what you think about this guy who i'm about to mention
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:27.240]  but i was sent a a video yesterday i said it's basically a documentary
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:30.360]  and late in the afternoon so i watched it last night
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:34.520]  and it's and it's by alex jones info wars and
[1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:39.480]  and the media has tarnished him with all sorts of name calling conspiracy
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:42.760]  theorist bomb thrower the one thing that i know about this
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:47.160]  gentleman alex jones is that is that he loves this country
[1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:53.000]  he is as smart as a whip he he absolutely believes in what he
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:57.080]  believes in and he also does his research and his homework
[1:29:57.080 --> 1:30:01.640]  and so i sat because a close friend of mine said you've got to watch this i
[1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:04.440]  just finished watching it he actually put it out
[1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:08.520]  yesterday and it's called an emergency broadcast and it's based on info wars
[1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:11.640]  and it's based on the whole covid lie
[1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:16.360]  and and alex takes his audience through an hour and a half worth of
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:21.720]  just incredible level of detail of a of a war game
[1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:26.920]  that our government did back in the 2016 2017 time frame
[1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:30.600]  with with you know under a different name and they called it spars
[1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:35.160]  instead of sars covid right and it's this incredible
[1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:39.160]  uh i mean it's like it's like runs parallel to
[1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:44.440]  everything that's going on today even in the war game that they did
[1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:49.400]  almost five years ago now four years ago now in the war game they even put out
[1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:54.520]  social media things like tweets and such and in the tweets that they use
[1:30:54.520 --> 1:30:57.640]  in the war game they use the exact same tweets
[1:30:57.640 --> 1:31:02.440]  over the last year i mean exact same words the exact same hashtags
[1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:06.200]  and it's like it's one big setup so let me so that's just
[1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:09.080]  this thing that this thing that alex jones put out yesterday
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:14.360]  it needs to get out in a bigger way because alex walks through
[1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:18.120]  and again whatever i don't care what people think of him he's incredibly
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:22.280]  detailed in his research he loves this country he is a patriot
[1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:26.200]  and he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this country better
[1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:30.120]  listen to and there's a reason why the mainstream media calls
[1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:33.400]  a guy like him a bomb thrower or a conspiracy theorist
[1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:38.120]  because they're they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out
[1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:42.120]  and in this particular documentary that he did yesterday it's
[1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:47.640]  fascinating and it there's an awful awful lot of parallels in it from what
[1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:51.320]  was done in a war game so to speak quote unquote
[1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:55.720]  and then what we what the reality is that we're facing
[1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:58.760]  let me give for radio listeners because they can't see the tv screen anymore
[1:31:58.760 --> 1:32:05.800]  simulcast at radio slash tv show the band.video or freeworldnews.tv site so
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:10.040]  you know uh the name of the video general flinn
[1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:15.880]  calls for investigation of spars 2025 2028 and can we please put up the band
[1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:19.160]  video link things uh from band.video you guys said
[1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:23.000]  they're perfect thank you it's emergency saturday broadcast
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:29.800]  world shocked by spars 2025 2028 document so again emergency

[1:32:41.640 --> 1:32:45.160]  want to send these globalists to prison and by the way the crew is doing a
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:48.120]  fabulous job have ever sounded irritated live here on air
[1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:51.000]  no one would do a radio tv show directing from
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:55.400]  on air the only way to do it though the way i do it is because we're live
[1:32:55.400 --> 1:32:58.920]  just breaking it's it's it's having a lifetime as i direct things
[1:32:58.920 --> 1:33:01.880]  and and this crew does a great job i sound frustrated
[1:33:01.880 --> 1:33:05.080]  it's because i am just completely freaked out i am i am
[1:33:05.080 --> 1:33:10.120]  i mean folks behind the scenes the democrats and the globalists are so
[1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:13.240]  criminal it is just unbelievable the level of
[1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:18.120]  evil i mean we are facing real evil and so i'm not feeling sorry for myself
[1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:20.680]  but most people with what's going on behind the scenes wouldn't even be on
[1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:24.440]  air right now and and you know they would be
[1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:28.680]  dealing with it or licking their wounds or whatever but
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:31.160]  i know we're on a mission i know we're going to bring down this evil i know
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:34.040]  god's on our side and so i feel stronger than ever but i but i do tend to get
[1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:36.840]  very very angry and upset and i know you do as well but let's just take that
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:40.760]  anger put in a constructive action to expose these monsters and because we
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:43.160]  wouldn't do something like this or think like this
[1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:47.240]  we have a blind spot to it you have to just admit it to yourself i mean it's so
[1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:51.720]  bad and it's so confirmed and there's no way we're wrong they admit they're doing
[1:33:51.720 --> 1:33:54.600]  it my god i mean prince charles prince philip
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:57.880]  ted turner bill gates day the rocket filler all said they want to kill us
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:01.480]  through vaccines uh you know and they've been studying
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:04.840]  how we said back in the 2000s that it looked like mad cow was how they wanted
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:08.520]  to do it because they were really obsessed with it and and we know that
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:11.800]  there are a lot of prions that are causing a lot of the Alzheimer's
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:15.160]  and that they're artificially introducing them and then now they're in the news
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:17.720]  saying we're going to put nano-tech into your body
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:22.120]  we're going to make the military ticket and you read the top of nano-tech it
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:26.520]  is it's all protein growers
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:29.480]  which is crystals
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:35.240]  it's not just you covid brain fog can linger for months
[1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:40.520]  until you just get used to it
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:44.200]  and they hit you with a burst of electromagnetic system and they can grow
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:49.320]  it and that's in major studies
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:56.200]  so at this point i mean just we got to pray to god we just got to get close to
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:58.680]  god and we've got to understand how serious all this is
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:01.880]  here's another video there's there's hundreds of these people are finding
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:06.440]  we haven't given it a title yet but uh we'll post it to band-aid video later
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:10.840]  this is from uh ten years ago there's 12 minutes of this clip i'm going to play
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:15.240]  about a minute and a half of it here it is
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:19.160]  what did i and dr group and others and dr blalock who's a
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:23.400]  brain surgeon what have we talked about in the past here on the air
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:27.480]  that the globalists have said in their white papers in their own un documents
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:31.880]  that they want to create race specific bio weapons and other systems to
[1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:34.760]  depopulate the planet they teach that everywhere that the world
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:38.280]  without humans would be great we need to depopulate china's been the center of
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:43.160]  one child policy all of this and that it would be good to call the planet a lot
[1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:47.640]  of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:52.680]  bio weapons claim that they're naturally uh occurring
[1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:57.960]  and then use that as the cover for civil emergencies societal control
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:36:02.680]  crackdowns on free speech obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:05.880]  and when he got confronted by it by congress he said well it's in case the
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:11.240]  bird flu or sars gets out just type that in cdc says internet
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:15.480]  kill switch is in case bird flu or sars breaks out and they have to control
[1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:19.400]  panic and direct every website in the us to one government
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:23.960]  announcement and we looked at every angle and believe a bio weapon release
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:27.480]  could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:31.480]  global problem and the un has said that a global pandemic is the only
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:35.240]  thing that may save their world government it may not be this year but
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:42.120]  this is the globalist plan i'm alex jones you have been warned
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:45.480]  all right we're gonna go to break i got a lot more
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:49.720]  of this for you uh straight ahead and we're just gonna

[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:16.680]  formula had a certain percentage and i said just like with bodies ultimate
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:19.480]  turmeric formula for the average competitors at five percent or
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:22.280]  humanoid i said no one else does 95 that's the
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:24.920]  highest level i said give me 95 percent humanoid
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:29.000]  didn't even cost much more and we have 95 percent humanoid
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:32.920]  well it's the same thing here this is a very strong beat extract
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:35.720]  and it's very good for your body good for your heart and it's back in stock
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:40.440]  basal beats at infowarstore.com 50 percent off
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:45.240]  turbo forces back in dna forces back in ultra 12 is back in super male
[1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:48.040]  vitalities back in and they all fund the info war
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:51.560]  and their store-wide free shipping and double patriot points for the week of
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:54.280]  memorial day
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:38:02.840]  what are champions may have here's a man who can show you
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:38.360]  If a war store dot com is simply the best If a war store dot com beats out all the rest
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:58.120]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast and then I've
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:02.880]  got some really really really really good news. Yes, I can spend an hour telling you about
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:07.200]  how the globals are getting exposed and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon and
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:10.840]  how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in. I can even tell you about how the states
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:14.640]  are turning against the puppet president Biden and saying we're going to have $1,000
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:18.240]  or $5,000 to try to make people wear masks. I can tell you about all of that, but why
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:23.320]  shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the info war? That's
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:27.520]  right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day special for the
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:35.160]  next week only with store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, and DNA Force Plus
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:42.160]  is back in stock, sold out for 7 months, 40% off, supermobile mentality, 50% off, Prostigar
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:48.640]  40% off, Albala Power 50%, Ultra 1200% as of the 50% free shipping, and Patriot points,
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:53.800]  and a tons of info war, and it's incredible products, and George Soros hates it. When I
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:57.400]  get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold out for
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:40:01.840]  3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 7 months, it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:06.040]  I'm really genuinely freaked out, because listeners were buying enough of our great
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:10.040]  supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation, because they're great
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:13.440]  products that we're coming back and getting more, and thank you for the support. But whether
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:18.240]  it's DNA Force Plus, or whether it's Polym Block, or whether it's supermobile mentality
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:23.800]  or Vaso Beats, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:28.160]  the quality of our products, and so we just can't offer them. But thank God, it looks
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:32.880]  like some good things are starting to happen right now, because suddenly a lot of products
[1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:37.200]  have been sold out for a long time are back in stock, and one of them is Polym Block.
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:41.520]  It takes a long time to get into Polym Block, but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:47.480]  allergies, it's from France, it's a special proprietary system, this is the highest quality
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:52.160]  back-of-stock infowarstore.com, store-wide free shipping, and double-patriot points,
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:56.240]  check it out.
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:03.240]  We are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:38.200]  So, President Trump went on a syndicated radio show, Wayne Allen Root today, and asked the
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:42.420]  question, what happens when people find out all these states are going to flip? Does that
[1:41:42.420 --> 1:41:50.920]  mean you go 3.5 years with someone destroying our country? Who stole the election? Well,
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:59.720]  what happens is, Mr. President, is they indict you with George Soros' operative in New York,
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:06.440]  and that's the rest of the story. I mean, this is a criminal takeover. But all of that
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:16.240]  is smoke screen for the soft-kill weapons that are being put in the vaccines from the
[1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:23.080]  scientific dictatorship. And, of course, you know, last week I aired that piece. See if
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:31.200]  you guys can dig it up on short notice. From Jesse Ventura's show, American Conspiracy,
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:38.720]  where I introduced Dr. Remo Lebo, I was looking for a video earlier this morning when you
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:43.080]  guys pulled up this video, when it was another video I wanted, but it's the one where I'm
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:48.440]  in the kitchen in Florida last week that I introduced the piece. That's the one. I forget
[1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:57.560]  the name. Yeah, it's this clip. And you have to ask yourself, you know, how could I say
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:04.160]  12 years ago, in 2009, exactly what would happen, how would be the UN, World Government,
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:10.480]  how they'd use it for censorship, total control, and then how the vaccine would have lipids
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:16.840]  in it. She listed a squalene to brain damage people and determine the zombies. Why do you
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:20.640]  keep hearing that? Why do you keep seeing it? It's in all the literature that that's
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:28.400]  what it's doing. So it's like a Twilight Zone episode. We're here today experiencing
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:35.080]  what we warned you about 25 years ago, 12 years ago, five years ago, a year ago, six
[1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:42.600]  months ago. I mean, we're here. And here's the biggest takeaway. All of these idiots.
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:50.000]  Yeah, there it is, drug delivery, nanoparticles given nanotransmitter passports to cross blood
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.640]  brain barrier. Well, I didn't even know that. I mean, I got a stack of articles about them
[1:43:54.640 --> 1:43:58.440]  going, we're going to start doing experimental stuff for the public all the time. And the
[1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:02.000]  military will just do all this unapproved, whatever we want. We're going to give the
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:07.520]  troops nanotech, it's little crystals that grow and help you. And then we can put data
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:13.880]  inside the crystals and computers read it. We scan it. Yeah, put that article back up.
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:17.560]  See because what's crazy is it's like mainstream news like everyone's going to love animal
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:23.520]  human hybrids. We've already made them. Congress two days ago couldn't pass a law. It failed
[1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:29.640]  against it. It's already happening. See how suddenly you wake up and you're in the future.
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:39.920]  It was already here. It was a breakaway civilization. They're at least 50 years ahead.
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:46.880]  Genetic engineering and biotechnology news, drug delivery, nanoparticles given neuron
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:54.960]  transmitter passports to cross blood brain barrier. Oh, it's mimics your neuron so your
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:45:01.880]  body doesn't reject it when it takes over. Oh, they're going to send little things into
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:10.960]  our brain. Oh, they love us. And when you can't talk and get Alzheimer's and, you know, when
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:19.840]  you get dementia and start, you know, drawing the walls like a three years old with the
[1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:29.480]  brown Crayola that she got out of the toilet. It's a gift. Like, like what did Joe Biden
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:35.600]  say? He said, oh, mark my words in 15 years, every hospital bed will be filled with Alzheimer's
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:40.920]  because it's true. And the left's going to love it. They're going to love their five
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:44.520]  year old that takes the COVID shot by the time they're 10 is going to have Parkinson's.
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:48.960]  It won't be able to be like, oh, we get attention now. Our child's dying. More shots, more and
[1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:53.040]  more and more and the child's convulsing like liberal liberal liberal because the left wants
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:46:00.880]  to cut their genitals off anyways. And again, it's they're bringing us to their dimension
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:07.800]  and a great allegory is event horizon. 1990s sci-fi horror movie. I like it. It's well done.
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:12.480]  And this time machine of this warp drive takes you another dimension to full space, but you
[1:46:12.480 --> 1:46:18.000]  go through hell on the way or a dimension of just pure evil. And the people when they
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:21.040]  actually watch the footage of the crew killing themselves are just ripping their eyeballs
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:26.160]  out, cutting their tongues out and just loving it. Like you're scratching their eyes out
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.640]  everything. Well, that's what the Aztecs would do when they were streaming with whatever
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:38.880]  this stuff was. And so, I mean, that's it. You want to know what life's like event horizon.
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:44.720]  Period. That's your future. That's where we are. Hell is opening. Hell is coming. Hell
[1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:49.600]  is here. And that's why everything you see is going to be totally hellish is dying people,
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:53.720]  convulsing cancer everywhere, total death, the armored cars pulling up, leftist jumping
[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:56.960]  out with machine guns, marching and injecting you. And then a month later, because it's
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:00.080]  going to get worse and worse, you know, they're going to give you more and more deadly shots.
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:03.600]  You'll be dying, but your neighbors won't say anything. Because if you say they're hurting
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:09.840]  you, if you say the shots are bad, you'll be shot on site. And of course, the leftists
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:12.560]  aren't going to come in your house. They're going to pull up in a van to loot and rob and
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:20.560]  rape your kids. They're going to send robots in to kill you. So if you want to know, pull
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:27.040]  up the photos off of Instagram of the left, taking selfies of themselves, getting the
[1:47:27.040 --> 1:47:31.920]  shots and they all have this crazy demonic look. We didn't pick these to show you the
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:47.480]  crazy ones in almost every photo. And again, it's a sacrament of showing I want to die.
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:53.080]  I want to merge with Satan. I want Satan seated me. It is a sexual experience. That's all
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:58.160]  they're into is this stupid, Crowley sex magic crap. And they are being infected with the
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:06.320]  genetics of a dead boy that is in the vaccines and the jellyfish and the nano viruses and
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:12.240]  they're just communing with the death and just getting off on the death and the destruction.
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:18.880]  It's like a long, slow, enjoyable suicide. And all over the news, they've got new liberal
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:23.760]  fetishes around for a while. They're like, oh, we like to get pregnant and new sonograms
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:28.520]  and look at the baby and wait till it's nine months. And then we take it. We have an abortion
[1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:33.960]  and it turns us on to kill our daughter or kill our son. I'm going to play the video.
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:39.760]  Oh, God, it felt so good. They chopped her up inside of me. Oh, I asked them if I could
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:46.240]  just look at their body parts. Oh, I love to kill my daughter and a son. And then Governor
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:55.840]  Northam says, we keep the babies comfortable only harvest. Oh, but see, it's liberal. And
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:01.920]  the good guys, Bruce Jenner and a big bird demon outfit is stumbling and the conservatives
[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:06.680]  go, oh, here's our God. He doesn't want to cut the boys ding dongs off. He doesn't want
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:11.120]  boys and girls sports. He just says dress like a girl. He's the good guy. I mean, just
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:16.540]  a total deception. Total death and what is the transmission cut off your Gentiles?
[1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:21.600]  Gouge out your eyes? Die. Cut off your Gentiles gouged out your eyes. Die. Come off your
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:25.420]  Gentiles Gouged out your eyes. Die. Cut off your Gentiles. Guyout your eyes. Dye. That's
[1:49:25.420 --> 1:49:30.840]  the state in it. Transmission and the leftist dances to it. Cut off your fürversion. It
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:35.180]  will scouts out your eyes. Dye. Cut off your Gentiles. Gauge out your eyes. Dye. Cut off
[1:49:35.180 --> 1:49:39.340]  for Gentiles, Galge out my eyes die, murder baby, Jeff, eat people.
[1:49:39.340 --> 1:49:49.980]  Rebellion is gone. That's all they do. That's the transmission.
[1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:55.100]  The TV puts them into a trance state, then it programs them into the demon state.
[1:49:55.100 --> 1:49:57.900]  And they're coming for your guns, and they're coming for your soul, and they're coming for
[1:49:57.900 --> 1:50:01.220]  your genetics, and they're coming for you and your children.
[1:50:01.220 --> 1:50:06.300]  All right. Need to pay some bills around here. We'll keep us on air.
[1:50:06.300 --> 1:50:12.100]  I suggest that you get DNA Force Plus for your mitochondria, for your DNA, for your
[1:50:12.100 --> 1:50:18.860]  telomeres of the PQQ and the CoQ10. This is the Rolls-Royce highest-level quality you
[1:50:18.860 --> 1:50:26.700]  can get, 40% off sold out for almost seven months, infoorstore.com, or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9,

[1:50:29.700 --> 1:50:35.180]  free shipping and double-patriot points together for Memorial Day.
[1:50:35.180 --> 1:50:39.620]  Right through to next Wednesday, we're running this special, and then it will end. And we
[1:50:39.620 --> 1:50:47.140]  have all the other great stuff back in stock. Alpha Power, VasoBeats, Ultra 12, Prostaguard,

[1:50:55.140 --> 1:50:59.060]  and it keeps us on air as long as God wants us to stay on air.
[1:50:59.060 --> 1:51:03.740]  So I hope God touches your heart to my products so that as we're under globalist attack,
[1:51:03.740 --> 1:51:10.940]  we can power up to savagely go on to the end, quote Churchill, whatever the cost may be,
[1:51:10.940 --> 1:51:15.540]  but it is only you, like God holding the stars in the sky. Well, you hold us with your gravity,
[1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:20.540]  your prayer, your support, your word of mouth in the fight. You throw us like a hatchet of
[1:51:20.540 --> 1:51:27.540]  truth towards the goblins' face. When you buy the products, you are in the war. You
[1:51:27.540 --> 1:51:35.660]  are funding the tip of the spear, fiery with its intensity and commitment. Infoorstore.com,
[1:51:35.660 --> 1:51:42.420]  hour number three, tons of news, and a major Facebook whistleblower, straight ahead.
[1:51:42.420 --> 1:51:47.180]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where Info Wars is, and it's
[1:51:47.180 --> 1:51:51.700]  always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons
[1:51:51.700 --> 1:51:57.340]  that make all this possible. So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral of censorship,
[1:51:57.340 --> 1:52:02.060]  Info Wars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing
[1:52:02.060 --> 1:52:06.900]  the global agenda and fighting it. But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of
[1:52:06.900 --> 1:52:10.940]  supply chains has almost shut us down because most of the best-selling products which you
[1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:15.260]  want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others, have been sold out for up to seven months.
[1:52:15.260 --> 1:52:20.100]  Well, guess what? DNA Force Plus just came back in. Thank God for seven months. It's
[1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:24.900]  40% off. It's amazing at InfoWarsstore.com. And for the week leading up through Memorial
[1:52:24.900 --> 1:52:29.780]  Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double-patria points, and alpha powers back
[1:52:29.780 --> 1:52:34.420]  in stock, and supermilitalies back in stock, and pollen block, and vaso-beaster all back
[1:52:34.420 --> 1:52:40.180]  in stock, as much as 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, InfoWarsstore.com.
[1:52:40.180 --> 1:52:46.180]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, Info Warriors. You know, I'm cutting ad right now, and I've
[1:52:46.180 --> 1:52:49.820]  been here on the Saturday cut knees. I've done a terrible job because I've just cut
[1:52:49.820 --> 1:52:56.540]  like five ads, and I didn't tell people the most important part. No, it's not that DNA
[1:52:56.540 --> 1:53:01.660]  Force Plus has been sold out for seven months, and it's back in stock, and it's 40% off.
[1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:05.580]  Or how the supply chain broke down, and how it almost bankrupted us, but thank God, it
[1:53:05.580 --> 1:53:10.060]  finally came in. Or how it cleans up your mitochondria, and makes your telomeres last
[1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:14.220]  longer, and can regrow nerves. You've got to go research DNA Force Plus. No, it's not
[1:53:14.220 --> 1:53:19.100]  that. The reason I just cut all those ads, and forgot the most important point, the supermilital
[1:53:19.100 --> 1:53:24.380]  vitality is back in stock, 50% off. The processing arts back 40% off. The alpha power is back
[1:53:24.380 --> 1:53:29.580]  50% off. The Ultra 12, I'm gonna be 12, take another tongue, it's incredible. It's back
[1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:35.740]  also 50% off. Or Vazel beats back 50% off. No. Instead, we've got double-patria points
[1:53:35.740 --> 1:53:39.980]  and free shipping store-wide, double-patria points, free shipping store-wide on top of
[1:53:39.980 --> 1:53:46.980]  the huge sales.
[1:53:46.980 --> 1:53:51.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:51.980 --> 1:54:09.860]  Well, Morgan Common is one of the big whistleblowers, insiders at Facebook that went public for
[1:54:09.860 --> 1:54:14.420]  these documents from this year, where they are beginning to go after even, quote, truthful
[1:54:14.420 --> 1:54:19.860]  statements. We're gonna show you some of those documents concerning COVID-19, the vaccines,
[1:54:19.860 --> 1:54:27.660]  all of it. And Tucker Carlson had him on last night. Again, he did protect his identity,
[1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:32.020]  but he decided yesterday to go ahead and go public, and he's there at the Project Veritas
[1:54:32.020 --> 1:54:37.980]  headquarters, it looks like. So we're gonna be going to him on the other side of this
[1:54:37.980 --> 1:54:43.340]  short segment, but I wanted to air the Tucker Carlson piece. We salute him for going public,
[1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:47.620]  and this is Achilles' heel of these deceptive mega-corporations, as the truth is coming
[1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:50.180]  out because of insiders here it is.
[1:54:50.180 --> 1:54:54.740]  Earlier this week, James O'Keefe and Project Veritas did this country yet another public
[1:54:54.740 --> 1:55:00.020]  service. They obtained international internal documents from a whistleblower at Facebook.
[1:55:00.020 --> 1:55:05.180]  The whistleblower explained that Facebook automatically flags comments that express any concern about
[1:55:05.180 --> 1:55:07.660]  the coronavirus vaccine.
[1:55:07.660 --> 1:55:12.900]  Facebook uses classifiers in their algorithms to determine certain contents, to be what
[1:55:12.900 --> 1:55:17.060]  they call vaccine hesitant, or they call it vaccine hesitancy, and without the user's
[1:55:17.060 --> 1:55:22.220]  knowledge, they assign a score to these comments that's called a VH score, a vaccine hesitancy
[1:55:22.220 --> 1:55:26.940]  score, and based on that score, will demo or leave the comment alone, depending on the
[1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.260]  content within the comment.
[1:55:29.260 --> 1:55:34.380]  According to those documents, here's one example of what Facebook considers a tier one vaccine
[1:55:34.380 --> 1:55:39.220]  hesitancy comment. Quote, if the vaccines are so useful, then why do we still need to
[1:55:39.220 --> 1:55:44.540]  wear a mask or social distance afterward? Fair question, but not allowed. Morgan Coleman
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:49.660]  is the whistleblower who exposed all of this. He's been suspended from his job at Facebook.
[1:55:49.660 --> 1:55:50.660]  He joins us now.
[1:55:50.660 --> 1:55:57.180]  Morgan, thanks so much for coming on and for your bravery. It sounds like any real questions
[1:55:57.180 --> 1:56:00.140]  at all about the vaccines are not allowed by Facebook.
[1:56:00.140 --> 1:56:06.300]  Yeah, Tucker, that's true. Basically, the way that they set this up is that anything
[1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:11.700]  that questions the vaccine or the narrative regarding the vaccine, which is everyone should
[1:56:11.700 --> 1:56:14.940]  get the vaccine and the vaccine is good and you're not going to have very many bad side
[1:56:14.940 --> 1:56:19.500]  effects, anything outside of that realm is basically considered under vaccine hesitancy
[1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:22.460]  by Facebook's algorithms.
[1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:28.740]  Is there any motive that you can understand? Why would they want to ban people from asking
[1:56:28.740 --> 1:56:36.540]  honest questions or reporting real side effects?
[1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:41.980]  Well honestly, Tucker, I think that they're afraid of what people might conclude if they
[1:56:41.980 --> 1:56:47.740]  see that other people are having negative side effects. They think that this is going
[1:56:47.740 --> 1:56:51.780]  to drive up vaccine hesitancy among the population and they see that as something that they have
[1:56:51.780 --> 1:57:02.060]  to combat. But honestly, I think that that is not something that... Basically, my moral
[1:57:02.060 --> 1:57:08.500]  compass says that that is not the right thing to do because basically the users at Facebook
[1:57:08.500 --> 1:57:13.420]  are not aware that this is going on. If you're using Facebook or a social platform and they're
[1:57:13.420 --> 1:57:19.100]  censoring the content of your comments unbeknownst to you, I think that's highly immoral.
[1:57:19.100 --> 1:57:25.260]  It is highly immoral. You are willing to lose your job and it sounds like you have or will
[1:57:25.260 --> 1:57:28.260]  for coming forward. Is that why you came forward?
[1:57:28.260 --> 1:57:36.060]  Yeah, I believe that any consequences that are besotted on to me by Facebook as a result
[1:57:36.060 --> 1:57:40.420]  of this week and these documents that I've leaked to Project Veritas, I think any of
[1:57:40.420 --> 1:57:45.740]  those consequences don't really weigh much when it comes to having to live with myself
[1:57:45.740 --> 1:57:49.940]  and ask myself for the rest of my life. I saw these documents and I had the opportunity
[1:57:49.940 --> 1:57:55.540]  to show the public this and what's going on behind the scenes and I didn't do it. I wouldn't
[1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:57.260]  be able to live with myself after that.
[1:57:57.260 --> 1:58:02.820]  I consider that heroic. This country used to consider whistleblowing heroic. Have you
[1:58:02.820 --> 1:58:07.660]  been treated as a hero?
[1:58:07.660 --> 1:58:13.460]  Among the close company I have now, yes. As for Facebook, they decided to suddenly tell
[1:58:13.460 --> 1:58:17.580]  me to stop my work one day while I was at work, call me into a meeting with my supervisor
[1:58:17.580 --> 1:58:21.780]  and a security guard. They removed all my company equipment from me, my company laptop,
[1:58:21.780 --> 1:58:25.700]  company cell phone, and my badge, my access badge. They walked me out of my car and basically
[1:58:25.700 --> 1:58:31.020]  informed me that they would be having an investigatory meeting with me at a later date, which they
[1:58:31.020 --> 1:58:32.020]  actually...
[1:58:32.020 --> 1:58:35.060]  All right. Now Facebook has responded. It's like, oh, we told our employees this isn't
[1:58:35.060 --> 1:58:40.620]  secret, but of course it is secret, as all criminal activities are. They're really out
[1:58:40.620 --> 1:58:45.460]  of control. They're now censoring Congress when they have hearings about this and members
[1:58:45.460 --> 1:58:51.900]  of parliament in Australia. Stay with us and we'll talk to this man for a day.
[1:58:51.900 --> 1:58:59.060]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials and right now we've got store-wide free shipping.
[1:58:59.060 --> 1:59:04.900]  We've got double Patriot points. We've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold out for seven

[1:59:23.500 --> 1:59:27.940]  up with, with top developers to blow people away. And it's all there. There's a bunch
[1:59:27.940 --> 1:59:33.340]  of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales and specials
[1:59:33.340 --> 1:59:38.420]  to mention them all here today. But whatever you do, go to infoorstore.com with destroyer-free
[1:59:38.420 --> 1:59:43.660]  shipping and double Patriot points and sold out for seven months. DNA Force Plus with
[1:59:43.660 --> 2:00:05.460]  the PQQ and the CoQ10 that's been sold out is now back in stock, 40% off, infoorstore.com.
[2:00:05.460 --> 2:00:12.020]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[2:00:12.020 --> 2:00:18.580]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:18.580 --> 2:00:25.140]  So, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith of all people, says life will be like Orwell's
[2:00:25.140 --> 2:00:34.060]  1984. By 2024, if AI is allowed to surveil us and control us, well, it's already 1984
[2:00:34.060 --> 2:00:40.980]  for 3 billion users. Facebook and new internal documents a few days ago came out. Project
[2:00:40.980 --> 2:00:46.940]  Veritas with two whistleblowers and one of them, Morgan Common, has gone public before
[2:00:46.940 --> 2:00:52.380]  he was just blacked out in the studio to protect his identity. But they went ahead and called
[2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:57.660]  him in and discovered and figured out who had dared mention the guidelines, the orders,
[2:00:57.660 --> 2:01:05.460]  that anything true event or a fact where someone's been hurt by a vaccine or has questions or
[2:01:05.460 --> 2:01:08.660]  is telling people that they have a right to basically not be forced to do it, anything
[2:01:08.660 --> 2:01:12.020]  critical in any way is not allowed. But, of course, they didn't want you to know that.
[2:01:12.020 --> 2:01:15.300]  A member of parliament in Australia a few weeks ago who said that you shouldn't have
[2:01:15.300 --> 2:01:20.740]  forced inoculations, he's banned on Facebook. Facebook now announced that anyone that questioned
[2:01:20.740 --> 2:01:24.420]  the election results in Congress, which the Democrats did four years ago, five years ago
[2:01:24.420 --> 2:01:29.140]  for Biden, that they won't be allowed to engage in political activity on Facebook, including
[2:01:29.140 --> 2:01:35.780]  Senator Ted Cruz. So, the tyranny is here. It's not coming, but I love their response
[2:01:35.780 --> 2:01:40.260]  that, oh, this wasn't secret. We let employees know about it. But if they talk about it,
[2:01:40.260 --> 2:01:47.420]  anybody, they're fired. Morgan Common joins us. Go send go.com forward slash expose Facebook.
[2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:52.420]  Everybody needs our support who's doing this. This is the real war and people tell them
[2:01:52.420 --> 2:01:57.540]  the truth of the frontline soldiers. So, this is one of the biggest censorship stories ever.
[2:01:57.540 --> 2:02:02.500]  It's incredible. Thanks for joining us, Morgan. This is just broken the last 48 hours and
[2:02:02.500 --> 2:02:07.300]  I guess you've just been discovered recently as the pro human mole inside Facebook. Give
[2:02:07.300 --> 2:02:12.260]  us, give us your just thought of what's happening and other points you'd like to add. Basically,
[2:02:12.260 --> 2:02:18.900]  you've got the floor. All right. Thank you, Alex. So, basically, after Facebook saw this,
[2:02:18.900 --> 2:02:24.420]  saw the story where I came out and my identity was hidden, I went back to work after I got
[2:02:24.420 --> 2:02:28.180]  back from producing that story. And I was working and they basically said, hey, when
[2:02:28.180 --> 2:02:31.820]  you just stop all your work and you immediately come bring all your personal stuff and all
[2:02:31.820 --> 2:02:37.140]  your work equipment to this meeting in a conference room. So, I did as I was told and went up
[2:02:37.140 --> 2:02:41.820]  there and went to the room. I got a security guard and my main supervisor there. They informed
[2:02:41.820 --> 2:02:46.060]  me that I was under investigation. They took my employee access badge. They took my laptop.
[2:02:46.060 --> 2:02:51.820]  They took my phone, my work laptop and my work phone and basically said, yeah, you know,
[2:02:51.820 --> 2:02:55.300]  and they put me on the phone with a third party representative who was in contact with Facebook
[2:02:55.300 --> 2:02:59.940]  who informed me, yes, you're under investigation. We're going to file a request for a meeting
[2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:04.460]  on this date. And then I was like, okay, sounds good. And then the security guard walked me
[2:03:04.460 --> 2:03:09.980]  out to my car. And, you know, after that is when I decided to go public.
[2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:13.380]  What do you make of their public response to it? I've got the quotes here. Talk about
[2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:17.180]  Orwellian. They're like, oh, this is no big deal. We tell employees we do this. There's
[2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:19.180]  nothing happening here.
[2:03:19.180 --> 2:03:23.500]  Yeah. I honestly expected this response from them. A lot of times their public, well, most
[2:03:23.500 --> 2:03:26.580]  of it, their public policy and their private policy is written very differently. Their
[2:03:26.580 --> 2:03:30.860]  public policy is written in a way that is, it makes it very easy to defend. It's very
[2:03:30.860 --> 2:03:34.580]  ambiguous. It's very flip floppy and smoky. And that way, if it's, if it's questioned,
[2:03:34.580 --> 2:03:37.460]  they can just come up with, with, with, you know, whatever the new term of the term of
[2:03:37.460 --> 2:03:41.300]  the day is to say, well, this is just reducing harm. And we're just helping people out.
[2:03:41.300 --> 2:03:44.460]  But internally, things are much more specific. Obviously, you know, you look at these documents
[2:03:44.460 --> 2:03:49.540]  and they have very specific things on here. And they know exactly what they're doing.
[2:03:49.540 --> 2:03:52.380]  And yeah.
[2:03:52.380 --> 2:03:58.740]  And now here you are sitting in Project Veritas Studios, I guess in New York. This has been
[2:03:58.740 --> 2:04:00.460]  quite a week for you, hasn't it?
[2:04:00.460 --> 2:04:04.780]  Yeah. Yeah. Very little sleep. It's kind of surreal for me, but I know that despite all
[2:04:04.780 --> 2:04:08.900]  the hardships I'm going through now, this has to get out. You know, people had to see
[2:04:08.900 --> 2:04:14.820]  this. I couldn't really, not releasing this does not align with my moral compass. There's
[2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:18.420]  no way that I could have not released this and lived with myself. And I mean, this is
[2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:21.340]  not just about me. It's not just about the United States, not just about Facebook. It's
[2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:25.220]  about the entire world. These people really are creating a model and have created really
[2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:30.900]  a model that's live right now. They've created a model for acting hesitancy now, but this
[2:04:30.900 --> 2:04:37.380]  could actually expand to include really any topic. And I think that maybe it will still,
[2:04:37.380 --> 2:04:40.020]  but had I knocked him out this, it certainly would have.
[2:04:40.020 --> 2:04:43.140]  Well, we know that there's similar systems. We know during the election, they were blocking
[2:04:43.140 --> 2:04:49.260]  pro Trump stuff. What else did you witness while you were inside Facebook?
[2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:52.340]  So one thing that was kind of disconcerting is when I actually discovered this document,
[2:04:52.340 --> 2:04:57.880]  it was posted on an internal social media platform that Facebook uses called workplace. And the
[2:04:57.880 --> 2:05:02.180]  comments from the people who have access to that interim platform were actually, there
[2:05:02.180 --> 2:05:05.540]  was a lot of positive comments saying, this is very exciting. I'm very glad that we can
[2:05:05.540 --> 2:05:12.100]  do this. I've even seen people, employees make complaints like, Hey, I got an anti vaccine
[2:05:12.100 --> 2:05:17.980]  or a vaccine has a tent post put in my recommendations. I want this to be fixed, please. And but as
[2:05:17.980 --> 2:05:21.420]  far as like, you know, water cooler conversations and around the office, you know, personal
[2:05:21.420 --> 2:05:27.980]  conversations with people in person, they seem to be against censoring this kind of
[2:05:27.980 --> 2:05:30.260]  thing. And they think that everyone should be able to make their own choice because
[2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:37.220]  it is a personal choice. So it's kind of concerning.
[2:05:37.220 --> 2:05:41.460]  There are so many different facets to this, so many angles. Imagine this is your chance
[2:05:41.460 --> 2:05:45.140]  like talking to 5 million people last night to Carlson, probably 2 million people conservative
[2:05:45.140 --> 2:05:50.100]  or tuning right now. What else do you want the public to know?
[2:05:50.100 --> 2:05:54.300]  I want the public to know that I'm just a normal person. I come from a town has way
[2:05:54.300 --> 2:05:59.300]  less than 10,000 people in the middle of nowhere. And just because you don't have notoriety,
[2:05:59.300 --> 2:06:01.820]  just because you're not, you know, you don't think that you're a somebody doesn't mean
[2:06:01.820 --> 2:06:04.780]  that if you have access to information like this, that could help people that you can
[2:06:04.780 --> 2:06:07.780]  bring it out, you can definitely bring it out. There are people like project Veritas,
[2:06:07.780 --> 2:06:11.660]  you can go to Veritas tips of proton mail.com. They will help you out. They do this kind
[2:06:11.660 --> 2:06:16.100]  of thing for, you know, this is one of their sticks, you know, and they will take care
[2:06:16.100 --> 2:06:19.860]  of you. There's a lot of people that are on your side, you know, it's the silent majority,
[2:06:19.860 --> 2:06:23.060]  but it's really hard for the average person because of the consequences. I mean, Facebook
[2:06:23.060 --> 2:06:28.460]  is a very, very powerful company. They're not even really beholden to, you know, the
[2:06:28.460 --> 2:06:32.260]  US government. So, well, absolutely, the US government, I'm
[2:06:32.260 --> 2:06:36.460]  sure you saw the news that members of Congress that we're going to have a 10 day investigation,
[2:06:36.460 --> 2:06:39.580]  which is totally legal, you know, Democrats did it five years ago, they challenged Trump
[2:06:39.580 --> 2:06:44.340]  selection, if you remember, and tried to not even get the delegates to be seated. They're
[2:06:44.340 --> 2:06:49.660]  trying to say anybody that was trying to hold a vote on January 6 before the riot, that
[2:06:49.660 --> 2:06:54.980]  they don't get to be political or promote themselves on Facebook. I mean, that's directly interfering
[2:06:54.980 --> 2:06:55.980]  in our election.
[2:06:55.980 --> 2:07:01.900]  Yeah, it's totally Orwellian. And I think that the comparison by the Microsoft CEO
[2:07:01.900 --> 2:07:06.820]  to 1984, yeah, that's certainly correct. And I think that what they're trying to do,
[2:07:06.820 --> 2:07:11.860]  you know, they know the power they're wielding, and I think a lot of times, too, with, especially
[2:07:11.860 --> 2:07:15.260]  with the internal employees and the software engineers, they take advantage of people's
[2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:18.660]  good nature, where then they try to say, you know, you guys are helping out and the world
[2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:22.500]  needs this and you guys are heroes. And one of their stated goals, even in one of the documents
[2:07:22.500 --> 2:07:25.860]  says that they want people to know that they did this and then they want to take credit
[2:07:25.860 --> 2:07:32.900]  for their work. And I think that if people need to, you know, go in and see these kind
[2:07:32.900 --> 2:07:36.220]  of things and they need to follow their moral compass and say, yeah, even though I'm an
[2:07:36.220 --> 2:07:40.980]  executive Facebook, this is wrong. And we should not be doing this. And if, you know, you receive
[2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:43.500]  opposition, make it public.
[2:07:43.500 --> 2:07:48.020]  Morgan Common is a major whistleblower. We really appreciate him joining us. We got one
[2:07:48.020 --> 2:07:51.620]  more segment with him. How do people reach out to you? How do other IT companies that
[2:07:51.620 --> 2:07:56.780]  might want you to work with them who are moral? How do people reach out to you for employment
[2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:59.340]  or how do people reach out to you for interviews?
[2:07:59.340 --> 2:08:03.340]  All right, if you guys want to reach out to me, the best way to do that and fastest would
[2:08:03.340 --> 2:08:08.700]  probably be just to go through Project Veritas. You can contact them on their website. And
[2:08:08.700 --> 2:08:15.100]  then if you want to support me personally, we set up a fundraiser on givesendgo.com slash
[2:08:15.100 --> 2:08:19.420]  expose Facebook. And you can go there and donate there. And then I also included some
[2:08:19.420 --> 2:08:22.620]  cryptocurrency links to some addresses in there you can use as well.
[2:08:22.620 --> 2:08:27.820]  Well, it's important to build our own community and to support and celebrate people that expose
[2:08:27.820 --> 2:08:31.300]  the criminal activity of Facebook. I mean, they're not going to like this information
[2:08:31.300 --> 2:08:35.180]  coming out. They're not very happy right now, because they say right here, we want to suppress
[2:08:35.180 --> 2:08:39.820]  the truth, true events and facts. That is amazing.
[2:08:39.820 --> 2:08:45.340]  Yeah, I have a feeling that they're scrambling. Damage control mode right now.
[2:08:45.340 --> 2:08:48.660]  How do you think Facebook got to be the most powerful, I think more powerful than Google,
[2:08:48.660 --> 2:08:53.380]  more powerful than Apple, hands down worldwide involved in all these elections, politics,
[2:08:53.380 --> 2:08:58.700]  telling countries what they can and can't do. I mean, who died made Mark Zuckerberg God?
[2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:02.660]  I think that honestly, Mark Zuckerberg had his own had his own ideas in the beginning.
[2:09:02.660 --> 2:09:06.180]  And yeah, he's still a part of it now. So he's certainly not to escape blame. But I
[2:09:06.180 --> 2:09:09.580]  think that this is something that has grown way out of his control. I think there's a
[2:09:09.580 --> 2:09:12.540]  there's a group of people behind behind the scenes that are, you know, kind of like a
[2:09:12.540 --> 2:09:15.860]  board or something that are making all the calls and stuff like that and bingo exactly
[2:09:15.860 --> 2:09:20.100]  just like Henry Ford was one thing. And then the other group took over his foundation.
[2:09:20.100 --> 2:09:24.660]  The same thing gates took over IBM's foundation. Most folks don't know that through his mother.
[2:09:24.660 --> 2:09:28.980]  But exactly you have the Southern primary law center and other groups that are now taking
[2:09:28.980 --> 2:09:34.460]  over the board of Facebook and are in control. So the left is in who is in control of a three
[2:09:34.460 --> 2:09:39.300]  billion person army. They could influence bully and control in a giant brainwashing
[2:09:39.300 --> 2:09:44.740]  gulag. We've got a lot of news on that as well. Coming up got major whistleblower Morgan
[2:09:44.740 --> 2:09:53.620]  common stay with us. In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you how amazing pollen block

[2:10:49.620 --> 2:10:54.860]  really works. One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just
[2:10:54.860 --> 2:11:01.500]  out and about is Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines? How do I warn them?
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:05.900]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it. So many facts. It's the history of
[2:11:05.900 --> 2:11:10.660]  contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in the US and Europe,
[2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:15.380]  the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines
[2:11:15.380 --> 2:11:21.220]  and the whole history of secret experimentation on at risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites,
[2:11:21.220 --> 2:11:25.820]  Native Americans, the list goes on and on. But what about the fact that Fauci testified
[2:11:25.820 --> 2:11:33.140]  to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around half of the
[2:11:33.140 --> 2:11:38.140]  NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, neurologist, scientists have refused to take the vaccine
[2:11:38.140 --> 2:11:42.780]  and don't take it safe. Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it.
[2:11:42.780 --> 2:11:45.780]  It's the same thing in the private practices out there, somewhere numbers that that's not
[2:11:45.780 --> 2:11:53.780]  something I'm going to be taking. That's very, very simple. There's your answer.
[2:11:53.780 --> 2:12:19.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. You can run on for a long time, run on for a long
[2:12:19.780 --> 2:12:28.180]  time. Sooner or later, gotta put you down. You know, we got some big breaking news next
[2:12:28.180 --> 2:12:34.180]  segment. This is news is just as important. Go tell that. Wait to see where we cover next
[2:12:34.180 --> 2:12:40.180]  segment. Alex Jones here back live. Morgan Common is our guest Facebook insider that
[2:12:40.180 --> 2:12:44.860]  chose to come forward with Facebook internal company documents and telling a plan to quote
[2:12:44.860 --> 2:12:49.700]  curb vaccine hesitancy assignment vaccine. It's a GMO thing they've cooked up on a
[2:12:49.700 --> 2:12:56.860]  global scale that stated goal of feature is to drastically reduce user exposure to vaccine
[2:12:56.860 --> 2:13:01.220]  hesitant comments like people dying, like the BBC presenter that just died from a blood
[2:13:01.220 --> 2:13:04.700]  clot in her brain or she took it. I mean, it's just an everyday occurrence of some famous
[2:13:04.700 --> 2:13:08.940]  person dies and they pulled much of these vaccines around the world. We even try to
[2:13:08.940 --> 2:13:16.620]  share that fact. They block it. So what is it like for these content moderators serve?
[2:13:16.620 --> 2:13:22.060]  When you see a doctor, you know, talking to a legislature in Florida and I remember Facebook
[2:13:22.060 --> 2:13:27.820]  censored that and Twitter censored it and so did YouTube or you see congressional hearings
[2:13:27.820 --> 2:13:31.980]  where they gave testimony. I remember six months ago about Wuhan lab being probably where it
[2:13:31.980 --> 2:13:36.980]  came from. And I remember seeing where YouTube took that down. It's not just not just Facebook.
[2:13:36.980 --> 2:13:44.020]  It's Google sub companies. I mean, they're all doing it. We're now Legislature testimony.
[2:13:44.020 --> 2:13:52.740]  We can't see. I mean, this is outrageous. Yeah, Alex, it's absolutely outrageous and
[2:13:52.740 --> 2:13:56.260]  these people, you know, the thing that they even have the power to do this and totally
[2:13:56.260 --> 2:13:59.180]  totally get away with it is one of the things that really, you know, rubs me the wrong way
[2:13:59.180 --> 2:14:01.420]  where they're like, yeah, you know, this is totally normal and we're going to do this
[2:14:01.420 --> 2:14:04.700]  and you're not going to ask any questions. You're just going to keep going. And as long
[2:14:04.700 --> 2:14:11.220]  as we let you have your Facebook and your Instagram, then you'll say, okay, well, I would expect
[2:14:11.220 --> 2:14:16.060]  more people to go public and whistleblowers are watching. I know the Project Veritas is
[2:14:16.060 --> 2:14:21.300]  a great network and they've been helping whistleblowers that come forward, get other jobs, get, you
[2:14:21.300 --> 2:14:25.420]  know, support up front because it's hard to lose your job, but it's even harder to be
[2:14:25.420 --> 2:14:30.940]  part of an evil organization without giving away any other employees or coworkers that
[2:14:30.940 --> 2:14:35.620]  also had similar thoughts because, you know, the Facebook folks are spying on you and watching
[2:14:35.620 --> 2:14:39.660]  us right now. But what was the sense of other people around you? Were they concerned or
[2:14:39.660 --> 2:14:45.900]  were you more like Winston Smith in 1984, the Ministry of Truth, just keeping it to yourself?
[2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:49.940]  Other people were absolutely concerned. I had many, many conversations with many different
[2:14:49.940 --> 2:14:54.740]  people on this, both on the internal platform and in person. And yeah, people are very concerned
[2:14:54.740 --> 2:14:58.220]  about this, you know, they're concerned that Facebook even cares what your personal medical
[2:14:58.220 --> 2:15:02.500]  choices are and that they would moderate your content based on that. And they also don't
[2:15:02.500 --> 2:15:06.060]  get, you know, like, what's the big deal? Like, what's the whole thing behind this?
[2:15:06.060 --> 2:15:09.060]  But you know what, they never get a straight answer. Never get a straight answer on that.
[2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:12.300]  And I think that's one of the things where people, even if they don't know a lot about
[2:15:12.300 --> 2:15:17.820]  the vaccines and the FSC and, you know, all the hubbub, at least when they see, well,
[2:15:17.820 --> 2:15:22.700]  why can't we talk about it? That's a huge red flag even to the average person, I think.
[2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:28.100]  And again, you have the Microsoft president saying AI is 1984 when it censors and controls
[2:15:28.100 --> 2:15:33.420]  you. Is it the act of censoring somebody even before it's posted, which I see is in the
[2:15:33.420 --> 2:15:38.460]  report about you and others, that you and others said we have to do something because
[2:15:38.460 --> 2:15:42.340]  they're even suppressing stuff before it ever makes it on the platform.
[2:15:42.340 --> 2:15:46.780]  Yeah, yeah, they'll suppress things before it even makes it to your page. And then they'll
[2:15:46.780 --> 2:15:51.700]  actually also suppress recommendations. If things, a content is found to be vaccine
[2:15:51.700 --> 2:15:55.580]  hesitant, they'll make it so that it can't even be recommended to other people. So they're
[2:15:55.580 --> 2:16:02.180]  absolutely trying to stifle the spread. They're trying to stifle the free speech. And honestly,
[2:16:02.180 --> 2:16:06.660]  like I said, this vaccine hesitancy thing is just, you know, small change compared to
[2:16:06.660 --> 2:16:10.180]  what this model could be applied to, which is literally anything they could they could
[2:16:10.180 --> 2:16:13.660]  apply this to any topic they want on their on their platform.
[2:16:13.660 --> 2:16:18.140]  So we think about Iran as a threat and I agree there that's a threat and we think about Russia
[2:16:18.140 --> 2:16:22.260]  could be a threat. China definitely is a major threat to America. But if we become and let
[2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:26.660]  companies become far worse than even they are, then then we've already lost the war
[2:16:26.660 --> 2:16:32.100]  of our own choosing. We've already run up the white flag to evil.
[2:16:32.100 --> 2:16:37.340]  Yeah, it's the arrogance of the of the human intellect, you know, we think that we we're
[2:16:37.340 --> 2:16:42.060]  so great and we discover these and create these technological marvels. And then we say
[2:16:42.060 --> 2:16:46.260]  we yes, we can control this and we know everything about this in and out. And you know, people
[2:16:46.260 --> 2:16:49.900]  don't even think about the fact that well, maybe we don't know this, maybe we're playing
[2:16:49.900 --> 2:16:50.900]  with fire.
[2:16:50.900 --> 2:16:59.940]  Well, look, if my wife posts a photo of me on my birthday and it gets 20,000 likes,
[2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:04.980]  other takes it down. I remember a couple years ago when I said, Biden's got cognitive problems,
[2:17:04.980 --> 2:17:08.460]  probably had another stroke, just speculation, most doctors agree with me at the time, bunch
[2:17:08.460 --> 2:17:12.620]  of me that were questions said, he looks like he has that other stroke. We know he had major
[2:17:12.620 --> 2:17:17.420]  brain surgery, you know, 20 years ago almost died. And Facebook came out and said, Jones
[2:17:17.420 --> 2:17:23.460]  is in a special area of dangerous persons. And so you may not mention him unless it's
[2:17:23.460 --> 2:17:28.260]  negative. And then they went on to say, but it's okay to organize violence against him.
[2:17:28.260 --> 2:17:30.260]  Did you see that?
[2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:34.420]  Oh, yeah. And, you know, and this is this is classic Facebook behavior. They're just
[2:17:34.420 --> 2:17:36.900]  going to say, well, they won't give you a straight answer. They say, well, he's being
[2:17:36.900 --> 2:17:41.580]  harmful or he's doing this and we're doing this in your best interest. But isn't that
[2:17:41.580 --> 2:17:46.420]  what all, you know, people who are, you know, con artists, isn't that what they always say?
[2:17:46.420 --> 2:17:50.100]  We're doing this in your best interest. This is for you. When really, if you look behind
[2:17:50.100 --> 2:17:52.420]  the scenes, like, okay, then well, why can't I have the information? Why didn't you make
[2:17:52.420 --> 2:17:55.780]  this public? If this is my profile and my data and even have a feature where you can
[2:17:55.780 --> 2:18:01.700]  download the data they have on use allegedly, all the data, then why can't we see it? And
[2:18:01.700 --> 2:18:05.300]  they won't answer that question. And I think we all know why.
[2:18:05.300 --> 2:18:09.340]  Well, the left wants to take over Facebook to control it. And so Facebook wanted just
[2:18:09.340 --> 2:18:13.780]  gave them control show that Congress wouldn't wouldn't do it officially. And I think that's
[2:18:13.780 --> 2:18:18.140]  the even even more dangerous, perfect storm. What do you think should be done to Facebook?
[2:18:18.140 --> 2:18:21.620]  I mean, broken up into what six different parts or?
[2:18:21.620 --> 2:18:24.300]  This is what I think I don't think there should be government regulation because I think that
[2:18:24.300 --> 2:18:27.820]  has the same potential to get out of hand as Facebook's power that they have now. I think
[2:18:27.820 --> 2:18:32.300]  what should happen is we need to rise up as individuals to say, we are not going to use
[2:18:32.300 --> 2:18:35.980]  Facebook. This is it. This is how it's going to be because you are their product. And so
[2:18:35.980 --> 2:18:39.780]  if you get up and walk out and say, I'm not using it anymore, because you unless you guys
[2:18:39.780 --> 2:18:43.620]  tell me exactly what's going on with my content that I post on your platform, I'm not I'm not
[2:18:43.620 --> 2:18:46.820]  doing anymore. I don't think government regulation is going to help. I don't think trying to get
[2:18:46.820 --> 2:18:49.980]  other companies involved is going to help that much ultimately because there's too much
[2:18:49.980 --> 2:18:53.980]  of a vested interest. It's too powerful of a tool. But people like us as individuals
[2:18:53.980 --> 2:18:58.860]  on an individual level, we can't control that like a corporate board can. And so we can
[2:18:58.860 --> 2:19:00.860]  say I'm not using it.
[2:19:00.860 --> 2:19:05.940]  Well, sir, all I can say is I'm impressed with what you've done. You are a hero in the
[2:19:05.940 --> 2:19:10.660]  beginning. When a patriot is a scarce man, he's hated, feared, and scorned. But in time
[2:19:10.660 --> 2:19:14.540]  when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[2:19:14.540 --> 2:19:18.820]  Well, you're doing this way before the avalanche happens against tyranny. But we're looking
[2:19:18.820 --> 2:19:22.260]  to that avalanche. We're looking for that chain reaction. We're looking for that huge
[2:19:22.260 --> 2:19:27.020]  wake up calling your right. It's going to happen with the people in 1984. It's going
[2:19:27.020 --> 2:19:31.060]  to happen with the pros. It's going to happen when the common person has a revolution of
[2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:35.580]  the mind and realizes that they've been made the product that they're being dehumanized
[2:19:35.580 --> 2:19:40.540]  through that process and take control of their identity and themselves again and realize
[2:19:40.540 --> 2:19:43.980]  you wouldn't let your wife or husband know all this about you that Facebook knows. You
[2:19:43.980 --> 2:19:47.780]  wouldn't let your wife or husband or your boss know any of the stuff that Google knows
[2:19:47.780 --> 2:19:53.940]  about you or your smart TV or your iPhone. Why did we let ourselves ever get in this
[2:19:53.940 --> 2:19:56.140]  position?
[2:19:56.140 --> 2:20:00.860]  I think that if you look at the old movie, The Network, there's a speech in that movie
[2:20:00.860 --> 2:20:04.900]  by the main anchor and he says, you know, as long as you just leave me alone with my
[2:20:04.900 --> 2:20:09.060]  steel-built radio and my TV and my toaster and I won't say anything and I'll be quiet
[2:20:09.060 --> 2:20:11.460]  and I won't do anything. And I think, you know, that's a position that a lot of people
[2:20:11.460 --> 2:20:14.860]  take and I don't blame them for that. There's a lot of risk to coming out here. But at the
[2:20:14.860 --> 2:20:19.100]  same time, it's, you know, weigh the risk and weigh the benefit. Would you rather live
[2:20:19.100 --> 2:20:23.900]  your life as essentially a slave in all ways but the most obvious? Or would you rather
[2:20:23.900 --> 2:20:26.940]  stand up for what's right and be able to say, I don't care how my life was, even if I was
[2:20:26.940 --> 2:20:31.820]  destitute until the day I died, I did the right thing and I can be, I can be comfortable
[2:20:31.820 --> 2:20:32.820]  knowing I did the right thing.
[2:20:32.820 --> 2:20:36.820]  And that attitude builds a beautiful civilization. The one of groveling builds a total tyranny.
[2:20:36.820 --> 2:20:42.060]  Oregon Common, thank you. Very impressed. Go send go.com for its last exposed Facebook.
[2:20:42.060 --> 2:20:49.060]  We should support in there. Thank you so much. At least salute you, my friend. Thank you.

[2:21:55.540 --> 2:21:59.900]  good news. Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed
[2:21:59.900 --> 2:22:04.340]  and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci
[2:22:04.340 --> 2:22:08.060]  are in. I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president
[2:22:08.060 --> 2:22:12.060]  Biden and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try to make people wear masks. I could
[2:22:12.060 --> 2:22:17.340]  tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news
[2:22:17.340 --> 2:22:21.380]  concerning the info war? That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now the

[2:22:46.020 --> 2:22:53.060]  products and George Soros hates it. One of the most popular memes on the Internet the
[2:22:53.060 --> 2:22:59.380]  last decade has been Alex Jones was right, but it now routinely trends number one on
[2:22:59.380 --> 2:23:04.620]  platforms like Twitter and Facebook making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:08.540]  But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today and thanks to your support. We're still
[2:23:08.540 --> 2:23:13.020]  on air at infowars.com and Bandai video radio stations and TV stations across the country
[2:23:13.020 --> 2:23:17.500]  and our film in game censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years
[2:23:17.500 --> 2:23:22.940]  ago is now available again. We have reprinted it on high quality DVD in HD. It has a zero
[2:23:22.940 --> 2:23:27.140]  country code. Anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it and I'm asking you to

[2:23:30.900 --> 2:23:34.460]  it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever
[2:23:34.460 --> 2:23:39.140]  you do, warn the world. This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years
[2:23:39.140 --> 2:23:45.260]  ago to expose them. It's more important than ever available at infowars.com. That's infowars.com.
[2:23:45.260 --> 2:23:52.260]  Game Gang, Blueprint for Globalist Lighting.
[2:24:15.260 --> 2:24:27.260]  Game Gang, Blueprint for Globalist Lighting.
[2:24:45.260 --> 2:24:51.100]  So understand this, the attack on America is bigger than Donald Trump, it's bigger than
[2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:56.140]  all of you individually, it's the true story of America and the idea of liberty against
[2:24:56.140 --> 2:24:58.180]  all the different charities in the world.
[2:24:58.180 --> 2:25:03.780]  So never forget, no matter how bad it gets, this is the beginning of the end of the new
[2:25:03.780 --> 2:25:04.780]  world order.
[2:25:04.780 --> 2:25:13.740]  Your soul's already with God forever, you've got free will and you made that decision,
[2:25:13.740 --> 2:25:19.820]  so fear not the world and the anti-Christ because you are with Christ.
[2:25:19.820 --> 2:25:25.940]  Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the globalist are the parasites that are enslaving China
[2:25:25.940 --> 2:25:31.900]  and enslaving Europe and enslaving Africa and enslaving all the rest of the world and
[2:25:31.900 --> 2:25:38.740]  as soon as we start calling out the COVID-19 hoax lockdown and as soon as we start exposing
[2:25:38.740 --> 2:25:47.100]  the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[2:25:47.100 --> 2:25:52.900]  The great reset is a psychological warfare program to scare you into submission.
[2:25:52.900 --> 2:25:56.740]  The masks are the symbol of the permanent lockdown and the slavery.
[2:25:56.740 --> 2:26:02.340]  Tens of millions have already starved to death in the third world during the great lockdown.
[2:26:02.340 --> 2:26:10.300]  The U.S. is being collapsed, it is a public plan called the great reset, the great reset,
[2:26:10.300 --> 2:26:12.180]  the great reset.
[2:26:12.180 --> 2:26:17.180]  You are in grave danger, you are in grave danger.
[2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:22.340]  Phase two of the great reset is a bio weapon release.
[2:26:22.340 --> 2:26:30.420]  COVID-19 was only a drill, COVID-19 was only a drill for the real attack Bill Gates says
[2:26:30.420 --> 2:26:39.380]  is coming because Bill Gates and the U.N. and Klaus Schwab are behind the great reset.
[2:26:39.380 --> 2:26:45.740]  You are in grave danger, the next attack will be a real bio weapon attack.
[2:26:45.740 --> 2:26:49.260]  Prepare your family, you are in grave danger.
[2:26:49.260 --> 2:26:54.860]  You are under globalist attack, you are under globalist depopulation.
[2:26:54.860 --> 2:26:58.460]  The great reset is preparing you for a real bio weapon attack.
[2:26:58.460 --> 2:27:02.620]  COVID-19 was only the trust to test drill.
[2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:08.660]  I told you this a year ago, now they admit it's only a test drill.
[2:27:08.660 --> 2:27:13.260]  They're going to tell you next your dogs and cats have a deadly virus and you've got to
[2:27:13.260 --> 2:27:18.060]  euthanize them and you will euthanize your dogs and cats in mass.
[2:27:18.060 --> 2:27:22.500]  That's one of the plans Gates has to say your dogs and cats will have the next virus and
[2:27:22.500 --> 2:27:27.940]  you will kill them as a sacrament, as a leftist, just as you kill your children.
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:32.940]  Remember, you will kill your dogs and cats when you are ordered to when Bill Gates says
[2:27:32.940 --> 2:27:34.460]  they have a virus in them.
[2:27:34.460 --> 2:27:38.940]  Gates will launch that attack with my approximation within 24 months.
[2:27:38.940 --> 2:27:42.940]  Giant bio weapons attacks are coming.
[2:27:42.940 --> 2:27:46.540]  Giant bio weapon attacks are coming.
[2:27:46.540 --> 2:27:50.020]  COVID-19 was only the test drill.
[2:27:50.020 --> 2:27:56.900]  You are in grave danger, you are in grave danger, you are in grave danger,
[2:27:56.900 --> 2:27:59.140]  you are in grave danger.
[2:27:59.140 --> 2:28:07.020]  The Great Reset is a plan to put you under martial law before they release the real bio weapons.
[2:28:07.020 --> 2:28:13.020]  Please look in to the Great Reset for yourself before it's too late.
[2:28:13.020 --> 2:28:16.620]  The terrorist is Bill Gates and his controllers.
[2:28:16.620 --> 2:28:23.820]  We have lived in the bosom of freedom for so long that Americans have no idea how much
[2:28:23.820 --> 2:28:25.900]  danger they are in.
[2:28:25.900 --> 2:28:30.940]  The Great Reset is a plan to bankrupt you, lock you down, release a real bio weapon
[2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:32.420]  on you and kill you.
[2:28:32.420 --> 2:28:39.220]  Once you've taken the vaccine, it's a binary weapon that programs yourself with a repressor
[2:28:39.220 --> 2:28:45.300]  protein that once that comes in contact with the next virus, you will die very quickly.
[2:28:45.300 --> 2:28:49.660]  They are implanting you and murder you with phase two.
[2:28:49.660 --> 2:28:52.820]  The mRNA vaccine is a binary weapon.
[2:28:52.820 --> 2:28:57.180]  All record top scientists have said it, I've met with top scientists, millionaires on this.
[2:28:57.180 --> 2:29:02.340]  They said it will kill you when they release the next virus because the cells will be programmed
[2:29:02.340 --> 2:29:04.340]  with their protein inside.
[2:29:04.340 --> 2:29:10.700]  The Great Reset is upon us, you are in grave danger.
[2:29:10.700 --> 2:29:19.260]  The Great Reset is upon us, research the Great Reset, research the Great Reset.
[2:29:19.260 --> 2:29:33.540]  All right folks, that is video from last April and May, different demonstrations that we
[2:29:33.540 --> 2:29:34.540]  engaged in.
[2:29:34.540 --> 2:29:35.540]  It goes on and on.
[2:29:35.540 --> 2:29:40.300]  We posted it at band.video, just to show people that are new viewers and listeners, but we
[2:29:40.300 --> 2:29:41.900]  were out exposing a long time ago.
[2:29:41.900 --> 2:29:44.060]  Now you hear a rest voucher, a rest case.
[2:29:44.060 --> 2:29:47.580]  So great job the listeners being supporters of this broadcast, which is the tip of the
[2:29:47.580 --> 2:29:51.860]  spear so we can get this information out.
[2:29:51.860 --> 2:29:58.180]  Now we shoot live reports here on air and we cut them up, that's what the segments are,
[2:29:58.180 --> 2:30:02.820]  there's live reports on air with callers and guests and myself.
[2:30:02.820 --> 2:30:05.100]  And then we post in the band.video.
[2:30:05.100 --> 2:30:13.140]  So I get an idea of what people think is most important.
[2:30:13.140 --> 2:30:16.340]  The name of the report you just saw is you are in grave danger, Alex Jones warned of
[2:30:16.340 --> 2:30:21.420]  the Great Reset calling last year and they just posted it about an hour ago, it's already
[2:30:21.420 --> 2:30:25.660]  got 10,000 views, very important to get that out.
[2:30:25.660 --> 2:30:32.860]  But what I'm getting at now is something just as important and that's energy and when
[2:30:32.860 --> 2:30:35.660]  we shoot reports on this, no one really cares.
[2:30:35.660 --> 2:30:41.500]  I mean, it will get 30,000 views instead of 2 million views and it's all part of the
[2:30:41.500 --> 2:30:47.940]  same globalist plan, it's all part of the same operation.
[2:30:47.940 --> 2:30:48.940]  And what am I talking about?
[2:30:48.940 --> 2:30:54.500]  Well, Biden announced two days ago with an executive order that I think is unconstitutional
[2:30:54.500 --> 2:31:02.300]  clearly, that no lithium batteries or solar panels or any of the things being made in
[2:31:02.300 --> 2:31:10.500]  the U.S. under his stimulus package, because he's tying the money to that, can be from
[2:31:10.500 --> 2:31:19.300]  mined rare earth minerals that are needed in their construction from the United States.
[2:31:19.300 --> 2:31:24.540]  Because under the globalist agreement, China is supposed to have control of rare earth
[2:31:24.540 --> 2:31:29.180]  minerals, it's an unofficial treaty, but you heard the last guest bring up the movie
[2:31:29.180 --> 2:31:32.540]  network and the movie network, they tell you how it works when Howard Beale, the new
[2:31:32.540 --> 2:31:38.700]  caster, the fictitious newscaster, goes in to talk to the big banker head that owns
[2:31:38.700 --> 2:31:47.420]  the TV network, he tells them, Mr. Beale, you don't just think that we're going to
[2:31:47.420 --> 2:31:53.820]  let these companies continue to be America and we're not, this is globalism, we let
[2:31:53.820 --> 2:31:57.300]  certain countries control certain things and others control other things, that's how we
[2:31:57.300 --> 2:32:02.180]  control the world corporately so no country ever gets too powerful.
[2:32:02.180 --> 2:32:12.700]  And of course that then gives the corporations all the power.
[2:32:12.700 --> 2:32:17.860]  Let me think of what the search on network to actually find that clip.
[2:32:17.860 --> 2:32:22.540]  That would be Howard Beale, there it is, you found the clip, and we should play that next
[2:32:22.540 --> 2:32:26.860]  segment if we have time to download it and get it.
[2:32:26.860 --> 2:32:33.180]  But here's what I'm getting at, I've actually been given quite a few of these speeches,
[2:32:33.180 --> 2:32:43.060]  they're remarkably the same as the movie, just in modern context, and I'm not bragging
[2:32:43.060 --> 2:32:48.380]  when I tell you that story, you know a lot of other people have gotten a similar speech,
[2:32:48.380 --> 2:32:51.660]  and a lot of them have actually bought into it, but then later found out that what they
[2:32:51.660 --> 2:32:57.220]  were being told wasn't actually the case, but let me just get back to where I was.
[2:32:57.220 --> 2:33:07.820]  When we talk about energy, and we talk about how if you control that you control everything,
[2:33:07.820 --> 2:33:13.300]  but Biden came out and said we cannot do any mining in America to speak of for rare earth
[2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:17.620]  minerals, and with regulations and controls they've basically banned gold mining, silver
[2:33:17.620 --> 2:33:22.260]  mining, and other things that happened there previously, there is no lead mining or lead
[2:33:22.260 --> 2:33:28.620]  smelting in the United States period, well guess what he's done now, he'll tell you
[2:33:28.620 --> 2:33:35.580]  about it on the other side of this quick break, but when you talk about the industrialization,
[2:33:35.580 --> 2:33:40.460]  this is it, there's a nice cartoon for TV viewers, we'll come back and cover the cartoon
[2:33:40.460 --> 2:33:48.100]  and more on the other side, find out who Biden just wave sanctions on.
[2:33:48.100 --> 2:33:52.460]  I don't really need to sell you on how beet concentrate is really good for your heart,
[2:33:52.460 --> 2:33:56.860]  good for your liver, good for your lungs, good for your cardiovascular system and your brain,
[2:33:56.860 --> 2:34:01.460]  it's well known and so beet supplements are amongst the best sellers out there, so I went
[2:34:01.460 --> 2:34:06.740]  out to a top lab and I said what is the strongest beet concentrate, you can do a copy of the
[2:34:06.740 --> 2:34:10.660]  popular formula you have, they explained that their formula had a certain percentage and
[2:34:10.660 --> 2:34:15.260]  I said just like with body's ultimate turmeric formula, for the average competitors at 5%
[2:34:15.260 --> 2:34:20.460]  or humanoid, I said no one else does 95, that's the highest level, I said give me 95% or humanoid,
[2:34:20.460 --> 2:34:26.100]  didn't even cost much more, and we have 95% or humanoid, well it's the same thing here,
[2:34:26.100 --> 2:34:30.620]  this is a very strong beet extract and it's very good for your body, good for your heart

[2:38:12.420 --> 2:38:18.780]  here on the info war pro-human anti-globalist network and then weekday afternoons 3 to 6
[2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:19.780]  p.m.
[2:38:19.780 --> 2:38:25.300]  Owen Troyer the war room over at weekday mornings 8 a.m. with Harrison Smith and I'll be back
[2:38:25.300 --> 2:38:30.900]  this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central for the Sunday edition, we have other live Saturday transmissions
[2:38:30.900 --> 2:38:35.900]  as well, find all the details at infowars.com forward slash show.
[2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:42.260]  Okay, look at this headline on MSM.com, Biden says he lifted sanctions on the Nord Scream
[2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:45.460]  2 because it's almost completely finished.
[2:38:45.460 --> 2:38:53.020]  That's not a joke and that is a Russian to Germany pipeline.
[2:38:53.020 --> 2:39:00.220]  Merkel is very upset that they're putting a U.S. sanction on a pipeline to Germany.
[2:39:00.220 --> 2:39:03.500]  So what is it to shut down the Keystone pipeline?
[2:39:03.500 --> 2:39:04.500]  It's a blockade.
[2:39:04.500 --> 2:39:05.500]  It's not just a sanction.
[2:39:05.500 --> 2:39:08.100]  It's an act of war.
[2:39:08.100 --> 2:39:17.140]  So you see, that's really what the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline was all about.
[2:39:17.140 --> 2:39:20.220]  Was a blockade was a sanction.
[2:39:20.220 --> 2:39:26.140]  Gen. 21 and Gen. 2030 is sanctions on select countries and peoples.
[2:39:26.140 --> 2:39:31.420]  Biden says he's lifted sanctions on Nord Stream 2 because it's almost completely finished.
[2:39:31.420 --> 2:39:35.820]  President Biden said that he lifted sanctions on the Russian to Germany pipeline Nord Stream
[2:39:35.820 --> 2:39:38.300]  2 because it's almost completely finished.
[2:39:38.300 --> 2:39:43.100]  They didn't use the excuse that, oh, fossil fuels, because it carries both natural gas
[2:39:43.100 --> 2:39:48.580]  and oil and gasoline, natural gas, you can carry it all.
[2:39:48.580 --> 2:39:55.940]  Just like the Keystone pipeline could, just like other pipelines like Colonial can, no.
[2:39:55.940 --> 2:39:59.260]  They say because Russia is evil and meddled in our election with no evidence.
[2:39:59.260 --> 2:40:02.940]  That was their excuse to try to get that shut down, but oh, it's been tens of billions
[2:40:02.940 --> 2:40:04.620]  of dollars to build it.
[2:40:04.620 --> 2:40:09.300]  It's just being completed so it gets to stay open because he doesn't want to commit an
[2:40:09.300 --> 2:40:15.780]  act of war on Russia and Germany, but he can beat up Americans politically all he wants.
[2:40:15.780 --> 2:40:22.540]  Biden says he lifted sanctions on Nord Stream 2 because it's almost completely finished.
[2:40:22.540 --> 2:40:29.500]  It's not like I can allow Germany to do something or not, Biden continued, because I've been
[2:40:29.500 --> 2:40:31.460]  opposed to Nord Stream at the beginning.
[2:40:31.460 --> 2:40:35.180]  Actually, the Ukrainian company, he and his son were involved in it or heavily involved
[2:40:35.180 --> 2:40:36.180]  in it.
[2:40:36.180 --> 2:40:39.700]  So at the end of the day, he is on the Russian payroll, but whatever.
[2:40:39.700 --> 2:40:42.140]  I say don't close the Russian pipeline.
[2:40:42.140 --> 2:40:43.340]  Bring more energy to more people.
[2:40:43.340 --> 2:40:45.940]  That brings down prices, but it shows how it all works.
[2:40:45.940 --> 2:40:51.860]  So here's the cartoon, shows two Roughnecks working on a drilling rig for oil, Biden
[2:40:51.860 --> 2:40:55.260]  waived sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[2:40:55.260 --> 2:41:00.300]  So then shutting down an American pipeline and letting the Russians pipeline open, that
[2:41:00.300 --> 2:41:04.380]  doesn't tell you how it all works, nothing will.
[2:41:04.380 --> 2:41:07.380]  So that's how the cow ate the cabbage.
[2:41:07.380 --> 2:41:14.820]  Let's play a clip from the 1970s film network where Howard Beale has shut down the acquisition
[2:41:14.820 --> 2:41:19.540]  of their news company by the Saudis and the big corporate chairman of the multinational
[2:41:19.540 --> 2:41:49.340]  news and glomerate explains to him about the new world order.
[2:41:49.340 --> 2:42:06.700]  Well, Howard, Mr. Beale, please sit down.
[2:42:06.700 --> 2:42:35.660]  You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, you have meddled with the primal
[2:42:35.660 --> 2:42:42.140]  forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I won't have it, is that clear?
[2:42:42.140 --> 2:42:45.900]  Do you think you merely stopped a business deal?
[2:42:45.900 --> 2:42:47.780]  That is not the case.
[2:42:47.780 --> 2:42:52.820]  The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country and now they must put it back.
[2:42:52.820 --> 2:42:59.500]  It is airbed flow, titled gravity, it is ecological balance.
[2:42:59.500 --> 2:43:06.780]  You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples, there are nations, there
[2:43:06.780 --> 2:43:11.460]  are no peoples, there are no Russians, there are no Arabs, there are no third worlds, there
[2:43:11.460 --> 2:43:21.740]  is no West, there is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and the main, interwoven,
[2:43:21.740 --> 2:43:30.100]  interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars, petrodollars, electrodollars, multidollars,
[2:43:30.100 --> 2:43:37.220]  Reichmarks, Rims, Rubles, Pounds and Shekels.
[2:43:37.220 --> 2:43:43.540]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this
[2:43:43.540 --> 2:43:46.220]  planet.
[2:43:46.220 --> 2:43:52.060]  That is the natural order of things today.
[2:43:52.060 --> 2:44:04.220]  That is the atomic and sub-atomic and galactic structure of things today.
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:17.300]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature and you will atone.
[2:44:17.300 --> 2:44:23.100]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Biel?
[2:44:23.100 --> 2:44:33.940]  You get up on your little 21-inch screen and howl about America and democracy.
[2:44:33.940 --> 2:44:35.940]  There is no America.
[2:44:35.940 --> 2:44:38.460]  There is no democracy.
[2:44:38.460 --> 2:44:49.980]  There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon.
[2:44:49.980 --> 2:44:54.020]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[2:44:54.020 --> 2:44:58.100]  What do you think the Russians talk about in their Council of the State, Karl Marx?
[2:44:58.100 --> 2:45:03.060]  They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions
[2:45:03.060 --> 2:45:07.020]  and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like
[2:45:07.020 --> 2:45:08.020]  we do.
[2:45:08.020 --> 2:45:12.980]  We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Biel.
[2:45:12.980 --> 2:45:26.980]  The world is a college of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business.
[2:45:26.980 --> 2:45:30.060]  The world is a business, Mr. Biel.
[2:45:30.060 --> 2:45:34.460]  All right, it goes on from there, you can watch the full thing, but just to call it
[2:45:34.460 --> 2:45:40.900]  the network CEO speech and it should pop up.
[2:45:40.900 --> 2:45:44.460]  Maybe you guys tell me what they call it on the line, I'm not going to play the whole
[2:45:44.460 --> 2:45:47.580]  thing here, but that's exactly what these guys do.
[2:45:47.580 --> 2:45:52.780]  When I've had the heads of major Fortune 500 companies repeatedly call you up the top of
[2:45:52.780 --> 2:45:56.380]  something that looks pretty similar to that, like I was in one boardroom that had the green
[2:45:56.380 --> 2:45:59.900]  lights and the English-style brown wood.
[2:45:59.900 --> 2:46:04.460]  Most of it's more modern these days and they give you those little speeches and they say,
[2:46:04.460 --> 2:46:08.300]  do you want to be on this crusade that's going nowhere, Mr. Jones, or do you want to be a
[2:46:08.300 --> 2:46:15.620]  leader who can actually add their two cents to this big group of corporate super leaders?
[2:46:15.620 --> 2:46:18.300]  The super class, Alex, you can be a leader of the super class.
[2:46:18.300 --> 2:46:21.300]  You can help lead your people towards a better world.
[2:46:21.300 --> 2:46:23.260]  Here's the problem, they're not doing that.
[2:46:23.260 --> 2:46:27.540]  See, they have the big corporations take over not to build this big utopia, whom by our
[2:46:27.540 --> 2:46:32.300]  corporate system, no, they did it to then have robots and computers take over and make
[2:46:32.300 --> 2:46:36.100]  humans obsolete and face out the humans.
[2:46:36.100 --> 2:46:39.700]  So the globalists that already hate themselves, they believe, can climb out of this body into
[2:46:39.700 --> 2:46:43.940]  some type of silicon system because they've given up on life.
[2:46:43.940 --> 2:46:47.380]  They screw people over to get where they are and they've decided there's nothing worth
[2:46:47.380 --> 2:46:49.540]  anything on this planet, not even their grandchildren.
[2:46:49.540 --> 2:46:51.220]  In fact, most of them don't have children.
[2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:53.100]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[2:46:53.100 --> 2:46:56.300]  I'm going to get a bunch of other news and then we've got a great guest that's taken
[2:46:56.300 --> 2:47:01.500]  over in the fourth hour, but I'll just say this.
[2:47:01.500 --> 2:47:05.140]  The megabanks have all the money, thousands of times what there's real assets, and they're
[2:47:05.140 --> 2:47:09.180]  using that now to make you eat bugs, to make you not live healthy, to make you not have
[2:47:09.180 --> 2:47:10.180]  a good life.
[2:47:10.180 --> 2:47:12.220]  They're going to force the economies onto electric cars.
[2:47:12.220 --> 2:47:16.660]  They're going to force everything onto what they want because it's controllable.
[2:47:16.660 --> 2:47:18.780]  They're making everything ugly and obsolete.
[2:47:18.780 --> 2:47:20.340]  Well, guess what?
[2:47:20.340 --> 2:47:21.340]  I'm sticking around.
[2:47:21.340 --> 2:47:22.340]  I'm not obsolete.
[2:47:22.340 --> 2:47:26.620]  Many of the New World Order and their corporate fascist model is what's obsolete, and all
[2:47:26.620 --> 2:47:31.180]  the little leftist follower idiots that are lining up to be killed are making themselves
[2:47:31.180 --> 2:47:32.180]  obsolete.
[2:47:32.180 --> 2:47:33.180]  I'm sticking around.
[2:47:33.180 --> 2:47:34.180]  I'm not going anywhere.
[2:47:34.180 --> 2:47:35.180]  I think you're the same way.
[2:47:35.180 --> 2:47:38.180]  If you believe like I do, you believe in God, you believe these corporate guys aren't
[2:47:38.180 --> 2:47:44.580]  God, then fill your hand today in the fight and spread the word about infowars.com, newswars.com,

[2:50:42.020 --> 2:51:02.140]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:02.140 --> 2:51:25.260]  I didn't fail today, we covered a ton of news, but I'm going to have to shoot a special
[2:51:25.260 --> 2:51:29.460]  report for tonight, or I'm going to come in tomorrow, in fact, just for the crew that
[2:51:29.460 --> 2:51:33.740]  wants to come in this weekend, I'm sure you all want to all still be here this Sunday,
[2:51:33.740 --> 2:51:38.700]  4 to 6 PM, I went 6 to 8, there's so much news, they're both volunteered to come in,
[2:51:38.700 --> 2:51:42.820]  but I'm either going to come in and tape a show tomorrow, or I'm going to do a live
[2:51:42.820 --> 2:51:47.860]  one, I've got to think about that today, it takes more crew to a live one, because there
[2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:51.620]  is just so much news, I didn't get to, and I know more news is going to break after that,
[2:51:51.620 --> 2:51:59.300]  and it is all completely insane, I know he's got that Dr. Ruby on, who's so smart, our
[2:51:59.300 --> 2:52:08.580]  next guest host does, so stay for that as well, but I did my best to get to it all, and then
[2:52:08.580 --> 2:52:13.620]  there's a lot of other news that we just glazed over, grazed over, I guess would be a better
[2:52:13.620 --> 2:52:18.060]  word, but at a certain point my eyes just glazed over, but look at this, study finds
[2:52:18.060 --> 2:52:24.700]  face masks, hidden slow spread of COVID-19, another big university study, University
[2:52:24.700 --> 2:52:28.740]  of Louisville, and that's what all the other studies show, but it's a sign, like a burka
[2:52:28.740 --> 2:52:33.300]  over a woman's head, it's powerful to make people do that and say, you're dirty, you're
[2:52:33.300 --> 2:52:38.220]  bad, you can only take the mask off when you have a vaccine, which is even a vaccine,
[2:52:38.220 --> 2:52:43.780]  and now they're pushing everywhere, now they have time out boxes, they make people go in
[2:52:43.780 --> 2:52:52.660]  at Amazon, and it's all just a psychological test to see what they can do to us, because
[2:52:52.660 --> 2:52:59.940]  we don't stand up for ourselves, they have absolutely no respect for us.
[2:52:59.940 --> 2:53:04.980]  Now here's another report, this is by Steve Watson on infowars.com, more scientists demand
[2:53:04.980 --> 2:53:11.740]  lab leak investigation claim they were ostracized for presenting research backing the scenario,
[2:53:11.740 --> 2:53:17.380]  they claim it, hell they got censored everywhere, including Senate and House testimony and legislative
[2:53:17.380 --> 2:53:24.700]  testimony around the damn country, I had a Facebook whistleblower on, just last hour
[2:53:24.700 --> 2:53:33.980]  talking about it, so this is all here, it's not coming, it's insane, but let me show you
[2:53:33.980 --> 2:53:38.620]  something from man.video, David Ike, who's a smart guy and also riveting, I think he's
[2:53:38.620 --> 2:53:43.020]  gonna be able to come on next week, we're asking him to, he has his own channel on there
[2:53:43.020 --> 2:53:46.460]  that gets millions of views each week, and David Ike doesn't call up and ask me permission
[2:53:46.460 --> 2:53:52.660]  to do the shows he does, so people are asking me in the office and online, well hey, show
[2:53:52.660 --> 2:53:58.540]  the video please guys, what is David Ike doing having a video on Bandod videos saying Wuhan
[2:53:58.540 --> 2:54:03.300]  lab virus leak a calculated diversion from the simple truth, there is no virus, David
[2:54:03.300 --> 2:54:07.980]  Ike, because that certainly got him banned off YouTube and Facebook finally last year
[2:54:07.980 --> 2:54:14.780]  when he said that, hard to believe over here in a half, yeah it was last year, 2020, well
[2:54:14.780 --> 2:54:18.220]  I mean David Ike is allowed to have his own opinions and I respect him, and as much as
[2:54:18.220 --> 2:54:24.420]  we've been lied to, who knows, you know, the scientific method is you can always challenge
[2:54:24.420 --> 2:54:28.940]  things, and a lot of things we're told are fact, later turn out to not be, so I'm gonna
[2:54:28.940 --> 2:54:33.820]  get him on next week to discuss that, obviously if I rub up against poison ivy, that's a chemical
[2:54:33.820 --> 2:54:38.860]  in there that causes an autoimmune response in my body, and that's a mechanism the plant
[2:54:38.860 --> 2:54:43.020]  has so things don't rub up against it or try to eat it, so there's lots of invisible stuff
[2:54:43.020 --> 2:54:48.660]  that does things, and Ike's right that cells put off things that are RNA when they get
[2:54:48.660 --> 2:54:54.380]  toxified, and a lot of scientists cover that and know that, so it's a fact, but some say
[2:54:54.380 --> 2:54:57.740]  well basically everything is coming out of ourselves, well that's why they admit that
[2:54:57.740 --> 2:55:04.380]  if you take the COVID vaccine, it can make your cells release more deadly variants,
[2:55:04.380 --> 2:55:08.860]  and that's the discoverer of HIV, Nobel Prize winner saying that, so a lot of what he's
[2:55:08.860 --> 2:55:13.860]  saying is true, do I go all the way to say it doesn't exist at all, no, they made a virus,
[2:55:13.860 --> 2:55:18.380]  even though they can never isolate it at the clinics and places that are around, but they
[2:55:18.380 --> 2:55:23.900]  do create chimeroviruses, and they do release them to create fear and get power, but is
[2:55:23.900 --> 2:55:26.460]  it a fraud like the PCR test entirely?
[2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:31.260]  I don't know, but I'm open for a debate about that, and I shouldn't fear debate about that,
[2:55:31.260 --> 2:55:34.580]  and that's a good thing, we don't have like a monolithic thing here where every host and
[2:55:34.580 --> 2:55:41.340]  every guest, every person totally agrees with some lockstep thing, we're not CNN or MSNBC,
[2:55:41.340 --> 2:55:47.420]  we're not mainstream media, all right, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[2:55:47.420 --> 2:55:51.740]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast, and I've
[2:55:51.740 --> 2:55:56.220]  got some really, really, really, really, really good news, yes, I could spend an hour telling
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:56:00.460]  you about how the globals are getting exposed and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon
[2:56:00.460 --> 2:56:04.500]  and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in, I can even tell you about how the states
[2:56:04.500 --> 2:56:08.300]  are turning against the puppet president, Biden, and saying we're going to have $1,000
[2:56:08.300 --> 2:56:12.300]  fines to try to make people wear masks, I could tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't
[2:56:12.300 --> 2:56:16.900]  I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the M4 war?
[2:56:16.900 --> 2:56:20.940]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day Special
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:28.060]  for the next week only, with store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, and DNA Force
[2:56:28.060 --> 2:56:34.300]  Plus is back in stock, sold out for seven months, 40% off, supermobile mentality, 50%
[2:56:34.300 --> 2:56:41.460]  off, prostigard, 40% off, out of the power, 50%, ultra-12%, that's only 30%, free shipping,
[2:56:41.460 --> 2:56:45.420]  and pay three points, and it comes in four, and it's incredible products, and George Soros
[2:56:45.420 --> 2:57:04.060]  takes it, ha-ha!
[2:57:04.060 --> 2:57:10.700]  Dr. Jay, standing by because we have to get to some extremely important breaking discoveries
[2:57:10.700 --> 2:57:13.060]  surrounding the poisonous injections.
[2:57:13.060 --> 2:57:20.540]  There are some absolutely unbelievable things happening here today, but before we get to
[2:57:20.540 --> 2:57:26.460]  the doctor, the GOP has finally done something right, it would seem that some of these Republicans
[2:57:26.460 --> 2:57:31.340]  have grabbed ahold of their testicular fortitude.
[2:57:31.340 --> 2:57:38.140]  They've stopped Nancy Pelosi from going forward with her hit squad with the January 6th Commission.
[2:57:38.140 --> 2:57:43.780]  It appears the Senate vote was 54 to 33, just six votes short of the 60 that it would have
[2:57:43.780 --> 2:57:48.900]  taken to pass the House bill to create the 10-member panel that would be evenly split
[2:57:48.900 --> 2:57:53.140]  between Republicans and Democrats, and it's interesting to me that it's notable to mention
[2:57:53.140 --> 2:57:57.540]  there were two Senate Democrats that skipped the vote.
[2:57:57.540 --> 2:58:03.140]  So if this had been the end of the world event that Nancy Pelosi and these radicals want
[2:58:03.140 --> 2:58:07.980]  to tell you that it is, Schumer would have absolutely made sure that everyone was there,
[2:58:07.980 --> 2:58:11.100]  but he didn't, and that's very telling, and that's because we know the truth.
[2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:16.260]  The truth is that it was a grandma selfie party, and that Patriots responded to the
[2:58:16.260 --> 2:58:20.540]  call of the President to be peaceful and come and support him in the wake of what we knew
[2:58:20.540 --> 2:58:23.740]  was going to be a complete hijacking, because he told us it was going to be, and he was
[2:58:23.740 --> 2:58:24.740]  right, and he's right.
[2:58:24.740 --> 2:58:29.820]  They've been right about nine out of ten things that he said during his administration.
[2:58:29.820 --> 2:58:33.860]  We were all called these tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists for backing the President
[2:58:33.860 --> 2:58:38.180]  as, you know, I'm not a torch carrier for everything Donald J. Trump, specifically and
[2:58:38.180 --> 2:58:42.300]  most importantly, probably his most glaring mistake, which has been the people that he
[2:58:42.300 --> 2:58:47.980]  has had closely around him, and I think, you know, personnel decisions made in a different
[2:58:47.980 --> 2:58:52.180]  light could have definitely helped the President, and who knows, he could still be in office
[2:58:52.180 --> 2:58:57.180]  had he acted, you know, on the information that he was being provided.
[2:58:57.180 --> 2:59:00.580]  We know that there was certain information that has been kept from him and was kept
[2:59:00.580 --> 2:59:07.700]  from him five months after that election took place, which is heartbreaking and it's devastating.
[2:59:07.700 --> 2:59:13.220]  Also breaking over at stupeters.tv today leaked training materials for transgender acceptance
[2:59:13.220 --> 2:59:19.380]  as the Marxists continue to force the demasculinization of males in our country and attack the Christian
[2:59:19.380 --> 2:59:22.340]  and conservative culture here in the United States.
[2:59:22.340 --> 2:59:23.340]  So don't miss that report.
[2:59:23.340 --> 2:59:26.220]  Again, you can find that at stupeters.tv.
[2:59:26.220 --> 2:59:33.940]  Also breaking today, Senator Ted Cruz has introduced a no vaccine passport bill to stop
[2:59:33.940 --> 2:59:36.060]  federal government tyranny.
[2:59:36.060 --> 2:59:42.260]  The bill would ban vaccine passports and Cruz has the statement that he released here.
[2:59:42.260 --> 2:59:46.060]  I think there's a real potential for government overreach and I don't believe anyone should
[2:59:46.060 --> 2:59:48.140]  be forced to take the vaccine.
[2:59:48.140 --> 2:59:49.700]  It should be your personal choice.
[2:59:49.700 --> 2:59:52.460]  Well, yeah, we all agree with that.
[2:59:52.460 --> 2:59:55.500]  You should make the choice based on your health, based on the decisions you want, and I've
[2:59:55.500 --> 2:59:59.300]  also introduced this week legislation that would number one prohibit any federal vaccine
[2:59:59.300 --> 3:00:04.020]  passport prohibit the Biden administration from doing anything to mandate vaccines, but
[3:00:04.020 --> 3:00:08.020]  it also prohibits discrimination in employment.
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:11.620]  We're seeing some places where employees are saying that if you're not vaccinated, you're
[3:00:11.620 --> 3:00:14.740]  fired and that ought to be illegal.
[3:00:14.740 --> 3:00:18.540]  Your health decisions are yours to make and it shouldn't be your boss and it shouldn't
[3:00:18.540 --> 3:00:19.540]  be your government.
[3:00:19.540 --> 3:00:23.980]  It shouldn't be anyone else forcing you to make those decisions.
[3:00:23.980 --> 3:00:29.420]  So he did, in fact, go ahead with introducing that legislation.
[3:00:29.420 --> 3:00:33.300]  Interesting take earlier this afternoon from Tom Papert over at National File.
[3:00:33.300 --> 3:00:37.340]  If Ted Cruz is going to be so concerned about that and we wish him the best of luck, but
[3:00:37.340 --> 3:00:42.020]  what about right at home in Texas where Governor Abbott has said that he's introduced Texas
[3:00:42.020 --> 3:00:45.100]  law that bans this stuff from happening, but in fact, that isn't the case.
[3:00:45.100 --> 3:00:51.860]  When you look into it, you'll find that Abbott is putting on this front of being this real
[3:00:51.860 --> 3:00:56.060]  conservative guy stopping and opposing any of this forced inoculation, but in fact, it's
[3:00:56.060 --> 3:00:57.620]  all really squishy and really wonky.
[3:00:57.620 --> 3:01:01.940]  Okay, so we have a lot to get to here today with Dr. Jane Ruby as we're breaking never
[3:01:01.940 --> 3:01:06.420]  before released information surrounding the so-called shot in the arm, the jab being falsely
[3:01:06.420 --> 3:01:08.620]  referred to as a vaccine.
[3:01:08.620 --> 3:01:16.660]  It's responsible for mass infertility, miscarriages, aka spontaneous involuntary abortions, menopausal
[3:01:16.660 --> 3:01:23.020]  women have begun bleeding again, young women having abnormal cycles, reports of females
[3:01:23.020 --> 3:01:24.020]  bleeding.
[3:01:24.020 --> 3:01:28.140]  We've had males that have had other adverse side effects and different reactions.
[3:01:28.140 --> 3:01:33.980]  I spoke to somebody in Toronto today regarding personal finance stuff, golfing, by the way,
[3:01:33.980 --> 3:01:37.500]  they stopped that in Canada because as we know, golfing is really dangerous.
[3:01:37.500 --> 3:01:42.340]  When you're out there looking, for me at least, I'm looking for several sleeves of balls in
[3:01:42.340 --> 3:01:46.660]  the woods away from anybody else in the outdoors, very dangerous stuff.
[3:01:46.660 --> 3:01:53.700]  They tried to ban tennis in Canada as well, because that's really dangerous.
[3:01:53.700 --> 3:01:59.820]  But we talked about these injections being self-spreading or transmissible.
[3:01:59.820 --> 3:02:04.260]  It's been revealed here on the Alice Jones show and all over at InfoWars as well as over
[3:02:04.260 --> 3:02:05.260]  at stupeters.tv.
[3:02:05.260 --> 3:02:10.500]  For months, we've been talking about how years ago they telegraphed this and told you that
[3:02:10.500 --> 3:02:17.380]  they were designing these transmissible vaccinations, vaccines that would basically inoculate even
[3:02:17.380 --> 3:02:23.020]  the unwilling or anybody that had any kind of hesitancy to get vaccinated, so they wanted
[3:02:23.020 --> 3:02:26.340]  to develop these transmissible vaccines.
[3:02:26.340 --> 3:02:28.100]  We refer to that as shedding.
[3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:29.860]  You're more than likely familiar with that term.
[3:02:29.860 --> 3:02:32.380]  We've been talking about a here.
[3:02:32.380 --> 3:02:36.940]  And if you're here, you're part of the resistance as Alex obviously always accurately says.
[3:02:36.940 --> 3:02:41.300]  But the report that you won't want to miss is this one.
[3:02:41.300 --> 3:02:49.140]  And that is that this myocarditis, which is a way of saying basically an infection or
[3:02:49.140 --> 3:02:54.220]  an inflammation of the heart, has been taking place.
[3:02:54.220 --> 3:02:59.260]  And Dr. Jane Ruby is joining us now to talk about brand new findings surrounding these
[3:02:59.260 --> 3:03:04.460]  injections and the catastrophic damage that they're causing, of course, totally ignored
[3:03:04.460 --> 3:03:05.460]  by the media.
[3:03:05.460 --> 3:03:10.060]  Dr. Ruby, we've been talking about this myocarditis here.
[3:03:10.060 --> 3:03:15.700]  And there was an article that came out that said that myocarditis was that we were seeing
[3:03:15.700 --> 3:03:18.900]  some mild cases of this.
[3:03:18.900 --> 3:03:22.820]  Oh, I'm getting here that we don't have Jane Ruby on.
[3:03:22.820 --> 3:03:23.820]  All right.
[3:03:23.820 --> 3:03:24.820]  Well, we'll get the doctor on.
[3:03:24.820 --> 3:03:28.940]  I don't know if it was a technical difficulty there, but we'll get her on here in a minute.
[3:03:28.940 --> 3:03:35.500]  But they're talking about this myocarditis being, you know, that there's been mild cases
[3:03:35.500 --> 3:03:37.180]  of this.
[3:03:37.180 --> 3:03:43.180]  And I don't know anybody in their right mind that could say that swelling in on or around
[3:03:43.180 --> 3:03:46.660]  the heart could be mild.
[3:03:46.660 --> 3:03:49.620]  This is, you only get one heart.
[3:03:49.620 --> 3:03:51.980]  You don't just go get another one.
[3:03:51.980 --> 3:03:57.700]  And there's been a lot of reports in the VAERS system of specifically, apparently this is
[3:03:57.700 --> 3:03:58.900]  targeting males.
[3:03:58.900 --> 3:04:02.580]  And when the doctor does come on or when we get a hold of her here, we'll ask her about
[3:04:02.580 --> 3:04:03.580]  this.
[3:04:03.580 --> 3:04:09.020]  But it seems that now we've got both the females covered with infertility and spontaneous involuntary
[3:04:09.020 --> 3:04:13.740]  abortions being caused by these miscarriages.
[3:04:13.740 --> 3:04:15.540]  Elderly women are being affected by this.
[3:04:15.540 --> 3:04:18.060]  And the thing is, is that we knew about this.
[3:04:18.060 --> 3:04:22.820]  And it's all coming out now in the mainstream media as they want to talk about the findings
[3:04:22.820 --> 3:04:30.060]  that are surrounding this Wuhan lab, this Wuhan Virology Institute, where Fauci was
[3:04:30.060 --> 3:04:31.060]  a personal investor.
[3:04:31.060 --> 3:04:32.260]  And we talked about this.
[3:04:32.260 --> 3:04:36.460]  We told everybody, we told the world that Fauci and Barack Obama were personal investors
[3:04:36.460 --> 3:04:37.460]  in this lab.
[3:04:37.460 --> 3:04:41.260]  Now my financial advisor didn't tell me, he didn't give me any inside information saying,
[3:04:41.260 --> 3:04:42.660]  Stu, hold the phone.
[3:04:42.660 --> 3:04:47.500]  I've got really important, a great tip for you on this obscure laboratory in Wuhan that's
[3:04:47.500 --> 3:04:52.260]  going to be, you know, doing some really, really innovative stuff.
[3:04:52.260 --> 3:04:53.660]  And you should really invest in that.
[3:04:53.660 --> 3:04:57.980]  But Anthony Fauci, obviously, he had the upper hand in that.
[3:04:57.980 --> 3:05:02.820]  And now there's an article coming out that says Fauci demanded, or excuse me, defended
[3:05:02.820 --> 3:05:08.860]  controversial virus research, arguing that it was worth the risk of man-made outbreak
[3:05:08.860 --> 3:05:10.940]  way back in 2012.
[3:05:10.940 --> 3:05:16.860]  Now, Alex said before he left here today that he wants to help be responsible for putting
[3:05:16.860 --> 3:05:17.860]  these criminals in jail.
[3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:23.660]  I mean, listen, we're talking about the most catastrophic damage that we have seen here.
[3:05:23.660 --> 3:05:29.780]  We're talking about millions of people that have apparently succumbed to this COVID-19
[3:05:29.780 --> 3:05:30.940]  virus.
[3:05:30.940 --> 3:05:37.020]  We're talking about trillions of dollars in damage to a world economy, to the global
[3:05:37.020 --> 3:05:38.260]  economy shutting down.
[3:05:38.260 --> 3:05:43.220]  We're talking at midnight tonight, Australia is going to go back into the most restrictive
[3:05:43.220 --> 3:05:49.660]  lockdowns that that continent has seen since March of 2020.
[3:05:49.660 --> 3:05:54.860]  And that is because a new report is coming out of Australia that there are 26 new cases
[3:05:54.860 --> 3:06:03.620]  of COVID there, 26 new cases of COVID on an entire continent is now spurring these lockdowns.
[3:06:03.620 --> 3:06:04.980]  This isn't about health and safety.
[3:06:04.980 --> 3:06:08.660]  I mean, obviously we know that.
[3:06:08.660 --> 3:06:13.700]  And I think you'll have a much clearer understanding of where we are today when you realize that
[3:06:13.700 --> 3:06:21.140]  the vaccine was not brought here because of COVID, but rather that COVID was brought here
[3:06:21.140 --> 3:06:24.540]  for the vaccine.
[3:06:24.540 --> 3:06:26.980]  They want to inject you with this stuff.
[3:06:26.980 --> 3:06:29.540]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[3:06:29.540 --> 3:06:34.140]  Vaccine passports, I hope Ted Cruz is successful, but we know that this stuff is going to be
[3:06:34.140 --> 3:06:39.340]  vehemently opposed by all of these elitists and globalists that have infiltrated our government
[3:06:39.340 --> 3:06:43.020]  and we'll be back to talk about the dangers of this with Dr. Ruby right after the break
[3:06:43.020 --> 3:06:44.020]  of October.
[3:06:44.020 --> 3:06:45.020]  My name is Peter Sticks.
[3:06:45.020 --> 3:06:46.020]  Thanks a lot for sticking with us today.
[3:06:46.020 --> 3:06:51.260]  The BioProse are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat
[3:06:51.260 --> 3:06:53.300]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[3:06:53.300 --> 3:06:58.260]  For the first time, the BioProse are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[3:06:58.260 --> 3:07:00.100]  products to the everyday consumer.
[3:07:00.100 --> 3:07:04.580]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically
[3:07:04.580 --> 3:07:07.620]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[3:07:07.620 --> 3:07:11.940]  BioSepticPro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[3:07:11.940 --> 3:07:13.860]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[3:07:13.860 --> 3:07:16.500]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[3:07:16.500 --> 3:07:21.420]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[3:07:21.420 --> 3:07:25.100]  BioSepticPro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[3:07:25.100 --> 3:07:29.380]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to
[3:07:29.380 --> 3:07:34.380]  treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than
[3:07:34.380 --> 3:07:35.380]  its competitors.
[3:07:35.380 --> 3:07:39.540]  BioSepticPro is safer plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.

[3:07:45.660 --> 3:07:50.660]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where M4s is.
[3:07:50.660 --> 3:07:54.420]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you
[3:07:54.420 --> 3:07:57.340]  are the patrons that make all this possible.
[3:07:57.340 --> 3:08:03.300]  So in short, the world's awakening to spiral the censorship, M4s has never been more influential
[3:08:03.300 --> 3:08:07.580]  and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[3:08:07.580 --> 3:08:13.140]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because
[3:08:13.140 --> 3:08:17.140]  most of the best-selling products which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others,
[3:08:17.140 --> 3:08:19.060]  have been sold out for up to seven months.
[3:08:19.060 --> 3:08:20.060]  Well, guess what?
[3:08:20.060 --> 3:08:23.700]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, in percent of months.
[3:08:23.700 --> 3:08:24.740]  It's 40 percent off.
[3:08:24.740 --> 3:08:25.740]  It's amazing.
[3:08:25.740 --> 3:08:29.940]  M4WareStore.com, and for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide
[3:08:29.940 --> 3:08:35.220]  free shipping and double-patria points and alpha powers back in stock, and supermilitalities
[3:08:35.220 --> 3:08:39.660]  back in stock, and pollen block and vasobeats that are all back in stock as much as 50 percent
[3:08:39.660 --> 3:08:40.660]  off.
[3:08:40.660 --> 3:08:43.660]  Store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, M4WareStore.com.
[3:08:43.660 --> 3:09:05.500]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, M4Warriors.
[3:09:05.500 --> 3:09:06.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show of preworldnews.tv.
[3:09:06.500 --> 3:09:07.500]  My name is Stu Peter Pepp.
[3:09:07.500 --> 3:09:08.500]  Happy to be here again on this Friday afternoon.
[3:09:08.500 --> 3:09:09.500]  Quite the honor to be here.
[3:09:09.500 --> 3:09:16.700]  I'm happy that Alex continues to put up with me and invite me back.
[3:09:16.700 --> 3:09:19.380]  We're talking about the vaccine, and we're going to get to the doctor here in a second.
[3:09:19.380 --> 3:09:23.500]  I don't know, if anybody saw this, a couple of positive things in the news, because I
[3:09:23.500 --> 3:09:27.300]  think it's important that we also get to that a little bit.
[3:09:27.300 --> 3:09:34.860]  Breaking in New York, a couple of fans, if you saw this at Yankee Stadium, unveiled a
[3:09:34.860 --> 3:09:35.860]  banner.
[3:09:35.860 --> 3:09:42.540]  I'm looking at a picture, a massive banner that read, Trump won, save America.
[3:09:42.540 --> 3:09:45.100]  I love it.
[3:09:45.100 --> 3:09:50.060]  Where I come from over at StuPeters.tv, you'll also see we interviewed Maria Zach just the
[3:09:50.060 --> 3:09:51.060]  other day.
[3:09:51.060 --> 3:09:54.660]  I had her on the program, and there was breaking news over there as well, that the same people
[3:09:54.660 --> 3:10:02.060]  responsible for the Italian job, the theft of the election over there in Italy, and the
[3:10:02.060 --> 3:10:07.700]  satellite that was owned by these people at Leonardo, they are the very same people
[3:10:07.700 --> 3:10:14.140]  who were implicated in the setup of George Papadopoulos, Russiagate spying on the Trump
[3:10:14.140 --> 3:10:15.140]  campaign.
[3:10:15.140 --> 3:10:18.420]  So, really big news over there at StuPeters.tv, we'll hope you check us out.
[3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:20.700]  I see Dr. Ruby is here to join us now.
[3:10:20.700 --> 3:10:23.220]  Dr. Ruby, thank you very much for being here.
[3:10:23.220 --> 3:10:28.980]  You're one of the only trusted sources that I can go to on this vaccine stuff, this inoculation,
[3:10:28.980 --> 3:10:32.220]  this push for these jabs has just become unprecedented.
[3:10:32.220 --> 3:10:36.420]  We're seeing that in Canada, kids are being lured in with milk and cookies and treats
[3:10:36.420 --> 3:10:40.740]  and candy and ice cream in exchange for being inoculated.
[3:10:40.740 --> 3:10:46.700]  And in some cases, or in all cases, apparently, it doesn't require any parental consent.
[3:10:46.700 --> 3:10:48.780]  They can go there and get these jabs.
[3:10:48.780 --> 3:10:53.540]  Then there was video of parents in Ontario, which I think you have seen, that were really
[3:10:53.540 --> 3:10:58.420]  upset about this, rightfully so, and they're trying to get into these vaccination sites
[3:10:58.420 --> 3:11:03.220]  or these clinics where these kids are being jabbed, but there's a line of cops standing
[3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:06.140]  there, preventing these people from coming through.
[3:11:06.140 --> 3:11:10.700]  And we're going to get to some breaking stuff here, but myocarditis.
[3:11:10.700 --> 3:11:15.660]  The article says that there are some mild cases of myocarditis that are being found
[3:11:15.660 --> 3:11:23.340]  specifically in men, young men, that's causing the swelling in this infection or this inflammation
[3:11:23.340 --> 3:11:24.340]  of the heart.
[3:11:24.340 --> 3:11:30.780]  So, how mild are these cases, what exactly should we be prepared for, or people who have
[3:11:30.780 --> 3:11:34.940]  succumbed to the pressure and been vaccinated, what might they be experiencing as far as
[3:11:34.940 --> 3:11:37.780]  side effects and how serious is this in all actuality?
[3:11:37.780 --> 3:11:40.660]  Well, Sue, thanks for having me back.
[3:11:40.660 --> 3:11:42.460]  Thanks to you and Alex Jones for having me back.
[3:11:42.460 --> 3:11:44.220]  It's my honor as well.
[3:11:44.220 --> 3:11:49.420]  But sadly, I have a lot of really difficult information to bring to your listeners and
[3:11:49.420 --> 3:11:51.100]  your viewers.
[3:11:51.100 --> 3:11:55.380]  Let's start with the myocarditis issue.
[3:11:55.380 --> 3:11:58.260]  As you mentioned, it is incredibly serious.
[3:11:58.260 --> 3:12:05.700]  I'm really getting tired of these authorities, so to speak, calling this mild and rare.
[3:12:05.700 --> 3:12:12.020]  Would you like your heart to be inflamed, swollen, the muscle damaged, and then because
[3:12:12.020 --> 3:12:18.020]  you can recover from it in an emergency room, call it mild and rare, it's just ridiculous.
[3:12:18.020 --> 3:12:20.820]  But let me get into some of the background here.
[3:12:20.820 --> 3:12:27.780]  Israel made a deal with Pfizer back a few months ago, and so exclusively that particular
[3:12:27.780 --> 3:12:33.820]  injection was used in Israel, and Israel went whole hog and tried to inoculate their entire
[3:12:33.820 --> 3:12:34.820]  population.
[3:12:34.820 --> 3:12:40.140]  Well, they got through about two-thirds before things slowed down, and they had an early
[3:12:40.140 --> 3:12:46.540]  signal on this myocarditis around the middle of April, and they started talking about it,
[3:12:46.540 --> 3:12:49.340]  but they dribbled the numbers out little by little.
[3:12:49.340 --> 3:12:53.460]  I wanted to share some information with you because now, just like what's happening here
[3:12:53.460 --> 3:13:00.220]  in the U.S., the numbers are swelling, they're rising so high and so fast that they're not
[3:13:00.220 --> 3:13:02.380]  going to be able to hide this stuff anymore.
[3:13:02.380 --> 3:13:07.260]  And for example, Israel is still churning out more and more numbers, and what they decided
[3:13:07.260 --> 3:13:13.460]  to do instead of halting this program in children, they want to proceed with jabbing children,
[3:13:13.460 --> 3:13:18.380]  but they're now suggesting that they just give them one of the two Pfizer doses.
[3:13:18.380 --> 3:13:23.340]  Let me remind everyone, this has never been studied with one injection.
[3:13:23.340 --> 3:13:28.420]  They're just changing the goalpost, they're moving around what they want to do based on
[3:13:28.420 --> 3:13:32.180]  no science, based on no responsible part of the studies.
[3:13:32.180 --> 3:13:36.180]  So I just wanted to share, and getting back to those that are most vulnerable, I think
[3:13:36.180 --> 3:13:40.460]  anybody is vulnerable, but I'm going to tell you the numbers that nobody else has been
[3:13:40.460 --> 3:13:41.460]  reporting.
[3:13:41.460 --> 3:13:47.300]  I want to share with you in this first segment with me because it's exciting in a bad way,
[3:13:47.300 --> 3:13:49.980]  but the truth is coming out, and that's what's exciting.
[3:13:49.980 --> 3:13:56.980]  The last time I reported to you, there were overall about 152 cases of myocarditis.
[3:13:56.980 --> 3:14:03.340]  I just got, and kudos to Albert Benvenitas who was on the show when I hosted the show
[3:14:03.340 --> 3:14:06.980]  for Alex recently, he just got some last minute numbers.
[3:14:06.980 --> 3:14:12.380]  He's the gentleman who downloads all the raw data from VAERS and then keeps these spreadsheets
[3:14:12.380 --> 3:14:16.980]  and tracks what they're doing, and he has discovered that they are indeed throttling
[3:14:16.980 --> 3:14:17.980]  numbers.
[3:14:17.980 --> 3:14:22.620]  However, they can't keep up with these myocarditis numbers as they start to push this program
[3:14:22.620 --> 3:14:25.500]  through on children, and here are the hot numbers.
[3:14:25.500 --> 3:14:31.820]  Just as a point of reference, the last time we met, there were 152 cases in the U.S. reported
[3:14:31.820 --> 3:14:38.700]  on VAERS of myocarditis after injection of these so-called experimentals, and in the
[3:14:38.700 --> 3:14:44.740]  12 to 17 year group, there were three reports of myocarditis.
[3:14:44.740 --> 3:14:48.900]  In this last drop that just came out this morning, and I've been pressuring this poor
[3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:56.700]  guy all day to get this information, we now have 31 reported cases under 17 years of VA,
[3:14:56.700 --> 3:15:05.860]  in other words, under 18, anything, 17 plus, and so we've seen a 219 percent increase in
[3:15:05.860 --> 3:15:10.700]  myocarditis in under 18 years old, so that's 12 to 17.
[3:15:10.700 --> 3:15:19.140]  Stu, I predict that in the next few weeks, as these irresponsible, these incredibly just
[3:15:19.140 --> 3:15:25.460]  evil authorities are setting up clinics in grammar schools, elementary schools, middle
[3:15:25.460 --> 3:15:31.420]  schools, high schools, we just saw that Fairfax County, Virginia, of all places, is setting
[3:15:31.420 --> 3:15:37.500]  up clinics in all of the schools, whether parents like it or not, to inoculate 12 to
[3:15:37.500 --> 3:15:44.180]  17 year olds, because on May 10th, the FDA gave authorization or expanded the emergency
[3:15:44.180 --> 3:15:47.580]  use to Pfizer for 12 to 17 year olds.
[3:15:47.580 --> 3:15:51.660]  This is really, really frightening, and we're going to see these numbers explode.
[3:15:51.660 --> 3:15:57.740]  So, when you say that the numbers are being throttled, what exactly do you mean by that?
[3:15:57.740 --> 3:16:01.020]  I mean, they're being deleted, they're being changed, they're being altered, they're being
[3:16:01.020 --> 3:16:05.460]  hidden, they're being covered up, are you making that connection, that allegation?
[3:16:05.460 --> 3:16:06.460]  Yes.
[3:16:06.460 --> 3:16:12.300]  And I'm making that based on the sources of people like Albert who are keeping these
[3:16:12.300 --> 3:16:13.300]  spreadsheets.
[3:16:13.300 --> 3:16:20.260]  Now, we are seeing, like I said, we are seeing an increase reported of myocarditis in children,
[3:16:20.260 --> 3:16:24.580]  but overall, all, remember there are other side effects too.
[3:16:24.580 --> 3:16:30.940]  There are blood clots and miscarriages and neurological issues and muscle aches and pains
[3:16:30.940 --> 3:16:38.180]  and debilitating, permanent debilitation, those numbers have not been updated in many,
[3:16:38.180 --> 3:16:39.180]  many weeks.
[3:16:39.180 --> 3:16:43.380]  In fact, they keep putting the same exact numbers out from January.
[3:16:43.380 --> 3:16:51.700]  So, based on that, what we think we're seeing is that they're hiding side effects and they're
[3:16:51.700 --> 3:16:55.220]  blocking, you know, the actual reports.
[3:16:55.220 --> 3:16:59.180]  They're claiming that they have to validate them and they have to go vet them.
[3:16:59.180 --> 3:17:01.220]  That's not the purpose of the VAERS system.
[3:17:01.220 --> 3:17:04.060]  The VAERS system is a self-reporting.
[3:17:04.060 --> 3:17:10.500]  And by the way, on these myocarditis numbers, when we looked at specifically who's reporting
[3:17:10.500 --> 3:17:13.540]  them, the majority are physicians.
[3:17:13.540 --> 3:17:15.020]  And so it's not just...
[3:17:15.020 --> 3:17:19.500]  Yeah, and they'll go back to, oh, well, it's just VAERS and anybody can report that which
[3:17:19.500 --> 3:17:20.500]  isn't the case.
[3:17:20.500 --> 3:17:25.940]  VAERS themselves, they hid the ability to search on their platform after we brought specific
[3:17:25.940 --> 3:17:31.620]  examples on my program of kids that were dying, teenagers that were dying after being inoculated.
[3:17:31.620 --> 3:17:32.940]  They want to cover this thing up.
[3:17:32.940 --> 3:17:36.300]  And what's even more sick is that they knew this.
[3:17:36.300 --> 3:17:40.140]  They knew this back in December that it was going to cause these problems and the proof
[3:17:40.140 --> 3:17:41.140]  is in the pudding.
[3:17:41.140 --> 3:17:44.940]  We're going to show you how next on the Alan Stone Show, don't go anywhere.
[3:17:44.940 --> 3:17:49.740]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:17:49.740 --> 3:17:52.460]  for beta testing to operational.
[3:17:52.460 --> 3:17:57.220]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[3:17:57.220 --> 3:17:58.220]  takeover.
[3:17:58.220 --> 3:18:01.340]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been
[3:18:01.340 --> 3:18:06.260]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:18:06.260 --> 3:18:07.380]  Humanity is strong.
[3:18:07.380 --> 3:18:08.380]  We're incredible.
[3:18:08.380 --> 3:18:12.060]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:18:12.060 --> 3:18:14.540]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:18:14.540 --> 3:18:18.780]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[3:18:18.780 --> 3:18:20.460]  others is absolutely essential.
[3:18:20.460 --> 3:18:24.980]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[3:18:24.980 --> 3:18:28.660]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[3:18:28.660 --> 3:18:30.460]  also fun to air operation.
[3:18:30.460 --> 3:18:31.460]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:18:31.460 --> 3:18:32.460]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[3:18:32.460 --> 3:18:38.580]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because supply chain breakdowns are back

[3:18:43.260 --> 3:18:48.260]  you for being part of the resistance.
[3:18:48.260 --> 3:18:51.260]  We are champions made of.
[3:18:51.260 --> 3:19:20.260]  Here's a man who can show you.
[3:19:20.260 --> 3:19:30.260]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[3:19:30.260 --> 3:19:46.260]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.

[3:19:53.620 --> 3:19:55.980]  We've got double Patriot points.
[3:19:55.980 --> 3:19:59.860]  We've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold out for seven months.
[3:19:59.860 --> 3:20:05.540]  We've got 50% off on Ultra 12, 50% off on Vasobites, 50% off on Alpha Power.
[3:20:05.540 --> 3:20:06.540]  These are all incredible products.
[3:20:06.540 --> 3:20:10.260]  I can talk about each one for several minutes, but a lot of you have already used them, so
[3:20:10.260 --> 3:20:11.260]  you have it.
[3:20:11.260 --> 3:20:12.260]  You've got to go check these out.
[3:20:12.260 --> 3:20:17.060]  These are all top-of-the-line formulas, some of them clones of best-sellers, others original
[3:20:17.060 --> 3:20:22.060]  formulations that we came up with, with top developers to blow people away, and it's all
[3:20:22.060 --> 3:20:23.060]  there.
[3:20:23.060 --> 3:20:27.300]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales
[3:20:27.300 --> 3:20:32.380]  and specials to mention them all here today, but whatever you do, go to InfoWarsStore.com
[3:20:32.380 --> 3:20:36.780]  with a store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points, and sold out for seven months.
[3:20:36.780 --> 3:20:42.460]  DNA Force Plus, with the PQQ and the CoQ10 that's been sold out, is now back in stock,
[3:20:42.460 --> 3:20:46.100]  40% off, InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:20:46.100 --> 3:20:49.220]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold
[3:20:49.220 --> 3:20:53.220]  out for three months, four months, six months, seven months, it's not a gimmick to make
[3:20:53.220 --> 3:20:54.220]  you buy the products.
[3:20:54.220 --> 3:20:58.420]  I'm really genuinely freaked out, because listeners were buying enough of our great
[3:20:58.420 --> 3:21:02.380]  supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation, because they're great
[3:21:02.380 --> 3:21:05.580]  products that we're coming back and getting more, and thank you for the support.
[3:21:05.580 --> 3:21:10.580]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus, or whether it's PollenBlock, or whether it's SuperMoviality
[3:21:10.580 --> 3:21:16.180]  or VasoBeats, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower
[3:21:16.180 --> 3:21:19.460]  the quality of our products, and so we just can't offer them.
[3:21:19.460 --> 3:21:24.100]  But thank God, it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now, because
[3:21:24.100 --> 3:21:27.540]  suddenly a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[3:21:27.540 --> 3:21:30.180]  And one of them is PollenBlock.
[3:21:30.180 --> 3:21:34.020]  Takes a long time to get into PollenBlock, but it's procedural discomfort, stuff like
[3:21:34.020 --> 3:21:35.020]  allergies.
[3:21:35.020 --> 3:21:36.020]  It's from France.
[3:21:36.020 --> 3:21:38.540]  It's a special proprietary system.
[3:21:38.540 --> 3:21:42.260]  This is the highest quality, back in stock, in FullWareStore.com.
[3:21:42.260 --> 3:21:49.260]  Store-wide free shipping, and double-patriot points, check it out.
[3:21:49.260 --> 3:22:06.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:22:06.860 --> 3:22:13.780]  I mean, if you've seen these reports about the IRS hiring an unprecedented amount of
[3:22:13.780 --> 3:22:18.260]  agents, field agents, investigators, this isn't by accident.
[3:22:18.260 --> 3:22:22.980]  I mean, this all has to do with the federal government coming after every single last
[3:22:22.980 --> 3:22:26.060]  bit of remaining individual liberty or freedom that you have.
[3:22:26.060 --> 3:22:28.340]  The First Amendment completely been attacked already.
[3:22:28.340 --> 3:22:35.340]  The second is next, look at this ATF guy that they're talking about, putting in charge of
[3:22:35.340 --> 3:22:40.700]  alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, but can't properly identify what an AR-15 is.
[3:22:40.700 --> 3:22:46.380]  He doesn't want to get into how an assault weapon is identified by the federal government.
[3:22:46.380 --> 3:22:50.860]  Of course he doesn't, because then an assault weapons ban akin to what happened back in
[3:22:50.860 --> 3:22:56.180]  the Clinton days, you couldn't do it, because you'd have to identify those things, essentially
[3:22:56.180 --> 3:23:02.300]  saying that the only thing that will be allowed for people to carry anymore is the.22 caliber.
[3:23:02.300 --> 3:23:07.580]  Well, does the guy not realize, I mean, this is the new potential head of the ATF.
[3:23:07.580 --> 3:23:11.780]  Does this guy not realize that the.22 round is probably the most deadly?
[3:23:11.780 --> 3:23:13.780]  Anything with a detachable magazine will be outlawed.
[3:23:13.780 --> 3:23:20.340]  That means your.308 hunting rifle, your.306, your.7MM, your.300 Winchester mag, anything
[3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:24.900]  that you take out west, if you're not from there and you go out west to hunt mule deer
[3:23:24.900 --> 3:23:28.740]  or elk, they'll be taken away from you.
[3:23:28.740 --> 3:23:32.180]  The federal government is absolutely 100% weaponized against you.
[3:23:32.180 --> 3:23:38.140]  Law enforcement agencies that have been politicized, the FBI, Jim Comey, where is he at?
[3:23:38.140 --> 3:23:42.740]  Where has he been since he tried to throw President Trump under the bus with all of these
[3:23:42.740 --> 3:23:43.740]  lies?
[3:23:43.740 --> 3:23:44.740]  He's completely disappeared.
[3:23:44.740 --> 3:23:47.940]  George Papadopoulos says that he believes John Durham knows exactly where they are.
[3:23:47.940 --> 3:23:48.940]  They're not underground.
[3:23:48.940 --> 3:23:49.940]  They haven't disappeared.
[3:23:49.940 --> 3:23:51.260]  I guess we will see.
[3:23:51.260 --> 3:23:55.580]  The federal government in every single place that you turn has been totally weaponized
[3:23:55.580 --> 3:23:56.580]  against you.
[3:23:56.580 --> 3:23:58.900]  The CDC, we know that, but what about the FDA?
[3:23:58.900 --> 3:24:05.820]  We were holding on to this going, well, maybe they're not going to approve this vaccine.
[3:24:05.820 --> 3:24:08.060]  Maybe they're not going to approve it.
[3:24:08.060 --> 3:24:14.900]  The CDC then and FDA continue to extend this emergency use authorization and allow this
[3:24:14.900 --> 3:24:19.060]  thing to be conducted, this experiment that we don't believe to be an experiment.
[3:24:19.060 --> 3:24:20.060]  This is totally on purpose.
[3:24:20.060 --> 3:24:27.460]  This is by design, but now they're opening it up to your kids as young as 12 years old.
[3:24:27.460 --> 3:24:28.460]  Unbelievable.
[3:24:28.460 --> 3:24:34.980]  Dr. Jane Ruby joining us here with, I guess what I would consider to be the biggest bombshell
[3:24:34.980 --> 3:24:41.420]  that I've heard, and it's really depressing to hear this, Dr. Ruby, that the CDC and the
[3:24:41.420 --> 3:24:49.820]  FDA knew about this in December of last year that these heart problems would affect young
[3:24:49.820 --> 3:24:50.820]  people.
[3:24:50.820 --> 3:24:54.460]  They know it now, but they knew it then.
[3:24:54.460 --> 3:24:58.340]  Sue, they knew it then.
[3:24:58.340 --> 3:24:59.860]  They went forward.
[3:24:59.860 --> 3:25:05.940]  They're getting serious side effects in young people, in everyone, all age groups, and they're
[3:25:05.940 --> 3:25:09.660]  going forward even more full steam.
[3:25:09.660 --> 3:25:16.300]  On December 21, there was a publication that clearly linked the spike proteins that these
[3:25:16.300 --> 3:25:23.700]  injections force your body to make with cardiac damage, with cardiac illness, inflammation,
[3:25:23.700 --> 3:25:31.060]  and the myocarditis, but also the blood clots, and also the other, the strokes.
[3:25:31.060 --> 3:25:32.900]  It's absolutely insane.
[3:25:32.900 --> 3:25:35.540]  They're just running with impunity.
[3:25:35.540 --> 3:25:42.180]  As long as we're talking about impunity, let's talk about America's doctors, because I wanted
[3:25:42.180 --> 3:25:45.180]  to share the perspective.
[3:25:45.180 --> 3:25:51.580]  People have to remember our doctors in the United States are derelict in their duty.
[3:25:51.580 --> 3:25:53.940]  They're failing their hypocriticals.
[3:25:53.940 --> 3:25:56.540]  Why do I come out on a limb and say this?
[3:25:56.540 --> 3:25:58.620]  Because let's start at the beginning.
[3:25:58.620 --> 3:26:05.020]  Because last spring, when this virus came out, and everyone was touting HCQ as a cure,
[3:26:05.020 --> 3:26:13.580]  and it is a relative cure if used early enough, the whole thing was shuttered, right?
[3:26:13.580 --> 3:26:17.060]  Because they were on their way to the emergency use authorization.
[3:26:17.060 --> 3:26:22.980]  I myself, as I've told the audience before, came down with the natural flu, COVID-19,
[3:26:22.980 --> 3:26:25.340]  last March of 2020.
[3:26:25.340 --> 3:26:27.940]  I pleaded with my GP to get it.
[3:26:27.940 --> 3:26:29.220]  He said, we don't give it.
[3:26:29.220 --> 3:26:30.780]  We're not giving it.
[3:26:30.780 --> 3:26:31.780]  We're not allowed to give it.
[3:26:31.780 --> 3:26:32.780]  We're not using it.
[3:26:32.780 --> 3:26:36.580]  And when I dug a little deeper, because I went to the hospital to make sure I wasn't
[3:26:36.580 --> 3:26:41.260]  in a pulmonary crisis, I begged for it there, and I was refused to get it.
[3:26:41.260 --> 3:26:47.020]  In fact, we have a clip or two, if you want to run it, where I explained what I discovered,
[3:26:47.020 --> 3:26:53.820]  because this was being perpetrated, the blocking of access to life-saving treatments was being
[3:26:53.820 --> 3:26:59.180]  conducted by Democrat governors through their departments of health.
[3:26:59.180 --> 3:27:03.100]  If you have that clip, let me know if you can run it.
[3:27:03.100 --> 3:27:05.540]  Otherwise, I'll explain what happened.
[3:27:05.540 --> 3:27:06.540]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:27:06.540 --> 3:27:11.500]  Tell us, talk to us about your medical background on off-label prescriptions and why you think
[3:27:11.500 --> 3:27:13.220]  this is happening in the state of Virginia.
[3:27:13.220 --> 3:27:18.860]  Yes, first of all, people need to understand that governors control the treatment you get
[3:27:18.860 --> 3:27:21.660]  in your state through the Department of Health.
[3:27:21.660 --> 3:27:24.460]  That's why you see those notices in the Department of Health.
[3:27:24.460 --> 3:27:29.380]  I want people also to understand that it is not illegal on any level for a physician or
[3:27:29.380 --> 3:27:34.820]  nurse practitioner to prescribe off-label, which is defined as, for a reason other than
[3:27:34.820 --> 3:27:37.060]  which a drug was originally approved.
[3:27:37.060 --> 3:27:41.340]  If there's some data, any data, any information, doesn't have to be published or anything,
[3:27:41.340 --> 3:27:45.580]  but the drug has some effect, they have the right to do that.
[3:27:45.580 --> 3:27:49.260]  Pharmaceutical companies, in contrast, cannot market it off-label.
[3:27:49.260 --> 3:27:51.260]  That's illegal.
[3:27:51.260 --> 3:27:55.780]  With that understanding, what they're doing here is they're saying you can only prescribe
[3:27:55.780 --> 3:28:00.980]  it for malaria or lupus, the things that it was originally approved for, when in fact
[3:28:00.980 --> 3:28:05.820]  what they're doing, they're using it ostensibly to really block the average person's ability.
[3:28:05.820 --> 3:28:07.820]  It's not just Virginia.
[3:28:07.820 --> 3:28:08.820]  Right.
[3:28:08.820 --> 3:28:10.820]  I mean, it's not just anywhere.
[3:28:10.820 --> 3:28:11.820]  It's not just anywhere.
[3:28:11.820 --> 3:28:18.060]  They're blocking it all over the place because you can treat this thing relatively inexpensive.
[3:28:18.060 --> 3:28:19.060]  Right.
[3:28:19.060 --> 3:28:24.900]  And, you know, Florida, I had friends in Florida whose doctors said, sure, what's the name
[3:28:24.900 --> 3:28:25.900]  of your pharmacy?
[3:28:25.900 --> 3:28:26.900]  Your COVID test is positive.
[3:28:26.900 --> 3:28:29.060]  You know, I'll phone it in.
[3:28:29.060 --> 3:28:33.620]  And it dawned on me, it's dangerous to live in a Democrat-run state.
[3:28:33.620 --> 3:28:37.820]  And I'm going to, you know, the other dereliction of duty in America's doctors, and in a year
[3:28:37.820 --> 3:28:41.340]  or two, Stu, I predict they're going to hang their heads in total shame.
[3:28:41.340 --> 3:28:42.340]  And they deserve it.
[3:28:42.340 --> 3:28:48.980]  Those are the same doctors, those same cowards and dereliction of duty who are now pushing
[3:28:48.980 --> 3:28:51.700]  the vaccine on their own patients.
[3:28:51.700 --> 3:28:53.140]  And I have a personal story.
[3:28:53.140 --> 3:28:57.420]  My new GP down here a couple of weeks ago said, you really ought to get the vaccine.
[3:28:57.420 --> 3:28:59.180]  And I said, why would I do that?
[3:28:59.180 --> 3:29:04.100]  And I proceeded to lay out a lot of the facts that I've shared with you on the show here.
[3:29:04.100 --> 3:29:08.380]  And she backed up and said, oh, my, I guess I need to go back and do some reading.
[3:29:08.380 --> 3:29:12.460]  These America's physicians are very irresponsible.
[3:29:12.460 --> 3:29:15.220]  They're either ignorant or they're really stupid.
[3:29:15.220 --> 3:29:20.180]  And they better get on the ball because they're pushing their patients into getting these
[3:29:20.180 --> 3:29:22.140]  very dangerous injections.
[3:29:22.140 --> 3:29:27.540]  And they're going to be managing those patients, their myocarditis, their long-term cardiopulmonary
[3:29:27.540 --> 3:29:29.380]  autoimmune diseases.
[3:29:29.380 --> 3:29:30.980]  It's going to be a disaster, Stu.
[3:29:30.980 --> 3:29:34.860]  And they're going to be partly held responsible as they should.
[3:29:34.860 --> 3:29:36.500]  That is the whole idea here.
[3:29:36.500 --> 3:29:38.820]  That is the design here.
[3:29:38.820 --> 3:29:43.380]  If we have a cure for something, if we have a cure for cancer, by the way, we all know
[3:29:43.380 --> 3:29:47.100]  that cures for a whole lot of things have been available for a really long time.
[3:29:47.100 --> 3:29:49.700]  Ask Magic Johnson about a cure.
[3:29:49.700 --> 3:29:52.260]  If you have the money, you can find a cure.
[3:29:52.260 --> 3:29:58.460]  And treating things long-term is the only thing that contributes to compliance, it contributes
[3:29:58.460 --> 3:30:02.940]  to control, and it contributes to the bottom line of these for-profit businesses because
[3:30:02.940 --> 3:30:04.220]  that's what these providers are.
[3:30:04.220 --> 3:30:08.260]  And a lot of these administrators that run these hospitals, that run these clinics, have
[3:30:08.260 --> 3:30:11.700]  a bottom line that they have to meet or their job is in jeopardy because if they don't care
[3:30:11.700 --> 3:30:15.500]  about the business aspect of the job, they're going to lose their job.
[3:30:15.500 --> 3:30:16.780]  Their whole career will be gone.
[3:30:16.780 --> 3:30:21.980]  So for example, treating a COVID patient, putting a COVID patient on a ventilator.
[3:30:21.980 --> 3:30:26.700]  A whole lot of reasons why Andrew Cuomo in New York didn't use the resources that President
[3:30:26.700 --> 3:30:32.060]  Donald Trump sent to him because these hospitals, these clinics, the bureaucratic pressure and
[3:30:32.060 --> 3:30:37.900]  all of the special interests, there's trillions of dollars at stake to hospitalize these people
[3:30:37.900 --> 3:30:42.460]  and to put them on the ventilators because they're getting paid 30, 40, 50,000 depending
[3:30:42.460 --> 3:30:47.780]  on what state you're in dollars per patient that they diagnose, hold, and treat for COVID-19.
[3:30:47.780 --> 3:30:48.780]  It's all a money game.
[3:30:48.780 --> 3:30:49.780]  We know that.
[3:30:49.780 --> 3:30:52.060]  The globalists are after nothing but money and control.
[3:30:52.060 --> 3:30:55.220]  We're a big farm here, we're farming humans.
[3:30:55.220 --> 3:30:57.580]  I mean, that is the realization that we have to come to.
[3:30:57.580 --> 3:31:02.060]  I've got about 30 seconds left in this segment, but I want you to wrap up on this dereliction.
[3:31:02.060 --> 3:31:09.140]  I just wanted to say over 500,000 Americans died and the majority of them needlessly,
[3:31:09.140 --> 3:31:13.980]  90% of them, they sent people to their deaths on these ventilators when they had something
[3:31:13.980 --> 3:31:17.380]  that would cure it in a matter of hours.
[3:31:17.380 --> 3:31:20.780]  It's just, Stu, it's unfathomable.
[3:31:20.780 --> 3:31:24.740]  And like I said, America's doctors are going to have a lot to answer for these doctors.
[3:31:24.740 --> 3:31:28.900]  They knew there was no safety study in pregnant women or little children, and yet they're
[3:31:28.900 --> 3:31:32.340]  still pushing those populations to get these jabs.
[3:31:32.340 --> 3:31:33.340]  Yeah.
[3:31:33.340 --> 3:31:36.860]  Well, amongst the doctors, I think there's going to be many others that are committing
[3:31:36.860 --> 3:31:38.380]  suicide like the parents.
[3:31:38.380 --> 3:31:43.300]  I'm predicting a huge breakout of suicides as we continue with Dr. Ruby Nexdonk anywhere.
[3:31:43.300 --> 3:31:44.940]  My name is Stu Peters for Alex Jones.
[3:31:44.940 --> 3:31:49.300]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful
[3:31:49.300 --> 3:31:50.300]  products ever made.

[3:32:44.860 --> 3:32:48.980]  You know, I'm cutting an ad right now, and I've been here on the Saturday cutting days
[3:32:48.980 --> 3:32:54.660]  under a terrible job, because I just cut like five ads, and I didn't tell people the most
[3:32:54.660 --> 3:32:56.180]  important part.
[3:32:56.180 --> 3:33:01.220]  No, it's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months, and it's back
[3:33:01.220 --> 3:33:05.780]  in stock, and it's 40% off, or how the supply chain broke down, and how it almost bankrupted
[3:33:05.780 --> 3:33:10.380]  us, but thank God it finally came in, or how it cleansed up your mitochondria and makes
[3:33:10.380 --> 3:33:13.220]  your telomeres last longer and can regrow nerves.
[3:33:13.220 --> 3:33:15.060]  We've got to go research DNA Force Plus.
[3:33:15.060 --> 3:33:16.060]  No, it's not that.
[3:33:16.060 --> 3:33:20.900]  The reason I just cut all those ads and forgot the most important point, the super low vitality
[3:33:20.900 --> 3:33:25.620]  is back in stock, 50% off, that Prostingar is back 40% off, that Alpha Power is back
[3:33:25.620 --> 3:33:31.140]  50% off, that Ultra 12, Mountain B12, take another tongue, it's incredible, is back also
[3:33:31.140 --> 3:33:34.140]  50% off, or Vaso Beats back 50% off.
[3:33:34.140 --> 3:33:35.140]  No.
[3:33:35.140 --> 3:33:39.540]  Instead, we've got double-patriot points and free-shipping store-wide, double-patriot
[3:33:39.540 --> 3:33:41.940]  points, free-shipping store-wide on top of these huge sales.
[3:33:41.940 --> 3:33:50.580]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast, and I've
[3:33:50.580 --> 3:33:53.300]  got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[3:33:53.300 --> 3:33:57.340]  Yes, I can spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed and how
[3:33:57.340 --> 3:34:01.580]  they launched COVID-19 as a bio-weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are
[3:34:01.580 --> 3:34:02.580]  in.
[3:34:02.580 --> 3:34:05.460]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden
[3:34:05.460 --> 3:34:08.700]  and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try to make people wear masks.
[3:34:08.700 --> 3:34:13.500]  I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super
[3:34:13.500 --> 3:34:15.700]  good news concerning the M4?
[3:34:15.700 --> 3:34:19.780]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day Special
[3:34:19.780 --> 3:34:27.620]  for the next week only with store-wide free-shipping, double-patriot points, and DNA Force Plus

[3:35:03.820 --> 3:35:10.140]  that quail that eat a certain diet produce eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people
[3:35:10.140 --> 3:35:14.980]  eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what folks call allergies.
[3:35:14.980 --> 3:35:18.620]  It's back in stock, it's been sold out for a long time, it's very hard to get, despite

[3:35:43.940 --> 3:35:49.260]  it basically has, this stuff really, really works.
[3:35:49.260 --> 3:36:05.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:36:05.580 --> 3:36:09.900]  Course it's all about your kids, we've been saying that forever, we've been saying that
[3:36:09.900 --> 3:36:14.460]  for the longest time, they're coming after your kids, you know we're called tinfoil
[3:36:14.460 --> 3:36:20.700]  hat-wares again when you talk about Adreno Chrome, we know the truth about that, we know
[3:36:20.700 --> 3:36:28.140]  why certain people aren't aging, we know why others appear to be in a post-Trump world.
[3:36:28.140 --> 3:36:32.620]  Ted Cruz saying, I think there's a real potential for government overreach, do you think so?
[3:36:32.620 --> 3:36:36.060]  Senator Cruz, do you think that there's such a thing as government overreach, they're
[3:36:36.060 --> 3:36:41.460]  coming for your kids, I mean they're luring them in with milk and cookies, there are lotteries,
[3:36:41.460 --> 3:36:47.860]  million dollar lotteries going on, Governor DeWine, we're seeing coercion by employers,
[3:36:47.860 --> 3:36:51.900]  by universities, these kids can't go back to school, I mean what about these kids Dr.
[3:36:51.900 --> 3:36:56.300]  Ruby who are looking at their second and third year of college, they're already enrolled,
[3:36:56.300 --> 3:37:01.180]  their parents have paid for tuition, and you know when you start talking before we went
[3:37:01.180 --> 3:37:06.620]  to the break, I was predicting this mass suicide event that's going to happen, and you know
[3:37:06.620 --> 3:37:11.860]  I'm talking about the doctors that you were alluding to who have acted in malfeasance
[3:37:11.860 --> 3:37:17.220]  and who have not done their research at very minimal, they haven't done their research on
[3:37:17.220 --> 3:37:21.740]  what's in these injections because they just get this emergency use authorization, it's
[3:37:21.740 --> 3:37:27.940]  not their job to really look into it, but when you as a doctor, isn't it your responsibility
[3:37:27.940 --> 3:37:34.300]  to say, hey I'm seeing these reports of this myocarditis, and yeah in the media I'm seeing
[3:37:34.300 --> 3:37:39.140]  that okay well it doesn't say that there's a direct link, but there is all of this data
[3:37:39.140 --> 3:37:45.540]  that's accessible by healthcare professionals, by these doctors who have access at very minimum
[3:37:45.540 --> 3:37:50.540]  to theirs, but I think for a lot more access to other things, listen I should probably look
[3:37:50.540 --> 3:37:56.340]  into this, and so then you know they go ahead and they get the, I don't know, I think they're
[3:37:56.340 --> 3:38:00.540]  going to be killing themselves, but what about these poor parents, what about these parents
[3:38:00.540 --> 3:38:09.060]  who are with joy holding up their infant babies for cameras for photo opportunities, the youngest
[3:38:09.060 --> 3:38:14.860]  baby injected with this thing in the world, let's make news, people running around touting
[3:38:14.860 --> 3:38:20.500]  the fact, celebrating the fact that they have encouraged their children towards this thing,
[3:38:20.500 --> 3:38:25.260]  I'm predicting mass suicides by those people as well, I mean what about the luring, what
[3:38:25.260 --> 3:38:32.020]  about the going after our children with this thing, to that you say what?
[3:38:32.020 --> 3:38:37.380]  I'm going to call it a war on young people and children, they're hitting the universities
[3:38:37.380 --> 3:38:45.020]  all the way down to the nursery schools, I can't sound this alarm enough, your life
[3:38:45.020 --> 3:38:53.660]  long health is not worth changing, losing a semester or two, find another university,
[3:38:53.660 --> 3:39:00.140]  not every university demands that you be inoculated, injected with this poison before you can return
[3:39:00.140 --> 3:39:04.940]  back to school, put your money where your mouth is, march with your wallet, in terms
[3:39:04.940 --> 3:39:13.100]  of young children, parents, I'm begging parents, you're sentencing your child to first of all
[3:39:13.100 --> 3:39:19.380]  a lifetime of the unknown, but what we do know you're sentencing them to is highly likely
[3:39:19.380 --> 3:39:26.460]  many decades of autoimmune diseases, illnesses, if they even live a normal lifespan, and I'm
[3:39:26.460 --> 3:39:33.220]  not overstating this, when I tell parents and students just wait, find another university,
[3:39:33.220 --> 3:39:38.580]  even when it comes to jobs, people write to me, Dr. Ruby, what should I do, it's my job,
[3:39:38.580 --> 3:39:45.020]  find another job, are you willing to trade your life and your health for the next 40,
[3:39:45.020 --> 3:39:53.140]  50 years for a trip to Spain next year, I mean really think about this, it's incredibly
[3:39:53.140 --> 3:39:57.220]  dangerous, and you mentioned the dereliction of doctors, I just want to touch on another
[3:39:57.220 --> 3:40:03.580]  thing about that Stu, why aren't doctors looking for weekly safety updates, there's nothing
[3:40:03.580 --> 3:40:11.300]  coming out to guide doctors and other professionals, education professionals, anything like that,
[3:40:11.300 --> 3:40:17.260]  there's no oversight, has anyone stopped to ask, where's the oversight on these programs
[3:40:17.260 --> 3:40:22.140]  in, they're setting up clinics in school, it's incredibly frightening, we mentioned
[3:40:22.140 --> 3:40:26.820]  you are, but I think there is a whole lot of oversight going on here, because I think
[3:40:26.820 --> 3:40:31.740]  that this is absolutely 100% intentional, and I think that the globalists are absolutely
[3:40:31.740 --> 3:40:35.980]  overseeing all of this, and they're pulling all of the strings that there's been backroom
[3:40:35.980 --> 3:40:41.020]  deals done in Washington, and that those that are supposedly elected and sent there to
[3:40:41.020 --> 3:40:45.140]  represent the will of the people who we know now, I mean they don't even have to be elected,
[3:40:45.140 --> 3:40:49.340]  they can be installed, they can just be sent there, and then they can be inaugurated under
[3:40:49.340 --> 3:40:55.020]  the protection of electrified razor wire and thousands of National Guard troops in a weird
[3:40:55.020 --> 3:41:00.500]  and vacant Washington DC, so I think there's a whole lot of oversight going on here, and
[3:41:00.500 --> 3:41:06.060]  I think that those people who are going to be found to be criminally liable is going
[3:41:06.060 --> 3:41:12.820]  to really surprise a whole lot of people that this is not just limited to Democrats, Democrats
[3:41:12.820 --> 3:41:18.300]  and progressive radicals that we have been identifying here as tyrants and hijacking
[3:41:18.300 --> 3:41:22.820]  a political system and overturning our entire government, I think it's going to shock a
[3:41:22.820 --> 3:41:27.620]  lot of so-called Republicans when they find out that the people that they had a whole
[3:41:27.620 --> 3:41:32.460]  lot of confidence in that would go to Washington and properly represent us were equally as
[3:41:32.460 --> 3:41:36.100]  complicit in this because their pockets were being lined by special interest groups and
[3:41:36.100 --> 3:41:40.180]  by the elitists that sit at the round table of the faction and the globalists that want
[3:41:40.180 --> 3:41:45.140]  to kill our kids, that want to make women infertile, that want to demasculinize men
[3:41:45.140 --> 3:41:50.020]  and get rid of any opposition to this overtaking, this political agenda to move towards a one
[3:41:50.020 --> 3:41:53.860]  world order, and I know that we're getting off the topic here a little bit, but when
[3:41:53.860 --> 3:41:57.460]  I have you, you're very valuable to me, so I want to go back to the medical insight on
[3:41:57.460 --> 3:42:03.380]  this, but I just want to give, for a full perspective here, I mean, I have seen verifiable
[3:42:03.380 --> 3:42:08.420]  evidence that the UN, for example, is gearing up to come in and start policing the streets
[3:42:08.420 --> 3:42:11.300]  in some of these cities like Chicago and in New York.
[3:42:11.300 --> 3:42:16.580]  All of this uptick in violence, all of this uptick in, you know, gun violence and killings
[3:42:16.580 --> 3:42:19.860]  and homicides, this isn't a surprise.
[3:42:19.860 --> 3:42:24.060]  The reason you don't see a look of shock or surprise on some of these tyrannical leaders
[3:42:24.060 --> 3:42:28.780]  like Lori Lightfoot in Chicago or here on Mayor Jacob Fry in the city of Minneapolis
[3:42:28.780 --> 3:42:30.980]  is because this is all orchestrated and planned.
[3:42:30.980 --> 3:42:35.460]  It's going on in New York, it's going on in Los Angeles, and that is because if defunding
[3:42:35.460 --> 3:42:39.620]  the police is not enough and enough enough people stand up and say, no, no, no, we want
[3:42:39.620 --> 3:42:44.700]  to, we want to fund our police, we need police protection here, then the goal is then to say,
[3:42:44.700 --> 3:42:47.860]  well, you know what, the police that we have here are not effective.
[3:42:47.860 --> 3:42:51.340]  Look at this, they have not been able to stop this violence, they have not been able to stop
[3:42:51.340 --> 3:42:56.140]  this burning, they have not been able to stop these people, you know, assaulting people,
[3:42:56.140 --> 3:42:58.540]  holding people for ransom in their alleyways.
[3:42:58.540 --> 3:43:02.700]  These police that you're looking at are weak, they're ineffective, they're not able to stop
[3:43:02.700 --> 3:43:03.700]  this violence.
[3:43:03.700 --> 3:43:08.100]  So we need to find an alternative solution to this kind of policing.
[3:43:08.100 --> 3:43:13.580]  When they say reimagine, these are the terms that you have to be, they should make your
[3:43:13.580 --> 3:43:20.620]  skin crawl when you hear things like reimagine policing because that means that an uninterested
[3:43:20.620 --> 3:43:25.620]  party, somebody with no ties to your community, somebody who doesn't care about the city of
[3:43:25.620 --> 3:43:30.500]  Minneapolis or, you know, Florida, wherever you are, they don't care about that because
[3:43:30.500 --> 3:43:35.380]  they don't have any ties there, they're going to send in this new police force that's going
[3:43:35.380 --> 3:43:37.580]  to overtake everything and everybody.
[3:43:37.580 --> 3:43:41.100]  Now you're going to watch the lawlessness continue to uptick, you're going to watch
[3:43:41.100 --> 3:43:46.260]  as crime becomes legalized, but it doesn't just, it's not just law enforcement that
[3:43:46.260 --> 3:43:49.740]  we have to worry about this oversight that you're talking about, that there's a lack
[3:43:49.740 --> 3:43:54.700]  thereof, which I am more cynical, maybe more jaded than you are, but I see that there is
[3:43:54.700 --> 3:43:58.820]  a whole lot of oversight going on here and that this isn't just going to be, well, the
[3:43:58.820 --> 3:44:02.780]  police aren't effective, but it's also going to be your doctors have been ineffective.
[3:44:02.780 --> 3:44:09.380]  And so now there needs to be some sort of a one system of health care where you're going
[3:44:09.380 --> 3:44:14.340]  to be, you don't know what's best for you and we do know what's best for you.
[3:44:14.340 --> 3:44:18.660]  And so now we're getting to the point where it doesn't matter what Senator Ted Cruz says
[3:44:18.660 --> 3:44:23.860]  about vaccine passports and whether or not he wants to oppose these things, because that
[3:44:23.860 --> 3:44:28.700]  is going to be overtaken by whatever this force is that is going to require you to
[3:44:28.700 --> 3:44:29.700]  be vaccinated.
[3:44:29.700 --> 3:44:30.700]  I think that that's coming.
[3:44:30.700 --> 3:44:34.420]  I mean, do you disagree with that, with that, with that theory?
[3:44:34.420 --> 3:44:35.820]  No, not at all.
[3:44:35.820 --> 3:44:40.900]  I mean, you know, I, I, I tend to focus on the medical atrocities because we are so
[3:44:40.900 --> 3:44:46.020]  off the mark in terms of what we normally do with research, health care and getting
[3:44:46.020 --> 3:44:51.980]  treatments out, but you're painting the broader picture because the medical atrocities going
[3:44:51.980 --> 3:44:56.660]  on right now are really only part of the entire, you know, takeover.
[3:44:56.660 --> 3:45:00.060]  I've said from the beginning, we're in the middle of a Marxist coup.
[3:45:00.060 --> 3:45:05.660]  The only reason they haven't completed the entire takeover and finalized some of the
[3:45:05.660 --> 3:45:11.100]  scenarios you just laid out, I believe is because we, we, we have the second amendment
[3:45:11.100 --> 3:45:14.460]  is because we have firearms and they don't know where they all are.
[3:45:14.460 --> 3:45:18.860]  But, but I, I really want to urge people just on, you know, on the medical stuff, go to
[3:45:18.860 --> 3:45:23.140]  your school boards, go to your medical, you know, boards in your state, start streaming
[3:45:23.140 --> 3:45:27.780]  and yelling because this, like Stu said, this is part and parcel of the entire takeover.
[3:45:27.780 --> 3:45:30.460]  I will tell you, it does make a difference.
[3:45:30.460 --> 3:45:32.100]  People do make change.
[3:45:32.100 --> 3:45:38.500]  In Alabama, I interviewed a guy just yesterday at stupeters.tv who he went in with, we had
[3:45:38.500 --> 3:45:41.500]  a guest here on one of my Fridays in the Alex Jones show.
[3:45:41.500 --> 3:45:44.020]  He went in with some of that paperwork.
[3:45:44.020 --> 3:45:47.540]  He threw it at the board and said, no, I want the masks off and you're not going to require
[3:45:47.540 --> 3:45:49.660]  proof of vaccination before my kids come back.
[3:45:49.660 --> 3:45:52.220]  They threw him out of that meeting.
[3:45:52.220 --> 3:45:57.460]  But then now later have come back and said, after reviewing the paperwork that he filed
[3:45:57.460 --> 3:46:02.140]  from Lewis Ewing, that guest that I had here on this program, that they have now come out
[3:46:02.140 --> 3:46:06.660]  in, in that county in Arizona and Jefferson County and said, no, we're not going to require
[3:46:06.660 --> 3:46:10.260]  your kids to wear masks here and we're not going to require proof of inoculation.
[3:46:10.260 --> 3:46:14.980]  So getting loud and getting in front of these people and causing a problem, you have to
[3:46:14.980 --> 3:46:15.980]  cause a problem.
[3:46:15.980 --> 3:46:20.100]  As Maxine Waters says, you have to get more confrontational with these people and as we
[3:46:20.100 --> 3:46:25.420]  get more confrontational and we say, no, we're putting our foot down, we can absolutely make
[3:46:25.420 --> 3:46:26.420]  a difference.
[3:46:26.420 --> 3:46:29.500]  Many people have sent questions to my proton mail and yours, Dr. Ruby.
[3:46:29.500 --> 3:46:32.100]  I think it's important that we answer some of those questions.
[3:46:32.100 --> 3:46:33.460]  We're going to do that right after the break.
[3:46:33.460 --> 3:46:34.460]  Stick around.
[3:46:34.460 --> 3:46:40.460]  This is the Alex Jones show.
