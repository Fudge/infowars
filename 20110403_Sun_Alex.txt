[00:30.640 --> 00:36.480]  We're live my friends thank you so much for joining us it is now Sunday the third day of April
[00:37.040 --> 00:43.440]  2011 we're going to be here live for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[00:43.440 --> 00:50.320]  time back Monday through Friday 11 a.m. 2 p.m. Central time as well one of the hardest working
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.880]  radio show crews in America my great team want to salute them and of course you the listeners
[00:56.880 --> 01:02.880]  that are continuing to raise alarm bells that tyranny is accelerated across the planet and
[01:02.880 --> 01:09.680]  that liberty is in trouble only by admitting that our basic freedoms are under assault can we begin
[01:09.680 --> 01:16.000]  to reverse that criminal tide and restore our republic and free nations around the globe
[01:16.960 --> 01:24.880]  okay we have got unbelievably important news to cover today and we're also going to then
[01:24.880 --> 01:34.560]  open the phones up after I cover this news the United Nations backed government and the Ivory Coast
[01:36.640 --> 01:45.200]  in that civil war the side that the UN has backed has been caught involved in the mass murder of
[01:45.200 --> 01:53.360]  a thousand men women and children shades of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 that was United Nations
[01:53.360 --> 02:00.480]  run we're going to be going over that another headline peacekeepers control airport in the
[02:00.480 --> 02:07.120]  Ivory Coast French military says so another another invasion as they try to back the rebels
[02:07.920 --> 02:13.440]  against the incumbent government see they could care less about real humanitarian
[02:14.320 --> 02:20.240]  and humanitarian disasters that's their pretext to go in and we have a long history of UN backed
[02:20.240 --> 02:26.960]  massacres we're going to be breaking that down as it integrates from the Gold Coast of Africa
[02:26.960 --> 02:33.520]  and then over on the other side of Africa up in the northeastern corner coalition friendly fire
[02:33.520 --> 02:41.600]  kills 13 Libyan rebels continuing ex-Mujahideen now they're not al-Qaeda they're Mujahideen
[02:41.600 --> 02:46.480]  Wall Street Journal help lead Libyan rebels what we told you that five weeks ago that's who's
[02:46.480 --> 02:52.640]  leading it is al-Qaeda they're leading it they're not in and amongst them I've heard neo-contact
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.680]  show host well if there is al-Qaeda we need to find them that's why our special forces are there to
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.800]  clean out the al-Qaeda the al-Qaeda they command it's all in plain view stalemate and Libya increasingly
[03:04.800 --> 03:11.520]  viewed as a likely outcome Washington post Afghanistan quran burning protest rage for third
[03:11.520 --> 03:19.280]  day UN workers were beheaded at least 10 killed a thousand people protesting against the desiccation
[03:19.280 --> 03:25.920]  of the quran I mean that's amazing some of these muslim countries attack christian churches and
[03:25.920 --> 03:31.280]  burn the whole things down it's that's not the first amendment or free speech but the right
[03:31.280 --> 03:39.120]  to burn a quran or a bible or an american flag people's sacred symbols use basic free society
[03:39.120 --> 03:45.520]  and so again I point out that I don't support what that pastor did but it is his right to do it
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.080]  and people who don't like it should leave the united states because that's what freedom of
[03:50.080 --> 03:56.160]  speech and the first amendment is all about and if you allow them to take white supremacist speech
[03:56.160 --> 04:00.960]  or somebody burning korean speech you're going to lose your speech you figure that out yet that's
[04:00.960 --> 04:06.320]  why the globalists want all this multiculturalism so they can referee the the fighting sides it's
[04:06.320 --> 04:14.000]  whole part of divide and conquer now that's just some of the news on that front census bureau

[04:23.760 --> 04:28.480]  door at 10 o'clock at night and threats that's the chicago tribune writing the article like it's
[04:28.480 --> 04:34.240]  reasonable and good what the government is doing just the upside down upturning of our liberties
[04:34.240 --> 04:40.400]  now i also genetically modified cows produce human milk this is like spider goats or part
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.800]  arachnid part goat this is part cow part human but that's not the big news when we come back

[06:06.160 --> 06:22.480]  on for your mind thank you for joining us my friends an extremely important two-hour transmission

[06:41.680 --> 06:49.920]  2011 okay we've got census workers all over the country viciously harassing people and violating
[06:49.920 --> 06:55.840]  their rights the chicago tribune has an article basically whitewashing this of course you're
[06:55.840 --> 07:00.880]  like wait the census was last year no this federal government announced a decade ago
[07:00.880 --> 07:05.680]  they're just now getting around to it that the census will be yearly for all citizens
[07:05.680 --> 07:11.840]  and monthly for all businesses and will include thousands of questions a year this is not about
[07:11.840 --> 07:18.400]  apportioning the number of representatives for the for the congress out of each state
[07:18.400 --> 07:25.920]  it has nothing to do with that as the constitution provides it is all about training you that the
[07:25.920 --> 07:29.920]  government can stick their hands down your pants take money directly out of your bank account
[07:29.920 --> 07:34.560]  and order you to tell them what type of firearms you own what type of stocks and bonds you own
[07:34.560 --> 07:40.000]  what type of light bulbs toilet who lives there where do you work when do you go to work yes these
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.760]  are some of the questions on the eight different versions of the surveys by the way because the
[07:45.760 --> 07:51.200]  entire document is a fraud when they come to my house i inform them i'm never going to sign this
[07:51.200 --> 07:56.640]  don't ever come back well we'll call the police there's a federal law and i say good go ahead and
[07:56.640 --> 08:02.480]  do that and i'm going to explain why i didn't do it in 2000 i didn't do it last year and the few
[08:02.480 --> 08:07.440]  times that come to my door i say let me explain something i'm going to call the sheriff's department
[08:07.440 --> 08:13.520]  and have you arrested for trespassing get off my porch you little thug now only after they start
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.400]  smart mouthing me with their little plastic badge so i'm going to break that down it's illegal
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.840]  they'll have a 10 question a 40 question a hundred question they got eight different versions i've
[08:23.840 --> 08:28.640]  seen up on the census website said i get to this later but i'm already getting into it
[08:28.640 --> 08:33.040]  uh but i want to back this up the facts i'm putting out here federal judges have ruled
[08:33.040 --> 08:40.080]  including in houston uh repeatedly that they can only ask you how many people live there now that's
[08:40.080 --> 08:48.000]  what's in the constitution now they put the federal law code number under the first four
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.080]  questions only one of the questions is constitutional but it's all a threat of jail time they've only
[08:54.080 --> 08:59.520]  prosecuted one person back in 1960 for refusing a census i've looked that up and they and they
[08:59.520 --> 09:07.120]  lied about how many people live there but if you go back no one else has ever been prosecuted
[09:07.120 --> 09:12.080]  because they can't so they send you this form saying federal law provisions jail time if you
[09:12.080 --> 09:17.360]  don't do this fines and then they ask the one question they're allowed to ask have the code
[09:17.360 --> 09:23.440]  under it and the rest of the form is a fraud the rest of the form is color of law fraud
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.640]  and a contract that's fraudulent is null and void okay here's an example for those that are
[09:28.640 --> 09:32.480]  living in denial that i'm getting into the really big news i shouldn't be covering this first here
[09:33.840 --> 09:41.040]  i'm gonna cover it later as i said give the police pull you over because you're speeding
[09:41.040 --> 09:48.080]  and they hear someone banging in the trunk help me help me they have probable cause to pop the
[09:48.080 --> 09:53.840]  back of the trunk to find the woman you've got tied up or the man and then to take you to jail
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.560]  and then the murder trial continues or the kidnapping trial continues because they go
[09:58.560 --> 10:06.480]  out to your house and find 14 buried bodies now if you're a serial killer caught with a woman
[10:06.480 --> 10:13.760]  in your trunk 14 dead bodies buried out at your farm the police cannot compel you under the fifth
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.760]  amendment to incriminate yourself and to answer questions so someone with dead bodies at their
[10:19.760 --> 10:25.440]  house does not have to answer the government's questions under the fifth amendment and the
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.560]  right to remain silent and they cannot compel you through torture that's why they have that
[10:30.560 --> 10:38.000]  in the constitution bill of rights they can't make you do that but some person being paid $12
[10:38.000 --> 10:46.080]  an hour on a power trip with a plastic badge came to my house in 2000 and said you didn't fill out
[10:46.080 --> 10:51.120]  your whole form and i was covering at the time and the federal law had lawyers on documenting it and
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.120]  at the time a federal judge in houston had said you've only got to answer how many live at your
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.200]  house nothing else and she read the federal law and it was in the houston chronicle and everywhere
[10:59.200 --> 11:04.560]  else so the guy had had had been to my house he threatened my girlfriend we lived together then
[11:04.560 --> 11:09.120]  we're now married and i said well next time he comes back let me talk to him and i got a video
[11:09.120 --> 11:14.240]  camera out there and he got smart mouth with me and i said listen punk get off my property or my
[11:14.240 --> 11:18.320]  call the police for trespassing and i noticed he was parked in the middle of the street he thought
[11:18.320 --> 11:23.840]  he was so royal and holy that he parked out in the middle of the street literally blocking i mean
[11:23.840 --> 11:32.880]  parked in the middle of the road like he was god and i explained to him if you had had me arrested
[11:32.880 --> 11:39.920]  for murder and found dead bodies here you couldn't make me answer questions now get out of here it's
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.040]  called the fifth amendment and he threatened me and he had zits all over his face and he left
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.720]  some zit face 20 year old know it all on a power trip now since then they've had crises all over
[11:50.720 --> 11:56.800]  the country with uh census workers breaking into houses raping women that look good think of the
[11:56.800 --> 12:00.800]  control freaks that go and get this job not all of them but some of the bad guys just like
[12:00.800 --> 12:07.840]  bad crazies that want power become tsa and rob bags and want to try to rape women and declare
[12:07.840 --> 12:13.520]  their god and go crazy or make fun of their co-workers genitalia size uh making them go
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.000]  through the scanners and then a fist fighter rubs i mean you've seen the reports they're off the charts
[12:18.000 --> 12:27.200]  but somebody goes and gets a $12 an hour job on a power trip and they will climb
[12:27.200 --> 12:32.640]  no trespassing fences they will go on farms they will go on ranches and then when a dog attacks them
[12:33.920 --> 12:38.320]  for being out on some farm or ranch they they call the police and freak out or they break
[12:38.320 --> 12:44.080]  in homes i've seen those reports last year and back in 2000 but here's the big frightening issue
[12:44.080 --> 12:53.440]  you they've announced that they want to make these surveys go to yearly for all citizens all
[12:53.440 --> 13:00.080]  americans and monthly for businesses and i'm not going to fill them out i'm not going to fill it
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.880]  out i'm not going to get in this this this trained propaganda position where where i work for the
[13:06.880 --> 13:13.200]  government as an indentured servant and i fill out forms like i'm in the army or something and i'm a
[13:13.200 --> 13:20.560]  i'm a sergeant and i'm filling out forms uh for the colonel no i don't work for you we already
[13:20.560 --> 13:26.000]  spend what is it 50 plus billion dollars a year just complying with the income tax just the paperwork
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.880]  with the cpa's and the bizantine systems you can't figure out and now they by the way it's in the
[13:32.880 --> 13:38.080]  chicago tribune they go ahead and say well uh you know they did fill out their census this family
[13:38.080 --> 13:46.080]  being harassed last year but now this is the new yearly census just a big giant federal bureaucracy
[13:46.800 --> 13:51.600]  and so now we just don't fill any of it out and i'm public about that those directly in the trash can
[13:52.400 --> 13:59.040]  directly in the trash can the entire thing it's a fraudulent document through color of law

[19:17.120 --> 19:22.400]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[19:27.680 --> 19:32.800]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[19:32.800 --> 19:37.360]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[19:37.360 --> 19:41.440]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar powered
[19:41.440 --> 19:46.240]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information
[19:46.240 --> 19:52.320]  at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't
[19:52.320 --> 19:57.840]  own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three two seven zero
[19:57.840 --> 20:07.200]  three six five coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting
[20:07.200 --> 20:25.360]  network network waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[20:25.360 --> 20:33.200]  lines of the info war we are live thank you so much for joining us on this sunday transmission
[20:33.200 --> 20:43.680]  and third day of april 2011 okay coming up the united nations backed rebels in the ivory coast
[20:44.240 --> 20:49.600]  have reportedly murdered at least a thousand men women and children with machetes and machine guns
[20:49.600 --> 20:54.640]  kind of like the un it turned out actually helped round up and murder the hundreds of thousands
[20:54.640 --> 21:01.120]  the estimated 800 thousand rwandans nearby in 1994 because they were the minority group they
[21:01.120 --> 21:05.520]  wanted to clean out and so the oil companies can move in you see the globalist that run our
[21:05.520 --> 21:09.520]  country and most of the planet could care less about humanitarian disasters like they're telling
[21:09.520 --> 21:14.480]  you with libya and the ongoing bombing of libya no doubt has intensified the amount of hardship
[21:15.040 --> 21:22.560]  and now the globalist backed forces are losing again to qaddafi that is coming up later in the
[21:22.560 --> 21:27.840]  hour i also want to open the phones up on all the issues that i've been covering but before i give
[21:27.840 --> 21:36.480]  the phone number out at the end of this segment i want to cover the top story today and at info
[21:36.480 --> 21:41.280]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com we've been covering this in detail the drudge report has
[21:41.280 --> 21:49.120]  continued to try to keep this on the front burner not dancing with the stars not the ncaa scores
[21:50.080 --> 21:56.160]  not even the libya situation though that is very important uh new york times contributor he's a
[21:56.160 --> 22:01.840]  writer for the new york times who was writing for the bay citizen newspaper in the bay area
[22:01.840 --> 22:09.760]  new york times contributor confirms california rainwater 181 times above drinking water standards
[22:09.760 --> 22:19.280]  for radioactive iodine 131 and the issue here is we're now three weeks and two days so we're now
[22:19.280 --> 22:28.800]  uh 21 22 23 days uh into the fukushima situation that happened on march 11th uh of last month
[22:28.800 --> 22:33.040]  and the first radiation to get here was from the small leaks when the plant got damaged from the
[22:33.040 --> 22:39.360]  earthquake and tsunami then on the next saturday reactor one blew up spectacularly then on monday
[22:39.360 --> 22:46.160]  reactor three mox plutonium general electric reactor blew up in a 3000 foot black uh mushroom
[22:46.160 --> 22:51.440]  cloud ejecting what we later learned were hundreds of thousands of spent fuel rods stored on top
[22:51.440 --> 22:57.680]  of the reactor then since then they've admitted three of the five damage of the total six do
[22:57.680 --> 23:04.320]  have partially breached intercontainment cores that have the live uranium and in one case uh
[23:04.320 --> 23:09.200]  plutonium in reactor three and that now for at least a week and a half that's been running into
[23:09.200 --> 23:18.640]  the groundwater and into the ocean at 100 000 times safe levels a source on that uh kiyoto news
[23:20.000 --> 23:28.560]  japanese government washington post reportedly for miles around 1 000 milliseverts per hour
[23:29.280 --> 23:34.880]  the washington post radiologist nuclear uh fallen experts estimated earlier in the last week
[23:34.880 --> 23:40.640]  that five hours or 5000 milliseverts if you're around that five hours is a 50 50 chance it
[23:40.640 --> 23:46.000]  will kill you within two weeks and they are now reporting uh radiation sickness and of course the
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  head of the plant's put in the hospital for a week now but but but here's the big news uh out of
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.480]  the bay citizen but also out of some other californian newspapers they also are reporting
[23:58.480 --> 24:04.080]  similar numbers out of washington state but it's not getting any play new york times contributor
[24:04.080 --> 24:10.560]  confirms california rainwater 181 times above drinking water standards for radioactive iodine
[24:10.560 --> 24:17.760]  131 federal officials have still not published any official data on nuclear fallout from japan
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.960]  disaster they're not giving any aggregate reports total mapping reports it's been state officials
[24:22.960 --> 24:28.080]  in california and washington that did their job and reported that they were finding radioactive
[24:28.080 --> 24:36.480]  iodine and other uh off-gassed radioactive isotopes in the milk because the cows are quite large they
[24:36.480 --> 24:43.040]  eat a lot of grain drink a lot of water and then it bio accumulates out in their milk uh federal
[24:43.040 --> 24:48.880]  officials again have not given any numbers uh radiation from japan rained on berkeley during
[24:48.880 --> 24:54.880]  recent storms at levels that exceeded drinking water standards by 181 times and has been detected
[24:54.880 --> 25:00.800]  in multiple milk samples in multiple states radiation falling uh with rain can cover grass
[25:00.800 --> 25:05.760]  that is eaten by cows or other animals it can also fall on crops or accumulate in reservoirs
[25:05.760 --> 25:11.280]  that are used for irrigation or drinking water seafood can also be affected a rooftop water
[25:11.280 --> 25:15.360]  monitoring program managed by uc berkeley department of nuclear engineering detected
[25:15.360 --> 25:22.960]  substantial spikes in rainborne iodine 131 during torrential downpours a week ago uh yeah going back
[25:22.960 --> 25:34.240]  two weeks ago we first got the radiation levels as far east as boston uh nevada uh illinois picked
[25:34.240 --> 25:41.360]  it up uh then of course the first year uh atlantic nation uh was of course island then the continent
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.560]  of europe and they're just giving you a basic background radiation reading not the specific
[25:46.560 --> 25:53.040]  isotopes that take very expensive uh measuring equipment that is very detailed and we've had
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.160]  the pentagon there for three weeks pulling back 200 miles quietly evacuating people not releasing
[25:58.160 --> 26:03.440]  numbers the japanese for over two weeks wouldn't release numbers when they finally did uh last
[26:03.440 --> 26:10.960]  sunday more than two weeks in they said 100 000 times and they reported again in the japanese news
[26:10.960 --> 26:17.200]  the last two days blue beams of light and when my dad was going to ut and in the nuclear physics
[26:17.200 --> 26:21.200]  department down there they made the joke to him because they have a little nuclear reactor at
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.320]  ut another bigger one that the jj pickle center that wasn't there when he was at ut just the one
[26:26.320 --> 26:32.800]  reactor they made the joke that yeah we've got uh ultraviolent light detectors uh that can pick up uh
[26:32.800 --> 26:37.360]  you know radioactive light but the joke is if it ever gets to that level you're basically it's
[26:37.360 --> 26:41.920]  going to kill you in a few weeks anyways from any exposure well it's not funny because those
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.160]  those blue lights are being seen even in the daytime they're called neutron beams and so
[26:48.160 --> 26:55.200]  neutron beams are shooting out uh of at least one of the damaged internal uh reactors that is leaking
[26:55.200 --> 27:01.120]  out uh and again every time i mention that we have reactors in austin i get emails saying i'm a liar
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.680]  because people don't know how to search engine things i'm sure that when i mentioned that they
[27:05.680 --> 27:11.280]  now have goats that are part spider or cows that are part human i'm going to be sending emails that
[27:11.280 --> 27:18.480]  i'm a liar see we're living in the 21st century folks this isn't 1960 this is buck roger's land
[27:18.480 --> 27:23.200]  and if you think this radiation is a danger and being whitewashed and cover up what about
[27:24.160 --> 27:30.320]  the wild open air genetic engineering going on and the type of mutated viruses and bacteria we
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.600]  know in studies this is already basically loosed on humanity we're going to be breaking that down later
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.760]  london telegraph genetically modified cows produce human milk scientists have created
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.760]  genetically modified cattle that produce human milk in a bid to make cows milk more nutritious
[27:45.760 --> 27:49.760]  and it goes on to say the scientists have successfully introduced human genes into 300
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.600]  dairy cows to produce milk with the same properties as human breast milk these cows are part human uh
[27:55.600 --> 28:00.560]  so and and and so you don't normally get zoological diseases from animals because there's a buffer
[28:00.560 --> 28:06.240]  between species but when you start crossing their genetics then it allows these diseases to jump
[28:06.240 --> 28:13.680]  back and forth not natural very very dangerous and i've interviewed many top genetic engineers
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.320]  over the years who've broken down how deadly dangerous this is and we've also provide a lot
[28:18.320 --> 28:23.680]  of great books that break this down like genetic roulette available on the online video bookstore
[28:23.680 --> 28:29.520]  at info wars dot com again genetic roulette continuing here though uh again this is a
[28:29.520 --> 28:34.240]  respected reporter john upton who writes for the new york times he wrote this for the base citizen
[28:34.240 --> 28:41.120]  government under fire as radiation is found in milk and rain and uh goes on to report that the
[28:41.120 --> 28:48.400]  feds are covering up just how serious this is will finish up with the ongoing crisis no by
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.440]  the way the japanese say this may go on for months so it just keeps drifting over towards the u.s
[28:53.440 --> 29:01.280]  but the feds won't release numbers we'll be right back stay with us hello friends this is alex

[30:10.480 --> 30:15.360]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned members influence
[30:15.360 --> 30:21.360]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[30:21.360 --> 30:27.840]  of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[30:27.840 --> 30:34.240]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[30:34.240 --> 30:39.200]  government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[30:39.200 --> 30:43.920]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[30:43.920 --> 30:51.520]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[30:59.760 --> 31:04.560]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on june of
[31:04.560 --> 31:10.800]  2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[31:10.800 --> 31:15.520]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and
[31:15.520 --> 31:20.720]  silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition
[31:20.720 --> 31:25.520]  to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food savings account

[32:24.720 --> 32:30.320]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact baron's called his work a dire prophecy
[32:30.320 --> 32:34.800]  recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[32:34.800 --> 32:40.000]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener i can't stress this enough you should at least

[33:35.760 --> 33:50.160]  877-789-ALEX or 877-789-2539 and we'll get you up live and here on the air today the third of
[33:50.880 --> 34:00.080]  april 2011 so it's being reported out in california and washington state and other western areas
[34:00.080 --> 34:06.160]  that the radiation is building up the levels exceed federal drinking water thresholds known as
[34:06.160 --> 34:14.400]  maximum containment levels or mcl's by as much as 181 times patty lavera assistant director
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.840]  at the nonprofit food and water watch the official mantra from a lot of folks in government is oh
[34:19.840 --> 34:25.840]  it's okay at low levels but low levels add up see that keeps building up it keeps adding up
[34:25.840 --> 34:31.680]  and we keep getting more and more of the smoke and more and more of the radiation from fukushima
[34:31.680 --> 34:40.720]  as it continues to burn and explode and leak uranium plutonium cesium tritium the list goes on and on
[34:42.320 --> 34:49.600]  and the report continues from the bay citizen and actually uh the new york times did actually
[34:49.600 --> 34:55.920]  even post this article so they actually are uh reporting on that as well but you would think
[34:55.920 --> 35:04.720]  that this would be a bigger news story right now uh continuing tepco struggles to halt radioactive
[35:04.720 --> 35:13.040]  leak tokyo power is struggling to block a crack in a pit that is leaking highly radioactive water
[35:13.040 --> 35:18.400]  into the ocean at its fukushima dieci nuclear plant the utility also said it had found the
[35:18.400 --> 35:26.800]  bodies of two employees at the stricken facility uh continuing uh with the report here uh fox news
[35:26.800 --> 35:31.520]  is reporting that the chief cabinet secretary is saying that it would take a few months until
[35:31.520 --> 35:37.120]  we finally get things under control and have a better idea about the future so a few months until
[35:37.120 --> 35:42.000]  they even understand exactly what's going on and they've repeatedly in the last week pulled
[35:42.000 --> 35:48.560]  emergency workers out saying the radiation is too dangerous to even be around uh so uh that gives
[35:48.560 --> 35:57.200]  you an idea of how shattered this facility is also the age out of australia is reporting japan's
[35:57.200 --> 36:04.480]  prime minister tells nuclear workers you can't lose this battle and he's come out and said that
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.480]  basically that it's it's going to radiate large areas of japan that it's already radiated but
[36:10.480 --> 36:16.160]  continue to radiate it uh if they don't uh defeat this and he went on to say that we're fighting
[36:16.160 --> 36:22.640]  to determine japan's fate now that's across the pacific ocean but the winds are all blowing this
[36:22.640 --> 36:28.640]  way and the japanese are now saying they're fighting to determine japan's fate but most of our media
[36:28.640 --> 36:36.480]  is basically playing down what's going on and not releasing the some aggregate totals of radiation
[36:36.480 --> 36:43.680]  levels on the west coast where the jet stream dumps most of this stuff in uh continuing much
[36:43.680 --> 36:49.120]  of the floating debris from tsunami hit japan could reach us west coast the pristine beaches of the
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.400]  us west coast could become a dumping ground for flotsam and debris coming from the sunken
[36:55.120 --> 37:03.360]  vessels in the tsunami hit northeastern japan in one to three years it's saying it'll take
[37:03.360 --> 37:10.640]  that long for it to float across uh and uh boiling down the latest george washington blog
[37:10.640 --> 37:17.760]  has a boil down uh from singing in the associated press and others update to japan's nuclear crisis
[37:17.760 --> 37:23.600]  the situation of fukushima diachi nuclear complex is getting worse and in many ways
[37:25.120 --> 37:33.120]  but better in some here's a quick roundup reactor one energy secretary steve choose said that roughly
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.080]  70 percent of the core reactor number one suffered severe damage in other words it came very close
[37:38.080 --> 37:43.200]  to a total meltdown but things appear now to be stabilizing we can believe that uh continuing
[37:43.200 --> 37:48.160]  reactor number two tepco announced there is a crack in the concrete pit of the reactor number two
[37:48.160 --> 37:53.280]  that is leaking radiation at 100 000 timesafe levels into the ocean from the crippled reactor
[37:55.200 --> 38:00.560]  at 1000 millisieverts of radiation per hour five thousand is considered to be lethal
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.040]  continuing reuters reports that workers are coming to plug the crack with concrete
[38:05.600 --> 38:11.760]  but were facing challenges public broadcaster nhk said late on saturday the water was preventing
[38:11.760 --> 38:17.760]  the concrete from hardening and the pit was still leaking uh cnn reports authorities in japan
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.880]  raised the prospect friday of a likely breach in all important containment vessel number three
[38:22.880 --> 38:29.280]  reactor as well at the stricken fukushima diachi nuclear plant not just number two
[38:29.280 --> 38:35.040]  a potentially ominous development in the race to prevent a large-scale release of radiation
[38:36.320 --> 38:42.480]  the new york times pointed out a senior nuclear uh executive uh who insisted on anonymity but who
[38:42.480 --> 38:46.880]  has broad contacts in japan said there was a long vertical crack running down the side of the
[38:46.880 --> 38:51.360]  reactor vessel itself the crack runs down below the water level in the reactor and has been leaking
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.920]  fluids and gases yeah for several weeks and they believe it happened during the big explosion at
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.120]  reactor three the big thing that happened over two weeks ago with a big black cloud going up
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.040]  there is a definite crack in the vessel it's up and down and it's large he said the problem with
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.440]  cracks is they do not get smaller the nhk notes that the giant crane fell over and probably crushed
[39:13.440 --> 39:18.000]  spent fuel rods at fukushima reactor number three which contained plutonium uranium mix
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.720]  and it goes on that reactor number four nuclear engineer arnie gunderson notes that the spent
[39:24.720 --> 39:29.440]  fuel rods in reactor four have no water and the fuel rods are exposed and have been smoking
[39:30.880 --> 39:37.360]  continuing here mike adams has a reported info wars dot com dealing with the boston globe getting
[39:37.360 --> 39:43.840]  all their scientific facts wrong and and and actually making up terms and getting information
[39:44.400 --> 39:50.400]  incorrect showing the level of ignorance the government is playing on through the mainstream
[39:50.400 --> 39:57.840]  media okay uh so there you have it we are now into week number three as of last friday we are now
[39:57.840 --> 40:12.320]  23 days and counting into this crises and our government i saw the epa on friday in the san
[40:12.320 --> 40:20.560]  francisco chronicles saying don't worry about radiation in california and washington milk because uh it's
[40:20.560 --> 40:26.160]  going to lower very quickly we believe it's going to go down and that we're going to get less
[40:26.160 --> 40:32.800]  radiation now from japan really two weeks ago was 1600 times safe levels then it was 10 000
[40:32.800 --> 40:39.680]  times safe levels then it was 100 000 times safe levels now there's neutron beams shooting out for
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.920]  a week and a half straight of such high radiation you could see it with your eyeballs blue light day
[40:45.920 --> 40:52.080]  and night according to the research i've done in the nuclear physicists we've had on when you start
[40:52.080 --> 40:58.160]  seeing blue light ladies and gentlemen you're in a microwave of radiation now it's going in the
[40:58.160 --> 41:04.480]  seafood and if you look at the federal government's policy going back over two weeks ago people flying
[41:04.480 --> 41:11.920]  into dallas san francisco uh chicago and many other cities had radiation on their shoes especially
[41:11.920 --> 41:16.880]  from the ground but on their clothes on their bodies the aircraft had it and they didn't take
[41:16.880 --> 41:21.680]  their clothes away and give them other clothes or scrub them down or call out the homeland security
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.720]  scrubber trucks to get people you know scrubbed and anti-radiation soap and get clean they just
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.760]  said go on through we just wanted to know how radioactive you work and they just let them on
[41:31.760 --> 41:37.600]  in and it's going to be the same thing with the food the vegetables the fruits where this stuff
[41:37.600 --> 41:44.720]  bioaccumulates it rains down in quote low levels week after week aggregating building up bioaccumulating
[41:44.720 --> 41:49.120]  you're not going to hear any recalls you're not going to hear any warnings like people 2 000 miles
[41:49.120 --> 41:55.040]  away from chernobyl in 86 for six months in europe even in people that weren't downwind they
[41:55.040 --> 42:03.280]  shipped in food from the u.s in asia frozen frozen poultry powdered milk from other reasons of the
[42:03.280 --> 42:08.960]  world frozen vegetables you're not hearing that are you know in fact the japanese still just 20
[42:08.960 --> 42:15.120]  miles away have kids going to school so the japanese are going with the same policy all the u.s military
[42:15.120 --> 42:19.920]  pulled out almost every major u.s corporation pulled out but golden sacks they told their employees
[42:19.920 --> 42:25.200]  and you know you go ahead was it golden sacks or jp morgan google golden sacks tells employees
[42:25.200 --> 42:28.480]  stay in japan i think it was golden sacks but one double check i'm having a little memory
[42:29.840 --> 42:34.880]  thing there when i come back i'll plug that break that down and then after we take calls for a
[42:34.880 --> 42:39.760]  couple segments and get your view on all this we're going to shift gears into the latest on libya
[42:40.400 --> 42:46.000]  and the al-qaeda forces that the media now admits are leading the rebellion but don't talk about al-qaeda
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.080]  or you're you're not a humanitarian you're uh you're to be pro america you got to be for al-qaeda
[42:52.080 --> 42:57.520]  well then i'm not pro america then i don't like al-qaeda or their lca to handlers and we'll get
[42:57.520 --> 43:03.360]  into the uh gold coast hi folks this is alex jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you

[45:08.400 --> 45:13.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[45:13.440 --> 45:19.040]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[45:19.040 --> 45:24.720]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[45:24.720 --> 45:30.240]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[45:30.240 --> 45:34.640]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[47:08.640 --> 47:24.160]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[47:25.440 --> 47:27.600]  rallying patriots worldwide
[47:27.600 --> 47:34.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:38.560 --> 47:46.000]  my memory did serve correctly it was uh cnbc and others reported not this coming monday but last
[47:46.000 --> 47:53.600]  monday on the 28th of march goldman sacks employees told not to leave japan and they
[47:53.600 --> 47:59.120]  sent an executive to who hurriedly left soon as he told them you will stay here but basically
[47:59.120 --> 48:04.960]  everybody else is evacuating but they're telling the japanese schoolchildren nearby the reactor play
[48:04.960 --> 48:10.000]  have fun drink the water and it's the same thing here in the u.s where it's bio accumulating and
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.200]  fruits vegetables and milk the feds have no comment on the states picking this up so it's 181 times
[48:17.200 --> 48:24.800]  safe levels in the bay area you know what so what enjoy it drink it have extra it's not bad for you
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.720]  just like in 91 they changed the pentagon policy of not letting troops use depleted uranium
[48:31.840 --> 48:37.680]  because it ignites while being fired down the barrel of all calibers of projectile weapons
[48:38.240 --> 48:43.360]  and you get a deadly dose of it it may take 20 years to give you lung cancer but it's deadly
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.760]  we've had the former head of the d u weapons program dr doug rocky on but so what if he's
[48:47.760 --> 48:53.280]  the physicist who wrote the book they say it's good for the troops see it's this out of control
[48:53.280 --> 48:58.400]  attitude by the people managing and running this planet that dovetails with all this open air
[48:58.960 --> 49:04.640]  cross bc salmon that are part insect cows that are part human pigs that are part human
[49:05.440 --> 49:11.680]  so they can harvest their organs and and all these top experts who were working inside these
[49:11.680 --> 49:16.960]  facilities genetic engineers come out and talk about how dangerous this is and how it can give me
[49:16.960 --> 49:25.920]  mutation problems into the viruses and bacteria and cross species disease spread and unnatural
[49:25.920 --> 49:32.640]  mutations they don't care just do it have fun enjoy it the globalists are endangering this
[49:32.640 --> 49:37.520]  planet even if they think it's their planet and want to reduce the world population by 80 percent
[49:37.520 --> 49:42.720]  now i'm going to cover all of that and i'm going to get into the situation on the uh ivory coast
[49:43.600 --> 49:48.240]  and the un's back group running around murdering people the latest on libya also they're talking
[49:48.240 --> 49:53.440]  about for the third time in two years suspending the canadian parliament the queen of england
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.600]  runs everything and if the parliament doesn't do what she wants she suspends it uh well that
[49:57.600 --> 50:02.640]  happened a few days ago not with a bang but with a whimper parliament to dissolve election in early
[50:02.640 --> 50:07.760]  may government found in contempt at first in canadian history it is not the first it's happened
[50:07.760 --> 50:12.560]  two other times in the last two years canadian government dissolves parliament well i thought
[50:12.560 --> 50:17.280]  the parliament is the government we're going to explain that key piece of info she's also
[50:17.280 --> 50:24.320]  suspended the parliament in australia before but right now we've got michelle myles syntia
[50:24.320 --> 50:33.120]  shane alexander dana henry josh nate josh brian uh peter and many many others uh but first and i
[50:33.120 --> 50:35.840]  want to go to your calls quickly so have your comment question right i'm going to the next
[50:35.840 --> 50:43.120]  person michael in washington you're on the air hey alexis megal uh michael i'm sorry uh i
[50:43.120 --> 50:49.360]  lived in bellingham washington and i was just wondering i know you're not a doctor but when
[50:49.360 --> 50:55.840]  would you suggest starting to take the potassium iodide well i'm not going to advise people on
[50:55.840 --> 51:00.640]  when they should take the different brands of medical potassium iodine and this is the the
[51:00.640 --> 51:04.960]  thread is radioactive iodine it's one of the wider isotopes it's made it over here in higher
[51:04.960 --> 51:11.840]  numbers many of the experts we've talked to have said 250 times safe levels you're at 181 times
[51:11.840 --> 51:17.760]  safe levels uh i personally if i live on the west coast i would already be on it but that's me
[51:17.760 --> 51:22.880]  personally i'm not giving you advice and before you take it you need to consult a physician and ask
[51:22.880 --> 51:29.680]  them thank you what do you think about the fact that the states are reporting higher very much
[51:29.680 --> 51:34.400]  higher levels of radiation but uh the feds are not releasing numbers just like the japanese
[51:34.400 --> 51:42.400]  didn't for two weeks i think it's criminal is anybody is anybody concerned in your area
[51:42.400 --> 51:48.160]  no everybody i talked to they're like oh you're overreacting we live thousands of miles away
[51:48.160 --> 51:53.040]  it's going to dissipate before it gets here eight day half life and all that and like
[51:53.600 --> 51:59.680]  guys i'm trying to make you sure make you not cheap but if you want to keep your blinders on
[51:59.680 --> 52:05.920]  i gotta keep uh my four and no more and move forward michael i appreciate your call and it's
[52:05.920 --> 52:09.520]  not just radioactive iodine that's one of the things they're picking up they've picked up some
[52:09.520 --> 52:14.880]  other isotubes but the feds with all of their billions of dollars in instruments that i mean
[52:14.880 --> 52:19.600]  they've got submarines admittedly with snorkels they put up that can pick up everything in the
[52:19.600 --> 52:24.880]  full spectrum they've got aircraft that do it they've got government sensors but you're not
[52:24.880 --> 52:30.080]  getting that information because they don't want you to know what came out four months ago in texas
[52:30.080 --> 52:39.200]  we'll put it on screen again cbs news houston uh fox news san Antonio radiation found in drinking
[52:39.200 --> 52:46.000]  water in every major texas city radioactive isotopes government covered up radiation in texas water
[52:46.800 --> 52:51.840]  radioactive isotopes and they didn't say why is it there or why was it covered up just oh it was
[52:51.840 --> 52:56.800]  covered up for years well because they mine it out of phosphate mines where they also get the
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.920]  sodium fluoride that's the same place you mine uranium and other isotopes that's where it is
[53:02.640 --> 53:06.320]  so they don't just dump fluoride in your water and they covered that up they put
[53:06.320 --> 53:12.800]  radioactive isotopes in your water just search there it is investigation finds radiation in texas
[53:12.800 --> 53:19.440]  drinking water and it goes on to say that texas secretly covered up the levels and basically
[53:19.440 --> 53:24.960]  worked with the epa to do it and i can't read what source that's out of that's out of the texas
[53:24.960 --> 53:29.520]  observer just type texas covered up radiation the water folks you can't make this stuff up
[53:29.520 --> 53:38.320]  miles in california you're on the air hey miles can you hear me uh let's go to senty
[53:38.320 --> 53:45.680]  and louisiana sentia you're on the air hey alex uh pleasure to talk to you um i live in
[53:45.680 --> 53:52.880]  ish report louisiana and these people really start need to really listen to what you're saying
[53:52.880 --> 53:59.600]  and what you're getting out there uh because it's a big problem okay let me break it down for you
[53:59.600 --> 54:08.000]  real quickly um when you started uh making everybody aware of the dangers of of all of this
[54:09.280 --> 54:17.520]  radiation and all this fallout i ordered online uh potassium i diet pills all right i never
[54:17.520 --> 54:25.200]  received them okay not only that i received the email where they had been sold out so i
[54:25.200 --> 54:34.000]  was offered the thyroid shield okay i ordered that now my order totally disappeared alex okay
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.920]  and thin air i have a confirmation order where it was scanned you're ready for me to tell you the
[54:39.920 --> 54:46.880]  state that it was scanned in exactly the same state that you said where it was going to come
[54:46.880 --> 54:52.800]  into the united states past alaska washington and i'm mad as hell well senty i hear you and i
[54:52.800 --> 54:56.560]  appreciate your calls you're saying you ordered some of these pills somewhere and it was stolen
[54:56.560 --> 55:02.320]  basically in the mail uh well obviously this is something in high demand uh but again you are in
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.880]  louisiana and the chances of you getting you know any high levels of this stuff are very very low
[55:06.880 --> 55:13.840]  but it is beginning to rise according to just to state and university uh measurements in california
[55:13.840 --> 55:19.120]  in washington state and it is a very serious issue obviously and i can understand why you're mad
[55:19.760 --> 55:26.480]  let's go ahead and talk to shane in kentucky shane you're on the air hi alex hey buddy yeah i was
[55:26.480 --> 55:32.560]  just calling about uh the uh census that you mentioned earlier and uh i just i find that
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.840]  hard to believe in the sense that the uh the treatment that me and my family went through
[55:37.840 --> 55:43.520]  during the previous census last year was just awful so yeah now they're saying they're gonna
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.640]  start random yearly census they have no power of law to do this and they demand you to answer all
[55:48.640 --> 55:52.880]  their questions so were you and your family threatened by these goons for not answering
[55:52.880 --> 55:58.960]  how big your toilet is or when you go to work oh i mean all sorts of stuff like that and even
[55:58.960 --> 56:06.080]  after we answered you know the questions they they came back even after that uh numerous times uh
[56:06.080 --> 56:11.360]  and said you didn't fill this out yet and we already did and we it was just well i mean look
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.160]  imagine all these control freaks they go get jobs where they can do this and if people just joined
[56:16.160 --> 56:20.640]  us i want to stay again there's no law you got to answer what type of firearms you own or what
[56:20.640 --> 56:25.680]  stocks and bonds you got or how many people you know uh are in your family just how many live
[56:25.680 --> 56:30.560]  there that's the only question and it's starting to make the news that the feds want this yearly
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.480]  census and they're coming to people's houses and harassing them i'm going to cover that
[56:34.480 --> 56:39.840]  coming up in the next hour anything else shame nope good job thank you sir no good job to you
[56:39.840 --> 56:46.480]  i appreciate your call alexander in new jersey you're on the air hi how's it going good um i just
[56:46.480 --> 56:51.440]  want to thank you for helping to uh get this information out i wish i had more time to speak
[56:51.440 --> 56:56.480]  with you than a quick call i'll go ahead i got alexander higgins vlog pretty sure you're familiar
[56:56.480 --> 57:02.240]  with it you post and you link some of my stuff um the big thing here that that is not being discussed
[57:02.240 --> 57:08.960]  is that this university of berkeley study it actually found that the radiation in the tap water

[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.200]  a blogger in new jersey we have his little report here we've got our little reports on this up on
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:41.840]  info wars dot com uh so does the new york times radiation found in san francisco uh california
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:50.080]  tap water rainwater um the numbers i have uh out of the reports is that it's uh 18
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:59.760]  1800 uh times but uh you were saying that from uh your research uh that it was uh higher levels
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:06.960]  go ahead and make your point alexander no no no well it's 181 times which is which is 18100
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.800]  percent above uh the main point that needs to be stressed is people in california that there's
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.840]  no such thing as a safe dose of of radiation several experts that came forward and said that
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.840]  but the uc the university california and berkeley they're the ones who detected this
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:30.080]  um they also found that the radiation was in the tap water that they took uh three liters
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:36.720]  i mean they they took their sample and they found the radiation in the tap water and i i guess
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.640]  another quick point that i'd make just to hurry up here is that they're they're using uh the eight
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:49.840]  day half life of iodine to help you know calm the worries of the public but in fact that doesn't mean
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:55.200]  that that iodine disappears out of the environment eight days the epa site itself says that it stays
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.880]  in the environment for months the point is is that the reactors continue to blow up and smoke and leak
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:07.120]  so more is always coming and i've seen the food and rug administration and epa going don't worry
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.920]  we expect the numbers to go down but instead three weeks in they're going up just like they're going
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:17.120]  up in japan because there's all sorts of isotopes but most these universities and states don't have
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:24.560]  the devices to pick it up yeah i mean uh berkeley has a very advanced instrument but uh i mean the
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.240]  iodine half life once it's inside of the human body is actually 100 days it's not eight days
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.960]  once it gets in your body like you said before it accumulates and they are detecting other
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:42.000]  isotopes too in the rainwater like uh the cesium and the tellarium and uh and even
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.320]  scarier point is that they're not even mentioning some of these other things in the well this is
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.720]  a good this is a good blog about plutonium yeah this is a good blog you've written you want us
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.760]  to get it up on info wars dot com yeah i mean certainly this needs to get out i mean people
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.640]  need to know that this is in their tap water well i've got the new york times here i've got uh
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.720]  the other local newspapers reporting it as well uh like the base citizen government under fire
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.920]  as radiation found in milken rain but you're right the new york times white washes it and
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.640]  basically says it wasn't found in in tap water but that's where uh berkeley says they got the samples
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.200]  yeah they got the samples from berkeley and it's a blatant lie they say right in their article
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.920]  it's not the drinking water the new york times does but if you look at the university of berkeley's
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:37.280]  study it's right there that they found a diadine in the tap water and on top of that ever since i
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:43.440]  published this post and it started going viral around the internet um they uh the university
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.440]  of berkeley stopped updating their website they were updating like twice yeah i don't know if you
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.160]  were listening three weeks ago but i made the point that as the radiation gets here we would see
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.160]  reports from states and universities but then it would be shut down and suddenly you wouldn't get
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.360]  more info that follows what the system has done in the past and the japanese government did this as
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:07.040]  well so this is certainly fitting into that and notice that the feds aren't issuing any statements
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.200]  on this other than saying don't worry about it none at all i mean it's like there's a gag order
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.400]  and they won't respond to it they won't give you know any levels at all all they can say is that it's
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.920]  below levels of concern that it's safe um and there's plenty of other well you should do another
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.560]  blurb because i've read your article it's accurate another blurb dealing with new york times covers
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:33.280]  up radiation in tap water and kind of recap and send it over to us we'll get that up that's how

[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:39.840]  there's a quasi secret in canada and australia and other british commonwealth and i'm going to
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:46.960]  cover this before the broadcast ends later in the hour twice in the last two years the
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:53.760]  parliament the elected government who then votes for the prime minister in their parliamentary system
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:02.000]  twice they have removed him from office and the queen of england orders the governor general
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:11.040]  to suspend the parliament now they've done it again and this happened on march 26 more than a
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:16.160]  week ago and i didn't learn about it until today when erin dykes posted links to it on info wars
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.920]  dot com that shows how quiet they keep this in fact you read in the times of india their big
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:28.400]  paper canada dissolves parliament election set for may 2nd ottawa that's their capital city
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:34.000]  canada's governor general dissolved parliament on saturday after a vote of no confidence in
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.800]  torrey prime minister steven harper's government setting up a may 2nd election the fourth and seven
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.760]  years from the steps of the official residents of queen elizabeth the second's representative in
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:49.360]  canada harper announced the official launch of the campaign contrasting his conservative
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.720]  economic recovery plan now so they spin it and every time i cover this canadiens call me and they
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.920]  say the queen doesn't run our country really she owns over half your land but every time you don't
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:03.920]  do what she wants she suspends parliament this is the third time now they're actually going to have
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.800]  an election and i've got erin reposting old articles in the last two years where this has happened
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:15.280]  twice it happened in the late 70s in australia you elect the government they don't do what the queen
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:24.640]  wants and she suspends them but you read this article out of the post out of canada and you
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.360]  have to read deep in here that the governor general suspended the parliament parliament to
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.600]  dissolve election in early may government found in contempt a first in canadian history prime
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.280]  minister steven harper will visit governor general today dissolved parliament because he
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:44.240]  doesn't like what they said setting the stage for a federal election early may the harper
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.720]  government and they don't like those they'll just dissolve them again the harper government was
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.440]  defeated in the house of commons doesn't matter he's got the queen and the first time in canadian
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.120]  history that a government has been found in contempt that's not true they did it already twice
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.760]  the liberal motion passed 156 145 but that doesn't matter as opposition parties teamed
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:10.400]  up to topple the conservatives the ranking and campaign for canada's 41st election is expected
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.920]  to begin this morning yeah they had only for about a hundred years they even had a government
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.880]  outside the queen even the puppet government when harper visits the governor general to dissolve
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.960]  parliament which has now happened harper said he was disappointed in the vote and argued that
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:28.560]  canadians would be too he scolded opposition parties for rejecting the government's budget
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.960]  and it goes on so they're supposed to just have a new prime minister because the elected parliament
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:39.200]  votes for him but no no the queen says no amazing pretty much covered it already now
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.720]  let's continue with your calls then i'm going to shift gears out of the
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:50.480]  rainwater 181 times 181 times
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:59.840]  above drinking water standards for radioactive iodine that's what the university of berkeley said
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:04.000]  the state government's admitted attire same thing in washington state the feds are not releasing
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.720]  numbers and uh the caller earlier pointed something out i went through the link it's true
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.000]  since the federal government got involved the university with all these sensors they've got
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.520]  one one of the more advanced in the country is not releasing new numbers this is what i said three
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.160]  weeks ago on air i said if you follow up previous nuclear disasters like three mile island in the
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:32.640]  us chernobyl uh in the former soviet union now ukraine outside Kiev they will go into all the
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.680]  monitoring stations and tell them to shut up sometimes a few will first report it that the
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.240]  radiation is going up then they'll be told to shut up what we see for two weeks in japan
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.720]  and the two states around fukushima the two prefectures the government would have on the news
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:55.280]  websites still collating data they wouldn't release the radiation numbers when they finally did 1600
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:02.320]  10 000 100 000 times safe levels so this is what's going on this is a big deal and it just shows how
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:09.920]  government will cover up and does cover up then i want to get into um what's happening in libya
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:18.160]  but also the un backed rebels uh in ivory coast reportedly killed a thousand people men women
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:24.960]  and children that's part of the globalist liberation and to back up the rebels uh european union
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:31.760]  military has taken over the key airport to help the rebels another humanitarian invasion to help
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:37.520]  the rebels slaughter everybody they really just want the uh oil and gold and the rest of it
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:45.120]  dana in alabama thanks for holding you're on the air hey i was good to talk to you look real quick
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:53.920]  hey uh in friday's usa today the editorial page 12 a the first two sentences say that our senate
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:01.120]  and our house past resolutions authorized in the no fly zone i've been hearing that this is the
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:08.880]  first time our military has been used without any uh talking congress usa today friday says that both
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.760]  30 days ago the senate and the house passed resolutions is that true did i miss it or what
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:21.200]  was called that is absolutely not true ron paul has been all over the news pointing out that they
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:28.400]  didn't even consult congress uh the media hailed it that obama was taking un orders and that is
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:35.840]  that sounds like complete and utter disinformation uh the united nations didn't even consider a
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:43.440]  no fly zone until three weeks ago and it was uh what three thursdays ago so it won't be three weeks
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:50.560]  until this in fact guys to make sure i'm right uh search the uh date of un no fly zone resolution
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.040]  on un and that was a thursday night i think two and a half weeks ago but i want to check that exact
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:02.960]  date uh so that is very bizarre sir uh that you uh who wrote that usa today that's in the first
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:08.880]  two sentences of the editorial on friday i mean who wrote it who's who's the author uh you know
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.840]  it doesn't say this it's the editorial our new heart no i understand the paper yeah sometimes they
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.200]  put out editorials and don't just say it's from the paper i understand so this is speaking as the
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.760]  editorial board um what's the headline i'm gonna look it up right now the headline is in middle east
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.640]  familiar echoes about limits of us power which is 11 by the way that's 11 words i'm not gonna get
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.320]  funny on here but i've been collecting uh these 11s for 10 years i've got a fat notebook and a
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.080]  famous author right now she's not gonna do nothing with it so i can get it back i'm gonna send it

[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:26.080]  bureau that is now announcing they're going to full time send people census forms not just every
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.480]  10 years and demand you answer all sorts of questions that by law you don't have to answer

[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:44.240]  but during the break we looked into it and sure enough it was march 17th uh that was uh two and
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:50.080]  a half weeks ago on a thursday un security council authorizes no fly zone that's fox news
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:56.160]  with no congressional consultation or approval so that us today is incorrect that is very
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:02.720]  bizarre to see that type of disinformation was a mistake or on purpose also we're going to get
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:09.120]  into libya and what's happening on the ivory coast as well big developments there that show
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.960]  the hypocrisy of this new war that we're not supposed to call a war but a kinetic military
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:21.280]  action uh so that is coming up but right now let's go to henry and canada henry thanks for
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:29.520]  holding it on the air hey i work hey henry um i just wanted to talk about some stuff and about
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:37.200]  your show for two minutes so um basically um i'm a senior right now in high school and um
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:43.840]  um since i woke up about um two years ago and became an activist i've noticed like a
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:51.440]  a market change a difference in awareness at my school and um you know you you can talk to people
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:56.800]  and most of them know about false flag terror and all that oh yeah folks don't make fun of you as
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:01.280]  much as they did before because now everybody's talking about financial collapse and dollar
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.240]  devaluation and the federal reserve being the problem yes we've we've done our job you've done
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:12.560]  your job henry exciting things are happening we're able to now actually blame who is responsible
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:19.840]  for what's happening and as things get worse bring them to justice yeah well and um there are
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:27.520]  there's there's still working on some of the uh stuff like governments and in our lives and freedom
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:33.440]  to spank your kids or spit off your front porch or whatever and as you talk to them you do run into
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:39.520]  a lot of um generals are off kind of types from what you know the deadliest game and
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:47.120]  people who are into the whole malthusian worldview but um we put the information out there
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:54.160]  and uh it's it's unstoppable and so they could they could set you up they can beat you up
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.760]  they could even kill you it doesn't matter you'd still be around like uh uh with the failure
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:06.400]  yeah i appreciate your call henry uh yeah what's happening is that the information is bullet proof
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:12.160]  ideas are bullet proof we're all individually flesh and blood but ideas are bullet proof
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:18.640]  josh in hawaii josh welcome hey thank you alex uh how's it i uh just wanted to share a couple
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:25.520]  insights from that i learned from the nineteen uh the answer to 1984 1776 campaign if that's okay
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:31.200]  sure okay um i think you guys are just par excellence at the top of your game when it
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:37.840]  comes to strategic uh you think you're strategic you you have incredible insightful analysis
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.760]  the most amazing guests people are brilliant and it really allows the listeners to have a huge leg
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:51.520]  up uh you know on it's a full spectrum analysis absolutely but the problem is is that and and
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:56.480]  i think that's what henry was trying to say there as far as activism goes that's where it ends if
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:02.000]  people don't uh take that uh information and run with it like i said uh another time if you're
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.080]  hearing this information you're not doing anything about it then you are wrong so uh my my quick
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:13.040]  suggestion is maybe a slight change in tactics because you guys are you guys are just working
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.760]  24 seven completely overburdened and we can't have you burned out and and uh and have health
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:23.360]  issues and all sorts of other stuff we need to leverage the listeners to be able to take this
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.880]  message and run with it on their own and the way that the technology is nowadays that's easier than
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:35.360]  ever before we've already recognized the power of the google bombs um but what i what i think is
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.080]  really important is on the days that you're not doing google bombs we need to do a couple other
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:45.760]  things and i'd like to suggest those right now number one twitter bombs uh you know it's like
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:51.440]  well the law of compounding interest if we have everybody take an article from info wars dot com
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.640]  or prison planet dot com or from twitter dot com forward slash real alec shones and retweet that
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.760]  out absolutely we'll we'll start doing twitter bombs i've meant to do that and and really leverage
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:06.480]  the power of this massive audience to push something out into the uh you know the tweeting
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:12.000]  verse to really reach a lot of people that aren't aware and to show our power what else okay so quick
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.520]  more ideas after that facebook bombs you know we talked about uh creating our own kind of social
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.080]  network i don't think that's necessary we can work with from within the matrix you've got 500
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:27.360]  million users there and so you got to go where the people are at so we can do the same thing
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.120]  through facebook bombs and lastly something called four square which i'm not sure if you know about
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.840]  but i think this is the most exciting uh spot in the new internet as it were because this is
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.280]  essentially making the internet local again and basically the idea here is you know businesses
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.560]  a lot of times can can join up on this thing called four square almost everyone nowadays has
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.680]  a smart phone and literally what they're doing is looking up it pulls up a map and it shows the
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:57.520]  different uh businesses in a given area that are doing a certain thing that you're looking for
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.760]  well you opt in on your phone and then it gives you little alerts and really surveils
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.120]  the daylights out of you uh what do you do uh i mean get people that have businesses that
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.920]  that sell books or expose the new world order or local radio stations that have good talk show host
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:17.840]  or do you fill it with disinformation not no not i would i would go from the route of everyone who
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.360]  the uh a true info warrior say you own an independent coffee shop or a restaurant or a bar
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.080]  or you're a dry cleaner you tell folks that's a place to congregate if you love liberty and
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.200]  want v for victory absolutely absolutely and then the more people that you meet and and you see other
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.880]  people doing the exact same thing with you now all of a sudden you're that much more empowered and
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.440]  you're not alone i think i think that these are some great josh amazing ideas write an article
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.600]  up about it send it to us if it's written well we'll post it at info wars dot com with it's a great
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:52.320]  idea uh good to hear from you uh josh in pennsylvania you're on the air hey alex i actually wanted to
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.520]  talk about a specific article that was written in the guardian um it says how big u.s banks
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.640]  laundered billions from mexico murders drug gangs and if it should because i went on c n n fox is
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.600]  that one every mainstream news article and no one's discussing what wat kovia and well spargo
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:13.520]  did from yeah that was the 360 something billion they even own the aircraft flying the drugs around
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.160]  uh that was in bloomberg actually a few months ago the guardian picked up on it yeah the guardian
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.160]  had that and it's funny because it was only in it was early like real late late last night around
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:28.000]  like 12 31 o'clock yeah i'm going from memory it was 300 and what billion they laundered 373
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.320]  uh point six billion oh it must have got and they pled guilty to this but didn't get in trouble
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.960]  what's the guardian headline we'll put that up right now the guardian headline is how a big u.s
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.480]  bank laundered billions from mexico's murderous drug gangs and didn't get in trouble so how they
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.640]  did not they didn't gotten any trouble at all not at all yeah yeah okay so how a big u.s bank
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.400]  laundered billions from mexico's murderous drug gangs yeah i knew it was 300 something bill
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.600]  months ago there it is how big u.s banks laundered billions from mexico's murderous drug gangs as
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.240]  the violence spread billions of dollars of cartel cash began to seep into the global financial system
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.040]  but a special investigation by the observer reveals how the increasingly frantic warnings of one
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.280]  london whistleblower were ignored well they were warned for 11 years about made-off who started
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.560]  the nasdaq they made drugs illegal just like they made alcohol illegal and prohibition
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:20.400]  and the profits tripled and alcoholism tripled and then when they lost prohibition they made drugs
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:25.200]  cocaine heroin you could buy at the corner story legal so they could ship it in kill their
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.000]  competition use the cops to bust their competition then when you're dumb enough to use it they throw
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.640]  you in a private prison the government ships in the drugs they've been caught over and over again
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.760]  the big banks launder the money even tony montana can tell us that an oliver stone screenplay
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.560]  scarface anything else josh and pa i think i want to talk about with the one thing we also need to

[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:04.480]  promised to cover uh but certainly uh this shows how even weak i am i mean it comes out in
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.880]  bloomberg ap barely picks up what three months ago the 360 something bill at the time they're
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:20.320]  reporting uh now that it's uh 370 plus billion in one u.s bank laundered they even leased the
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:26.880]  aircraft ran the whole op you know just 100 folks 500 billion a year this was over two years
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:33.680]  comes into the u.s in narcotics money that's raw then they sell it for a lot more uh now
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.880]  you think the government doesn't know who's laundering the um the hundreds of billions of
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:45.280]  dollars a year you don't i mean i remember the associated press 15 years ago headline
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:51.520]  federal reserve bank of dallas caught with three billion in drug money they run the drugs okay and
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.400]  this is all admitted so yeah there's a london guardian reporting on its sister paper the observers
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.040]  detailed report how a big u.s bank laundered billions for mexico's murderous drug gangs
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.680]  and it goes on how they covered it up nobody got in trouble yeah you get caught though with a
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:11.120]  marijuana cigarette you're probably going to jail but you ship in hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:19.200]  in schmack and cocaine you are going to be on the presidential's advisory board and if they
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:24.560]  decriminalized it the mexican drug gangs the u.s banks the british government caught running opium
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:30.400]  for hundreds of years it all be over overnight and i've only covered this probably five six times
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:35.760]  since it came out so because the evil's so great i mean it's like six months ago it came out
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:44.400]  you know ap roiders bloomberg broke it okay top insurance company signed secret deals 11 years ago
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:49.600]  with veterans affairs to steal all veterans death benefits they paid into from world war two through
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:55.920]  current wars and the government said yeah we did it we're taking your money no issues no complaints
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:01.680]  no va veterans affairs groups can say anything just the folks they're stealing everything the
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.400]  governments a bunch of drug dealing criminals at the top haven't you figured this out yet
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:11.360]  they've already robbed us many times over we've got to wake up to this they've they've gotten us
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.160]  to sign on to trillions of dollars of foreign debt we don't know it's come out the federal reserve
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.960]  wouldn't tell congress the government the real government the private fed wouldn't tell them
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:26.560]  we're 23.7 trillion went in hearings turns out it went to foreign corporations and banks
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.120]  and their own private bank accounts people at the federal reserve people at the treasury
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.200]  they are criminals just because they got bald heads and wear $3,000 suits and land by private
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:44.160]  helicopter doesn't mean they're not crooks look at bernie madoff and the sec knew for 11 years
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:51.360]  everything he was doing of course they protected him and madoff's come out and said that now from
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.120]  jail he said of course they all knew i was doing it this is how it all operates the whole government's
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:01.680]  apanese scheme it's that was a new york magazine a month ago pull it up we don't make any of this
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.440]  stuff up okay i hear national talk show host that alex jones is a trader he says al qaeda works for
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:13.600]  the government he says the government's laundering drugs it's all admitted it's all over the news
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.600]  that al qaeda is the core the group six weeks ago that started the rebellion against qaddafi and is
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.440]  running it it's in the news again today al qaeda mujahideen the leaders of the rebellion
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.400]  i know what i'm talking about i live in the real world i'm just an average guy but i'm not a coward
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:36.400]  i will tell the truth i will risk my life the globalists don't know what to do because they've
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.400]  tried to assassinate my character they've tried to lie about me they've tried to demonize but if
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.520]  they kill me it underlines everything i've said it highlights what i've said it puts a big exclamation
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:51.440]  point behind it it emblazons everything i've talked about you understand that
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.280]  it's not the whole government it's criminal rogue groups within it but we've got to grow up and have
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.720]  a spine and more and more i'm here in mainline hosts say alex jones is right several big hosts in
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:07.680]  the national last week came out and said alex jones was right about al qaeda being government run
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:12.880]  but not government criminal groups within the government they're like why would the government
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.440]  want to attack itself so it can have a war it's called full spectrum dominance they don't just
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:22.880]  attack the enemy they create the enemy now does the low-level al qaeda grunt know that no they don't
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:28.640]  know that does our low-level grunt in the military know the globalists are controlling both sides
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:33.120]  no but up top they're running the show okay now now i'm really in trouble because we're running
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:39.040]  out of time here and i got all this news to hit josh and pa who brought up uh the uh wells fargo
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:45.600]  hundreds of billions in drug money and running the aircraft and everything uh any other comments
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.960]  yeah i got left with two quick real points one uh one is that people also need to understand that
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:55.760]  yes the radio the radiation and then the the the the signal the physical sickness you can
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.000]  attain for radiation is going to be extremely bad but also the financial uh the financial
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.800]  just devastation this is gonna do to the united states is just unbelievable that's one too the
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.120]  last one i'm gonna make is i i strongly believe i'd love to find out what uh what's the tarp
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.360]  lean if you can after next time i believe that we're strategically planning ourselves around
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:20.160]  northern africa potentially if it comes out to no no the tarp leaves already said that african is
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.680]  in control this is about the full invasion of africa piece by piece uh the french and the e you
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.560]  have invaded the ivory coast and are openly backing the rebels slaughtering men women and
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:36.240]  children an orgy of death to take over the resources and it's in the newspapers london telegraph
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:46.160]  france 24 bbc associated press uh yahoo news i mean it's it's just all admitted thanks i'll
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:51.520]  appreciate it man and keep up the good work thank you i mean what good work i'm just i i've got a brain
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:59.200]  when it's it's very frustrating ladies and gentlemen because i am not into sports i'm not
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.600]  into acting tough i'm not into going to parties i'm not in i'm into reality
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:15.200]  and i remember reading two and a half weeks ago the un resolution to bombard libya to bombard
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:21.680]  muammar qaddafi and it said that he would accept a humanitarian ground force or else
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.640]  and then they massed the troop ships off the coast the last two weeks and the marine corps commander
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.880]  when they left with 2200 marines said we're preparing for ground invasion and then that
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.440]  obama said we will not invade and then now they do this lawyer speak and say well we are getting
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.920]  ready for a ground force and our special forces have been there the whole time along with british
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:45.680]  but we're not going to be we're just going to be supporting the rebels who are the musha hadeen al-qaeda
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.720]  i mean they're they've already have a ground invasion there were ground troops in there
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.360]  before this started they're running it it's all admitted so they say yes we've got ground troops
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.960]  they're running it but we're not going to have a ground force so yeah we got special forces
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.360]  lasing targets all over the ground they were there beforehand they're running the rebels
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:12.160]  but we're not on the ground and this is not a military action this is a kinetic action
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:20.560]  i mean we're entering a orwellian system and you've seen shifting gears the industrial disaster of
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.920]  fukushima and the five of the six reactors going haywire blowing up spewing fuel rods everywhere

[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:13.600]  extinct regular alaskan and and and pacific salmon and i and i and i have on top genetic
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.680]  engineers who were making millions a year at companies but found that potatoes they engineered
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.400]  one case in england and they quit their job or they get fired when they say well yes you can
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.400]  make the potato last longer but it also happens to sterilize people and they say don't worry that's
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:33.600]  what this is all about i mean i read these reports and then they come out with cows that are part

[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.200]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:28.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.600]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.160]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:17.920]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:28.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show we've got a us today editorial from 2009 when the obama
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:34.080]  administration said quote people who criticized us are helping al-qaeda so see you're not allowed
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:40.080]  to criticize them using al-qaeda against qaddafi as the quote part of the force and us and british
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.920]  special forces they're advising him or you're with al-qaeda see if you don't support al-qaeda
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:51.040]  you're with al-qaeda and if you don't support the phony drug war to keep drug prices high
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:58.240]  so the big banks have more money to launder you're evil you see that's how all of this works now
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:03.280]  i've got to really move quick through news now uh here's a natural news story here fda says you
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.800]  have no right to real food unless they give you permission and they've been fighting in court at
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:14.000]  the new gmo salmon they're trying to put on store shelves uh that you not be allowed companies to
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.120]  label that they're not part fish part insect or other mixtures and in response to a lawsuit lawsuit
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.480]  filed by farm to consumer legal defense fund the fda has articulated its belief that there is no
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.640]  such thing as a right to health or to purchase or consume any given food and they have the quotes
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:38.880]  here saying that you're not allowed to know if you've got uh cloned milk that's already out there
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:44.560]  you don't have a right to know if it's genetically modified salmon you have no right the globalist
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.240]  will feed you this garbage and that's just the end of it despite all the major health studies
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.040]  remember all the big fights though over human growth hormone and milk we finally won that
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.720]  we're going to win this as long as we expose it but let's not worry about the real health crises
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.400]  the genetic engineering toxic waste dumping let's put taxes on carbon dioxide coming out of power
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.760]  plants and shut those down you know something that plants breathe uh but back to this report out of
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.680]  the telegraph genetically modified cows produce human milk the scientists have successfully
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.600]  introduced human genes into 300 dairy cows produced milk with the same properties as human breast milk
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.320]  by adding the human genetics to it and they say that uh this is going to help boost the immune
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:30.240]  systems of babies and reduce the risk of infections oh really but all the top genetic
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:35.040]  engineers we've interviewed who've been whistleblowers explain you change one group of genes
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.760]  you can get the effects you want but it randomly changes other genes then they start breeding these
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.920]  cows with other cows and there's a whole bunch of these that have been designed different types
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:49.680]  and then it it totally gets out of the population and now bovine diseases that humans couldn't get
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:55.680]  now we can get them or it can trigger virus or bacterial mutations this is already going on
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:00.160]  with genetically modified plants and the media is like oh it's like crossing two types of sunflowers
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:05.760]  no that's two sunflowers already related through natural hybridization that's not in that's not
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:13.840]  putting a a poisonous fungus into bt corn at 1000 times natural levels so bugs eat it and die
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:19.520]  and then they feed us that corn and honey bees are dying all over the world in some areas over
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:26.320]  80 percent are gone because they will go and eat it and there's german studies on that i mean it goes
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:33.440]  on and on and on and they just wave a magic wand and say gmo corn's fine gmo rice is fine gmo a
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:41.840]  soybeans fine oh we're going to release out in the open goats that are part spider they've got
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:51.920]  so many spider genes their udders create spider webs you cannot make this type of stuff up and
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:51:00.000]  they're just headlong rushing forward headlong saying it's no big deal it's amazing absolutely
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:06.800]  amazing uh here's some of the other news london telegraph ivory coast eight workers find 1000 bodies
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:14.960]  in a major city of du kou hope i'm pronouncing that right and they go on to say charity workers who
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:20.240]  reach the city so it appeared the killings had taken place in a single day shortly after the
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:30.560]  town fell to troops loyal to a la sane otara the man internationally recognized as having one last
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:37.440]  year's presidential election and the man backed by the un force here's another one peacekeepers
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:43.600]  control the airport in an attempt to back up the guy they're reporting is connected to all these
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:49.200]  machete uh murders and machine gunnings that are going on here's another one french coast arrive
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:57.600]  on the ivory coast french forces arrive to take over abad dajan airport and they're there to back
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:05.120]  up the rebel leader who the un says won the election so there you go another uh humanitarian
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:13.920]  event taking place uh there and it's the same thing we see going on with them are kadafi here's
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:20.480]  the wall street journal can't call them al-qaeda x mujahideen help lead libyan rebels and they're
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:24.640]  admitting yeah they are the first groups to attack and they are the leaders of the groups and
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:30.320]  u.s special forces have been arming them for uh more than five weeks uh out of egypt had to get
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:35.680]  that domino falling first because housing mubarak our old ally or the globalist old ally uh wouldn't
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:40.320]  play ball and they're reporting on a stalemate and libya increasingly viewed as a likely outcome
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:47.760]  splitting the country in tube uh meanwhile afghanistan quran burning protest rage on for the third
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:52.480]  day i don't agree with what that preacher did but i have to support his right to do it because if
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:57.760]  you take his free speech on that we all lose our free speech and these people running around burning
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:03.360]  and killing and doing all of this well that's their country but i'll tell you this i think it's wrong
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.080]  and here in the united states people threatening violence if you don't like free speech you need
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.960]  to get out of here okay you have a right to practice your religion here i have a right to
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:17.120]  my political views and religious views and you have a right to say you don't like what that
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:24.640]  preacher did and to protest him but you do not have a right to call for violence okay don't play
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:31.920]  into the hands of this clash of civilizations now at least 20 dead many un workers are reportedly
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:36.800]  dead some of them with their heads chopped off the globalists love this and they bring in groups of
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:42.160]  people to play us off against each other they have multiculturalism while hyping the crises on both
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:49.200]  ends now continuing with the census remember last year we heard a census worker been murdered
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:56.640]  now the police say that um he was found dead with fed etched in his chest and turns out it was uh
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:03.520]  that that that he killed himself but they tried to use that to demonize anybody as a cause celeb
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:09.040]  were sad sad he's dead for anybody that didn't like census workers here's the deal a murderer
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.560]  who's caught with dead bodies doesn't have to incriminate themselves and answer questions
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.960]  under the constitution and federal law you got to answer one question how many people live here
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:23.360]  for your apportionment in the congressional districting how many members of the house of
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.240]  representatives does your state get california has the most texas the second most okay that's what
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:34.000]  it's about now i remember 10 years ago now 11 years ago they said we're going to start yearly
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.600]  census and some businesses some private homes did start getting every year 40 questions 80
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:44.160]  questions 100 questions they have eight different variants on their website how many guns do you
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.320]  owe when do you go to work do you have renters what type of toilet do you have what type of
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:53.840]  light bulbs what are your stocks and bonds folks the fifth amendment they're not allowed to ask
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:58.000]  that so they mail out these letters that have the one question how many live there that's legal
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.040]  to ask with the federal code under it the rest of the questions are a fraud some of you go well
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:08.160]  i only got eight questions you didn't get the long form don't get confused here i always get emails
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:15.040]  going i didn't get 40 questions you learn now here's the chicago tribune census worker won't
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:20.000]  take no for an answer couple says questions too personal threatened with fine if they don't comply
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.480]  and notice how the article says now they're not anti-government the first three requests were
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:29.280]  tolerable a census bureau worker would knock on john and beverly scott's door and ask them to fill
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:36.480]  out an american survey community survey that can have 40 to 80 questions on i should add the mckinley
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:43.760]  park couple would politely decline but as the days pass the visits became more frequent and the
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:48.240]  request more urgent some evenings the door mail would ring at dinner time and then again at 10
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.240]  p.m. at night i'm generally a nice guy i didn't want to shut the door in their her face john scott
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.480]  i said i'm not going to answer your questions she kept saying you've got to you've got to
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:02.720]  i shut the door she kept ringing the doorbell and tapping on the window i saw a case where
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:05.680]  people didn't let him in so they called a swat team and killed him you see that last year
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:09.600]  well they showed them huh didn't they land the free home of the brave didn't have to answer the
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:14.960]  swat team guys questions but we're gonna kill you it isn't the scott's or anti-government oh no
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:21.360]  or philosophically oppose the census the couple filled out their uh tenure form last year answering
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:28.480]  every question but they're not too keen on the american community survey a more in-depth ongoing
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:36.640]  questionnaire oh it's ongoing it's not every 10 years it's ongoing the census bureau conducts to
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:41.920]  compile information on area demographics consumer patterns and economic issues yeah answer all their
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.880]  questions how many guns you got on some of the questionnaires how many toilets uh how many stocks
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:50.640]  and bonds what are they when do you go to work in the morning does your wife work do you work
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:57.280]  anybody got mentally mental issues here they all the cops can't ask you this you have a fifth amendment
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:03.760]  but they don't care they're training you to let the tsa put their hands on your little kids at
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:07.120]  the airport and put their hands down their pants they're training you to have tsa checkpoints on
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:12.720]  the highways now they're training you to have your doctor asking you questions and spying on you many
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.120]  i'm recruited by homeland security the pastors under clergy response teams look up these terms
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.680]  over 50 000 preachers recruited spying on their on their flock this is right out of red dawn
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:29.280]  this is going on everywhere and now they're getting more and more harassing more and more
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:35.600]  in their face threatening them with jail or fines when there is no law there is no authorization
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:41.680]  to do any of this and it's absolutely outrageous you have a fifth amendment but they're setting
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:46.640]  the precedent where you fill out monthly forms not just yearly they're now saying monthly are
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.280]  coming see you back tomorrow 11 a.m in full wars dot com
