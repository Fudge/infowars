[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:43.000]  It only happens to me every couple years. I go to sleep, in a deep sleep, face down, and wake up with one of my eyes open, stuck to the pillow.
[00:43.000 --> 00:52.000]  You ever done that? Right over here, this eye is just blasted out, big cut on the side. Had a doctor look at it, they said it should be fine.
[00:52.000 --> 01:01.000]  But let's just say this, if I see a little bummed out on here, it's not because we're the number one news story in the country and they're trying to shut us down.
[01:01.000 --> 01:20.000]  It comes me out, but there is a little bit of pain going on over here in the eye, so that may actually make me settle down a little bit today and actually be a little bit more congruent than I can be sometimes.
[01:20.000 --> 01:33.000]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, and then Mike Adams produces every week, usually on about a Friday, a one hour special called counterthink.
[01:33.000 --> 01:43.000]  Counterthought to the establishment, that's very informative, and then we're not live until 8am the next day when David Knight comes on with the real news.
[01:43.000 --> 01:56.000]  We're going to do a couple hours live tonight, just an exercise of free speech on the state of the internet and really where the planet is right now in relation to the mark of the beast.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  That's really what it is.
[01:58.000 --> 02:15.000]  And we're going to talk to Mike Cernovich and some other folks that are also going to be not just on the Info Wars platform, but streaming on their own platforms from their own studios, their own broadcast that we'll just be interfacing with, just to give people an example of how this
[02:15.000 --> 02:30.000]  de-platforming operation works. So it's a little legal test that we're doing just to illustrate to people what the real plan is here. Info Wars is being watched obviously extremely closely right now.
[02:30.000 --> 02:45.000]  Tucker Carlson's weighed in, Senator Ted Cruz has weighed in supporting Info Wars, and pointing out that there's a test case going to de-platform us off the internet to set the precedent to do it to conservatives and nationalists and whoever else the establishment wants to
[02:45.000 --> 02:54.000]  muzzle into the future. So that is all coming up during the broadcast as well.
[02:54.000 --> 03:09.000]  Now, regular listeners know that we've been spot on about what was going to happen when it was going to happen with the globalists because we read the trade publications.
[03:09.000 --> 03:24.000]  They are really upset at how influential we are. They're very, very upset about how accurate we are. They're really upset that government agencies, not just here, but around the world are increasingly tuning in and that it's
[03:24.000 --> 03:47.000]  decompartmentalizing their global plan. So I'm going to do my best today to just go 35,000 foot view because I tend to get on air and then I just say, let me prove it all to you and I show you each and every little factoid and tie it all together.
[03:47.000 --> 04:06.000]  We've done that. We'll do that later in the broadcast. I think it's important just to lay out the big picture here and what we're facing. Now, that said, they're making their move, not just against Info Wars but against everybody.
[04:06.000 --> 04:21.000]  And it's not just ahead of the midterms. It's a global crackdown on free speech. And they're very brazen about who's helping them do it, who's on showing. And it's so historical. History is happening now.
[04:21.000 --> 04:42.000]  History is outrageous tyranny. It's extremely naked. And it operates like you're completely unconscious and aren't consciously looking at what's happening. There's no logical 2 plus 2 equals 4 to any of it.
[04:42.000 --> 05:00.000]  It's just unbelievable how naked it is. I mean, it's really stunningly ridiculous. So we're going to break it all down straight ahead. I cannot stress enough to all of you out there how critical word of mouth is in this information war.
[05:12.000 --> 05:26.000]  We're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system. The pro pure whole house water filtration system is an advanced four stage compact filtration system that will provide water filtration for your entire home.
[05:26.000 --> 05:39.000]  Removing 220 plus contaminants from your water. It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[05:39.000 --> 05:46.000]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[05:46.000 --> 06:01.000]  Head to infowarstore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current run down systems, it's time to go big and go home with the pro pure whole house filtration system today.
[06:01.000 --> 06:11.000]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report.
[06:11.000 --> 06:22.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:22.000 --> 06:33.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[06:33.000 --> 06:46.000]  The United States of America and hundreds of other nations are now locked in a struggle against multinational corporations backed up by the communist Chinese and the elites that own Hollywood.
[06:46.000 --> 07:09.000]  They're attempting to dominate humanity and bring in an anti human world government where normal human processes are taken control of and then artificiality is then enforced to set up a new paradigm of complete and total synthetic corporate technological scientific elite military
[07:09.000 --> 07:25.000]  industrial complex elite control. The brave new world is here. It is the establishment plan. And we are here simply trying to ring the alarm bell and expose it because the information is so on target about the globalist program because it's from their own admissions.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  They were so arrogant they bragged about for decades.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  They're scared of this broadcast and they want it shut down.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  They're obsessed with knocking it out.
[07:39.000 --> 07:52.000]  And they want to set the precedent to be able to shut everyone else down. It's also the fact that we have a spirit of fighting back.
[07:52.000 --> 08:01.000]  And we have a spirit of victory that those that wish to break the will of free peoples everywhere hate info wars.
[08:01.000 --> 08:19.000]  If you looked at the amount of demonization attacks on info wars in the last 23 years, it starts out a trickle and then just exponentially goes up by 2016 and then goes into stratospheric straight up convulsions in the last six months.
[08:19.000 --> 08:31.000]  And now tens of thousands of articles, news programs, local shows, fake letters to the editor.
[08:31.000 --> 08:48.000]  The entire leftist deep state the entire foundation combine is launching attacks on info wars, the likes of which you only see before the country is tricked into invading some third world country.
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  It's war level propaganda.
[08:52.000 --> 09:00.000]  But see, info wars has been chosen as the test case for everybody else's speech to be taken.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  And we've worked really hard.
[09:02.000 --> 09:13.000]  The listeners have pushed really hard to get information into Congress's hands.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  And Congress has now seen the reports that we and others have put together detailing all of this.
[09:19.000 --> 09:38.000]  So we have a real fighting chance to get them educated about algorithms and shadow bands and community guidelines that are really run by the Southern Poverty Law Center where they can say very, very subjectively just up to them what they say is offensive and what isn't.
[09:38.000 --> 09:47.000]  And then the key is misrepresent what you said or done and not even show what you say or do that they claim is wrong.
[09:47.000 --> 10:00.000]  I mean, clearly you're covering the First Amendment already, but then they misrepresent what you say, remove it and then never show you what it is you supposedly said.
[10:00.000 --> 10:11.000]  Over 10,000 articles in the last four days in a Google search with the headline Alex Jones bullying Alex Jones child endangerment.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  They never tell you what it is.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  They never tell you what I did.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  They never have a police report.
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  They don't have a screenshot.
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.000]  Nothing.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  Now the first day they did Forbes and others said that in a video, I push a child to the ground.
[10:27.000 --> 10:36.000]  No, it was video from ABC News a month and 15 days ago in early June.
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  When a 10 year old the police have been called but they're not there yet is beating up adults and punching people in the face.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  He starts punching one adult four times in the face.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  The adult pushes him to the ground.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  We showed that video.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  It was national news.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  Thousands of other publications and groups did.
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  They then misrepresented it to say Jones needs to be completely banned.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  YouTube and Facebook have only banned him live streaming and blocked his pages.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  That's not enough.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  We cannot.
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  I will not though show you the video.
[11:12.000 --> 11:21.000]  Because even on other streaming services we're using the Southern Private Law Center has been signed up as judge, jury and executioner and they will go to the same fraud again.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  I've been on the phone with lawyers.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  They're forcing me to sue them to sue Time Warner.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  They've got me fighting their other fake suits.
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  But it has to be done.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  This is all of our fights.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  This is for the First Amendment because they don't just censor you.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  They lie about you when they do it.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  We posted on infowars.com the videos on our own servers.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  If you want to go see them.
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  But now the New York Daily News, the New York Times, the Washington Post are celebrating.
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  Facebook and YouTube said yesterday, okay, we're set to totally ban Jones forever off our platforms.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  They just had to act like they didn't do process first.
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  That's all this is.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Because Americans still believe in the First Amendment.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  So it's got to be, oh, he beat up a kid.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  Oh, okay.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  But imagine when a jury sees that.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  What Forbes and others said, I beat up a kid and it's not true, and then I show the jury all the other publications that ran the video.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  And that they're allowed to have it up, but I can't.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  See?
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  And that CNN and all of you knowingly lie about it to your viewers.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  What, what, what venom?
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  What evil?
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  But it's like they do lying about WMDs in a country and they go kill a couple million innocent people.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  Our military just has to do the fighting.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  They do the lying.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  So that's what they do.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how they kill the truth.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  That's how they murder it.
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  But beyond info wars, they're getting ready to make their big move.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  It's a very small part of what we do streaming on YouTube or Facebook.
[12:58.000 --> 13:07.000]  But they want the precedent for all the thousands of other channels that grab clips of the show and do things that that's not allowed period to set that precedent.
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  Just like they shadow banned a bunch of members of Congress last week where they couldn't even, no one could see their tweets.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  They could tweet, but it went into a black hole.
[13:16.000 --> 13:26.000]  Just like they've done to all these members of Congress running again and they're not allowed to put their campaign ads up on their Facebook or Twitter or YouTube, but the Democrats all can.
[13:26.000 --> 13:37.000]  There are now criminal Federal Elections Commission investigations launched by Nunes and others into this and it is criminal, just as the president said on Thursday.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  He said this shadow banning is discriminatory and it's illegal.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  We've got a lot of complaints.
[13:43.000 --> 13:55.000]  We're looking into it and we've got reports just like Nunes has come out and said, we've got a report detailing how all this banning works that I got to a week and a half before.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  Mike Adams report that I commissioned.
[13:58.000 --> 14:16.000]  And then right in live time, they went from 90% banning the conservative Republicans in Congress to total shadow ban where they went for having thousands of retweets already constricted 89% to zero, zero.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  We're talking maybe five tweets because only their office could see it.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Perfect timing.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  We got on the report.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  The next week they had the hearings, said ban conservatives off the web, told a bunch of lies.
[14:29.000 --> 14:37.000]  And then the next day they went to 100% shadow ban of hundreds of members of Congress.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  Here's chairman of the committee talking about it.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  Here's Chairman Nunes.
[14:43.000 --> 14:59.000]  And then you had a report that came out where in fact there were four people in the House of Representatives and the only four politicians in the country, the elected officials that were being quote unquote, well, they don't call it shadow banning, but effectively we were getting caught up in some type of trap to where people couldn't see our Twitter feed.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  That was Mr. Gates, Mr. Meadows, Mr. Jordan and myself.
[15:04.000 --> 15:15.000]  So I don't know what Twitter's up to. It sure looks to me like they're censoring people and they ought to stop it and we're looking at any legal remedies that we can go through.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  Now, why do they want in full war shutdown?
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  Because nine times out of 10, and by the way, I don't say that with pleasure, because I don't want to be the only one that gets it, won't Matt Drudge.
[15:25.000 --> 15:34.000]  We're the first people to report it. We push it for months. I explain to audience, hey, sometimes I repeat stuff over and over again because it's not even for you.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  It's to finally get through to Congress and others to get what's happening.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  And now we've gone from the president not knowing he's been a shadow ban for years on Twitter.
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.000]  You're like, well, he still has hundreds of thousands. That's who go to his page. He should be getting hundreds of millions.
[15:48.000 --> 15:59.000]  So now he knows about it. Nunes knows about it. We trigger the debate. And that's why they're trying to totally ban us off the Internet, because they're tired of us being the one that raised the alarm.
[15:59.000 --> 16:06.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we haven't in full war's life. It'd take hours.
[16:06.000 --> 16:16.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida. It's back in stock.
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  It's a real red pill. It's been sold out for months. It's got the preglinone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids. So you can upload it.
[16:26.000 --> 16:35.000]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[16:35.000 --> 16:43.000]  That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[16:43.000 --> 16:52.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.000]  It's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[16:58.000 --> 17:05.000]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.000]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now. I remember back when info wars and prison planet.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  It was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the page on my dial up into there.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of survival shield.
[17:27.000 --> 17:35.000]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX body. It's all amazing.
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  Thank you, brother.
[17:36.000 --> 17:44.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.000]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there.
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  Okay, 1770s Peace World War.
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  Head to infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  And that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[19:06.000 --> 19:12.000]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[19:12.000 --> 19:22.000]  25, 50, 100, 250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists
[19:22.000 --> 19:51.000]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[19:52.000 --> 20:02.000]  Head to infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:02.000 --> 20:28.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  All right, Alex Jones here back live. I want to get to all the other big news that we haven't gotten to the last few days
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  because I've been focused on the full out assault on the First Amendment.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  We're going to be looking at all of that.
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  The websites are newswors.com, infowors.com, prisonplanted.com.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  Those are more important than ever because the globalists tried to take the internet over the last 10 years
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  with social media and these big giant sites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[20:57.000 --> 21:05.000]  Everybody build up these big systems on there and to advertise and to push our big audiences off TV, talk radio,
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  billions of people advertise in local papers and local TV to promote their Facebook pages.
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  They got the power of billions of people to build their combines.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  But now they're rolling it up.
[21:22.000 --> 21:29.000]  They're just doing it to Christians or conservatives or libertarians. They're just 100% banning us ahead of the elections in the midterms.
[21:29.000 --> 21:37.000]  They're doing it to bans, hip hop, rock and roll, people that aren't part of the big labels, Christian groups,
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  anything successful that they don't control, they won't even let you buy advertising for now on many of these platforms.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  Because the big corporations have weighed in and said, listen, just like how the record companies created a monopoly the last 50 years,
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  they want one on all information.
[21:58.000 --> 22:06.000]  And so YouTube is becoming Hollywood Tube. Google is becoming Be Evil.
[22:06.000 --> 22:17.000]  Twitter. Jack Dorsey at CEO said six months ago, we will crush conservatives.
[22:17.000 --> 22:23.000]  We will win the midterms. We will crush them. We will isolate them. We will block them. We will stop them.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  He didn't say we're going to stop hate speech. We're going to, you know, all their cover stories.
[22:27.000 --> 22:38.000]  He said we're going to crush conservatism. We're going to absolutely shut it off and humiliate it and not let them communicate and break their will.
[22:38.000 --> 22:44.000]  Well, guess what? That hasn't happened yet. People understand what's happening.
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  But then they're going after drugs with the Federal Elections Commission. They're going after us.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  They're going after World Dead Daily. They're going after Fox News with internal battles trying to take it over.
[22:53.000 --> 22:59.000]  The globalists are going after anything that's pro-America, anything that's free market.
[22:59.000 --> 23:05.000]  So that's why I'm talking about this so much is because it's about the midterms and it's about the future of the country.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  And it's about their attempt to impeach Trump. And it's about their attempt.
[23:08.000 --> 23:15.000]  Once they get us kicked off Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and all the rest of it, they admit they're going after everybody's servers.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  They're going after their credit card providers. They're going after their merchants.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  That's why I call it the mark of the beast, even if you don't believe in God and the devil.
[23:25.000 --> 23:33.000]  If you read Revelation, a world government with a mark on the hand, the forehead where you can't buy or sell unless you serve this world system
[23:33.000 --> 23:42.000]  and a one world religion that's anti-family, anti-God, with big giant talking machines standing so the beast can talk worldwide
[23:42.000 --> 23:49.000]  in these huge temples it describes with these hundred foot tall images of the beast and everyone can see him.
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  It's a hologram. I mean, somebody was time traveling. Somebody got revelation from God.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  Whether you believe it or not, it's manifesting.
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  A world planetary government and it's anti-God, it's anti-family, it's targeting children.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  They just caught that top cardinal in the U.S. had to step down for pedophilia.
[24:13.000 --> 24:20.000]  The top cardinal in Australia had to step down. I mean, it's every week, but it barely gets coverage.
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  And again, it's a global pedophile ring.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  It's not a global Catholic ring or a global Hollywood ring or a global, it's a global pedophile ring.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  And what do they want, the innocence of the children?
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  Reuters, U.S. cardinal steps down and made mushrooming sex abuse scandal.
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  What did we tell you was going to happen when Trump got in?
[24:42.000 --> 24:49.000]  There is a eight-fold, according to the uniform crime statistics put up with the FBI just last month,
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  an eight-fold in arrest and indictment of pedophiles.
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  But the courts are just now jam-packed and it's not just pedophiles with some child porn on their computer.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  It's people with little kids in cages.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  And then it gets shut down in the news.
[25:08.000 --> 25:15.000]  But from Australia to Russia to Germany to Mexico to the U.S. to Chile to South Africa to Nigeria,
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  they are rolling these gangs up.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  And you go, why is it pedophiles?
[25:19.000 --> 25:27.000]  Because if you'll rape kids, you'll do anything.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  And you notice there's 400,000 signatures.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  Last time I checked, let's see what it is now for James Gunn,
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  who made thousands of jokes about raping little girls and little boys
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  and how much he enjoyed doing it and how, you know, leave Namble alone.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  And then as much people came out and defended him and said, let kids love.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  Let them have free will.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  Let them do what they want.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  That's actual Namble.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  Speak.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  And the whole, okay, yeah, yeah, so it's 332,000.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  I guess there's another one with a couple hundred thousand.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  They want 500,000 signatures.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  And look, it's going up.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  Our petition has 50,000 signatures at change.org to save the Internet
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  and stop shadow banning.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  They want 500,000 to deliver to Trump to say, let this pedo apologist get his job back.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  Wow.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  Unbelievable.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  He looks just like the subway founder, doesn't he?
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  They got the look.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  It's a look.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  And it's also their own words and their own actions.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  So it's just like Christ is being tried by Pilate.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  And Pilate says, I find no guilt in this man.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  Find no sin in him.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  And he says, it's the Jewish holy day.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  You're allowed to have one person go free who's scheduled to be executed.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  I suggest that be Jesus Christ.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  And they said, who else is there that's going to be executed?
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  There's only one more man, a rapist, a killer, a thief,
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  one of the most hated people in Jerusalem named Barabbas.
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.000]  And they began to how, give us Barabbas.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  And I'm not comparing Trump to Christ or anything,
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  but the economy's turning around 4%, 4.1, trying to do good things,
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  trying to be positive, being lied about, being demonized.
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  And they want him dead.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  They want his family dead.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  They want him full wars destroyed.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  They say, no, no, no, we don't want what's good.
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  They say, give us James Gunn.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  Give us Barabbas.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  So it's America's judgment.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  It's America's choice.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  But worldwide, China has a system that's going worldwide
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  of a digital social score for everything you do,
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  even outside the internet, where if you're not a good little communist,
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  you get demoted, then you can't even have a job,
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  then you can't even get food, you can't travel, you starved to death.
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  We first reported it five years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  That is the model coming in, being phased in.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  And they think Congressman Nunes and Congressman Cruz
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  and Congressman Jordan and Congressman Gates
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  and Congressman Senator Paul are stupid, and they're not.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  And I'm not.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  And now finally the balls rolling where people get,
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  this isn't old fashioned censorship.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  This isn't leftist doing it here and there.
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  This is full, kilt, maximum total control.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  And if we let them get away with it, we deserve what happens to us.
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  So when we come back, I'm going to get into why they hate Trump,
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  why they hate Info Wars, and how we defeat these globalists,
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  and how we take it to the next level.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  But whatever you do, download the free app.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  It's the new official app at infowars.com.

[30:24.480 --> 30:27.920]  We are the info war.
[30:27.920 --> 30:31.320]  Because of their intensive censorship it's more important than ever that everyone go to
[30:31.320 --> 30:36.560]  infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the sensors
[30:36.560 --> 30:42.160]  can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel.
[30:42.160 --> 30:47.660]  So now I ask you more than ever to share the info wars.com articles, to share the videos,

[30:50.960 --> 30:57.120]  is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.240]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[31:00.240 --> 31:04.600]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[31:04.600 --> 31:09.320]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.320 --> 31:10.840]  to detoxify the body.
[31:10.840 --> 31:15.680]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.680 --> 31:20.880]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[31:20.880 --> 31:23.960]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[31:23.960 --> 31:26.240]  It is a classical 360 win.
[31:26.240 --> 31:30.720]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[31:30.720 --> 31:35.400]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.400 --> 31:36.400]  get.
[31:36.400 --> 31:39.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[31:39.600 --> 31:44.640]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you

[33:13.600 --> 33:18.680]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[33:18.680 --> 33:40.680]  This is Alex Jones.
[33:40.680 --> 33:41.680]  We're back live.
[33:41.680 --> 33:43.680]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[33:43.680 --> 33:48.680]  So, the globalist worldwide are launching attacks on free speech.
[33:48.680 --> 33:56.400]  Remember three years ago, reporting on former head members of the East German secret police
[33:56.400 --> 34:01.280]  who were involved in the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of people being hired
[34:01.280 --> 34:10.720]  to work for Facebook to flag political incorrectness and then give it to the German police to arrest
[34:10.720 --> 34:14.760]  and indict people that were critical of radical Islam.
[34:14.760 --> 34:18.480]  And now the reports pour in daily of hundreds of arrests in Germany.
[34:18.480 --> 34:24.160]  I mean, if you just say radical Islam is not compatible, you are arrested.
[34:24.160 --> 34:28.480]  And so, you see the headlines, Jones's YouTube and Facebook blocked from live streaming may
[34:28.480 --> 34:40.560]  be banned because Jones has been found guilty by YouTube and Facebook of hate speech.
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.440]  Hate speech is just an old Soviet Union term they use for people they want to arrest.
[34:45.440 --> 34:47.520]  It's not a law.
[34:47.520 --> 34:49.040]  It's here in America now.
[34:49.040 --> 34:50.520]  It's a chilling effect.
[34:50.520 --> 34:53.680]  Shut your mouth.
[34:53.680 --> 35:04.680]  So, I'm going to get to more of that here in a moment, but this is how the death of logic
[35:04.680 --> 35:05.680]  works.
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.320]  I'm going to give you two examples of the death of logic here in just a moment.
[35:10.320 --> 35:13.560]  First off, let me introduce the exhibits.
[35:13.560 --> 35:20.440]  Here's one out of the Austin American statesman, other failed establishment newspaper that
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.800]  now is just a pure disrupter.
[35:23.800 --> 35:29.160]  City report on Confederate monuments raises idea of renaming Austin.
[35:29.160 --> 35:32.400]  Now, that's their politically correct way of letting that out.
[35:32.400 --> 35:38.240]  You actually read it, it says they recommend, because it's named after Stephen F. Austin,
[35:38.240 --> 35:40.600]  let the city be renamed.
[35:40.600 --> 35:44.720]  See, because that's why this works.
[35:44.720 --> 35:50.000]  Once you get rid of one statue, then you can get rid of everything.
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.920]  Remember Trump said, well, if you want to get rid of any monument of anybody that ever
[35:54.920 --> 35:59.480]  was involved in slavery, you have to get, take down George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[35:59.480 --> 36:00.880]  They went, oh, you're a crazy cook.
[36:00.880 --> 36:06.080]  And then one week later, the Democrats officially said, get rid of the American flag and get
[36:06.080 --> 36:08.920]  rid of George Washington and rename Washington DC.
[36:08.920 --> 36:11.240]  You're like, well, that'll never happen.
[36:11.240 --> 36:13.440]  Now, now, now think of the mental illness.
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.240]  It was Europe and England that first started getting rid of slavery.
[36:17.240 --> 36:18.800]  Then the United States came along.
[36:18.800 --> 36:22.600]  They still have slavery in three African countries right now.
[36:22.600 --> 36:25.000]  Six Islamic countries still have it.
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.800]  But they sell women in the sex slavery in Libya and Sudan and other countries right
[36:29.800 --> 36:30.800]  now.
[36:30.800 --> 36:31.800]  No one covers it.
[36:31.800 --> 36:33.040]  No one cares.
[36:33.040 --> 36:34.040]  We've covered it.
[36:34.040 --> 36:35.040]  I think it's incredible.
[36:35.040 --> 36:44.240]  Al Jazeera's reported, BBC has, there's been a few articles, but it's like it's going on
[36:44.240 --> 36:50.040]  because under radical Islam, Wahhabism, black people are not fully human.
[36:50.040 --> 36:54.840]  That's actually where they got that thing in the early voting rights and two thirds human
[36:54.840 --> 36:55.840]  and all that.
[36:55.840 --> 36:56.840]  That actually came from the Muslims.
[36:56.840 --> 36:59.280]  And I'm not here bashing the Muslims, man.
[36:59.280 --> 37:08.920]  But if we're going to rename Austin or rename Washington DC, well, baby, let's rename Africa.
[37:08.920 --> 37:11.080]  Let's rename Asia.
[37:11.080 --> 37:17.440]  The Bible, the Old Testament has free and bond because that's what happened.
[37:17.440 --> 37:20.840]  Most the white people that came to this country came here as indentured servants on seven
[37:20.840 --> 37:25.560]  or 10 year terms who were signed on with no rights could be chained up if they tried to
[37:25.560 --> 37:26.560]  run away.
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.440]  No one's defending that institution.
[37:29.440 --> 37:35.040]  But the idea that you can sit there with every junior high and high school student go, we're
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.440]  not going to teach you about anything in history, but how America had slaves, okay, yeah, 2%
[37:39.440 --> 37:40.440]  had slaves or whatever.
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.680]  And then we're going to harp on that all day and not talk about how we got rid of it.
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.120]  It's just that issue, total mental illness.
[37:49.120 --> 37:58.120]  And then, oh, Santa Anna, who was a dictator, had all these people called peons in forced
[37:58.120 --> 38:00.080]  labor, but they didn't call them slaves.
[38:00.080 --> 38:05.600]  So then his moral authority was claiming, oh, well, the South was expanding into Texas
[38:05.600 --> 38:07.800]  and there might be some slaves brought in.
[38:07.800 --> 38:10.680]  And so that was his excuse to invade had nothing to do with it.
[38:10.680 --> 38:12.260]  And so it became this whole debate.
[38:12.260 --> 38:16.760]  And then today, if you're in college or you're in high school, all they teach you is Texas
[38:16.760 --> 38:23.080]  is bad because they didn't want to ban slavery in 1836.
[38:23.080 --> 38:28.560]  And so that's the one little piece of history that's there, nothing else.
[38:28.560 --> 38:30.240]  But that's not even the issue.
[38:30.240 --> 38:37.320]  China sells political dissidents organs, Buddhist and Christians by the millions.
[38:37.320 --> 38:39.880]  There's no discussion of the Chinese Communist.
[38:39.880 --> 38:43.640]  There's no discussion of the millions that are in slave camps.
[38:43.640 --> 38:45.000]  There's no discussion of any of it.
[38:45.000 --> 38:55.280]  It's all just some dude named Stephen F. Austin.
[38:55.280 --> 38:56.560]  And let's look at slavery.
[38:56.560 --> 38:58.480]  So let's ban the name Austin.
[38:58.480 --> 39:02.240]  It's about being able to take control of everything.
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.080]  And this is what the chai comms, who are the biggest funders of Hollywood and the media
[39:07.080 --> 39:10.280]  are pushing when you tune into any Hollywood program.
[39:10.280 --> 39:12.520]  And whites are told, you're inherently evil.
[39:12.520 --> 39:13.680]  You're inherently bad.
[39:13.680 --> 39:16.000]  You have inherent guilt.
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.520]  Even though 2% of the South, not even the North, had slaves, 2%.
[39:23.520 --> 39:31.520]  And so how many people are descendants of 2% of people that were in the South before 1868?
[39:31.520 --> 39:32.520]  They've done the numbers.
[39:32.520 --> 39:33.520]  It's very small.
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.880]  But then let's expand further.
[39:37.880 --> 39:41.020]  Most people came here after the 1880s.
[39:41.020 --> 39:42.840]  They have no connection to slavery.
[39:42.840 --> 39:48.000]  So in what world is that going on?
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.720]  But see, poor white Europeans who had just been serfs and who had just been freed off
[39:51.720 --> 39:58.560]  the lands, the same thing, serf means slave, they picked it up on the East Coast when they
[39:58.560 --> 39:59.560]  came in.
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.560]  And I'm not bashing them.
[40:00.560 --> 40:02.240]  They were very tribal people.
[40:02.240 --> 40:05.640]  They finally got to be one caste above somebody.
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.600]  So all the black slaves run to the North, which big problems in the South.
[40:10.600 --> 40:16.400]  And it gets even worse in the North because people have never even seen black people.
[40:16.400 --> 40:18.600]  And they've just been slaves on their land.
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.120]  And they get told by race baiters, Democratic Party mainly on the East Coast, you're finally
[40:23.120 --> 40:24.560]  above somebody.
[40:24.560 --> 40:27.440]  You don't have any rights, but at least you're better than these people.
[40:27.440 --> 40:31.280]  And that's where the Democrats come from with their race baiting and their control.
[40:31.280 --> 40:32.280]  And it's the same trick.
[40:32.280 --> 40:39.160]  And it worked great in Chicago and New York and Boston and all these other big East Coast
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.960]  and second city areas.
[40:41.960 --> 40:46.520]  And that's the whole Democratic Party ethos of control.
[40:46.520 --> 40:48.080]  That's how they manipulate.
[40:48.080 --> 40:50.080]  That's how they dominate.
[40:50.080 --> 40:53.560]  That's how they play groups off against each other.
[40:53.560 --> 40:55.960]  Instead of as an American, we all have these basic rights.
[40:55.960 --> 40:57.680]  We all work together for these rights.
[40:57.680 --> 41:01.160]  And this system all makes us more wealthy, more successful and more happy.
[41:01.160 --> 41:07.160]  We go to a caste system yet again, where everything is race based and on what color
[41:07.160 --> 41:12.120]  you are and where you came from or blah, blah, blah, what group you're in, rather than
[41:12.120 --> 41:18.520]  what Martin Luther King talked about, what you do, what you stand for, what you produce.
[41:18.520 --> 41:20.520]  Because isn't that really the system?
[41:20.520 --> 41:25.000]  What we all want to be based on is how good at accounting are you?
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.280]  How honorable are you?
[41:26.280 --> 41:28.560]  How good at farming are you?
[41:28.560 --> 41:30.000]  How good at teaching are you?
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.560]  How good at football are you?
[41:31.560 --> 41:33.080]  How good of a doctor are you?
[41:33.080 --> 41:36.200]  If somebody's got the top ratings and is cool and great, I don't care if they're a black
[41:36.200 --> 41:40.800]  doctor or a white doctor, I want who people told me is the best and who treats me like
[41:40.800 --> 41:46.200]  a good person when I come talk to them.
[41:46.200 --> 41:47.640]  I don't care what color you are.
[41:47.640 --> 41:52.080]  If you've got nice food and you make me feel welcome, I'm going to eat in your restaurant.
[41:52.080 --> 41:54.880]  That's what Martin Luther King talked about.
[41:54.880 --> 41:58.960]  The opposite of what the Democratic Party pushes, but they think you're stupid.
[41:58.960 --> 42:00.160]  They think you're tribal.
[42:00.160 --> 42:01.240]  They think you're dumb.
[42:01.240 --> 42:02.240]  So there you go.
[42:02.240 --> 42:10.080]  The city of Austin recommends, the people we've elected, these virtue signalers, they
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.760]  recommend renaming the city something else.
[42:14.760 --> 42:22.040]  Well, since this is all part of fantasy land, why don't we rename it George Soros?
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.160]  He's a good Nazi collaborator, but he's worshiped by the left.
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.000]  He actually helped round people up for the Nazis, but he's worshiped by everybody.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.880]  So let's rename Austin Soros City.
[42:32.880 --> 42:38.640]  It'll be perfect, Soros City, Soros City.
[42:38.640 --> 42:46.080]  You see, because, forget Stephen F. Austin, he came here, braved the dictator, set something
[42:46.080 --> 42:51.760]  up, an economic system so much more free, 200 and something years later, everybody wants
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.440]  to come here, or 190 years or whatever.
[42:56.440 --> 42:57.440]  See how that works?
[42:57.440 --> 42:59.480]  We'll be back.
[42:59.480 --> 43:03.360]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[43:03.360 --> 43:07.880]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.280]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:13.280 --> 43:18.680]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[43:18.680 --> 43:20.240]  to unhealthy levels.
[43:20.240 --> 43:26.760]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:26.760 --> 43:30.760]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[43:30.760 --> 43:32.240]  in the rainwater.
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.480]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[43:37.480 --> 43:43.560]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.560 --> 43:49.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.520]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.520 --> 43:59.160]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.160 --> 44:05.520]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[44:05.520 --> 44:11.920]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[44:11.920 --> 44:19.160]  or videos or other material from infoorstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[44:19.160 --> 44:21.360]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[44:21.360 --> 44:25.040]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infoorstore.com.
[44:25.040 --> 44:28.760]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[44:28.760 --> 44:33.920]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for
[44:33.920 --> 44:34.920]  children and adults.
[44:34.920 --> 44:39.120]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[44:39.120 --> 44:44.840]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.280]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[44:49.280 --> 44:52.120]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[44:52.120 --> 44:55.240]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[44:55.240 --> 45:24.760]  against us so we need your support.
[45:24.760 --> 45:54.600]  Thank you very much for your time, and I'll see you in the next video.
[45:54.600 --> 46:04.120]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[46:04.120 --> 46:09.080]  Years ago, infowarslife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[46:09.080 --> 46:10.080]  yeast.
[46:10.080 --> 46:13.640]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[46:13.640 --> 46:17.520]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.720]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[46:22.720 --> 46:26.920]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better
[46:26.920 --> 46:28.960]  product to help your body fight back.
[46:28.960 --> 46:33.640]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive
[46:33.640 --> 46:38.320]  tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.400]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarko
[46:42.400 --> 46:47.000]  bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.040]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[46:50.040 --> 47:03.520]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com.
[47:03.520 --> 47:26.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[47:26.480 --> 47:34.400]  This is the Alex Jones show, tomorrow's news today.
[47:34.400 --> 47:38.840]  See what they don't want you to see, share what they don't want you to share.
[47:38.840 --> 47:45.360]  We're on over 250 stations during the week, over 150 on the Sunday broadcast, and then
[47:45.360 --> 47:49.840]  not that's just radio stations, we're on a lot of TV stations and cable systems as well.
[47:49.840 --> 47:54.720]  But we've reached billions and billions and billions of people just on our official YouTube
[47:54.720 --> 47:58.640]  and Facebook channels with videos that have been watched and it's changed the world.
[47:58.640 --> 48:02.640]  I've had documentaries that have been seen more than 200 million times online than I
[48:02.640 --> 48:03.640]  produced.
[48:03.640 --> 48:08.160]  I personally directed and made films that have been seen 100 million times, like in-game
[48:08.160 --> 48:10.840]  and others.
[48:10.840 --> 48:16.720]  And I remember in-game had 65 million views just on one YouTube channel or Google video
[48:16.720 --> 48:18.960]  and then they just killed it.
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.640]  So that's what they do, but it's okay because people saw that information.
[48:24.640 --> 48:31.760]  It got to them and the system has learned that people want alternative grassroots information,
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.280]  but it makes them matter and matter and matter that they can't stop you with their algorithms
[48:36.280 --> 48:43.080]  and their shadow bands and all of it spreading the word yourselves.
[48:43.080 --> 48:52.440]  Now why is the city of Austin officially coming out, the people that run it, and recommending
[48:52.440 --> 48:55.160]  that the name of the city be changed?
[48:55.160 --> 49:02.760]  They say in the report, action needs to be taken, we need to take immediate action, but
[49:02.760 --> 49:09.280]  changing the name of the city needs to be done, but it's not a simple matter.
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.200]  We need to change the name of Austin, it's not a simple matter.
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.760]  Because we're not going to report on the millions and millions of Buddhists and Christians who've
[49:15.760 --> 49:19.440]  had their organs taken as we speak in the last decade in China.
[49:19.440 --> 49:23.840]  We're not going to talk about Islamists in a bunch of Middle Eastern and North African
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.120]  countries shelling people into slavery because they're black and they claim the Koran says
[49:28.120 --> 49:29.120]  they can do it.
[49:29.120 --> 49:30.120]  No, no, no.
[49:30.120 --> 49:35.080]  We're not going to talk about people, 30% of the population on psychotropic drugs enslaved
[49:35.080 --> 49:36.080]  to it.
[49:36.080 --> 49:37.960]  We're not going to talk about tens of millions enslaved to opioids.
[49:37.960 --> 49:41.240]  We're not going to talk about all the real forms of slavery, people having their brains
[49:41.240 --> 49:48.520]  rewired, the screen sickness, world government, the family breaking up, depression.
[49:48.520 --> 49:54.000]  We're going to say some guy 190 years ago, why he, you know, he wasn't perfect.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.320]  So we're going to ban the name of the city, even though it's the founder of it and the
[49:58.320 --> 50:03.640]  founder of a system everyone's killing to get into.
[50:03.640 --> 50:07.240]  Not because it's perfect, but it's a lot better than everywhere else.
[50:07.240 --> 50:13.760]  The people that want to control language are in charge of because here's the secret.
[50:13.760 --> 50:19.900]  They don't want you recognizing slavery and medical tyranny beyond any science fiction
[50:19.900 --> 50:24.960]  horror movie you could ever imagine and human cloning and animal human splicing and all
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.280]  the new diseases and the deformities and the IQs dropping and cancer and children up 10,000
[50:30.280 --> 50:34.600]  percent, breast cancer up 3,000% they don't want to talk about all that.
[50:34.600 --> 50:40.280]  They want a bunch of bumbling basket cases obsessed over what's the name of that and
[50:40.280 --> 50:45.000]  who had the name of this and who's, you know, if you're white, you might have had ancestors
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  that did something wrong.
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.280]  Do you imagine if they told you, we're, we need some taxes from you because you're great,
[50:50.280 --> 50:52.960]  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandpa
[50:52.960 --> 50:54.200]  might have done something.
[50:54.200 --> 50:56.360]  You'd say you're crazy.
[50:56.360 --> 51:01.680]  If my daddy was a bank robber, didn't mean I'm guilty, everybody knows that, but that's
[51:01.680 --> 51:07.320]  what this authoritarianism is in Soviet Russia, in Nazi Germany.
[51:07.320 --> 51:10.480]  If your dad did something wrong, you got sent to a death camp.
[51:10.480 --> 51:21.080]  If one of your neighbors punched a SS officer in the face, you got sent to a gulag.
[51:21.080 --> 51:28.000]  So you see, that's how crazy this gets.
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.600]  And then you read Anne Hathaway, another failed nobody actress, virtue signals because they're
[51:32.600 --> 51:35.040]  told to, they read off scripts.
[51:35.040 --> 51:40.000]  All black people fear for their lives daily in America.
[51:40.000 --> 51:47.680]  We must ask our white selves, you're not a person, you're not individual, you're white.
[51:47.680 --> 51:51.200]  You're not a black person, you're not a person, you're black.
[51:51.200 --> 51:55.840]  You're not, you're not a person that is Asian, you're, you, you are Asian.
[51:55.840 --> 52:02.560]  See how crazy that is to see how evil that is, but that's the whole push, the whole
[52:02.560 --> 52:06.480]  propaganda of these cook balls.
[52:06.480 --> 52:14.800]  According to actress Anne Hathaway, all black people, all live in constant fear, how insulting
[52:14.800 --> 52:19.120]  in America because white people could kill them any moment, even though the statistics,
[52:19.120 --> 52:22.640]  and look, I'm sorry, it's just the facts.
[52:22.640 --> 52:28.320]  For every white person that attacks a black person, there's a 10 or 12 to one ratio, it's
[52:28.320 --> 52:32.680]  still a minority of blacks to do it, but it is a fact that has been culturally pushed,
[52:32.680 --> 52:38.720]  it's acceptable, and a lot of your new black Panther Party and others say, and the whole
[52:38.720 --> 52:43.240]  black lives matter group, they say, you know, whites are inherently bad, like she's saying
[52:43.240 --> 52:45.920]  here about herself, virtue signaling.
[52:45.920 --> 52:49.200]  And so, you know, if you're going to go out and mug somebody or attack somebody, do it
[52:49.200 --> 52:50.200]  in a white area.
[52:50.200 --> 52:52.800]  I've had the head of the new black Panther Party on from Houston.
[52:52.800 --> 52:57.680]  He was in the paper saying, don't mug black people, why go mug a white person?
[52:57.680 --> 53:02.320]  How about you don't mug anybody?
[53:02.320 --> 53:05.080]  But think of the condescension there.
[53:05.080 --> 53:09.120]  Anne Hathaway, all black people fear for their lives daily in America.
[53:09.120 --> 53:14.240]  We must ask our white selves, you're not just a red-blooded human that has a soul and a
[53:14.240 --> 53:19.640]  destiny and your own ideas, you're white, who you are is white, because you got pink
[53:19.640 --> 53:25.320]  skin or whatever your color, good God.
[53:25.320 --> 53:28.560]  We must ask our white selves, how decent are we really?
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.240]  She says, she's telling you, you're guilty, you're bad, but don't actually go out and
[53:33.240 --> 53:36.320]  help some black person, no.
[53:36.320 --> 53:39.120]  Just do what Hollywood says, follow our orders.
[53:39.120 --> 53:45.840]  Privileged white people don't have equivalence for their fear of violence, 90% of black people
[53:45.840 --> 53:48.440]  are killed by black people.
[53:48.440 --> 53:54.560]  But see, it doesn't matter if statistics don't even exist, she just puts it out because
[53:54.560 --> 53:59.520]  it's the talking point by the big banks and the chai comms and the globalists that run
[53:59.520 --> 54:00.520]  this country.
[54:00.520 --> 54:03.480]  And it doesn't mean that some of that stuff isn't true, it doesn't matter.
[54:03.480 --> 54:07.960]  It's being pushed to divide and conquer and bring down the country period.
[54:07.960 --> 54:16.200]  Now, that said, I talked about equivalence and logic not being in play.
[54:16.200 --> 54:17.400]  Here's one even bigger.
[54:17.400 --> 54:21.840]  I'll have Democrats, when I run into them on the street that are being more civil, they'll
[54:21.840 --> 54:28.360]  say, Alex, this president just needs to stop being so mean to the media and stop being
[54:28.360 --> 54:33.000]  so divisive and undermining our first amendment.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.480]  I go, he's not trying to get rid of free speech, he's responding to people.
[54:36.480 --> 54:37.560]  That is free speech.
[54:37.560 --> 54:41.680]  They go, well, he's just been saying some threatening things to the press that that
[54:41.680 --> 54:42.680]  really upsets me.
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.920]  I go, oh, really, like what?
[54:43.920 --> 54:48.800]  Well, you know, I mean, you heard it, just like he supposedly said Mexicans are all criminals.
[54:48.800 --> 54:50.640]  There's no video, there's no audio.
[54:50.640 --> 54:56.400]  It's a lie, just like they lie about me and say, I'm being removed off YouTube and Facebook
[54:56.400 --> 54:57.400]  for child endangerment.
[54:57.400 --> 55:02.080]  And it's an ABC news video of some kid punching an adult in the face and the guy pushes the
[55:02.080 --> 55:03.080]  kid down.
[55:03.080 --> 55:08.080]  But see, they won't show you what I supposedly did.
[55:08.080 --> 55:12.240]  Anybody with half a brain knows, journalistically, if you're hearing somebody committed a crime
[55:12.240 --> 55:17.080]  and then they don't show you the proof, what world is this?
[55:17.080 --> 55:25.720]  So when we come back, I'm gonna up the phones up, but I'm gonna get into time publisher
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.520]  asked Trump to reconsider anti-media rhetoric.
[55:29.520 --> 55:30.520]  That's the big story.
[55:30.520 --> 55:31.520]  AP, it's everywhere.
[55:31.520 --> 55:36.120]  He met with him and said, sir, it's dangerous to say the media is evil and bad and liars.
[55:36.120 --> 55:38.840]  No, he says specific people are liars.
[55:38.840 --> 55:40.760]  He says, sir, it's gonna cause violence.
[55:40.760 --> 55:46.720]  So they run with that and Trump responds by saying powerfully, it's on infowars.com.
[55:46.720 --> 55:55.360]  I will not allow our country to be sold out by MSM haters.
[55:55.360 --> 55:58.600]  It they're the one specifically saying he's a traitor.
[55:58.600 --> 56:00.880]  He's a Russian agent, kill his family.
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.840]  And then they send their publisher to go, God shucks, we haven't done anything but been
[56:04.840 --> 56:05.840]  sweet to you.
[56:05.840 --> 56:11.520]  And will you stop being mean as if we don't remember MSM and all of them constantly hating
[56:11.520 --> 56:12.520]  and lying.
[56:12.520 --> 56:17.800]  They're like, we've been so sweet and nice to you, why are you being so mean to us?
[56:17.800 --> 56:20.520]  You need to stop.
[56:20.520 --> 56:25.200]  They've gotten Trump to lower his guard four or five times for like a month and his poll
[56:25.200 --> 56:29.240]  numbers go down and they attack him and he starts losing when he's like, okay, I'm nice,
[56:29.240 --> 56:30.240]  be nice.
[56:30.240 --> 56:31.240]  Everybody, let's be friends.
[56:31.240 --> 56:34.880]  And they just stab him in the back.
[56:34.880 --> 56:36.480]  I'm gonna go to break.
[56:36.480 --> 56:38.160]  They're trying to shut us down.
[56:38.160 --> 56:42.760]  What we talk about is verboten forbidden because it's common sense and it's true.

[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.280]  My brains!

[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:38.280]  Fine. How have you been?
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:40.280]  Fine, sir. Good.
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:42.280]  It's the good thing you were wearing that helmet.
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:43.280]  Yeah?
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:45.280]  What should we do now, sir?
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:47.280]  Well, are we stopped?

[1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:30.280]  There was a compilation of like 20 different shows and four or five networks all saying,
[1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:36.280]  Trump is very Orwellian, Trump is very Orwellian, and then Dan Rather came out and said the same thing
[1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:42.280]  when Trump said, don't believe your eyes or ears when you're watching mainstream media.
[1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:46.280]  They cut off the mainstream media part and they said, it's very Orwellian.
[1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:48.280]  He's saying, don't believe your eyes or ears.
[1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:55.280]  Well, everybody knows mainstream corporate media has been putting the president down,
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:07:01.280]  calling him a Nazi, calling him a traitor, calling him a criminal, saying everything he says is a lie.
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:08.280]  It's been comical if it wasn't so serious and I've gotten to enjoy their lives.
[1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:13.280]  Did you hear Alex Jones got banned on YouTube and Facebook this week?
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:14.280]  Yeah, what was it?
[1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:19.280]  Well, we're not going to show you in thousands of articles and dozens of CNN shows.
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:25.280]  I mean, literally Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, if you turn CNN on, they're talking about me.
[1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:32.280]  Everybody's been calling me that just kind of tunes through or they're at bars or they're in a hotel or it's always an airport.
[1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:38.280]  Like my aunt called, I'm in an airport here in Albuquerque and I've seen you twice on CNN,
[1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:40.280]  something about endangering children.
[1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:42.280]  What, what, what is this?
[1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:44.280]  I had other family call me.
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:51.280]  I'm like, I showed an ABC news clip a month ago of a guy didn't punch the face four times by some punk,
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:08:00.280]  a young, you know, 10, 11 year old and the guy pushes him down and they said, I beat the kid up and I blocked my channels.
[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:02.280]  And she's like, wow, they're that big a liar.
[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:09.280]  And I said, yeah, it's, it's just, it's just unbelievable.
[1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:10.280]  But that's what they do.
[1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:13.280]  That's the level that they've gotten to.
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:20.280]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and they will create their own political demise,
[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:21.280]  their own political destruction.
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:23.280]  I don't mean literal.
[1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:30.280]  Like when I say it's high noon between Trump, myself and Mueller and everybody else, we're having a shootout politically.
[1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:34.280]  You know, and then there's no quarter given, none received.
[1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:40.280]  Jones threatens to shoot Mueller.
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:42.280]  No, that's not what I did.
[1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:48.280]  So this is how they deceive, but I want to give the number out.
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:55.280]  Specifically for folks that want to talk about the censorship war and what's coming next because they've never engaged in so much censorship.
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:57.280]  It's everybody I know is being blocked.
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:00.280]  Veterans groups, gun groups, just total bans, Congress.
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:08.280]  And how do we get Congress to act on the racketeering, on the organized crime, on the illegal mass persecution?
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:16.280]  Really the Facebook, Google, Twitter hacking of the Internet, hacking of our Republic.
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:18.280]  They're the ones involved in the election.
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:22.280]  They're the ones blocking people's regular political discourse while force feeding.
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:26.280]  Anderson Cooper, who was paid $18 million.
[1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:39.280]  Time Warner was CNN was to put out this new Anderson Cooper show that shot in the wrong aspect ratio with like bad audio and video to make you think it's shot out, you know, like he's doing himself.
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:41.280]  Like it looks totally different.
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:42.280]  They'll watch us.
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:45.280]  Well, but it's the same lying scumbags.
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:48.280]  It's top viewership was 5,400.
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:55.280]  It's average viewership 4,000 total galactic failure.
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:10.280]  You imagine on Facebook and YouTube when they don't put the shadow ban on us, the average life feed had 1 million viewers, 86 million viewers in one week before the shadow ban.
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:12.280]  Again, I already know I'm the winner.
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:21.280]  It's like I'm a boxer that did KOs 50 times in a row and now you won't let me box because you and then I just sit here and watch these people.
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:25.280]  I could KO every time and it's like your jokes, man.
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:29.280]  You're your total jokes.
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:36.280]  But to me, it isn't about being the most popular, even though I've been number one in dozens of cities on little stations against big stations.
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:39.280]  I've already done that and I know how the systems rigged.
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:45.280]  It isn't about me being number one or I could have worked with the system and played that game.
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:47.280]  I don't want to do that.
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:51.280]  I want to see real freedom and I'm pushing for it.
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:55.280]  But oh, look, talk about fake news.
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:10.280]  It's always good to give that number up before we actually rack up the phone system.
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:16.280]  I know it's filled up in there, but we probably need to get this in post that I haven't called in a while.
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:27.280]  We're going to continue on Mike Adams as an hour tape program counter think that's excellent and then we're going to continue for two hours on the total attack on the web.
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:35.280]  And how serious it is how to counter strike to it because the more they censor us, the more we work, the more we do, the more we innovate, the more we take action now.
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:40.280]  So there'll be an hour of that very powerful on the streams and on TV stations radio stations.
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:46.280]  It'll Adams will be on the satellite, but we're going to break in on the satellites to the radio stations and to the TV stations.
[1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:49.280]  So no cussing for our guests that are coming on.
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:56.280]  And we're going to go to the radio stations and to the TV stations, some of which carries 24 hours a day.
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:08.280]  Act over 100 of the stations carries 24 hours a day, including places like Kansas City and in Houston and Rochester, New York and little towns in Los Angeles, places like that.
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:13.280]  So there's a lot happening with the Streisand effect is they try to kick us off.
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:18.280]  People are going, hey, we better find out what it is that's so evil, you know, we're not supposed to see it or hear it.
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:22.280]  The people tune in, they go, well, this is really truthful.
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:25.280]  No wonder they don't want this.
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:26.280]  So this is all over the news.
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:31.280]  Times publisher asked Trump to reconsider anti-American rhetoric.
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:37.280]  They're like, come on, man, we're just beating you over the head and stabbing you in the liver every day.
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.280]  Sam, we're going to kill your family and everything and saying you're the biggest liar in history and a Nazi.
[1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:46.280]  And we sell these fake quotes about you and then you call us fake news, man.
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:47.280]  That's horrible.
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.280]  Don't talk bad about mainstream media.
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:52.280]  Just let us destroy you and lie about you.
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:59.280]  The publisher of the New York Times.
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:08.280]  He said, oh, the publisher, not Carlos Slim, the Mexican kingpin owner, but the publisher of the New York Times.
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:10.280]  Dun, dun, dun.
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:19.280]  Said Sunday he implored President Trump as a private White House meeting this month to reconsider his broad attacks on journalists calling the president's anti-press rhetoric,
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:23.280]  not just a visa, but increasingly dangerous.
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:26.280]  You're the ones pushing race war saying all whites are bad.
[1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:30.280]  Everybody that wants some free markets, a Russian agent, arrest everybody.
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:34.280]  You know, shut down your competitors, blah, blah, blah.
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:38.280]  We should investigate all the times and the Washington Post are fighting off for money.
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:45.280]  In a statement, publisher AG Slushenberger said he decided to comment publicly.
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:46.280]  Well, all right.
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:52.280]  After Trump revealed they're off the record meeting to his more than 53 million Twitter followers on Sunday.
[1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:57.280]  Trump's aides had requested the July 20th meeting not be made public.
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:13:59.280]  And it goes on.
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:00.280]  Show.
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:03.280]  We're going to punch you in the face 50,000 times.
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.280]  You don't even raise your arm and say you're under attack.
[1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:08.280]  Do you understand us?
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:10.280]  Our war in reality is paramount.
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:12.280]  How dare you question us?
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:16.280]  We have a right of kings to piss on America.
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:22.280]  When we come back, I'm going to read some of these tweets, the president's counter to this and then we'll go to your phone calls.
[1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:23.280]  But they think you're done.
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:24.280]  They think you're over.
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:26.280]  They think you're defeated.
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:33.280]  They think, you know, that Hillary was going to win 97% with all their lies, fake polls, giving her the question beforehand that failed.
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:40.280]  So now they're coming in with a real censorship thinking conservatives in the last year and a half of censorship would just go, I'll be a Democrat now.
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:42.280]  Don't censor me on social media.
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:43.280]  People don't care.
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:44.280]  They're leaving you.
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:45.280]  You failed the censor.
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.280]  You failed to break our will.
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:54.280]  That's why the stocks of Facebook are plunging and Google and Twitter are all about to go down because you broke your algorithm.
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:15:05.280]  You became a police state to try to deliver it to the globalist and you still failed because all the internal polls show a huge landslide for the Republicans in the midterm election.
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:15.280]  Them keeping the House, keeping the Senate, maybe even expanding except for all the people voting the names of dead folks and the illegal aliens, all these Democrats have legalized in 14 states voting.
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:18.280]  Even though they always set up as a conspiracy theory, no illegal aliens are voting.
[1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:19.280]  Now they've legalized it.
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:21.280]  The bunch of Democrats setting states.
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:23.280]  So there you go.

[1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:20.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:51.280]  That's not what's happening. You said it's like 1984. It's dystopian.
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:32.280]  He has made some way in that, as several people have said before me, he is not just attacking the truth. He wants to annihilate the truth. He wants to move us completely into the post-truth political era.
[1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:56.280]  In every major news program in the country, this week, came out and said, this is 1984. He says, don't believe your eyes and ears.
[1:21:56.280 --> 1:22:04.280]  No, he said, if you see something on mainstream media, don't believe it. Let me tell you something.
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:16.280]  Anybody can do a test right now for themselves. Go to Google, click News, type in Alex Jones, A-L-E-X-J-O-N-E-S.
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:24.280]  And I've spent hours every day clicking on articles, hundreds of them. It's like the same person wrote them all.
[1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:35.280]  They say, Jones has been restricted on YouTube and Facebook for bullying a child, for child endangerment.
[1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:48.280]  They don't show who the child is. You know, remember the old days, they'd say, this person was arrested for reportedly doing this to a child at this address in this city at this time and they face bail or they fit.
[1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:57.280]  It's just Alex Jones has been kicked off for Islamophobia, endangering a child.
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:07.280]  And then the video they banned was from ABC News of a kid trying to beat up an adult and a guy pushes the kid back. But they don't show it.
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:15.280]  Now, that's Orwellian. In 1984, they don't tell you what you've done.
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:24.280]  In 1984, you can't face your accuser. There's a Community Standards Board that reports to you.
[1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:31.280]  They don't even say what you've done and then you disappear. That's Orwellian.
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:38.280]  The President says, a lot of great people coming out of Latin America, but we also have open borders and a lot of criminals, a lot of rapists, a lot of robbers.
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:48.280]  That turns into all Mexicans are rapists and robbers. There's no video, there's no text, but they always say it, say it, say it on every show, every day.
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:53.280]  Like it's true, like it's true, like it's true, like it's true, like it's true, like it's true.
[1:23:53.280 --> 1:24:02.280]  Trump says, MS-13 killing some little girl, torturing her to death in a satanic ritual were animals.
[1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:10.280]  I say animals aren't that bad. Most of them don't torture for fun. I guess killer whales do.
[1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:25.280]  And you turn that into, he said, migrants are animals. That's their hoaxing or he threw the Martin Luther King bust out or, you know, he didn't visit Congressman Scalise when he was shot.
[1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:33.280]  I mean, you all know the lies, folks, and that's how stupid they think you are.
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:42.280]  They are 1984. They are the ones that want to suppress the economy. They are the ones that won't talk about communist China and what it's doing.
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:48.280]  They are the liars, and they're losing, and they don't know what to do.
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:54.280]  So they target low-hanging fruit like Info Wars, and they can set the present to shut us down, they can shut you down.
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:25:00.280]  Let's go over some of his tweets. It's on InfoWars.com. It's on NewsWars.com. Get this article out to everybody.
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:08.280]  Do it in your email. Do it by hand. They are so scared of you hitting the streets. You calling in to talk radio. You calling in to C-SPAN.
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:13.280]  Going around Facebook, around Twitter. They're so scared of you going to InfoWars.com.
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:19.280]  And getting those live feeds we've got of a special broadcast we're already doing that's going to go right to 9 o'clock tonight.
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:26.280]  Expanded coverage with Mike Adams next hour. With counterthink that we come back live. This will be taped to air. Special report he's got for you.
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:32.280]  We come back at 7 o'clock central with Mike Cernovich, others going over. How do we battle the censorship?
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:37.280]  It's in your phone calls. Your phone calls are next segment. We're going to be taking phone calls throughout the evening.
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:43.280]  What happens with the power of you telling folks about the free apps or you spreading that live link?
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:49.280]  They're afraid of that chain reaction. That's what they brought you to Facebook and YouTube and Twitter.
[1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:54.280]  So they can control everything you do in that gulag. They can control what you did in that ghetto.
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:26:02.280]  But now InfoWars and others are building our own platforms. We've been building them. We've been warning you this is coming.
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:07.280]  And it is good to see our platforms expanding rapidly as soon as the censorship cut in.
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:17.280]  But I'm telling you, they're planning something bigger. They're doing all this censorship right now because they're about to make a move in 2018.
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:22.280]  They know now. They're not as arrogant as they used to be. That makes them a more dangerous enemy.
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:28.280]  Trump, I will not allow country to be sold out by MSM haters.
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:32.280]  Singles outfailing New York Times and Amazon Washington Post.
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:37.280]  Now, that's important. He's doing that, but he's 72. He still thinks they're important.
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:43.280]  Sir, it's Google. It's Facebook. It's Twitter. They are 50 times bigger.
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:47.280]  Drudge, sir, is bigger than New York Times Washington Post combined, sir.
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:51.280]  Why don't you write a daily article for Drudge?
[1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:55.280]  He's smart, but, you know, he doesn't know everything.
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:58.280]  We got in the report. You see him saying the shadow man's illegal.
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:06.280]  But you think it gives me a power trip that most of the time it's us that actually get people warned.
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:13.280]  That scares the living daylights out of me, man. I'm sick of being absolutely ground zero and like the guy in the arena,
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:17.280]  because man, they are putting out bigger and bigger juggernauts on us.
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:22.280]  I'm like a gladiator and meaner and meaner stuff comes out of that cage every time those gates come up, man.
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:27.280]  I'm seeing and I'm just like, I don't care what happens to me. I'll be honest with you.
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:32.280]  I'm so committed to this. But, man, the fact that I know there are people smarter and stronger than me
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:35.280]  who are asleep and don't even know what's going on.
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:40.280]  And I'm sitting here realizing your children are going to be totally after over if you don't wake up.
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:44.280]  It's that simple. Let's end the game, folks.
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:49.280]  Trump said when the media is driven by insane by their Trump derangement syndrome,
[1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:55.280]  reveals internal deliberations of our government, it truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk.
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:01.280]  It's very unpatriotic Trump tweeted Sunday, because that's what they do.
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:06.280]  He went on to say accurately 90% of media coverage of my administration is negative.
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:10.280]  It's actually like 95. Despite the tremendously positive results we're achieving,
[1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:14.280]  it's no surprise the confidence in the media is at an all-time low.
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:19.280]  I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters.
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:24.280]  And that's, he's telling you, he doesn't want to take the stock market, but we're in a war with China.
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:29.280]  The globalist sold us out to China. They set China up.
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:33.280]  They set China up. We're like, we got a billion people that are communists.
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:38.280]  Let's set everything up here and screw America. And they did. Now it's a billion and a half.
[1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:40.280]  When it goes on.
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:44.280]  Dying newspaper industry, no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up,
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:47.280]  our country is making great progress under my leadership.
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:49.280]  And I will never stop fighting for the American people.
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:54.280]  The failing New York Times and Amazon, Washington Post, do nothing but write bad stories
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:58.280]  even about positive achievements. And they will never change because they're enemies.
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:03.280]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:08.280]  Hey, Alex, mate. I've been following you since I was 14. And I'm 32 now.
[1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:13.280]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen
[1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:16.280]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet.
[1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:21.280]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:25.280]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:30.280]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill,
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:33.280]  micro-ZX body. It's all amazing. Thank you, brother.
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:39.280]  Yeah. And I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind.
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:42.280]  You're detoxing the body. You're detoxing the spirit.
[1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:47.280]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:51.280]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew,
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:30:16.280]  and the listeners out here, 1776 Worldwide.
[1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:47.280]  Thank you.
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:58.280]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:32.280]  Hey, how would you like to take Info Wars with you wherever you go?
[1:31:32.280 --> 1:31:37.280]  Well, now you could do just that with the new official Info Wars app.
[1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:43.280]  And here's the best part. It is absolutely free at the Apple Store and Google Play.
[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:49.280]  You can join the Info War today. Check it out right now at infowars.com forward slash app.
[1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:53.280]  It's the Info Wars official app taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[1:31:53.280 --> 1:32:15.280]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:24.280]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:30.280]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[1:32:30.280 --> 1:32:35.280]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:45.280]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:50.280]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:52.280]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:32:52.280 --> 1:33:00.280]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:08.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:32.280]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:39.280]  Why do the globalists want infowars shut down? Because the general public tunes in. It's a big show.
[1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:46.280]  But the military, the intelligence agencies, foreign governments, they know what I'm talking about.
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:50.280]  And it becomes a worldwide talking point. What's happening?
[1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:55.280]  And they know that other people don't do something unless it benefits them individually right then.
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:34:02.280]  No, I will sit there and write a special report or make a film or spend time to try to educate Congress about censorship,
[1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:06.280]  because I believe in the First Amendment.
[1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:11.280]  And then we put a little bit of energy into it, and now suddenly Congress understands it and is doing something.
[1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:20.280]  And so now they want us totally banned because so many times they say it's info wars over and over again that is ground zero for us being defeated.
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:22.280]  I want that to change.
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:25.280]  I want to be made obsolete.
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:31.280]  And that's why it's good that Tucker Carlson is doing his own research and saying the same thing.
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:37.280]  And so is some of the big national talk show hosts and so is Sean Hannity.
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:40.280]  And that's great because in many ways they're smarter than I am.
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:49.280]  And I just, I just, I really want to be able to sit back and still do info wars and still, you know, be involved.
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:58.280]  Believe me, I'm not trying to be the big swing and, you know what, I just believe me, I've done it enough.
[1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:02.280]  And I want to beat these people is what I'm looking for.
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:05.280]  And we can do it together.
[1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:08.280]  And that's why Ted Cruz came out and defended me from being banned.
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:13.280]  That's what Tucker Carlson did because they can misrepresent what I've said and done all day.
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:17.280]  This is about setting the precedent to shut it all down and they're moving very rapidly.
[1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:20.280]  It's very illegal. It's very exponential.
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:30.280]  It's unbelievable to have all these nasty, nasty, nasty leftists and other so-called media organizations foaming at the mouth, CNN,
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:36.280]  leading the charge to have me taken off air, claiming I put out fake news and then misrepresenting what I've said.
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:46.280]  When they're the kings of fake news, it's the height of arrogance.
[1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:48.280]  All right, we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:53.280]  I just want to point out to listeners, you make it easy to support info wars.
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:57.280]  We go out and find the biggest organic manufacturer of fluoride-free toothpaste.
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:35:59.280]  And we add poital silver and iodine.
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:02.280]  It's called Super Blue for adults and children.
[1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:04.280]  And we've got the mouthwash and the immune gargle.
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:06.280]  It's at infowarstore.com.
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:14.280]  We have the new Super Silver wound dressing gel that is the level right below what you call prescription.
[1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:16.280]  It's FDA cleared for over-the-counter sale.
[1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:21.280]  It's a private label, one of the top sellers in the country that's patented at that level.
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:24.280]  They normally sell it for $40. It's $29.95.
[1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:29.280]  And obviously a lot of the cost is having to have all the FDA clearance, FDA approval.
[1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:32.280]  FDA cleared for over-the-counter because there are a lot of tests to do that.
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:35.280]  But Super Silver wound dressing is amazing.
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:37.280]  It funds the store.
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:39.280]  That's a five pack right there.
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:44.280]  You can buy it individually as well at infowarstore.com.
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:45.280]  No reviews yet.
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:47.280]  That's a new product that we're selling.
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:49.280]  But again, it's a private label, best seller.
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:52.280]  Now, take fish oil.
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:54.280]  This is what I now give my children.
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:36:56.280]  I was before I was giving it one of the best-selling brands in the country.
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:36:57.280]  This is even better.
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:36:59.280]  We've been working with this for years.
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:02.280]  I want to give people a document shot if they can here on the desk.
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:10.280]  But this is all the different known oils that are healthy and good for the brand.
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:19.280]  The DHA, the EPA, the wild anchovy and wild salmon and krill oil, vitamin D and E to help absorb it.
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:23.280]  But just look at the color of these.
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:26.280]  I mean, this is simply...
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:28.280]  Document cam shot right here.
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:29.280]  Right here. Thank you.
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:32.280]  Just look at that right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:35.280]  Again, so good.
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:37.280]  There's more in each bottle than that.
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:43.280]  That's one I've been eating out of each day because it gives me so much energy, so much focus, so much you name it.
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:45.280]  It really is amazing.
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:47.280]  And fish oil, krill oil, all of its great.
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:52.280]  But a lot of it hasn't really had the mercury taken out.
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:56.280]  We pay a lot more for ours to do that process down to non-detectable levels.
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:58.280]  So for yourself, your family, your children.
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:00.280]  The honor rolls for your children.
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:02.280]  We've got the adult fish oils as well.
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.280]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:16.280]  And if you fund us by getting great products you need, it's a 360 win.
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:19.280]  No fillers in our fish oil either, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:22.280]  So we set out to bring you the ultimate formulas.
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:24.280]  It's a win-win InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:26.280]  Okay, thanks to the crew.
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:32.280]  Let me go ahead now, ahead of Mike Adams coming up for an hour with CounterThink.
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:38.280]  And then the two-hour special broadcast we're going to do, going in to the censorship, how they're doing it, how to counter it.
[1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:45.280]  If you want to win the midterms, if you want to finish defeating Soros, Hillary, their whole combine, it's essential.
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:50.280]  And to do that, we've got to get the public educated and Congress educated, the courts educated.
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:53.280]  And it's a very academic process, but we've done it.
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:55.280]  So that's all coming up.
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:39:05.280]  Okay, Cameron, Connor, Joseph, Brad, Cindy, Troy, Elizabeth, Kerry, George, Vincent, Darian, Darren, you're all coming up.
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:09.280]  Cameron and Florida, thanks for holding. You're on the air, Cameron.
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:11.280]  Hi, Alex.
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:12.280]  Welcome.
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:22.280]  I would like to agree with you on what you just said about what we can do to battle the censorship.
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:31.280]  And I'd like to go over an article that was by the New York Times back in December 13, 2016.
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:33.280]  I don't know if you had read up on that.
[1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:38.280]  I don't know the particular article. What happens is everybody's used to other talk radio where they screen your calls.
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:40.280]  If you've got a clear phone on the topic, we put you on air.
[1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:44.280]  So people tend to get on air with me and they want me to screen their call.
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:47.280]  But you're on air. Go ahead.
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:54.280]  It was the New York Times, the perfect weapon, how Russian cyber power invaded the U.S.
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:56.280]  Okay, go ahead.
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:40:04.280]  It boils down exactly what their plans were to do, the DNC, the hacks, all of it.
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:10.280]  It's a really intuitive article to really get into.
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:12.280]  But like I said...
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:16.280]  Oh, I get it. I notice you had some trouble there.
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:20.280]  So you believe the New York Times.
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:23.280]  It also said Hillary had a 97% chance of winning.
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.280]  They were involved trying to rig the debates with CNN.
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:33.280]  So you really believe Russia, who can barely make their stoplights work, is this superpower,
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:36.280]  and that America wasn't sick of Hillary and the Clintons.
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:42.280]  So did the Russians make the economy grow to 4.1% or start securing the border?
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:47.280]  I mean, tell me about the New York Times and all the proof of the Russians.
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:52.280]  Oh, no. I absolutely agree with you that it wasn't the Russians that...
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:57.280]  Well, I'm trying to understand that. You just told me about the New York Times and about the Russians.
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:01.280]  No, I was trying to see if you had read up on that article because it was...
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:06.280]  Well, there's been like probably 5 million articles saying the Russians created the earth.
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:12.280]  Women don't have babies. Russians do. And like, bananas don't grow on trees.
[1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:15.280]  Russians, they fall out of Russians' rear ends.
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:19.280]  The ocean shoots out of Russians' nostrils.
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:22.280]  The galaxy was created by Russians.
[1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:25.280]  And when we wear a Make America Grading in hat, the Russians did it.
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:27.280]  And if you love George Washington, the Russians did it.
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:31.280]  Hell, it's all over the news that the Second Amendment is a Russian idea
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:36.280]  and that this Russian spy that could never, wasn't even proven to be a spy,
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:41.280]  tried to infiltrate the NRA so the NRA's Russian and David Hogg sent a...
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:47.280]  I appreciate your call, Cameron. The NRA sent out all this Russian-controlled garbage.
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:53.280]  But David Hogg says the NRA's Russian. So let's turn our guns in right now.
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:56.280]  God, I didn't realize that was a Russian idea.
[1:41:56.280 --> 1:42:01.280]  Aren't we glad that we are dealing with those Russians? That's right.
[1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:04.280]  The globalists say they hate America in their own white papers
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:06.280]  and in their own WikiLeaks and in their own admissions.
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.280]  That much they hate the country and how bad the country is and how, you know...
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:15.280]  But don't worry. See, the globalists now love America.
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:17.280]  They're protecting us from the Russians.
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:23.280]  Oh, but not the Chai comms that actually own our debt and own Hollywood now.
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:26.280]  Even the Washington Post control the big 50 universities.
[1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:28.280]  Don't look at them.
[1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:33.280]  No, no, no. The New York Times owned by Carlos Slim, the Mexican kingpin.
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:39.280]  It is going to save us from the Russians.
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:43.280]  Oh, my God. I just... Oh, thank God they're here to save us. Oh, my God.
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:47.280]  I mean, the Russians are building our military and put huge sanctions on Russia
[1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:49.280]  and are shipping tow missiles to Ukraine.
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:52.280]  And the Russians are just crushing their oil exports.
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.280]  I mean, the Russians are crushing themselves and building us up.
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:57.280]  I mean, oh, my God, so evil.

[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:31.280]  Let it all hang out cause we got a run to pick.
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:36.280]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer and Texarkana.
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:40.280]  And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes.
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:44.280]  Eastbound and down, loaded up and trucking.
[1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:47.280]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:52.280]  We've got a long way to go and it's short time to get there.
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:57.280]  I'm Eastbound, just watch our bandit run.
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:26.280]  We're gonna have specific callers and cover real issues.
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:31.280]  But this is the full assault, the Democrats absolute worship of tyranny.
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:38.280]  How liberals and socialists set up nightmares everywhere of total control because it's what they want.
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:41.280]  They want to shut down America.
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:43.280]  They want to shut down free speech.
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:47.280]  They want to shut it all down.
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:52.280]  We've taken 23,000 phone calls on our digital system in two hours before.
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:54.280]  So we have massive of real calls.
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:58.280]  And I noticed tonight before I give the number out, the phone bank was already full.
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:01.280]  And I said, who turned that on early? We don't do that.
[1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:08.280]  We have to turn it on when I give the number out to the real audience or the seminar callers have their engines started.
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:10.280]  Waiting.
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:12.280]  You understand, that's how that works.
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:15.280]  You gotta flip it on the minute I give the number out.
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:18.280]  That's how that works, or they flood in.
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:21.280]  We normally have somebody else in there running and taking the calls.
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:24.280]  And again, I used to say we don't screen your calls, just where you're calling from.
[1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:27.280]  Got a good clear phone line, you're on the air.
[1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:33.280]  But we have to screen them because the left just calls in to misrepresent who we are.
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:36.280]  Because they're just so fired up right now.
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:41.280]  All these professors, all the antifa, all the government workers, all of them are exponential.
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:44.280]  Their identity was they hate America.
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:46.280]  Their identity was they hate families.
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:48.280]  Their identity was they hate Christians.
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:50.280]  Their identity is they're going to break up free market.
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:52.280]  They're going to run America.
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:53.280]  They're going to be in control.
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:55.280]  They hate flyover country.
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:57.280]  And now they see the economy at 4.1.
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:59.280]  They see the sovereignty coming back.
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:03.280]  They see globalism in trouble and they are evaporating.
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:04.280]  They are panicking.
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:06.280]  They don't know what to do.
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:07.280]  They don't know how to respond.
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:12.280]  They don't understand how this could happen because the country was asleep.
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:16.280]  And now the country is away.
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:18.280]  And that's why you're losing and you're going to lose worse.
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:22.280]  No matter how much censorship you engage in, no matter how many scams you run,
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:24.280]  we punch up info wars on the screen. Thank you.
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:30.280]  No matter what you try or what you pull or what you do,
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.280]  you are not going to ever be able to put your system back together again.
[1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:39.280]  We just posted it up on infowars.com.
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:42.280]  I'm going to pull it up here on my own screen here.
[1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:44.280]  Got my computer punched up right over here for me.
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:48.280]  And you can send it out to people because it makes them so angry because they really hate,
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:50.280]  we have live feeds that can reach new people.
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:52.280]  They're not worried about talk radio and local TV stations,
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:54.280]  even though you're spreading the word about them.
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:55.280]  They should be worried about them.
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:56.280]  They're worried about the internet.
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:57.280]  They think it's theirs.
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:01.280]  It's supposed to be their big control arm to bring it all down and bring in total control.
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:07.280]  So watch live Alex Jones coverage of massive censorship and how to stop it live now
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:12.280]  and running through 9pm central time, the verboten information.
[1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:16.280]  And then it's got save the internet.
[1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:21.280]  What really concerns them right over here, save the internet emergency report,
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:24.280]  the censorship master plan decoded.
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:26.280]  And you scroll down here.
[1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:32.280]  We've got the big report for Congress and lawmakers and others about how big tech media are engaged
[1:51:32.280 --> 1:51:37.280]  in this total takeover of the internet and massive censorship.
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:42.280]  And now the president, a week and a half after the report comes out and says shadow banning is illegal
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:44.280]  and we're going to stop it and we're going to deal with it.
[1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:48.280]  That is the real excitement.
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:50.280]  But think how much they hate you.
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:52.280]  Think how stupid they think you are.
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:57.280]  Think what morons they think you are at every level.
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:04.280]  That they think that they can get up on the news and say Trump hates all Mexicans and they're all rapists
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:06.280]  and there's no video of it.
[1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:10.280]  Or they can get up and say that I'm kicked off YouTube and Facebook as I endangered a child.
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:13.280]  Total defamation, no such thing, total lie.
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:19.280]  And in 10,000 articles, not one video or photo of what I did.
[1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:24.280]  Because they're just criminal frauds and they're running out of gas
[1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:30.280]  and they think if they can wreck Trump or wreck me or something, they're going to know you're done, you're failures.
[1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:33.280]  People can't stand you.
[1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:41.280]  People see absolutely through what you're doing on so many fronts.
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:48.280]  But the Democrats are selectively implementing the internet kill switch right now.
[1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:52.280]  They are selectively implementing the internet kill switch right now
[1:52:52.280 --> 1:52:56.280]  and they think everybody's just mesmerized in asleep and doesn't know what's going on.
[1:52:56.280 --> 1:53:01.280]  But I'm here raising the alarm with our crew to let you know this is going on.
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:06.280]  They just hope that you don't tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to
[1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:08.280]  or the local TV stations you're listening to.
[1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:12.280]  They just hope others that are aware of what's going on sit on the sidelines
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:15.280]  and hope, oh, don't get involved in the censorship fight.
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:17.280]  You'll be left alone as long as you don't get involved.
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:20.280]  No, you'll be shut down next.
[1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:24.280]  The people that live in America, that live off those that stood up and fought for liberty,
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:27.280]  you live on the down payments put down by other people.
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:34.280]  Your cowardice, your bootlicking has only encouraged the atmosphere we're now in.
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:41.280]  And that's why they're trying to crush and shut down those of us that are telling the truth.
[1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:46.280]  Computer models show for the next four to five years we're going to be at 3% growth rate or more.
[1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:52.280]  It could be 6%, 7%. China's had 10% for decades because all of our money was shunted to them.
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:57.280]  Now under Trump, 20% is coming back to us. Just a little something.
[1:53:57.280 --> 1:54:05.280]  And because of that, the globalists hate his guts because their whole religion is about pissing on you and your family.
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:07.280]  Let's go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[1:54:07.280 --> 1:54:14.280]  Can we put a photo out of John Podesta and Stephen Colbert, who are good friends.
[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:21.280]  An Anthony Wiener that went to college and stayed in the same room and roommate with John Stewart.
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:28.280]  There's a big Getty's image photo where there are a bunch of people together, but it's the particular photo.
[1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:31.280]  I just say they call it the face.
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:36.280]  And I love when all I said was they call it the face, what the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of comments.
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:41.280]  My Twitter is Real Alex Jones. They call it the face.
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:45.280]  How many times I make it that face? See, they make it like it's cool.
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:56.280]  But when you see that Joker smile right there, when you see that unnatural look, you see that, buddy, that is El Diablo right there.
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:00.280]  That smile, like a great white shark coming down on you.
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:04.280]  That smile is not a happy smile.
[1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:10.280]  That is the smile of a really, really bad hombre.
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:13.280]  And that's the smile.
[1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:19.280]  That's the smile you see when you know you're in a whole lot of trouble.
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:26.280]  And you're calling out to God and God ain't coming.
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:32.280]  And you don't get in the club unless you got that smile.
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:37.280]  And that's the smile.
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:45.280]  That's the smile you know you're about to go through some serious times.
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:49.280]  But somebody's got to stand up to them and we're going to do it.
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:57.280]  Go read the comments for yourself. It's called the face.
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:01.280]  And they said, yeah, the guy, he goes, oh, the face they make when you had your kids taken away.
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:07.280]  Oh, like Hillary won the election. My kids weren't taken away from me.
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:11.280]  See, the left's obsessed with kids. They want you to abort your kids as fast as you can.
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:15.280]  They're obsessed with the government running your kids, not you.
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:18.280]  And then they're obsessed with telling parents.
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:23.280]  I want to give you a little newsflash out there, brother.
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:28.280]  I've got five children.
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:34.280]  Three with my first wife, one with my new wife, and one girl who decided to have the baby
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:38.280]  and didn't want me to be involved in it. But I got told about her sister later.
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:42.280]  And I still keep waiting for that young man. I'm told it was a boy to knock on my door.
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  But I was a teenager when that happened.
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:50.280]  I got five children. I loved children.
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:59.280]  Today, I was with all four of my children, just like I've been for the last five weeks.
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:06.280]  I've been with all four of my children for five weeks.
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:11.280]  And you sit there and you tell me I don't have my children. I had my children.
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:16.280]  I took the risk to have children. I took care of them. I loved them. They loved me. I'm their daddy.
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:21.280]  I don't sit there. I can't even make the look. I can facsimile, but I can't do it.
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:26.280]  When you see it, it pops. You know, you know, ooh, that.
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:32.280]  I only know because I got to see some things when I was a teenager that most people don't get to see.
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:35.280]  And let me tell you, it'll turn your hair gray.
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:38.280]  All right, Mike Adams is coming up on the streams at m4wars.com,
[1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:41.280]  forward slash show at many TV and radio stations for an hour.

[1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:29.280]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract,
[1:58:29.280 --> 1:58:31.280]  poudarko bark, and grape seed extract,

[1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:02.280]  that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure,
[1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:05.280]  that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.

[1:59:12.280 --> 1:59:14.280]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:19.280]  it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
