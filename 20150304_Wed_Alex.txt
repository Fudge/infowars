[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.000]  well it's another live worldwide transmission completely jam-packed and
[00:29.000 --> 00:36.920]  overflowing with key information it is already the fourth day of March 2015 I'm
[00:36.920 --> 00:41.360]  your host Alex Jones Wolfgang Halbig the former state police officer former
[00:41.360 --> 00:48.240]  customs officer former top school safety consultant in the country one of the
[00:48.240 --> 00:52.160]  top guys good morning America you name it one of the most successful businesses
[00:52.160 --> 00:57.600]  providing training and preparation for school security there's been
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.320]  investigating Sandy Hook and believes it's completely fake completely staged
[01:02.320 --> 01:06.560]  it's going to be joining us with new developments a few weeks ago there were
[01:06.560 --> 01:11.680]  moves by one of the charity groups associated with Sandy Hook and the
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.800]  reported tragedy there to shut down our YouTube channel for even daring talking
[01:16.800 --> 01:22.520]  about it it is the contention of the group that even talking about it is not
[01:22.520 --> 01:26.200]  allowed it's kind of an example of the new political correctness where if you
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.040]  disagree with someone their speech is taken that was overturned by YouTube but
[01:32.040 --> 01:36.640]  it is an ongoing as we filed a counterclaim but it just shows the ongoing
[01:36.640 --> 01:39.920]  garbage we deal with we're not gonna so much talk about the attempts to shut up
[01:39.920 --> 01:44.280]  and stifling investigation an obstructive investigation as the new
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.160]  developments and the lawsuits that have been filed to get more information on
[01:48.160 --> 01:54.640]  that because governments and group stage events like to have an article here
[01:54.640 --> 02:01.600]  today that is more than 60 examples of admitted declassified false flags and
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.880]  staged events by our government by other governments it's a very important
[02:06.880 --> 02:13.240]  article up on info wars.com that said a lot of times terror attacks are real but
[02:13.240 --> 02:17.600]  the response to them is to take the general public's liberties and freedoms
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.480]  and secure the globalist takeover and a big example of that is in the news today
[02:22.480 --> 02:28.840]  hacked email Saudi money finance Benghazi attack and Hillary is in a lot
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.800]  of trouble because the head of the EPA Sheila Jackson member had to step down a
[02:33.800 --> 02:41.400]  few years ago it is clearly illegal what Hillary has been doing and it shows its
[02:41.400 --> 02:45.920]  premeditated because she had her own private server system as well similar
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.120]  to what the IRS has been caught doing similar to what the different federal
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.500]  agencies have been caught doing Clinton ran on computer system for her
[02:55.500 --> 02:59.040]  official emails we're going to be getting into that we've got some good
[02:59.040 --> 03:05.760]  news here McDonald's new menu policy will only use chickens raised without
[03:05.760 --> 03:12.120]  antibiotics very positive news shows the effect of your buying power and voting
[03:12.120 --> 03:15.360]  with your dollars this example could bring down the whole new world order if
[03:15.360 --> 03:19.880]  people figure it out and the good news is they're starting to figure it out
[03:19.880 --> 03:26.560]  Pelosi got criticized for not properly bowing to Netanyahu whether you like
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.120]  Netanyahu or not I mean the bowing of politicians period makes my stomach
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.200]  turn well she now says she was near tears throughout the Prime Minister's
[03:35.200 --> 03:40.920]  speech and basically worships him so there she's properly prostrating
[03:40.920 --> 03:45.040]  herself to a foreign leader kind of like when Obama constantly bows down to
[03:45.040 --> 03:50.440]  every other foreign leader he can in the Saudis and they're saying of course the
[03:50.440 --> 03:54.520]  FBI that ISIS is in all 50 states and getting set to hit Europe will face a
[03:54.520 --> 03:58.800]  new 9-11 within two years Colonel Gaddafi's shine and that dovetails with
[03:58.800 --> 04:05.280]  Interpol saying they're getting ready for a new European 9-11 as best I can
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.560]  tell there is some jockeying going on where they want to create and it turns
[04:10.560 --> 04:15.920]  out was in a Brookings Institute document and several others a fake split
[04:15.920 --> 04:19.800]  between the US and Israel so Israel can attack Iran and not have any blowback on
[04:19.800 --> 04:23.640]  the US but at the same time it does appear there's some double crossing of
[04:23.640 --> 04:29.520]  the Saudis through the West with Iran and that Benghazi was part of getting
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.120]  that cash of weapons that couldn't be traced into their al-Qaeda fighters
[04:33.120 --> 04:37.920]  hands then hold the West hostage the Threvenue 9-11 attack any way you slice
[04:37.920 --> 04:42.040]  it it's an ordered out of chaos situation the genies out of the bottle
[04:42.040 --> 04:48.720]  and who knows what is going to happen next as we know genies are very
[04:48.720 --> 04:53.440]  uncontrollable and very destructive in the genie of geopolitical destabilization

[08:24.760 --> 08:30.520]  name here is wisdom let him who has understanding calculate the number of
[08:30.520 --> 08:38.280]  the beast for the number is that of a man and his number is 666 so how close
[08:38.280 --> 08:43.400]  are we to actually having microchips implanted under our skin well according
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.680]  to the NBC nightly news with Brian Williams we might be a lot closer than
[08:48.680 --> 08:52.400]  you think more now of our special coverage here tonight life in the US in
[08:52.400 --> 08:58.880]  ten years time the year is 2017 you're rushed to a hospital unconscious with no
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.800]  ID or medical history but thanks to a microchip under your skin it's all
[09:03.800 --> 09:09.440]  there science fiction 20 years ago but a biometric reality today in medical
[09:09.440 --> 09:14.680]  news tonight a chip the size of a grain of rice could save your life I've just
[09:14.680 --> 09:20.480]  been chipped myself it's not a painless process but doesn't last too long not too
[09:20.480 --> 09:24.520]  difficult minus surgical procedure new microchip technology now makes it
[09:24.520 --> 09:28.280]  possible for the emergency room staff to find out about your medical history at
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.800]  the touch of a computer key at some point we're all gonna have RFIDs it
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.280]  might be even in our fingers where they require it with everything on it instead
[09:37.280 --> 09:44.240]  of carrying credit cards or money we will probably be implanted with chips and
[09:44.240 --> 09:49.480]  now RFID microchips like this are being injected into humans I'm sorry sir did
[09:49.480 --> 09:53.040]  you just say you you would get one implanted in your arm absolutely a lot
[09:53.040 --> 09:57.160]  of doubt our driver's license will be on the RFID chip our credit card number
[09:57.160 --> 10:01.720]  all our information will be on this one chip
[10:03.880 --> 10:08.160]  the chip is in case an unbreakable glass and is about the size of a grain of
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.160]  rice the procedure is done with anesthesia and is relatively pain-free it
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.920]  felt pretty scary but at the same time it feels felt very modern very 2015 the
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.200]  government is just to prove the use of a computer chip that would be implanted
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.080]  under your skin when complete everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity
[10:26.080 --> 10:29.560]  number if hospitals purchase this detection equipment the system will
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.080]  most likely start to include more and more people in those communities who
[10:33.080 --> 10:36.160]  will want the chips well interesting everybody could have one of those one
[10:36.160 --> 10:41.560]  day does Google now know everything I do and everywhere I go because let's face
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.480]  it here we like you guys but you're from Google it may be true that 10 to 20 year
[10:47.480 --> 10:51.360]  olds don't want to wear a watch on their wrist but you can be sure that they'll
[10:51.360 --> 10:54.560]  be far more interested in wearing an electronic tattoo if only to piss off
[10:54.560 --> 10:59.680]  their parents forget mobile phones your children and grandchildren may well want
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.080]  an implant instead you know when we check out at the grocery store we'll be
[11:04.080 --> 11:09.320]  swiping our own arm over the scanner and that will be something we feel we can't
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.720]  live without it will be such a disadvantage to not have the implant
[11:13.720 --> 11:19.440]  that it essentially becomes not optional let's imagine a little bit what the
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.880]  future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.920]  or your stem cells and put them on a chip it would be a personalized chip just
[11:29.920 --> 11:32.520]  for you
[11:32.880 --> 11:41.240]  it turns over but it doesn't start but the RFID reader antenna is here so when I
[11:41.240 --> 11:47.080]  authenticate the bike powers up
[11:51.160 --> 11:57.640]  imagine if some of these machines can be made so thin light and portable they
[11:57.640 --> 12:01.760]  could be attached right to the surface of your skin and go wherever you go
[12:01.760 --> 12:06.920]  there's some very sophisticated device functionality sitting on my skin welcome
[12:06.920 --> 12:11.880]  to the future specifically the checkpoint of the future it is envisaged
[12:11.880 --> 12:15.920]  that the passenger will be able to flow through the security checkpoint without
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.800]  interruption this is what I after which is the airline industry trade body is
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.960]  hoping will become commonplace around the world a sort of one-stop-shop for
[12:25.960 --> 12:32.680]  security from the curb to the gate as they say with dignity a microscopic tag
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.640]  being planted in a person's body to track is every movement there's actual
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.720]  discussion about that you will rule on that mark my words before your tenure is
[12:41.720 --> 12:46.880]  over mark my words huh more like the mark of the beast even though it is called
[12:46.880 --> 12:51.920]  a tattoo there is no need to piercer puncture the skin instead the device
[12:51.920 --> 12:57.080]  sticks on so what we can do then is we can take this device laminated on the
[12:57.080 --> 13:01.200]  skin it occurs to me I've got them in my dogs why wouldn't I have them in small
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.360]  children there are also several products available to keep track of children many
[13:05.360 --> 13:10.400]  of them act as emergency cell phones and tracking devices with some even able to
[13:10.400 --> 13:16.040]  display on a map the places your child has visited they told you we're giving
[13:16.040 --> 13:24.440]  you a nano tracker chip yeah to think something so small can connect you to
[13:24.440 --> 13:32.480]  everything that matters because I'm in love with my kids kids because my car
[13:32.480 --> 13:41.000]  lost control while driving because now I'm looking out for both of us thank you
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.200]  Satan because I have diabetes but it doesn't have me because I'm an idiot
[13:47.200 --> 13:53.840]  because I spend my life in the ER trying to save yours
[13:53.840 --> 14:04.880]  Darren McBreen of info wars one of our researchers and host put that piece
[14:04.880 --> 14:11.360]  together looking at the last six seven eight years of propaganda just a
[14:11.360 --> 14:15.800]  snapshot a skimming of the propaganda pushing and plantable microchips I
[14:15.800 --> 14:21.600]  remember 20 years ago being on air warning people about the plan to have
[14:21.600 --> 14:26.800]  the Internet of Things smart dust RFID chips in all products RFID chips in all
[14:26.800 --> 14:33.840]  of the swallowing prescription pills chips and children at birth brain chips
[14:33.840 --> 14:42.320]  in the military brain chips to buy and sell brain chips to travel chips under
[14:42.320 --> 14:48.920]  the skin to travel and being called a crazy man even though I had DARPA
[14:48.920 --> 14:53.120]  documents that were public Federation of Scientists documents all these other
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.400]  statements that this was the world that was being built and that every
[14:57.400 --> 15:03.040]  appliance would have tracker devices in it to then dial into all other devices
[15:03.040 --> 15:10.760]  and surveil everything you do for global carbon taxes this was public 20
[15:10.760 --> 15:20.240]  years ago in 1995 the year I launched info wars and I would get up there on
[15:20.240 --> 15:25.760]  air and read MIT magazines and read trade publications and read Department of
[15:25.760 --> 15:29.640]  Defense reports that were public I would read reports where the Secretary of
[15:29.640 --> 15:34.360]  Defense admitted that we had earthquake weapons seismic weapons it was in Army
[15:34.360 --> 15:43.480]  times April 28th 1996 97 and I'm just kind of flashing back here to the
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.560]  thousands and thousands and thousands I mean there's got to be 15 articles a
[15:48.560 --> 15:52.200]  day about this just in today's news when I say thousands out of thousands of
[15:52.200 --> 16:00.520]  broadcast it's tens of thousands of total admissions of the set global plan to
[16:00.520 --> 16:07.760]  bring in a grid of basically omnipresent surveillance to not empower
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.720]  humanity but enslave humanity as well I think about how far we've come from
[16:13.720 --> 16:20.400]  they'll never try to chip us in 1995 to 1998 oh very chip if you want to get in
[16:20.400 --> 16:25.120]  all these bars and restaurants and in businesses in Europe and other areas
[16:25.120 --> 16:31.920]  you've got to have a chip the Baja Beach Club in Spain or the Baja Beach Club
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.720]  in Miami you want to get into the VIP champagne room with the models you've
[16:37.720 --> 16:43.600]  got to have a chip isn't that fitting and then oh the Mexican attorney general
[16:43.600 --> 16:48.160]  and over a thousand of his workers have to get the chip and now last week stock
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.000]  home microchipped office workers feel very modern using hand implanted chips to
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.400]  open doors that's in the Wall Street Journal just a few weeks ago February
[16:58.400 --> 17:04.000]  27th after we reported it and I point that out that we'll report it when it's
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.360]  in a trade publication and then it's in the Wall Street Journal the New York
[17:07.360 --> 17:12.000]  Times saying how great it is we'll first report saying they're using drones to
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.480]  spy on farmers and arrest people that build barns in Colorado or have quote
[17:16.480 --> 17:23.840]  wetlands oh your coke shot up but then they report on last week London
[17:23.840 --> 17:28.120]  Telegraph why your smartphone records everything you say they go on to say
[17:28.120 --> 17:31.280]  the terms and conditions show that everything you're saying is being
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.880]  recorded and being sent back to be datamined this is not me telling you
[17:36.880 --> 17:43.640]  this and it's a malevolent plan it's not a nice plan it's not a good plan it's a
[17:43.640 --> 17:49.400]  very very wicked plan and that's why they have the war on lemonade stands that
[17:49.400 --> 17:52.880]  Forbes reported on two years ago because the enemy is any independent
[17:52.880 --> 17:59.240]  grassroots operation every few days I see articles in California or New Mexico
[17:59.240 --> 18:03.840]  or Texas or Vermont this is just the last week or two where they'll have like
[18:03.840 --> 18:07.640]  these parties where people get together and cook organic food and a few hundred
[18:07.640 --> 18:13.240]  people show up at a ranch house and drink wine and then the government every

[23:37.240 --> 23:41.800]  heart attack and stroke one day I heard an ad for heart and body extract and I
[23:41.800 --> 23:47.200]  was skeptical but I decided to give it a try man the numbers don't lie learn the
[23:47.200 --> 23:51.400]  secrets of an effective natural 100% organic nutritional supplement for a
[23:51.400 --> 24:07.920]  healthy heart and circulation at hbextract.com
[24:07.920 --> 24:21.960]  Richard just pointed out that we should add to that video intro on the market
[24:21.960 --> 24:30.120]  the beast that we just aired earlier clips from 1997 so where I got arrested
[24:30.120 --> 24:35.480]  for demonstrating and refusing a thumb scan showing how the illegals could
[24:35.480 --> 24:39.200]  basically get driver's license so it wasn't about security the borders were
[24:39.200 --> 24:45.520]  wide open then they're even more open now and that I had my insurance card my
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.920]  old driver's license passport and five other forms of identification I had eight
[24:51.920 --> 24:55.040]  birth certificate you name it and that wasn't good enough they wanted my
[24:55.040 --> 25:01.880]  biometric thumbprint because they want to force us off of cash to raise taxes to
[25:01.880 --> 25:07.560]  a point that they bankrupt society and they know that when they're bankrupting
[25:07.560 --> 25:13.160]  a society that will force everyone underground into an underground economy
[25:13.160 --> 25:18.000]  to survive so they want those basic survival and adaptations and
[25:18.000 --> 25:28.040]  perseverance skills to be removed so just as a primitive human with my head
[25:28.040 --> 25:34.360]  screwed on straight I recognized because I was a history buff the historical
[25:34.360 --> 25:46.160]  repeat with a high-tech integration and overlay that was taking place and I knew
[25:46.160 --> 25:52.960]  that our world was being converted to a prison planet hence the launch of
[25:52.960 --> 26:04.160]  prisonplanet.com in 1999 info wars in 1996 this radio TV production system
[26:04.160 --> 26:10.880]  1995 and when I sit here and continually point out we warned you we warned you
[26:10.880 --> 26:15.960]  warned you it's not to say we're great guys it's to say we're telling you now
[26:15.960 --> 26:26.280]  the rest of the story and where this road leads us and it leads us to a very
[26:26.280 --> 26:30.960]  bad place indeed but the mind control the distractions the conditioning the
[26:30.960 --> 26:36.120]  misdirection is so sophisticated that even as pediatric cancers cancers and
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.600]  children are up more than 10,000% in the west even as neurological disorders are
[26:41.600 --> 26:46.160]  up several thousand percent just since the 60s even as breast cancers are up
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.360]  multi-thousand percentage points diabetes up multi-thousand percentage
[26:50.360 --> 26:57.200]  points autism up multi-thousand percentage points what is one in 25,000
[26:57.200 --> 27:02.520]  30 years ago one in 56 today. In fact guys will you give me the
[27:02.520 --> 27:06.440]  number on that how many thousand percentage points increase that is for
[27:06.440 --> 27:15.680]  the calculator how do you do that simple equation one in 56 one in 52 they
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.840]  debate the numbers they change every year it's set to be one in 10 by 2025 but
[27:21.840 --> 27:30.560]  but let's say one in 56 how big an increase is one in 56 from one in 25,000
[27:30.560 --> 27:34.920]  where if there was an autistic person doctors would travel the country by
[27:34.920 --> 27:41.920]  train or by bus or by by by aircraft to marvel at the autistic child to marvel
[27:41.920 --> 27:54.480]  at the unicorn to marvel at this narwhal of rarity of rarefied research the
[27:54.480 --> 28:02.120]  same with children with pediatric cancer who have developed it very rare they
[28:02.120 --> 28:06.640]  would come from all over the world to marvel at it now you can walk into any
[28:06.640 --> 28:10.200]  school or walk down the street and see the victims I'm going to come back in
[28:10.200 --> 28:13.760]  the long segment and hit all the news but we're under attack and that's why

[28:30.920 --> 28:37.760]  Catholic north against south man against woman we have to transcend that and
[28:37.760 --> 28:41.840]  realize the globalists are outside the box they've transcended it they've
[28:41.840 --> 28:48.120]  transcended it from an evil anti-human greedy selfish elitist arrogant
[28:48.120 --> 29:01.160]  narcissistic rage-based wings on wings of disdain and hatred they have scaled the
[29:01.160 --> 29:08.640]  heights and we live in their world their compartmentalized programmed false
[29:08.640 --> 29:14.080]  reality we're being eased into a false reality reality runs parallel to their
[29:14.080 --> 29:20.560]  false reality but more and more people fall to the matrix the proto matrix more
[29:20.560 --> 29:24.560]  and more fall to their smartphones and 10 hours of TV and video games and

[33:38.280 --> 33:48.280]  last night
[33:48.280 --> 33:54.120]  my mother's dinner on Sunday night and he said will you please stop singing on
[33:54.120 --> 34:01.320]  show he said it's really horrible and it's out of tune most of time and even
[34:01.320 --> 34:06.240]  know how to sing in tune why do you do it and I said dad I just can't help it
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.760]  and I'm gonna continue to do it because I just I'm teleprompter free and I'm
[34:10.760 --> 34:15.320]  obnoxious and that's why people love the broadcast and put up with me is
[34:15.320 --> 34:21.000]  because it's just real and I got to have a little bit of fun here I'll go
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.400]  crazy you got to be a little nuts or you might go completely insane in a world
[34:26.400 --> 34:28.880]  like this
[34:28.880 --> 34:39.560]  where to begin where to start there is so much to cover here well this all ties
[34:39.560 --> 34:43.560]  into Hillary and the Homeland Security I see a connection here to all this
[34:43.560 --> 34:48.960]  little constellation of articles so let me hit this first this is from Aaron
[34:48.960 --> 34:54.280]  Klein it's in the emails out of Hillary's private secret email account that
[34:54.280 --> 34:58.400]  she even had her own servers for showing the pre-meditated fraud when she was
[34:58.400 --> 35:04.400]  being subpoenaed on information to cover it up which is called absconding or
[35:04.400 --> 35:12.840]  obstruction of justice a conspiracy to hide criminal activity that's why Sheila
[35:12.840 --> 35:19.480]  Jackson had a step down from the command base that she ran there at the EPA with
[35:19.480 --> 35:24.880]  all her carbon taxing was because she got caught with a gnome to plume that is
[35:24.880 --> 35:31.040]  a pen name an alias and a fake email account my fake email account an email
[35:31.040 --> 35:34.000]  account that was not a governmental account that she was doing governmental
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.760]  business through and Hillary has been caught with multiple accounts with
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.840]  gnome to plumes conducting government business with a bunch of other aliases
[35:44.840 --> 35:50.960]  and code words and I can tell you right now that these code word people are
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.800]  going to be folks like Barack Obama Michelle Obama and then Hillary's known
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.720]  girlfriend that is a top administrator in the White House that she travels with
[36:00.720 --> 36:06.280]  and this has been seen snuggling with in public which is okay fine just just you
[36:06.280 --> 36:10.720]  know don't deny it you're so proud of being a bisexual lesbian then just
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.400]  announce it and eat the same food the kids eat the school lunch program but you
[36:15.400 --> 36:20.320]  know I digress from there all of this is beginning to come out now but it ties
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.880]  into this story at world net daily right now Saudi money financed Benghazi
[36:24.880 --> 36:28.600]  attack hacked email show Intel reportedly sent to Hillary by Clinton
[36:28.600 --> 36:33.600]  White House staffer an email reportedly sent to Hillary Clinton by former
[36:33.600 --> 36:38.080]  Clinton White House staffer Sydney Blumenthal quotes an intelligent source
[36:38.080 --> 36:43.640]  providing information that wealthy Sunni Islamists in Saudi Arabia fond of the
[36:43.640 --> 36:49.600]  September 11th 2012 attack on the US special mission in Benghazi you mean
[36:49.600 --> 36:53.400]  Saudi Arabia funded the takeover of Libya through Benghazi in the two years
[36:53.400 --> 36:58.400]  before that and you mean you mean they're involved I mean as if everyone
[36:58.400 --> 37:03.560]  doesn't already know this but here it is yet again documented the leaked emails
[37:03.560 --> 37:07.680]  were published by Russia today which says it was forwarded emails from
[37:07.680 --> 37:13.800]  Blumenthal's AOL account by a hacker using the alias Guccifer who they've got
[37:13.800 --> 37:18.480]  in prison right now what is it in Romania of course turns out as a
[37:18.480 --> 37:22.560]  listener of this show Guccifer reportedly hacked Blumenthal's email in
[37:22.560 --> 37:30.240]  March of 2013 Guccifer has since been identified as Marciel Lazar Leith a
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.920]  Romanian hacker serving a seven-year sentence for hacking into accounts of
[37:33.920 --> 37:37.640]  Romanian government officials he tried to meet with the New York Times and
[37:37.640 --> 37:42.360]  others to give him this and of course the New York Times didn't want it so guess
[37:42.360 --> 37:47.200]  who does the Ruskies doesn't mean the Ruskies are good guys but that's why
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.800]  separation of powers are good in a government or in a world because
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.600]  national sovereignty acts like a firewall and the fact that the Russians
[37:55.600 --> 38:00.400]  will publish this stuff that the New York Times won't just like the Snowden
[38:00.400 --> 38:06.360]  really worries the establishment member Guccifer was talking about the
[38:06.360 --> 38:09.400]  Bilderberg group and global government what he got out of government officials
[38:09.400 --> 38:13.920]  emails and he admittedly got into hundreds of them and now the Russians
[38:13.920 --> 38:19.560]  have it all enjoy yourself Hillary the Russians don't appreciate the jihadis
[38:19.560 --> 38:24.200]  attacking them trying to destabilize their entire country they're gonna burn
[38:24.200 --> 38:31.140]  you witch politically maybe just throw a bucket of water on you I'll get you
[38:31.140 --> 38:44.160]  when you're little dog to my pretty these things must be done let's continue here
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.200]  the leaked emails were published by Russia today and came from Guccifer which
[38:49.200 --> 38:54.240]  they've been sitting on they will have no wine until it's time the alleged
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.800]  memos concern information women fall says he gleaned about the Benghazi attack
[38:58.800 --> 39:05.420]  in the January 2013 hostage crisis at the gas complex in Algeria and it goes
[39:05.420 --> 39:12.980]  on that dovetails with this little little dobblet Europe will face a 9-11
[39:12.980 --> 39:17.700]  within two years Colonel Gaddafi's cousin says they're going all throughout
[39:17.700 --> 39:20.940]  Europe within one year two years you will have another not September 11 he's
[39:20.940 --> 39:26.220]  not threatening he's saying the same Al Qaeda that has been given control of
[39:26.220 --> 39:29.660]  Libyan and now making a failed state they go oh Hillary screwed up now it was
[39:29.660 --> 39:35.500]  by design now are saying they're gonna 9-11 Europe and he's agreeing with that
[39:35.500 --> 39:41.140]  and now the EU says they're bracing for new 9-11 the FBI said last week ISIS in
[39:41.140 --> 39:44.740]  Al Qaeda is in all 50 states suddenly from being degraded and defeated and
[39:44.740 --> 39:50.060]  destroyed to just bat from the dead like the phoenix Frankenstein bigger batter
[39:50.060 --> 39:54.900]  meaner and the answer is more taxes were Homeland Security and taking your
[39:54.900 --> 40:00.060]  freedoms and spying on everything you do and arresting tea partiers and arresting
[40:00.060 --> 40:03.940]  filmmakers and harassing pro-lifers with Homeland Security while the border
[40:03.940 --> 40:11.780]  stays wide open that will protect us isn't that just special now that then
[40:11.780 --> 40:17.500]  dovetails with Hillary and her other email scandals that tie into this
[40:17.500 --> 40:23.140]  Clinton ran own computer system for her official email see that's what lowest
[40:23.140 --> 40:25.620]  learner kept saying they'd lost the emails on a hard drive they're always
[40:25.620 --> 40:30.740]  kept on a separate server and then would never say and block subpoenas and
[40:30.740 --> 40:34.060]  wouldn't answer subpoenas about where those servers were then once Congress
[40:34.060 --> 40:38.060]  even learn where they were Congress suddenly didn't want them it's a big
[40:38.060 --> 40:42.580]  blackmail game up there at the top the computer server that transmitted and
[40:42.580 --> 40:46.420]  received Hillary Clinton's emails on a private account she used exclusively for
[40:46.420 --> 40:50.820]  official business when she was Secretary of State traced back to an internet
[40:50.820 --> 40:55.940]  service registry to her family's home in New York
[40:55.940 --> 41:01.100]  is Chappaquita according to internet records reviewed by the Associated
[41:01.100 --> 41:05.780]  Press the highly unusual practice of a cabinet level official highly illegal
[41:05.780 --> 41:11.100]  practice remember they took Obama's blackberry away because it could be hacked
[41:11.100 --> 41:15.700]  remotely the highly unusual practice of a cabinet level official physically
[41:15.700 --> 41:18.780]  running her own email would have gotten Clinton the presumptive Democratic
[41:18.780 --> 41:22.020]  presidential candidate impressive control over limiting access to her message
[41:22.020 --> 41:26.100]  archives would also distinguish Clinton's secret of email practices is far
[41:26.100 --> 41:30.300]  more sophisticated than some politicians because she's been CIA since out of high
[41:30.300 --> 41:39.100]  school folks putting Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin and then it just goes on to
[41:39.100 --> 41:42.460]  break this down Congress will probe Hillary Clinton's emails another
[41:42.460 --> 41:46.980]  headline at a New York Post Benghazi committee says Hillary use multiple
[41:46.980 --> 41:51.860]  personal email accounts politico maybe Hillary Clinton should retire her
[41:51.860 --> 41:55.940]  White House dreams national journal
[41:58.820 --> 42:04.780]  using private email Hillary Clinton forwarded records request well who is
[42:04.780 --> 42:11.180]  Eric Houghton ham Clinton's private server listed under mysterious
[42:11.180 --> 42:16.780]  untraceable name well that's what Sheila Jackson did at the EPA was a bunch of
[42:16.780 --> 42:22.740]  fake names this is what criminals do folks Lisa Jackson whatever the idiot's
[42:22.740 --> 42:27.980]  name is teleprompter free I get these names wrong sometimes by the way were
[42:27.980 --> 42:37.500]  you just on air Nico I was not I will give a cigar to whoever in there when
[42:37.500 --> 42:42.340]  you guys correct me or or help me out I think it adds to the show when I get
[42:42.340 --> 42:46.780]  something wrong because I go 100% for memory most of the time that you pop in
[42:46.780 --> 42:51.260]  and just correct me openly on there we've had a lot of how many things we
[42:51.260 --> 42:55.900]  had about this more than I can count you're on air right now right I'm on

[43:00.780 --> 43:06.340]  don't know how I can get you guys unless you think something's really inappropriate
[43:06.340 --> 43:10.940]  I'd like to be corrected openly on air now I understand you guys want to make
[43:10.940 --> 43:15.140]  sure you're correct you usually are be careful what you asked for be careful
[43:15.140 --> 43:20.300]  what you asked for well let's try it out let's just try what I want how's that
[43:20.300 --> 43:31.380]  sound thank you mold count is off the chart today in Austin Texas and it does
[43:31.380 --> 43:36.180]  not really hurt other than the fact that it makes my voice particularly deep and
[43:36.180 --> 43:41.780]  annoying sounding so I'm not trying to sound like this right now this is what
[43:41.780 --> 43:45.140]  I sound like this is what I sound like most people when they hold their nose
[43:45.140 --> 43:50.340]  sound like a mouse this is why I sound like when my nose that actually adds
[43:50.340 --> 43:57.940]  a twang to my speech is not stopped up and I am attempting as best I can to not
[43:57.940 --> 44:08.740]  sound like a smog from the Hobbit movie you disgusting Lakeman
[44:11.980 --> 44:17.380]  okay we're to go next there is so much to get to we do have Wilking how big on
[44:17.380 --> 44:20.980]  the latest on the Sandy Hook cover-up and I don't know what happened to Sandy Hook
[44:20.980 --> 44:24.980]  but it's as funny as a $3 bill
[44:24.980 --> 44:29.660]  kind of like somebody's radically swerving down the road driving crazy
[44:29.660 --> 44:33.780]  they're either having a stroke or an epileptic event or a diabetic shock or
[44:33.780 --> 44:37.420]  they've had a half a gallon of Jack Daniels or something and if I'm a cop
[44:37.420 --> 44:40.980]  I'm pulling them over and I don't know what's going on but something's going on
[44:40.980 --> 44:50.300]  same thing with Sandy Hook just like 9-11 it is as phony as a $3 bill does that
[44:50.300 --> 44:53.340]  mean I know who printed it who counterfeited it does that mean I know
[44:53.340 --> 44:56.860]  the whole story no I just know it's fake they don't make $3 bills they make
[44:56.860 --> 45:01.460]  $2 bills they make $1 bills they make $100 bills they make $1,000 bills they
[45:01.460 --> 45:05.380]  make $50 bills they make $10 bills they make $20 bills they make $100,000
[45:05.380 --> 45:11.980]  bills what is the biggest bill they make is it 10 million I know interesting
[45:11.980 --> 45:21.540]  interesting factoid but long story short here today 9-11 has been proven to be a
[45:21.540 --> 45:25.660]  real fraud bare minimum a stand down Saudi Arabia running the attacks 9-11
[45:25.660 --> 45:30.460]  Commission report sealed but leaked pretty big deal do we get apologies in
[45:30.460 --> 45:38.060]  the 9-11 truth community who have been demonized persecuted and attacked no and
[45:38.060 --> 45:43.500]  now we told you within days of Benghazi that it was Saudi Arabia in a hit to take
[45:43.500 --> 45:47.460]  out the ambassador who was not going along with transferring three warehouses
[45:47.460 --> 45:53.900]  of high-power kinetic weapons service air missiles anti-tank missiles you name it
[45:53.900 --> 46:00.260]  by the tens of thousands to Al Qaeda and he had to be killed so that whatever
[46:00.260 --> 46:04.100]  Al Qaeda is going to do now changing their name to ISIS can shoot down
[46:04.100 --> 46:08.940]  airliners blow stuff up hold the West hostage then the government can take
[46:08.940 --> 46:11.900]  our liberties and freedoms the name of protecting us and there's plausible
[46:11.900 --> 46:18.180]  deniability because they were fenced out to a bunch of crazy jihadis and that is
[46:18.180 --> 46:24.460]  a big fat juicy false flag in the making
[46:26.460 --> 46:31.740]  so I don't know exactly what they're planning I haven't put all the pieces
[46:31.740 --> 46:37.300]  together about what's going on but let me tell you something it's not good it's
[46:37.300 --> 46:47.300]  nasty it's bad it's serious and it has world-shaking provocations in the mix
[46:47.300 --> 46:51.540]  and if you expand on all of that
[46:53.020 --> 46:58.420]  you can see how terrorism and a destabilizing global list of proxy
[46:58.420 --> 47:04.660]  war conflicts are going to be used to bring in this planetary regime but don't
[47:04.660 --> 47:11.740]  criticize radical Islam in the totalitarian authoritarian control
[47:11.740 --> 47:17.340]  freak ivory towers of higher education where most degrees give you nothing but
[47:17.340 --> 47:22.260]  a giant student-alone system that you'll never be able to pay off
[47:22.580 --> 47:29.220]  here's the headline from campus forum you can't make fun of terrorists at the
[47:29.220 --> 47:34.340]  University of Minnesota the Minnesota Republic published a back cover mocking
[47:34.340 --> 47:39.780]  terrorists 2011 but that doesn't matter the University of Minnesota's funding
[47:39.780 --> 47:43.060]  committee said that the cover demonstrated an overt lack of sensitivity
[47:43.060 --> 47:48.020]  see free speeches know when it's not sensitive for the portrayal of members
[47:48.020 --> 47:53.260]  of the Arab world so you could show you know a crazy Yosemite Sam and they'd
[47:53.260 --> 47:57.700]  say that that hurts cowboys feelings such material could according to the
[47:57.700 --> 48:02.380]  committee compromise the cultural harmony see your free speech ends when it
[48:02.380 --> 48:08.580]  hurts harmony that is cult-like control compromise the cultural harmony of the
[48:08.580 --> 48:14.940]  campus no student or student group at a public University should have to fight
[48:14.940 --> 48:18.980]  for their first amendment rights but as I'm preparing for graduation a few short
[48:18.980 --> 48:22.620]  months exactly what I find myself doing fighting for the rights of my student
[48:22.620 --> 48:26.380]  publication I want to get this this this newspaper writer the student newspaper
[48:26.380 --> 48:30.300]  writer on at the Minnesota Republic we pride ourselves standing up freedom of
[48:30.300 --> 48:35.380]  speech on campus because we might not exist without it in the future close
[48:35.380 --> 48:39.580]  attention may be paid to the content published by students at the conservative
[48:39.580 --> 48:44.460]  voice to ensure that any material that is protected with student fee funds does
[48:44.460 --> 48:49.460]  not compromise this is a letter the cultural harmony of the campus our
[48:49.460 --> 48:52.860]  publication derived from the University of Minnesota students for conservative
[48:52.860 --> 48:57.420]  voice allow students on campus to share their viewpoints no matter what even if
[48:57.420 --> 49:02.020]  they are considered offensive the image was one of the students sending out a
[49:02.020 --> 49:11.420]  photo saying the Minnesota Republic terrorist hate it with a toy AK-47 so
[49:11.420 --> 49:15.100]  don't dress up at Halloween as a gay sugar old or an Islamic terrorist or
[49:15.100 --> 49:19.100]  anything as it must be politically incorrect and hurt somebody's feelings
[49:19.100 --> 49:23.180]  and so now the committee has come out and said that they are not to do that or
[49:23.180 --> 49:29.620]  they will get basically sanctioned but they're now questioning a minute the
[49:29.620 --> 49:37.340]  the the student newspapers headlines as well so there you go that's the top
[49:37.340 --> 49:43.940]  stuff that's going on meanwhile Congress sends homeland security bill to
[49:43.940 --> 49:50.220]  Obama without conditions that's right Obama can do whatever he wants with all
[49:50.220 --> 49:56.300]  the money and can basically direct homeland security as a dictator just
[49:56.300 --> 49:59.420]  like on every other front he is that way they can have plausible deniability
[49:59.420 --> 50:02.700]  and said that they as Republicans didn't go along with homeland security
[50:02.700 --> 50:05.420]  running Obamacare homeland security giving free tuition the illegals
[50:05.420 --> 50:09.180]  homeland security paying to ship people here homeland security engaging on all
[50:09.180 --> 50:12.540]  this they can just say here you do whatever you want and by the way
[50:12.540 --> 50:17.660]  Bernanke's in the news when we come back Bernanke wants the US president to
[50:17.660 --> 50:21.060]  declare economic emergencies in future crisis and basically take over from
[50:21.060 --> 50:25.900]  Congress Paul Joseph Watson wrote about this in 2013 when Obama signed an
[50:25.900 --> 50:29.380]  executive order saying that for any emergency including economic he could
[50:29.380 --> 50:33.740]  suspend Congress here's the article ex-treasurer official Obama could use
[50:33.740 --> 50:39.580]  debt crisis to seize total power president declare national emergency past
[50:39.580 --> 50:43.220]  executive order because it's already in places in executive order that he can
[50:43.220 --> 50:47.420]  put another order and suspend Congress we'll go over that coming up and the
[50:47.420 --> 50:50.820]  point is Congress that won't get suspended by the dictator if they go
[50:50.820 --> 50:57.340]  ahead and just become vestigial ceremonial well hind wipers of the
[50:57.340 --> 51:01.900]  dictator in chief harvest right the makers of the only in-home freeze dryer

[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.060]  called for an hour or never why were the ambulances parked down the street these
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:14.060]  are weird press conferences why are you sealing everything why was the school
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.740]  closed till right before what are these weird videos people walking in circles
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.820]  in and out the same people and weird guys caught in the woods that you later
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.340]  cover up man something's going on here and then they the feds in the state
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.460]  police and others to his house in Florida to threatening we better stop
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.500]  investigating well we've been threatening more ways than one here as well
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:38.740]  and when people start threatening you you know you're on to something and when
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:45.180]  people threaten me I got to be careful that I'm not manipulated and predictable
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:51.500]  cuz in the past if somebody threatened me I would immediately go after him legally
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:56.900]  and lawfully sometimes though people mess with you to get you to do that but
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.540]  still I have a tendency that if somebody tries to shut down my free speech
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:07.180]  tries to bully me I can't sleep at night if I don't get in their face and then
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:13.300]  basically figure out what they're up to and basically defeat them I think most
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.220]  people are like that who've got any common sense any sense of justice any
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:23.620]  self-respect but it's not an arrogance that I'm engaging in that I don't like
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:29.300]  being a slave it's just my very DNA my very bones don't like being suppressed
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.620]  don't like being dominated don't like being dumbed down that's why I
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.940]  fundamentally don't like the New World Order because they take knowledge and
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:41.020]  use it to control people instead of taking knowledge and using it to empower
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:46.340]  people because if you're such a great incredible globalist if you're so
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:54.980]  phenomenal and so amazing why then would you need to keep people dumb down to
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:03:02.300]  control them if you were so majestic and so powerful like Yoda says if so
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:08.180]  powerful you are why run the government tells us we shouldn't own guns we
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.700]  shouldn't have horrible food we shouldn't take special training with
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:19.860]  firearms or special training in hand-to-hand combat and self-defense and
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.540]  they demonize anybody that does that and that's why they hate veterans because
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:28.980]  you're a weapon system that no longer works for them and you're the apple of
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.700]  their disdain the apple of their hatred the apple of their disgust because they
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:40.140]  hate you because you're strong because you've done things because you've put
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:46.260]  yourself out there because you're manly because you're womanly you're human and
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:50.660]  the globalist act like a bunch of aliens that's because they are aliens
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.820]  ladies and gentlemen I'll just come right down to it they're not human as we
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.500]  know it and no I don't believe they came from a distant star system or carried
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:08.140]  here on seed pods by the solar wind from the horsehead nebula no they are
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:15.580]  psychopaths and sociopaths they are mentally ill with high IQs and they
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.860]  will see themselves as a separate species because they are they are humans
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.900]  but they are not the same species and the globalists are always writing books
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.940]  and have publications saying that the elite are breaking off and forming their
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.300]  own species because they're willing to be cold-blooded and they see us as animals
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:38.140]  no that does not make you a superior species a super morlock overlord species
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:48.220]  that feeds on the Eloi but I will say this the slouching repros that's a
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:55.140]  proper word of the general public under the globalist dehumanization onslaught

[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.540]  we're gonna open phones in the third hour there is a lot of news that we
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.300]  haven't even gotten to yet in detail police overwhelmingly reject AR-15
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:26.980]  cop killer ammo ban it's offensive and disgusting that they are using officer
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:32.300]  safety as a guise to further infringe the rights of the people that was out of
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:37.380]  police one we've got some other good news I'm gonna get into McDonald's new menu
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:43.060]  policy will only use chickens raised without antibiotics some bad news
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:47.260]  Congress since Homeland Security bill to Obama without conditions meaning Obama
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.900]  will now completely open the border as a blank check to do it from Congress without
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:57.380]  Congress voting just like they did on Obamacare letting him sign thousands of
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:01.360]  orders thousands of waivers and directives to change it and the power
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.420]  plants and the gun ammo ban and everything else and meanwhile three years
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.540]  ago Obama signed an executive order during any emergency including economic
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:15.900]  to even suspend Congress but he doesn't need to because Congress itself is
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:21.740]  suspended itself becoming ceremonial and vestigial there is a big movement to
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.260]  remove Boehner the speaker from his leadership role and that is wonderful
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:30.180]  we to all get behind that because this is getting serious the Republican
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.700]  leadership is wants to sell the country out get rich but be able to blame the
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:37.140]  Democrats when they're all part of it here's the article from two years ago
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:41.900]  Paul Watson x Treasury official Obama could use debt crisis to seize total
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:47.380]  power under orders you can go read the subsections of that and that dovetails
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:51.660]  with a new article today Bernanke wants the US president to declare economic
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:55.420]  emergencies close quote in future crisis president should get the power to
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.220]  declare economic emergency see they already have it on paper but now they're
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:04.860]  selling it as if oh we need it oh we need NSA spine to keep you safe after
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:09.220]  it's already on the books president should get the power to declare economic
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:12.620]  emergencies along the lines declare war to former federal reserve chairman
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.540]  Ben Bernanke yesterday president should get the power to declare economic
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.660]  emergencies along the lines of declaring war said former federal reserve
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.100]  chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday when you get Paul Watson or a Don Salazar
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:27.380]  somebody your kid Daniels your curtain ammo or a McHale fail on one of our
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.540]  great writers to go back to the last few executive orders from two and a half
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:38.380]  years ago like I need to actually print the executive orders off here's market
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:42.820]  watch breaking it down president that's the current announcement but I want to
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.940]  get the actual executive war because I forget the number I think the headline
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:54.380]  from info wars was also another news was something like president Obama signs
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.220]  order and it wasn't executive order was a presidential decision directive
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:04.380]  Obama directive I'm gonna give you the exact headline Obama directive gives
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:13.900]  president power to declare emergency for any crisis including economic we have a
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:19.380]  new article out tying an end to that showing how they're now moving to sell
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:26.380]  it and you notice the season on guns on ammo on borders on war on security on
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:34.140]  spying on energy on every subject it's centralized it's outside Congress it's
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.020]  the president and the bureaucracy and the Congress is signing off because it's a
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:43.460]  premeditated plan and with it comes false flag terror there's an article on
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.900]  info wars.com and prison planet.com that you should send out to everybody you
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:51.860]  know nations all over the world confess to carrying out false flag terrorism
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:57.980]  50 plus links to mainstream news not theory admitted fact because believe me
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:04.260]  this is the next phase of what we're going to see but they don't want to have
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.260]  it the Islamic attacks just yet because then we'll say well why are you bringing
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.300]  a minute record levels the radical Islamists why are you protecting them
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:17.340]  why are you funding them it's gonna be domestic groups they're gonna stage
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:21.860]  events and blame it on domestic groups that is what you can see all the
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:26.900]  conditioning in Hollywood and the print media the fiction the nonfiction they
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.540]  are preparing this to shut down their political opposition and kind of shame
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:37.340]  us into oh the next mass shooting a patriot did it oh a bombing of a mall a
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:41.660]  patriot did it and the Pentagon admits they're training their main enemy
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:45.820]  returning veterans gun owners and things like that you can see the writing on the
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:55.660]  wall an idiot could see this and now that brings me to our guest a very
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:01.660]  intelligent man not an idiot but like most of us believing that other people
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:08.140]  in government corporations are like us not corrupt Wolfgang Halbig moved here
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.780]  when he was young from Germany became a state police officer than a customs
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:16.980]  agent then he started a school safety system became the head of security for
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:23.220]  major universities his system became one of the most dominant after the tragedy
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:28.420]  of Columbine he's been on good morning America you know all the big shows
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:32.940]  CNN you name it and then he began to investigate Sandy Hook and it just
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:35.860]  didn't make sense even gave money to Sandy Hook I'm kind of recapping when
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.500]  he's broken down before he was the National Executive Director of the
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:46.940]  National Institute for School Workplace Safety and he joins us to break this
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.660]  down facebook.com forward slash Sandy Hook Justice
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:53.420]  sandhookjustice.com he has been threatened to shut up and I don't want
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.940]  to get name names because it gives people attention not because I'm scared of
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:00.860]  them I don't want to go down the road of some of these people that are trying to
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:05.180]  shut down our YouTube channel and some of the folks other folks that are
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.660]  threatening us and things I know Wolfgang's been through a lot of this
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.460]  with police coming to his house in another state for the feds and
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.860]  threatening him that's why he's intensified what he's doing but they do
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:21.020]  not want us looking into this and so you know he's a guy from the system but it
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:26.580]  just doesn't add up Mr. Halbig thanks for coming on recap who you are
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:32.340]  recap why you question kind of the top 10 or 15 points that I know are on your
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:38.900]  website of why this doesn't add up and and then now they're really trying to
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:43.940]  to seal everything when they could discredit us any time they wanted to
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:48.420]  just tell us why Anderson Cooper's nose disappears what's blue screen just
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.460]  tell us why the people are walking in circles and out of the building it
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.460]  appears to be staged tell us why they said they didn't catch somebody in the
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.060]  woods when they did tell us why the school was closed before and then after
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.420]  why they've sealed it all why they've not torn it down tell us why Bloomberg
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.420]  sent an email to his people the day before saying get ready to launch an
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.300]  operation to capitalize on the mass shooting tell us why you didn't launch
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:12.540]  the emergency helicopters tell us whether the ambulance has parked for an
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:17.420]  hour down the road tell us you know tell us why this appears to be as
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:27.060]  funny as $3 bill Wolfgang thank you for joining us thanks a lot Alex and thank God you have a voice I'm glad info wars is out there and
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:33.500]  the people that are attacking you now they are coming after me I mean they're
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.980]  just coming after me I mean they're destroying my family they've destroyed my
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.420]  business and I'm passionate and the only reason that I really got involved in
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:46.940]  this I'm standing in front of 200 Florida school board members in Tampa
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:52.340]  Florida and Alex they are worried that they may have a sandy hook unfolding in
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:56.900]  their community so they're asking me questions for two hours I can't give
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:01.540]  them the solutions because number one there's not one of us in America that
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:06.500]  knows the truth as to what actually happened in Sandy Hook so what do I do
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:12.780]  I simply ask questions as a national school safety consultant they are so
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:17.660]  simple that anyone should be able to answer that from the school board from
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:23.300]  the city Newtown Police Connecticut State Police to me two years and they're
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:31.660]  refusing to answer my questions well we're getting copyright claims filed on
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.060]  us for just showing news articles and you can't do that we've defeated these
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:39.340]  copyright claims but there's been a lot of other stuff behind the scenes going
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:44.420]  on by other organizations and groups they're really upset about this well
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:50.220]  you know what they need to get ready Alex we're coming if you could be in my
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:54.660]  office right now today beyond the reasonable doubt we have all of the
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:19:00.060]  evidence people anonymously have now come forward from Newtown we now have
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:06.620]  documents that will without a doubt show that that school did not exist it was
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:10.780]  not an operation well you better release those as soon as possible or they're
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.380]  gonna end up I mean you know what happens to people they're gonna claim you

[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:16.820]  the comments section what we need to do is change the way in which people think
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:20.820]  about guns especially young people and really brainwash people into thinking
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:25.660]  about guns in a very different way Frank makes that point yeah this is
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:32.060]  brainwashing oh you can't in your school paper in Minnesota criticize radical

[01:25:56.060 --> 01:26:01.420]  info go over the main points of Sandy Hook as a top safety expert why you
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:05.540]  questioned it there you are successful making a lot of money running nationwide
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:10.420]  programs playing golf you know pretty much quasi retired why would you do all
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:14.020]  this well because it didn't add up I know you've talked about that on there I'm
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:17.820]  not putting words in your mouth but then the latest bombshell you just dropped
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:22.180]  you're saying because we know the school suddenly reopened had been closed
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:26.180]  then and then they tore it down the place was falling apart in photos and
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.940]  videos we saw didn't look like a real school then you add everything together
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:35.340]  looks like a prop a drill did they kill real kids maybe maybe not why didn't
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:38.500]  they call helicopters I mean I keep repeating this it just doesn't add up
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:44.300]  Wolfgang what's the new bombshell info well the new bombshell is info is that
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:48.900]  the subpoenas have been issued across the country we're about to get discovery
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:53.980]  information that is now forthcoming and if they don't provide that's discovery
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:57.940]  information they're going to be in contempt the court and we also have the
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:01.820]  Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission hearing that is supposed to
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:06.940]  already happen they keep dragging it and dragging it but eventually we're
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:11.780]  going to get the truth and the truth is going to show Sandy Hook that school was
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:15.500]  not an operating school and I can tell you that from being a school
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:21.900]  administrator Alex it is the most filthiest the most deplorable school no
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:26.060]  child should have ever or every teacher should never died in such a filthy
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:31.460]  school it is loaded with lip paint it is loaded with asbestos it's loaded with
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:36.700]  PCP and those parents who called it a vanguard school who moved from all over
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.700]  the country they how could you say your kid to that filthy school Alex you and
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:47.100]  I wouldn't send our children to that school before we get into the judge
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.340]  you're filing where all this is going it hasn't got a lot of national
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:54.500]  attention it's gotten some though in the next segment recap what made you first
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:59.580]  start asking questions well what made me start asking questions is being a
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:04.780]  national school a safety expert it took me three days Alex when you don't
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:10.980]  request trauma helicopters that's negligence whether they land or not okay
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:17.580]  that's way but they should at least been requested to not allow paramedics and
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:22.980]  EMTs inside that school all day long when children could his life could have
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:28.460]  been saved that's negligence so they were turning off the default training of
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:35.020]  any police agency absolutely Columbine taught us one thing across America the
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:39.300]  government spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they used the word active
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:44.140]  shooter training well active shooter training Alex is to get in that school
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:49.420]  as quickly as possible neutralize the threat and then you get all the medical
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:54.300]  help that you can find and you get him in there to save lives Alex they never
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:29:00.820]  transported those kids any kids for over an hour I know I mean they had them they
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:04.760]  had him bivouac and gather down the street you know half mile away very
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:10.180]  bizarre and Alex who declared all of those children and teachers legally dead
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:15.860]  in the first 10 minutes when only a doctor or a license registered nurse
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:19.900]  specially certified can do that it's got to be a specially certified nurse or
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:23.300]  coroner and that's usually long after they're dead they come by and put a tag
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.420]  on their toe absolutely in the corner didn't show up for four hours so again
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:34.620]  Alex who declared them legally dead why was every standard procedure ignored and
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:39.380]  why are they covering up now and you know what and we need to hold these people

[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.620]  classified admitted cases where the US government in the last 120 years or so
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:29.300]  has staged bombings attacks mass shootings and blamed it on political
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:34.540]  enemies I don't know exactly what happened at the Boston bombing but I
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:39.980]  know the older Zarno brother who they hunted down and killed was in a CIA
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:45.580]  funded program at a Georgetown infiltrating al-Qaeda groups in Chechnya
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:54.300]  and two years before the Boston bombing the Russians blew his cover the FBI
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:57.620]  lied and so they never heard of him when the Boston bombing happened they now
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:02.660]  chased down the other brother and of course tried to kill him but that failed
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:07.300]  so now stars and stripes says Zarno's lawyer admits he carried out Boston
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:13.140]  bombing well so now the lawyer comes out and says oh he did it it was him Judy
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:18.780]  Clark says oh the lawyers like that isn't that nice he pleads not guilty but
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:24.780]  she says it was him well I know one thing none of that story added up I'm not
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:33.940]  gonna go back into it but I've seen this over and over again false flags don't
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.620]  just happen at the start of the Running Man in fiction movies they are the bread
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:42.100]  and butter of totalitarian elements within governments and who can deny we're
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.460]  going into totalitarian direction that ends up hurting all Americans to the
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:51.780]  tiny group it hurts them as well in the end but they are of their their feather
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:55.780]  birds of a feather flock together of their father the devil I guess you could
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.740]  say for go back to Wolf King W. Halbig I want to open the phones up specifically

[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:20.540]  attack some of the supposed parents of the victims because that opens some
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:27.100]  dangerous doors I don't want to attack Halbig you can bring up any questions or

[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:45.700]  over again and then you've got all these anomalies and clear loop tapes and
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:50.820]  clear blue screen green screens I mean they they really screwed up CNN screwed
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:54.500]  up during the Gulf War with fake green screen stuff the blue screen in that
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:36:00.780]  case chroma key you could have pink screen if you wanted to it's just the
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:05.460]  colors seem to be blue and mint green and you know fake scut attacks that are
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:11.780]  admitted so I just it had all the signs to how they were so ready that day how
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:15.820]  they capitalized on how they rolled out all these groups you look at the aurora
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.420]  shooting there are real shooters there are real people that go in and shoot
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:32.940]  folks up they're crazy people it's not before but he was under on record the
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:36.900]  aurora shooter under the top psychiatrist who headed up the psychiatric
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:43.900]  department for the entire Air Force command of over seven bases in Centonio
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:48.140]  she sent there he's in a secret government-brained DARPA human interface
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:52.780]  program his dad's a top scientist in secret operations he's given hundreds of
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:56.380]  thousands of dollars for the government secret projects and then he's drugged in
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.060]  the parking lot saying he didn't do it and tells people in jail I'm drugged I
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:05.100]  didn't do it then they come out and say oh he wasn't with people at the jail
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:10.580]  where they could hear him and it turned out he was so I mean I've just seen this
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:14.620]  over and over again shooter James Holmes and DARPA weird science is the
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:19.300]  article by Kurt Nemo I mean folks they could grab me for six weeks drug me up
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:23.340]  dump me on the parking lot after they carry out a shooting and I would think
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:27.060]  that I'd done the shooting they could do it to you I mean you can put somebody on
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:31.940]  PCP LSD that's just what they did in the 60s and 70s they got stuff now amnesiacs
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:41.140]  they can give you it is beyond the Manchurian candidate fact 25 years ago
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:46.100]  and I'm gonna go back to our guest they had robo rat brain chips in rats where
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:49.420]  they could send them in to rubble after earthquakes and things and they had
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:54.980]  robo dog but people said it was inhumane so they keep all that stuff on the LD
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:38:02.820]  on the low-down not on the down low it's low-down so they keep it on the LDDL
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:07.780]  but it's a huge program going on so they've got chips where you're just like
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:13.860]  a remote control you're just like a remote control and you could even be
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.620]  thinking I don't want to do this but your your arms your legs I'm not saying
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:24.020]  they've done that I'm just saying that's how far out the technology is that's

[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:28.020]  Wolfgang I want to go to calls but I've been asking some of the questions here I
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:33.140]  want to give you the floor to talk about other facets and but before we do that
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:38.740]  can you tell us about the court case who the judge was or is that sealed where
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:43.580]  this is going what you're subpoenaing what you're looking into and you're
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:47.620]  saying the new bombshell evidence you have that the school wasn't operating
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.980]  when this happened as it appears on the surface to not have been operating well
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:57.700]  I know it's not operating because the school board is refusing to answer all
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:02.420]  of the questions we've asked under the Connecticut foyer information these are
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:09.380]  school board policies that require the school board to inspect every school in
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:14.140]  Newtown and they have to be completed by August 1st of each year that
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:19.980]  inspection report on health and safety and cleanliness inside outside has to
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.780]  be submitted to the superintendent who provides it to the school board guess
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:29.700]  what they tell me we have no such records you cannot tell me as a former
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:33.260]  school administrator that you don't have any records when you have a school board
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:38.660]  policy that requires it that's what I'm telling you they are covering up saying
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:45.860]  you did not operate well when you look at not calling the emergency choppers
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:50.540]  that we know operate in that town you look that up they have the emergency
[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:54.260]  flight the star flight the care flight and they just didn't call when that's
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:57.580]  the default thing you do there's a bunch of kids shot and people you call the
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:01.140]  emergency helicopters and they call those when the cops see a bad car wreck
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:05.540]  it's the default position absolutely but you know I'm really bothered more than
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:09.060]  that they didn't pick up the phone to call the trauma helicopters but
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:13.380]  somebody at the incident command center picked up the yellow pages and called
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:17.860]  for 12 porta-potties to be delivered within the first three hours of this
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:23.540]  mass casually shooting Alex who is sitting there thinking about porta-potties
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:27.740]  when they can't even get the trauma helicopters or the paramedics and EMTs
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:33.180]  inside that school that's outright negligence well they're obviously looking
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:38.420]  for a big PR bonanza and then to bring in all the actors to break down and cry
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:42.260]  and then think we're so stupid they even use the same actors as different
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:46.740]  people I mean all I know is we've all seen the footage and maybe they're real
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:50.140]  parents whatever but when you've got somebody laughing and smiling when watch
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:54.580]  this and then walk it over one and then start crying for the cameras I mean it's
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:59.380]  what about the blue screen and Anderson Cooper's nose disappearing absolutely
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:05.260]  the blue string it's everywhere whether it's at the firehouse whether it's
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:12.500]  Anderson Cooper absolutely they use that as a technology it's like a movie said
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:19.100]  they did whatever they wanted to because guess what they were using emotions the
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:23.860]  death of children and teachers unhooking everybody across the America they
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:30.020]  threw those funerals out there guess what everybody was watching it 24-7 they
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:35.380]  inflicted emotional distress on millions of millions of innocent Americans Alex
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:40.100]  they knew what they were doing they got us in fact can we pull up the clip of the
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.100]  attorney general saying we need to literally brainwash the public when he
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:48.340]  met with the media because clearly they certainly capitalized on it and we're
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:53.500]  certainly ready minute one to do it what about Bloomberg's internal email we
[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:58.900]  took to his anti-gun groups Wolfgang saying get ready we're about to launch a
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:05.540]  major operation absolutely I mean this is so well-planned two two and a half
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:10.340]  years millions of dollars invested think about it you had to get the entire
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:15.580]  community involved from the Catholic priests all the way down to your local
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:22.460]  government agents your select men your city councils through these people the
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:26.460]  arrogant when I flew up there to Hartford, Connecticut, Newtown they're so
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:30.500]  arrogant I believe they all have immunity I think they can do whatever
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:35.580]  they want listen my dad's a dentist and he was approached about four years ago
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:40.380]  by Homeland Security to go to these meetings and then spy on people and my
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:44.300]  dad and the guy was real gave him a card my dad called checked it and my dad had
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.260]  been treating some of his family for decades and so he knew who the guy was
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:50.860]  knew he wasn't college this is a decade later and this guy's with Homeland
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:54.660]  Security and he said yeah my dad said what would I be looking for people
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:58.660]  saying they're gonna do something violent he was no just what your patients
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:03.140]  are thinking politically doing and we want you to influence people basically
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.740]  as an agent and my dad thought they were setting him up because he's my dad no
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:10.740]  they were ignorant didn't even know who he was basically my dad then talked to
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:13.660]  all the other dentists it was happening all over the city under
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:17.420]  infraguard and these other spy programs they tell people you're gonna be part of
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:21.940]  a drill national security and so it's and so because there's an appeal of
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:27.100]  authority and we're doing this for the children they can then canvas and get
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:30.860]  people lined up and then once they're signed on to it they're part of the
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:34.900]  conspiracy and have to keep quiet like the Manhattan Project or so many other
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:40.860]  programs and so under this mantle of of of local spy grids that's how they get
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:45.780]  people to go along with the cover-up well they they really get a good job
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:51.660]  writing the scripts and getting people hooked and the dash cam videos on that
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:57.380]  day Alex these police officers Connecticut and Newtown they actually had
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:03.180]  lunch inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School Alex you can see it now there are
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:08.300]  20 dead bodies you got adults you got the shooter killed himself and people are
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:12.660]  eating lunch inside the same and they're ordering porta-potties anybody that knows
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:17.180]  you see one dead kid you don't eat for a day you go home you cry you throw up you
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:21.620]  don't go have lunch by their dead splattered bodies and if you look at the
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:26.460]  crime scene photos there are more urinals and toilets inside that school
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:31.340]  than I've ever imagined I mean I haven't seen that many then why order porta-potties
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:36.740]  you know why have all the toilets but they order porta-potties eat lunch inside
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:41.620]  the school these people did a bad job writing the script you don't screw with
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:47.660]  public schools unless you know how we operate again you've run majoring
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:50.860]  universities you've advised hundreds of public schools I mean I looked you up
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:55.660]  you started going public the last year you were in the top two or three groups
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:00.220]  consulting nationwide I mean you you were making a lot of money you have no
[01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:02.900]  reason to be doing this to be going public I mean I would imagine you've
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:07.220]  lost a lot of business and you tell that to my wife I am about to kick out of my
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:12.940]  own house after being married 39 years Alex I'm about to lose my family because

[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:20.220]  investigating great personal sacrifice the Sandy Hook mystery and believe me
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:25.660]  it is a mystery it doesn't add up I wish it added up I wish it would never have
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:30.140]  happened but it's a lot less scary to have a lone crazy on Prozac type drugs
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:34.900]  out there than it is to have it be a premeditated government operation
[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:38.860]  Kyle J. Jimmy Eric Rick we're gonna go a little bit of the next hour with our
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:42.460]  guests to take your calls and I'm gonna shift gears and other open phones and a
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:47.140]  ton of news we haven't hit yet but let's go to Kyle in Connecticut speaking of
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:52.700]  the site of this this sad tragedy so tragedy any way you look at it Kyle
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:58.860]  thank you hi Alex yeah really good to be on the air with you I actually run a
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:03.260]  demolition company here in Connecticut I'm about an hour and a half away from
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:09.620]  Newtown site someone approached me months ago about the demolition of a
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:13.940]  suspected shooter's house in Newtown this is before it actually went to public
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:18.860]  vote and this is way before this even happened so I was just wondering like
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:23.460]  between you and Wolfgang what extent these people will go do to cover this up
[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:26.900]  to make it look like that nothing yeah why are they demolishing everything why
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:31.340]  are they passing laws to seal all the records what's going on here Wolfgang
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:36.300]  well again I'm glad Kyle you asked that question I mean think about the
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:41.660]  Sandy Hook Elementary School it has to you have to have a complete environmental
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:46.940]  study before you can demolish an elementary school these people just
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:52.380]  violated every law every regulation and just like the house you know the house
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:56.940]  belongs actually supposedly to the brother of Adam Lanza if he really exists
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:03.100]  I mean there are so much misinformation misdirection and these people do
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:06.620]  whatever they want and you know what they're saying to you and me well you're
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:11.820]  stupid America you're too too lazy to really investigate and again I go back
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:16.380]  to you thank you for calling I'm thinking out let me tell you what people
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:23.060]  need to wake up Sandy Hook is an American game changer when we saw Sandy Hook is
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:27.380]  going to expose Boston bombing it's going to expose 9-11 it's going to go
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:33.260]  down to JFK this government is running them up they are using us and using our
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:38.860]  emotions and guess what they're using the national news media NBC CBS sure let me
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:42.580]  add this in the operation Northwoods it wasn't just fly planes into things and
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:47.540]  blame it on Cuba and Kennedy said no to it they were planning to do fake
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:52.180]  shootings and real shootings in public places as well so he knows has been on
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:56.820]  the board before so he'd be crazy not to ask the question thank you Kyle Jay in
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:59.660]  pencilvania you're on the air with Wolfgang Halbic
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:04.780]  Oh awesome hey I've been really hurting if you touch on it because there are like so

[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:13.420]  boost the caller to me because I everything else is loud but can the
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:16.980]  network boost the caller to me a little bit thank you go I just took off I went

[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.540]  like pick them up on the side of the road and claims you brought them into his
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:35.340]  house like 30 minutes and like just let in the cops and shelves like another
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:40.260]  hour like the some students some somehow ran out of the building and some all

[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:15.060]  team in the school that size would find people in about 15 minutes and the other

[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:55.340]  doing first of all on our license plates out here in Connecticut it says
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:01:01.180]  Constitution State yes that couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth there
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:06.020]  hasn't been any elected county government here since the 90s no sheriff
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:14.220]  they dissolved it all okay so it does it makes it impossible for anyone over the
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:17.820]  people to investigate this well that's right Connecticut is where it all
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:21.420]  started now more than 20 states have done it partially to get rid of sheriffs
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:25.540]  being elected in quote combine them into the city well now you have the city that
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:29.300]  comes from the state and the county what the tail wagging the dog and then the
[02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:37.740]  feds can take it over and one more thing with my own personal investigation with
[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:43.780]  this is you find out who Robbie Parker works for and you start really going

[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:59.020]  us what the chips program was the chip program is you register your kids into a
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:04.380]  database the DNA yeah the mason's pushed that right and in order to like to
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:12.620]  prevent to the or to prevent the like where kids will go missing and you can

[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:24.980]  all in a sort of like how they have the amber alert it's related to that now
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:28.060]  I'm aware of it then and then the schools have little blue boxes where you get the
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:31.700]  DNA out of the cheek and thumb prints and fingerprints and all the rest of it
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:36.020]  thank you so much let's get Wolfgang how books take on what you just said well
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:42.900]  you know I go back Connecticut corruption as a former Florida State Trooper I
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:48.140]  looked at Connecticut State Police do you know the NYPD had to come into
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:53.380]  Connecticut to investigate the entire Connecticut's Police Department and make
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:58.220]  recommendations they had to disband the Connecticut State Police internal
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:03.580]  investigators because they were so corrupt and look where we are today we're
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:09.380]  simply trying to ask such simple questions and they can't even answer them
[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:14.020]  and these are school board policies and I'm begging all of you listeners go to
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:18.980]  Newtown Public Schools click on the school board policies and let me tell
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:24.060]  you what let's use their policies their rules and regulations to answer these
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:28.220]  questions you know what they're in the box and they can't get out and we've
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:34.500]  got them well it's gonna really freak the false flaggers out that people are on

[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:48.100]  Alex it's an honor to talk to you my question for Mr. Halbig is I had heard
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.900]  him say that there had not been one lawsuit filed by the parents of these
[02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:59.260]  supposed children against the school board officials but yet about two months
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:02.620]  ago I saw where a group of the parents were suing the gun
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:08.300]  manufacture that's right I would like to say isn't that just further proof that
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:12.660]  this was a gun control inspired that's right they have an open I mean I mean
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:16.700]  you've got all these kids killed all these kids in danger guaranteed parents
[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:19.860]  or family are gonna end up suing when it's open and shut they're gonna get a
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:24.980]  settlement but they're not doing that they're going after Bushmaster instead
[02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:29.860]  exactly I mean that's the cherry on top well in fact stay there Rick stay there

[02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:45.620]  break it down coming up after I guess leave us I'll expand into Obama's
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:52.540]  latest executive order confiscation of private property that's just some of
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:59.300]  what's coming up the UN drugs body warns us states and Uruguay over cannabis
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:05.020]  legalization the global government says you can't legalize marijuana well I
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:09.060]  don't like what marijuana being abused does with potheds make some live in
[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:12.540]  their mother's basements and turn into gnomes eating hot pockets and playing
[02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:22.180]  world of warcraft in second life but if you expand on that to its logical
[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:27.180]  conclusion when you allow the drugs to be illegal it allows big government
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:30.820]  corporations to ship them in and control them in a black market so the
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:35.300]  answers decriminalization I'm gonna be going over that Wolfgang Halbig top
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:39.900]  school safety advisor one of the top guys in the country questioning sandy hook
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:44.500]  when we even have debates on here now between people that think it's all true
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:50.660]  and don't folks try to censor those I mean this is very unamerican what's
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:54.500]  going on very dangerous we've been investigating it but Rick raised the
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:10:03.980]  point that several years have gone by since the show the event that was the
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:08.380]  the tragic trauma-based mind control that was saying the hook any way you look
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:17.380]  at it and now finally the families are looking at some local suits but they
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:21.260]  haven't gotten into that yet they're suing bushmaster they'll never win that
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:27.220]  suit not even with tear jerking pulling the strings the heart strings on a
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:31.660]  stupid jury but they would win on the helicopters not being called on the
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:34.980]  ambulance is standing down there would have been huge settlements but they don't
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:37.900]  want that they don't want to sue the government they don't want to sue the
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:43.940]  school that is another giant red flag that Rick and West Virginia brought up
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:46.580]  we're gonna get Wolfgang Halbig's response to that in a moment but
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:50.020]  anything else you want to add Rick because you're a pretty smart cookie I'm I
[02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:56.380]  appreciate you bringing that up well I just like to ask too is what what can
[02:10:56.380 --> 02:11:00.820]  we do to bring the truth out about this whenever they the officials keep
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:08.260]  destroying all the evidence Wolfgang I mean you know my my answer is this and
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:12.980]  I've been saying this now for two years ever since I got involved the only way
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:18.500]  that we are ever gonna get the truth is by these subpoenas is getting these
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:23.060]  people to raise their right hand and you got to find the weakest link there are
[02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:27.700]  people out there they better get ready because they're gonna their depositions
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:31.260]  are going to be taken and I'm gonna tell you they're gonna be video depositions
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:36.020]  and this is how we're gonna get the truth they were never expecting us to come
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:40.340]  along to do this they thought we were just gonna go away it has to be done
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:44.580]  through depositions and they're gonna have to hire attorneys and of course you
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:48.900]  said you were gonna drop this till they sent the state police to your house to
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:53.540]  basically threaten you for the Feds I'm gonna repeat that statement well yeah
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:58.460]  until they send two homicide investigators to my house I was quiet as
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:01.980]  amounts you would have never you and I would have never met and but when they
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:05.700]  come into my home a week before Christmas with my grandkids and they
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:09.620]  threaten and intimidate me tell me I'm gonna be arrested and I'm gonna go to
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:14.580]  jail and then two weeks later definitely shares in the uniform come to my house
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:19.700]  they said the new town police chief Mike well the police chief wants to know if I
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:24.420]  own handguns and if I ever come to new town I need to check in at the police
[02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:28.700]  station and then I get a phone call from the Southbury Police Department a
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:33.820]  sergeant to tell me never ever to call the Southbury Porta Potty Company again
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:39.140]  let me tell you I'm tired of that I'm an American I'm a naturalized citizen I
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:44.700]  have a right to ask questions they're not offensive and they're not rude well
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:47.580]  even though they were offensive you have a right the first amendment sack were
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:51.820]  saying they're trying to overturn it right now well I'm going to be polite
[02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:55.060]  and courteous you know when you're a school administrator you deal with
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:58.780]  thousands and thousands no no I agree it's good to be polite I'm just saying the
[02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:04.340]  first amendment has even higher standard protection I agree and you know
[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:07.180]  that's what they're doing you're attacking our first amendment second
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:12.300]  amendment and here's the thing Alex what people don't see that's coming
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:18.220]  Connecticut right now is passing laws that any parent who home screws their
[02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:23.500]  child is going to have to have a complete medical mental health examination I
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:27.740]  think about what we're doing to parents and children they got to have a
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:33.860]  complete mental health examination why
[02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:39.100]  well it's a fishing expedition and it's a way to demonize homeschoolers and it's
[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:42.660]  worse than that statistically homeschoolers get the most scholarships
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:48.140]  have the best grades the lowest crime rate absolutely and so it's becoming so
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:52.780]  popular they're trying to shut it down right now yeah and Alex I wish you
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:56.780]  producer had that clip on the chase in the woods I think that's how I'd like to
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:00.340]  end it with you if you allow me well sure we can play the clip where they
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:03.140]  supposedly catch the guy in camo in the woods and then say it never happened
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:08.420]  right the end your info warriors need to see this and they need to spread this
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:14.300]  message loud and clear they need to see this clip they're chasing a man in the
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:21.540]  woods at 12 23 p.m. on December 14 2000 and trying to think about it why are you
[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:31.020]  chasing them after lunch I nobody can explain that this is actually footage
[02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:36.300]  from a live helicopter and I think the reporter had no clue what he was seeing
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:40.820]  take a look right there they're running they're chasing each other at 12 23
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:44.780]  they're running by a storage shed that's our bitty broken open by the
[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:50.220]  Connecticut State Police it's 12 23 they're running up into the woods they're
[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:56.460]  chasing each other but Alex nobody knows who's chasing who the school was deemed
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:02.580]  completely safe by 10 30 a.m. that morning if that is a true statement look
[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:06.220]  at these guys they're actually walking away from saying you know it makes it
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:11.780]  look like they're going to send you know everything has been documented sure
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:15.820]  they're shooting footage the later show the police you know trying to chase bad
[02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:20.020]  guys but it's actually all scripted just like a movie they were just shooting it
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:24.140]  later in production that's why they said that the event never happened and
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:27.940]  didn't know that the helicopter footage had already gone out thank you now that's
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:33.300]  true because at 9 39 that morning all you have to do is take the Newtown police
[02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:38.380]  dispatcher see he got he got everybody in America hook in partnership with the
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:43.100]  national news media at 9 39 he broadcasts where everybody hears it a
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:48.700]  teacher just reported seeing two shadows running behind the gym well guess
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:52.820]  what I'm watching I want to see them catch those two shadows maybe there's
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:57.020]  going to be a shootout and then the national news media they show the
[02:15:57.020 --> 02:16:02.060]  chase into the woods assuming Alex that you and I are watching a chase in the
[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:06.620]  morning and we're going to bring the shooting to closure Alex that shooting
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:11.540]  chase didn't happen till after lunch they know they didn't even scripted it's
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:15.620]  kind of like when they in Indonesia and a couple other countries had Lee Harvey
[02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:20.460]  Oswald caught as the shooter of Kennedy about an hour before they even grabbed
[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:23.500]  him and then it was hours after that so they declared his name they got the
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:28.340]  time zone screwed up just like on 9 11 they blew up building 7 early and said
[02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:32.300]  oh it's falling it fell in its own footprint an hour before it fell and
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:35.620]  then 25 minutes before it fell they announced it fell but the reporters like
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:41.220]  but it hasn't fallen and I said BBC fed by Reuters Reuters jumped the gun five
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:45.840]  years later they admitted yes we were given that by Reuters so we just keep
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:50.340]  catching them Rick thanks for the call Dave quick question for Wolfgang
[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:57.260]  Halbig go ahead hi hi Alex and Wolfgang stay after these guys because we got him
[02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:03.700]  on the run I watched the quarter and he said that the rifle is what caused all
[02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:08.500]  those wounds and then later on the news I saw hey Adam lands his rifle was in his
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:12.740]  car and it's kind of strange to me that they don't even try to change their
[02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:16.700]  story or anything it's just out there forced to see well they said Obamacare
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:20.660]  would cut your prices and it hasn't they said two plus two equal five it's just
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:23.500]  they're a pack of liars
[02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:29.860]  you know Obama said raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt a good
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:34.980]  point Dave let's go to Jim and Connecticut you're on the air Jim come on

[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:12.780]  school board policy it's a law they don't have a choice they must respond all

[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:25.940]  at some of the mental health regulations that came about because of this whole
[02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:30.220]  situation and maybe following some of the key players or the money that's
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:34.340]  involved in that and also looking at those people in their associations you
[02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:37.060]  know kind of using that web of information against them like they do
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:43.540]  against us can I tell you I totally agree with you but look at me I'm a 68

[02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:20.620]  flag discussion with Jimmy Ray J Chris Mary and many others that are holding
[02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:25.100]  and I do have some good news on the second amendment along with the bad news
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:30.540]  and on the organic food front fifth monkey has signs of deadly bacteria and

[02:24:49.940 --> 02:24:54.220]  gorillas that's in the London independent the London telegraph that's
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:57.380]  just some of what's coming up but let me go ahead and get into false flags right
[02:24:57.380 --> 02:25:01.500]  now you go back 20 years ago people didn't know what the term false flag was
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:04.660]  they also didn't know the Federal Reserve was private that shows how far we've
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:07.900]  come identifying what's going on 10 years ago people didn't know that what
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:12.980]  false flag was now it's in the vernacular it's in the language stage
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:20.140]  terror self-inflicted wound inside job frame job it's now known and calling
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:25.180]  as conspiracy theorist and tenfold hat people doesn't work anymore does it as
[02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:30.420]  MSNBC basically considers closing its doors another major reorganization you
[02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:34.460]  don't exist anymore go up there and say I'm behind the boss and bombing all you
[02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:39.580]  want go on there and semi-racist all you want everybody who actually tunes in
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:43.820]  finds out you're a bunch of liars and we're just going to get to a point where
[02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:48.820]  the people in the system don't want to be slaves don't want to be criminals the
[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:53.100]  criminals have to manipulate good people in the system whether it's private or
[02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:57.300]  public into being part of it with these cover stories well these cover
[02:25:57.300 --> 02:26:03.980]  narratives these roles as they call them don't fly we got a saying down here
[02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:12.580]  in Texas that it that dog won't hunt and there's another saying I don't have a
[02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:19.020]  dog in the fight I think that's saying it's nationwide oh people in the system
[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:22.540]  on average are not evil or corrupt they're just now waking up and they're
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:29.180]  understanding a the dog won't hunt and a they don't have a dog in the fight and
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:33.940]  so we have intellectual facts history common sense research we compare what
[02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:38.460]  the criminals running things said one week ago compared to now five years ago
[02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:42.780]  compared to now we show their manipulation and it doesn't matter if
[02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:47.140]  they got half the public suck on their thumb not knowing which end is up a
[02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:51.940]  large portion of the public worldwide is really starting to get it now and if a
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:57.420]  minority a sizable minority ever wakes up and doesn't comply and starts voting
[02:26:57.420 --> 02:27:02.540]  with their dollars with their euros with their yen their yawn their rubles
[02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:08.260]  their shekels their pesos that's it for the establishment and that's why
[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:11.020]  they're in a race to kill choice back let me get this down I'll hit false
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:15.100]  flags in the next segment and go to calls market watch that's wall street
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:21.260]  journal McDonald's new menu policy will only use chickens raised without
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:27.900]  antibiotics Richard Walker here today to give this to me and he said a minor
[02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:33.460]  victory not trying to overplay it and I said this is a huge victory because if
[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:39.060]  you add craft and just every week some new giant company saying we're not gonna
[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:46.140]  use GMO we're gonna label we're not gonna have food fed with antibiotics we're
[02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:50.540]  not gonna add plasticizers into our food when which they sell in Europe you
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:56.420]  know it's illegal we're gonna sell you European varieties of food produced and
[02:27:56.420 --> 02:28:03.780]  packaged here in America it's not hard for them but you put the pressure on them
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:07.300]  and this is a microcosm of what could bring down the entire New World Order
[02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:13.340]  that's why they're in a naked all-out bum rush to just get everything shut down
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:16.860]  except for globalist operations that are tax exempt
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:20.700]  Obamacare exempt exempt from harassment that's what globalism and the
[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:24.820]  technocracies about is surveilling everything to selectively shut down
[02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:31.020]  everything not run by them that's robber Baron John D Rockefeller competition
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:37.380]  is a sin 101 only way McDonald's can survive is to shut down all their
[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:43.220]  competition but we're gonna shut them down before that happens and I'm sorry
[02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:46.700]  if you know McDonald's franchise I got my right to vote with my dollars and my
[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:52.540]  mouth and I got a big fat mouth like a crocodile that means we've got to come
[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:57.420]  back with bang your head in the next segment McDonald's MCD on the stock
[02:28:57.420 --> 02:29:01.700]  market is announced on Wednesday a new and by the way their stock shot up when
[02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:08.180]  they did it 69 cents a new menu policy Wednesday to only use chickens range
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:12.380]  without antibiotics and offer milk from cows that aren't treated with artificial
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:19.380]  growth hormones yeah another Victor forgot to mention that one dryers ice cream
[02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:22.780]  came out two weeks ago and said the same I mean it's all all the big brands are
[02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:26.420]  saying you know what you don't want high-fat corn syrup fine you don't want
[02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:30.020]  GMO growth hormones your kids are a foot dollar and get cancer when they're 14

[02:33:29.180 --> 02:33:34.180]  the headline just went up on info wars.com maybe somebody else pointed it out I
[02:33:34.180 --> 02:33:40.180]  hadn't even thought of it hiding in plain view Kit Daniels thought of it
[02:33:40.180 --> 02:33:45.180]  what about all the people that Hillary communicated with with an illegal secret
[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:50.180]  email when under federal law all these communications to be recorded and
[02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:54.180]  documented by the secretariat state
[02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:01.180]  obviously they're starting a new whitewash in congress about it but who are the
[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:04.180]  people that are the aliases that's been asked but here's the other issue she's
[02:34:04.180 --> 02:34:10.180]  talking to the White House the State Department all of those people are now
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:15.180]  involved aiding and abetting and it gets worse she's communicating with aliases
[02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:21.180]  not just hers but with gnome de plumes pen names in official state
[02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:27.180]  business with these people so see you make horses all just hiding in plain view
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:31.180]  common sense default to think of it we just are so busy covering so many issues
[02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:36.180]  and so is everybody else what about the people she was talking to
[02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:40.180]  White House never questioned Clinton's private email during her four-year
[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:44.180]  Secretary of State tenure Obama admin didn't care Clinton used private
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:50.180]  unsecure email in exchanges with White House excellent job in fact I asked Kit to
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:54.180]  change the headline to White House involved in illegal email with Hillary
[02:34:54.180 --> 02:35:00.180]  Clinton media and you know deaf or not deaf media silent on issue but this
[02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:04.180]  his sub headline is better than what I gave him during the break Obama admin
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:09.180]  didn't care it was Obama administration was complicit in letting Clinton use
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:12.180]  private unsecure email that's the word it's not they didn't care they were
[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:17.180]  complicit change that to complicit and we got it we're so busy around here there's
[02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:22.180]  total transparency I tell the crew to correct me I try to help them and tell
[02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:27.180]  a lot of this cruise smarter than I am on a lot of subjects I just have the old
[02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:31.180]  knowledge of kind of one of the old Mossbacks 20 years doing this is a long
[02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:35.180]  time I've just learned how people operate how enemies are going to come at us
[02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:40.180]  I've kind of got the the knowledge but when it comes to just events and
[02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:45.180]  angles and stuff it's great to have this team that's why I invite the team
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:48.180]  and they're in the control room to pop in whenever they want because they have
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:52.180]  they have a lot of great points kind of encouraging them right now to pop in
[02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:56.180]  well that was weird they just did a document cam shot and I looked over
[02:35:56.180 --> 02:36:00.180]  out of the corner of my eye and there's a giant hand on the wall I was like

[02:37:58.180 --> 02:38:02.180]  pretty darn transparent so you're unable to hook this great feed in that is the
[02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:07.180]  feed I like that is an awesome feed the answer is to wheel this camera around
[02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:13.180]  and aiming at that TV we'll get the feed see now I'm obsessing you're a radio
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:19.180]  listener people like what on earth is this maniac talking about who's he talking

[02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:30.180]  can still see the feed there you go there you go there's more than one way to

[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:16.180]  more than one way to get this job done look at that look at Marcos Morales

[02:39:44.180 --> 02:39:48.180]  on air so we're gonna make him I start jabbering too much I'm behind the
[02:39:48.180 --> 02:39:55.180]  camera talent oh come on made Marcos we need to go play pool again how long

[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:18.180]  terrible it was very very extremist very very terrorist terrorist act and then
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:22.180]  we got the rest of crooked this has degenerated I apologize this happens
[02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:26.180]  about two hours 40 minutes in the show occasionally but I get a bit dingy and
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:31.180]  it's because I got so much serious news in front of me that I don't even know
[02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:35.180]  what to get into all this though a lot of it's really good news this McDonald's
[02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:41.180]  thing taking the synthetic growth hormone out of their cheese and milk and
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:45.180]  saying that they'll no longer get chicken with all the antibiotics in it
[02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:49.180]  that is a really good news but you know it's only happening as McDonald's
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:53.180]  profits implode and every major big globalist fast food chain basically is
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:58.180]  engaging a death spiral right now is that not the ultimate microcosm Nico
[02:40:58.180 --> 02:41:03.180]  Acosta let's just make him go on the microphone Nico what do you think it was
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:07.180]  Richard brought to my attention first Nico's take and then and then Richard's
[02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:12.180]  take sorry I was trying to produce the show what are you asking me what do you
[02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:16.180]  how big a victory is this about McDonald's oh that's great yeah it's right
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:20.180]  in line with all the food but food babe initiatives pretty soon they're all
[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:25.180]  going to start falling that way absolutely okay next let's go and talk to
[02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:27.180]  Richard I don't know if Richard wants his last name out as well the new guys he

[02:41:35.180 --> 02:41:39.180]  dominoes falling this shows the power of voting with our dollars this really
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:43.180]  should be an example of everybody what do you think Richard I agree yeah I said it
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:46.180]  was a minor victory when I handed it to you I did downplay it a little bit but
[02:41:46.180 --> 02:41:54.180]  it is especially arguably the largest company downplaying it and saying we're
[02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:58.180]  going to go organic it's a big thing Burger King would be the other but yeah
[02:41:58.180 --> 02:42:04.180]  is that beard organic I can't hear that beard organic oh yeah oh homegrown all

[02:57:36.180 --> 02:57:39.180]  it just means criminal elements did allow it to happen bare minimum it isn't

[03:00:49.180 --> 03:00:55.180]  say that all these different videos that were made one of the videos that I
[03:00:55.180 --> 03:01:00.180]  looked at because I believe all the stuff at first to well somebody said they
[03:01:00.180 --> 03:01:07.180]  were sent records anonymously by a school board about the school being closed
[03:01:07.180 --> 03:01:11.180]  for something like four years because it was condemned and oh yeah I mean it
[03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:14.180]  been closed before we've we've confirmed that I mean that's why they're so scared
[03:01:14.180 --> 03:01:21.180]  I mean they act really scared to give anything out on this the second point I
[03:01:21.180 --> 03:01:27.380]  wanted to make it I am a nurse I was a nurse for 40 years I see you talk to
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:34.180]  LS not nobody that was injured was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead by
[03:01:34.180 --> 03:01:39.180]  anyone and that's federal and state law for folks who don't know that the medical
[03:01:39.180 --> 03:01:42.180]  examiner would lose their license the corner will lose their license depending
[03:01:42.180 --> 03:01:46.180]  on what they call it in the county and the police chief would get in big trouble
[03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:50.180]  I mean that was illegal for folks that don't know explain it to them
[03:01:50.180 --> 03:01:58.180]  people have to be pronounced dead by an MD by a doctor they cannot just close up
[03:01:58.180 --> 03:02:04.180]  the school they have to be taken in anything that any death of anybody
[03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:10.180]  taken to a hospital within 24 hours how is a coroner's case and if there's any
[03:02:10.180 --> 03:02:14.180]  foul play involved the medical doctor can pronounce dead but then cause of death
[03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:19.180]  is by the corner under law and you've got to have the medical exam or people got
[03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:24.180]  jail that's right there would be a big investigation and none of the hospitals
[03:02:24.180 --> 03:02:30.180]  reported any people coming to any hospital none of the police can't just
[03:02:30.180 --> 03:02:34.180]  decide they're dead and close up the school that's ridiculous God bless you ma'am
[03:02:34.180 --> 03:02:38.180]  tell that stories people listen to a nurse I mean my dad's been a physician I've
[03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:42.180]  worked in around hospitals under the rules of law it's just the whole thing is
[03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:47.180]  really suspicious they're covering something big time I lean in California

[03:03:06.180 --> 03:03:11.180]  eliminate being called a conspiracy theorist yeah I mean it's a label to say
[03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:16.180]  don't listen to these people it's something they do I mean I'm a person
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:20.180]  that questions known liars but there are people out there that just make stuff up
[03:03:20.180 --> 03:03:24.680]  you call conspiracy theorist but it's been declassified it's a CIA term the
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:29.180]  Clintons ordered the media in 93 to use it to demonize anybody that opposed them
