[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  This is our land, these are our people, the workers, the strivers, the builders, these are our people.
[00:26.000 --> 00:39.000]  Who are they? They are the dark armies, the dark murdering armies who we honor as atrocities.
[00:39.000 --> 00:56.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. Lord listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:56.000 --> 01:11.000]  We're going to be here as we are each Sunday, Lord willing, four to six p.m. central. That means I'm out here in Seattle time or total eclipse of the sun time. That's two to four p.m. Pacific three to five mountain time.
[01:11.000 --> 01:24.000]  David Knight's going to be riding a shotgun there back in the main big professional studio in the old ATX and tomorrow morning he's going to be a busy beaver along with many of the great crew of Info Wars that we've expanded thanks to your support.
[01:24.000 --> 01:33.000]  We're going to be launching a syndicated radio transmission that already has new stations ready to pick it up this week and everybody can watch it and listen to it for free at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:33.000 --> 01:44.000]  We'll have its own feed, its own archive, its own podcast. We're going to get that podcast up tomorrow. Launch that tomorrow for the shows over. You can subscribe to that at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:44.000 --> 01:57.000]  Then in about two weeks we're going to launch this show with Roger Stone, Mike Sernovich, and Owen Schreuer. That'll be the war room three o'clock central four o'clock eastern. That'd be one o'clock Pacific two o'clock mountain time.
[01:57.000 --> 02:09.000]  But again, those will be live so that we have live shows throughout the day as things break as things unfold as press conferences happen as eclipses take place as we have certain guests on so you can call in really excited.
[02:09.000 --> 02:21.000]  And I intend to the next year or so to basically be 18 hours a day live. I'd like to be live from about midnight till about six, you know, you know, a.m. midnight to six a.m.
[02:21.000 --> 02:32.000]  We'll leave that purview to coast to coast a.m. But we are going to put these broadcast out there because if we build it, you certainly have come. Of course, the big debate will be today.
[02:32.000 --> 02:41.000]  Why am I not wearing a shirt will be all over newspapers tonight being probably 1000 publications tomorrow. And that's because I can wear a pair of sunglasses on air.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  If I have a style, which I had last year.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  And it was a bit conspiracy we had like double the viewers instead of a couple million viewers on YouTube was like 4 million one day.
[02:51.000 --> 03:04.000]  Just because I was wearing sunglasses and I said hey I've got a infected I it's closed it's it's it's weeping it's dripping it's infected and I got this on and I'm not missing a shirt here because that way problems.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  I'm sitting in my hotel room getting ready to check out and fly out today back to Austin and I'm just like you know what.
[03:11.000 --> 03:23.000]  I haven't not worn my shirt on air in a while and this is a pretty important broadcast. A lot of big breaking things are becoming up today. We're launching the new real news transmission with David I tomorrow at 8am central.
[03:23.000 --> 03:35.000]  I've had the antifa basically physically attack me all over the city. They're stripping us of our rights are free speech, Google and Facebook and Twitter are censoring more so we're being stripped.
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.000]  Of our sovereignty we're being stripped of our prosperity through globalism we're being stripped of our.
[03:43.000 --> 03:54.000]  Our culture we were we're being stripped of our honor we're being stripped of everything that ends up allowing countries to be sovereign and upright.
[03:54.000 --> 04:09.000]  And strong and we have the globalist claiming everything is racist if you don't submit to their open borders of their carbon taxes of their Obamacare written by insurance companies to double and triple prices you are a racist.
[04:09.000 --> 04:25.000]  And so what we see is the world being stripped of common sense and the left turning into a hysterical group of people that live in hysteria bubbles like DC like Chicago like Seattle and like my own Austin.
[04:25.000 --> 04:40.000]  Colonized by the failures of California in places like Seattle, who have now come scrambling there and they're desperate.
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  To pull down any place they haven't imploded yet with their depression with their heroin head behaviors.
[04:47.000 --> 04:58.000]  It is truly amazing. We'll be right back stay with us big insight into all the White House as well.
[05:18.000 --> 05:26.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine said the bad halogen fluoride.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[05:33.000 --> 05:41.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[05:41.000 --> 05:49.000]  To request from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[05:49.000 --> 06:14.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[06:19.000 --> 06:37.000]  So what America is witnessing right now on this live August 20, 2017 global Sunday transmission is an exercise in corporate media bullying and their powerless frothing,
[06:37.000 --> 06:52.000]  useful idiot servants in hysteria bubbles like Chicago, New York, D.C. and Seattle and Los Angeles running around looking for who they can bully and who they can yell and scream at and who they can drive into submission.
[06:52.000 --> 07:05.000]  So since Trump gave four different press conferences and tweeted out and said great job, you know, with the anti racism march in Boston, which is Black Lives Matter, the cop killer group,
[07:05.000 --> 07:13.000]  even cheering the cop killer group is just oh, we've we've seen the usual suspects. Let me see.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  Michael Moore.
[07:16.000 --> 07:28.000]  We've seen the CNN host. We've seen them all have an MSNBC talk show host Sarah kins disor on the am joy.
[07:28.000 --> 07:37.000]  They're saying that you still have actual Nazis in the White House and saying that Bannon left because he was a Nazi. They have no writings of him and being a Nazi.
[07:37.000 --> 07:45.000]  They have no statements of him even being close to a white nationalist.
[07:45.000 --> 07:58.000]  They don't care. They don't care because it's an intimidation. Don't want Obamacare. Don't want open borders. Don't want higher taxes. You're a racist. We're going to beat you over the head with it.
[07:58.000 --> 08:06.000]  And it's not working anymore. People have been stripped of their prosperity, stripped of so much. Now they want to strip us of our first amendment.
[08:06.000 --> 08:20.000]  And that's why I'm broadcasting with my shirt off today. Radio listeners are treated as not having to witness this. But, you know, last time I took my shirt off riding a horse was actually hot on a summer's day.
[08:20.000 --> 08:31.000]  And my wife said, hey, you got to take a picture of this and act like you're Putin is a joke. They claim you're a Russian agent. I tweeted it and it was in hundreds of publications and a big, big joke.
[08:31.000 --> 08:41.000]  And so yet, you know, here we go again, the crime of a man with his shirt off is, you know, he and she are supposed to not exist.
[08:41.000 --> 08:50.000]  So I'm just committing this masculine crime here on air and in a publicity stunt. I mean, my goodness, I mean, I can do anything on air.
[08:50.000 --> 09:03.000]  And it turns into a big, basically, national, international incident. So I've got my shirt off in protest to the fact that they say masculine men are so bad.
[09:03.000 --> 09:11.000]  And that it's a conspiracy theory that men ever had hair on their chest. And that we should all just take the estrogen members and become sterile and then die.
[09:11.000 --> 09:27.000]  So that delusional, drug addict, Silicon Valley owners who believe they're going to merge with machines and become God can metaphysically believe that they have dominated the alpha males in the world by simply ending alpha males all to begin with.
[09:27.000 --> 09:40.000]  So this is my ode to the long gone alpha male, the scourge of earth here on the broadcast today. Now I'm going to give you the inside intel from three different sources.
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  I have been mum pretty much since Bannon, it was announced.
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  It seems like a million years ago. Was it Friday they announced the Bannon departure? Or was it Thursday?
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  And David and I can be co hosting here. He can pop it anytime he wants and refresh my memory because I'm teleprompter free.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  It doesn't mean I don't have a crew back there that I can't remember something finds it for me.
[10:00.000 --> 10:10.000]  I'm not really said much about Bannon, the outgoing former White House chief strategist, because I didn't have all the facts.
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  But now I do know why Bannon left and it's not just some factoid that we should all be interested in.
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  It ties into where the president's mind is and where this country is and where our beach head in the executive branch is.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  So that is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  I also have a lot of clips here. As I mentioned, MSNBC hosts, you still have actual Nazis in the White House.
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  That's the talking point. First they lie and say Bannon left because of Charlottesville.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  It had nothing to do with that. And they know that. It was the whole McMaster in fighting situation.
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  And it wasn't Bannon involved in the fighting with McMaster.
[10:51.000 --> 11:02.000]  It was Bannon with McMaster, according to my sources, and that's now clear. And I also have specifically why the president basically asked him to resign and what this bodes for the future.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  But before I go any further, let's play a clip of the standard new talking point.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  A, you're a Russian agent. They're now having to drop that more and more.
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  They may still get a grand jury to try some indictment on some corruption thing that's not connected to Russia.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  Because now it's a general corruption probe, magically not a Russia probe.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  So now they've dropped that. They're moving back into everyone that opposes this as a racist.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  And Trump's saying, I'd decry all forms of racism. We should love each other.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  Two hours after it happened was KKK behavior. It's not like Martin Luther King to the left saying it's all race, base, race, race, race.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  So he gave his Martin Luther King statement on Saturday. Then he gave another statement.
[11:40.000 --> 11:50.000]  He even more focused a few days earlier wasn't enough than now other statements. And then he even went too far and praised the overall Black Lives Matter cop killing group that was out there saying,
[11:50.000 --> 11:58.000]  no to a free speech rally that was like decrying and falling on its face saying, we swear we're not racist. We hate all white people, basically.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  And they said, that's not enough. You're whites. Whites aren't even allowed to march. Just get out of here, scum.
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.000]  And Trump just said, oh, it's good to come together and protest to come together. Sometimes that's good. But you know, Black Lives Matter that kills cops is there.
[12:12.000 --> 12:22.000]  So I guess he did mention that. But it's just crazy how we're all beaten into submission by MSM and almost no one buys or listens to.
[12:22.000 --> 12:36.000]  You know, that we're all racist because America and, you know, mainly England spearheaded getting rid of slavery worldwide and where the open was supposed free nations ever and 99% of us have no ancestors that own slaves and it's just
[12:36.000 --> 12:46.000]  literally like your neighbor showing up because your great, great, great, great grandpa knew somebody that committed a murder and saying you're going to come over to my house and just my ass because of past sins you committed.
[12:46.000 --> 12:55.000]  I am really sick of this crap. But let me tell you something. I've seen the desperate liberal trendies. They look like they're being murdered, like they're being killed.
[12:55.000 --> 13:12.000]  Their identity is so tied up at the Democratic Party and Pelosi and Hillary and Maxine Waters and all these other classically corrupt dirtbags that rob pension funds and economies and little Haitian kids that they are just walking around
[13:12.000 --> 13:24.000]  like they are in hell. Because imagine if your whole identity was like some big mama bird, Hillary, that was going to vomit, you know, you out a baby mouse or something she caught.
[13:24.000 --> 13:36.000]  And now you're hearing your mommy in there and you're just looking up the EBT money still comes, the government jobs still come, but you're just scrabbling around and you're in a little dirty, you know, heroin apartment in Seattle and
[13:36.000 --> 13:45.000]  Colbert only comes on every few nights and he's there and he makes fun of everybody and makes you feel intellectually superior and everybody calls everybody Nazis and you believe it.
[13:45.000 --> 13:53.000]  Then suddenly the Nazis are everywhere. Then there's Alex Jones walking down the street. You just go Nazi, kill him, kill him, which, which, which, which, which.
[13:53.000 --> 14:02.000]  And just go and start booing me and going, ah, everyone hates you. And I go, I'm showing how you're fascist. They all go, huh, and I'll realize it then run off like I came here on purpose.
[14:02.000 --> 14:13.000]  Why are you here scum? Don't you know we hate you? We're going to kick your ass. Yeah, you filth raises. I'm like, we're to actually say that. Oh, you look like an idiot on tape. Oh, I was strong.
[14:13.000 --> 14:22.000]  You know, because see, they're all about ganging up on Smiley and acting powerful over him. I was, I was not in junior high when I was in junior high.
[14:22.000 --> 14:32.000]  So here's a clip on MSNBC. You still have actual, actual. See, America that beat the Nazis, we're down the Nazi scene, but they're Captain America.
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  Every heroin head, every day who hates everybody, including themselves, who are totally depressed, totally obsessed, like a heroin spirit.
[14:40.000 --> 14:51.000]  And they want you to be miserable. They want you to be a failure. They want control of your kids. They all have a school program where they local rock bands, the local rap bands, the local trendy groups.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  They come and they talk to your kids at story time. They come in and they tell your kids everything.
[14:57.000 --> 15:06.000]  Like they have trendy story times for your five year olds or a big fat guy in a dress talks about sucking lollipops of your five year old, but perverted or pedophilic or anything.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  It's just loving liberalism with weirdo creepozoids that want to have a relationship with your kids. Let's go out to break this clip.
[15:13.000 --> 15:23.000]  I think as many have pointed out, this is still a white supremacist house. You still have actual Nazis in the house. You have Jeff Sessions, who's a long time antagonist against civil rights.
[15:23.000 --> 15:42.000]  And you have policies that back up these ideas in practice. And so what Bannon is probably going to do when he leaves is just support this aspect of Trump's agenda from the outside, which actually I think more dangerous and more harmful than having him in the White House where he was, as was mentioned, somewhat contained.
[15:42.000 --> 15:54.000]  Yeah, in a way, that's true, though, that he will be able to get a lot done more on the outside. But I mean, just these are the race players want to keep you poor and controlled. What a group of sick control freaks.
[16:12.000 --> 16:21.000]  Free herbal bug spray, concentrated peppermint mouthwash, unscented body wash, tea tree shampoo and long lasting natural deodorant.

[18:37.000 --> 18:47.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:47.000 --> 18:54.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[20:31.000 --> 20:41.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:41.000 --> 20:51.000]  So I'm shirtless here, broadcasting today. I might do the old shirtless stunt once a year to get in a couple hundred newspapers and troll the establishment.
[20:51.000 --> 21:01.000]  They think when they laugh at us and attack us, because most of them are really old. A lot of old folks are awake too and are trailblazers. Thank God for them, but a lot of the globalists are old.
[21:01.000 --> 21:11.000]  So they're all about wearing the perfect suit, looking all perfectly stated to get their con over. I like to not take myself so seriously sometimes.
[21:11.000 --> 21:23.000]  You know, go out and let a hateful leftist throw some coffee on me or have folks threaten to kill me, because I'm putting myself out there to illustrate exactly what we're facing and what we're dealing with.
[21:23.000 --> 21:35.000]  We need to cover news real time as it's breaking to then put our analysis on it. Not just cover what's already broken and also put out original research and content and a lot of powerful guests.
[21:35.000 --> 21:48.000]  And to tweet and Facebook inside the enemy media live time. And that's why we've launched 8 to 11 every day starting tomorrow morning on the 21st day of August 2017.
[21:48.000 --> 21:59.000]  David Knight's new real news that you'll have a round table of guests. He'll play a lot of clips. You'll be able to call in. We're going to take calls every day, at least for two or three segments.
[21:59.000 --> 22:07.000]  So everybody can look for that coming up and starting tomorrow.
[22:07.000 --> 22:16.000]  And then in a few weeks, in early September, what September 4th, we're going to launch the war room with a bunch of other great hosts as well.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  Roger Stone, Mike Sternovich, Owen Stroyer in the big studio, in the big control room, in the big war room, and the ATX.
[22:23.000 --> 22:33.000]  And we have our great reporters like Millian Gavin out there covering what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, and just so much more as we expand in the face of the globalist.
[22:33.000 --> 22:40.000]  But there's a little promo piece that Darren McBreen just threw together today. This is a great job so quickly, put it together just like a couple of hours.
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.000]  Here it is, promoting the new transmission with David Knight that kicks off tomorrow.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  But the big thing is, you being part of taking the live links tomorrow at infoawards.com.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  And then we'll have a podcast for you tomorrow. That's always important for the show to have a podcast.
[22:57.000 --> 23:04.000]  And then you'll be able to promote that and you'll be able to select video clips that we're going to post, but also the whole show to its own YouTube channel.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  And then you'll be able to see what's its own system out there. Each show will be its own continuum.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  And then they will use the broadcast to promote each other. But it's not about the broadcast the day after it airs. It's about when it's live.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  And things are happening so you can call in and see what's going on so you can send us clips so we can analyze things as they unfold in real time.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  And I want to get, by this time next year, 18 hours of live broadcast today.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  I'm going to leave coast to coast. We're not in competition with them. They're great folks.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  They dominate that slot. Coast to coast AM midnight to 6 AM.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  We're going to leave that with some of our best of retransmissions of the day.
[23:40.000 --> 23:52.000]  But from 6 AM until midnight central, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to be getting that out there 18 hours a day.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen. He's not shirtless.
[23:55.000 --> 24:05.000]  He's got a lot of great points to make. It's David Knight.
[24:05.000 --> 24:16.000]  Now you know you're winning the information war when the other side has no response but to resort to censorship.
[24:16.000 --> 24:23.000]  Drain the swamp. We're going to have to drain the privilege out of Washington first because that's what the swamp feeds on, their privilege.
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.000]  They can't stand for people to exercise their first and second amendments together.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  You found it. It's the real news. That's what you have to look forward to.
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.000]  He's not sorry when snowflakes can't handle the truth. It's your host, David Knight.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  Watch the real news with David Knight.
[24:43.000 --> 24:51.000]  Weekday mornings, 8 AM till 11 central at inforce.com forward slash show.
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  I'll tell you, McGreen put together an amazing promo. That guy is king at the office. We love him.
[24:57.000 --> 25:03.000]  Speaking of what David just said, that little promo piece from one of his live feeds that McGreen will have to clip from a few weeks ago.
[25:03.000 --> 25:12.000]  It's all about privilege and they wanted to get rid of all the Trump loyalists because it's about privilege and they want the only access to the president.
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  I know David Knight's been really worried about it. I've been calling David for two days saying, I don't know. Let me talk to my sources.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  Let's hold off. He was saying, it looks really bad that Batman's out.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  I agree it's bad that Batman's out, but probably not for the reason folks think.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  That's coming up in the next segment, but David Knight, before we go there, are you excited?
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.000]  You're going to be captaining at the helm as we launch your big syndicated transmission tomorrow that I want to ask all of our affiliates to give a good listen to.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  Usually new shows don't get syndicated right away, but yours will because you've been co-hosting right here.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  I know with a lot of our affiliates, you're more popular than I am with the station managers, owners, and listeners.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  I know Matt Drudge tells me that he doesn't like a lot of other talk show hosts, but he really likes listening to you.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  This is a big day, I think. You launch this tomorrow.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Tomorrow is the big eclipse that everybody's talking about.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  I think it's very important and very significant that that's the day that we're going to be launching real news.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  Because the question is... We didn't do that on purpose. No, it just happened.
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  It also happens to be my son's birthday, but we didn't do that on purpose.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  That's going to be the day they have the eclipse.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  What we're seeing right now is a struggle and a fight.
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  Whether or not we're going to have the establishment, the YouTube censorship, the firewalls from Facebook,
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  and all this corporate censorship, this corporate fascism, are they going to be able to roll back the Internet?
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  Because we got out of that little ghetto that they had created with a major three network,
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  so they had total control over everything that was being heard by everybody.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  They all talked about the same issues. They all had the same take on all of these issues.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  So everybody said, well, everybody's saying the same thing. It must be true.
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  They were reading off a government script, and then we had the fairness doctrine that came along.
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.000]  Then we had the Internet, and it got even bigger. Now they're trying to hide that.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  They're trying to put an eclipse there. So the question is, are they going to be able to do that,
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  or are we going to be able to stand together and enlarge this broadcast with our listeners' support?
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  And I hope that that's what's going to happen. I think that's what's going to happen.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  It's going to be a struggle because we're seeing YouTube put firewalls up.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  We're seeing them demonetize people left and right.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  And of course, we've been talking about this for a very long time.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  It looks like they had all of these levers in place.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  As you said before, Alex, they had everything in place to set everything down.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  And they're still going with that plan.
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  And that's why I took my shirt off today as a stunt just to protest.
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  Paul's left YouTube. Notice, folks, he had been on there over a week and a half.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  He just says, I'm not doing it. They keep banning my videos and blocking them.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  He did one criticizing modern art being government funded. They banned that.
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  And so now we really are down to trying to use old media talk radio, which still has a big audience,
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  and then infowars.com, and we're being more and more blocked.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  And yes, it's up to all of you folks. Like I went on Joe Rogan, the number one podcast,
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  not in his history, in all history, so they delisted it from number one.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  And even though it has more views than any other podcast, they still won't show it in the top 100.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  Because they don't want to give us those awards that not only are they trying to censor us,
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  but culturally, we are the most popular thing out there.
[28:19.000 --> 28:25.000]  And that's why they can't allow us to even be on talk radio or the internet is because we put out alternative talking points
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  from our perspective that are more reality based than telling us Obamacare is free.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  And Gruber says, thank God everybody's so stupid. He could say that on C-Span if nobody was watching.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  But see, we remember, we go back and get it and show people what they're doing.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  So it's really up to the audience. I know you're going to knock it out of the park tomorrow.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  Well, thank you.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  For the producers and the crew and the great guests.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  But it's up to the audience who I'm not bitching at. You've come through before.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  You come through again. We love you to really promote this new show, the audio feeds,
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  the podcasts, the live video links, and ask your local affiliates to pick up David Knight.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  At the speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.
[29:27.000 --> 29:35.000]  Our natural mixture harnesses the power of 10 known ingredients to let your body relax and get the sleep you need.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  Wake up refreshed and take on the day.
[29:37.000 --> 29:45.000]  Info Wars Life wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.

[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  And with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  10% off on auto ship.

[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[31:11.000 --> 31:16.000]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  that they were hunting, killing and then processing.
[31:22.000 --> 31:25.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman,
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[31:29.000 --> 31:36.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  and winning because of your support.
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  Caveman is finally back at the Infowars store.
[31:49.000 --> 31:53.000]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only.
[31:53.000 --> 31:58.000]  At infowarslife.com, or by calling toll-free, triple-A-253-3139.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[32:05.000 --> 32:11.000]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[32:11.000 --> 32:17.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.000]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[32:20.000 --> 32:25.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  The general public doesn't.
[32:38.000 --> 32:42.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[32:46.000 --> 32:52.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[32:52.000 --> 33:09.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at M4warStore.com.
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[33:24.000 --> 33:30.000]  David Knight, who's riding shotgun with me, is about to get more broadcast than he probably ever wanted.
[33:30.000 --> 33:33.000]  I know he's always shomped with the bit to do his own transmission.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  I had to get the crew hired, build the facilities, get the infrastructure in and get products out there for sale
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  that folks really wanted that worked really well.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  So we built a large customer base of Patriots that would fund us.
[33:45.000 --> 33:55.000]  We, despite the storms and the attacks and the censorship and the boycotts and the death threats and the congressional investigations, we are here.
[33:55.000 --> 34:04.000]  And so launching tomorrow a three-hour transmission, I think David's our strongest prospect to build a whole new system parallel to what we're doing
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  so that we're live time as things happen.
[34:07.000 --> 34:15.000]  So then get even bigger crew that takes clips out of the show in live time with key headlines, little short one-minute clips to dominate the web,
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  because that's what this is.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  This is an information war.
[34:18.000 --> 34:27.000]  If I had a bigger crew, we would have known when I only discovered yesterday, one week after Charlottesville, I knew a lot of it,
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  but I did deep research yesterday, supposedly on quasi-workcation, not staycation, workcation.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  I did research and I confirmed it all.
[34:37.000 --> 34:50.000]  They had known CIA and State Department officials in Charlottesville first tweeting, first being on MSNBC, CNN, NBC.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  And the mayor is involved.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  Everybody's a cutout of the major players.
[34:56.000 --> 35:03.000]  Some of the useless, I guess they're useful idiots, use Lenin's term, but I see them as useless idiots.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  The white supremacists coming out.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  Some of those are real.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  I'm not saying white supremacists don't exist.
[35:07.000 --> 35:15.000]  I'm not saying, but it turns out the guy that ran the girl over is a hardcore, long-term Obama supporter, obviously drugged up.
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  I mean, you can't make it up.
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.000]  He's a hardcore Obama supporter.
[35:17.000 --> 35:27.000]  The guy leading it was the leader of the Black Lives Matter and the leader of the Occupy Wall Street and the leader of the Obama and Hillary campaigns.
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  And then you've got the governor, I mean, the mayor tied into all this.
[35:32.000 --> 35:41.000]  And you've got the other white supremacist leader going to the same special elite school for international political programming.
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  It's just, oh my God, unbelievable.
[35:45.000 --> 35:55.000]  And then I said, oh, we've got to look at, we've got to look at some of this from the perspective of they've had actors at other events.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  And they go, oh, you're saying it's all fake.
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.000]  It's Sandy Hook.
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  Oh, you're saying it's all fake.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  CNN has had actors that say babies got thrown on incubators.
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.000]  And CNN admits and Politico admits and AP admits that the company that was hired to get actors there to quote, agitate.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  That means start a fight, did hire people the weeks before and did bring them there.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  And that is a fact.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  And I wasn't even saying there were actors there.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  But see, they were scared of that.
[36:22.000 --> 36:32.000]  So they wanted to head it off and announce it first and then say that, you know, I said Jews did it, which I didn't say to confuse it and poison the well.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  Yeah, we're putting the website on screen.
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.000]  Your home for rallies, protests, audiences, PR stunts and celebrity events.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  Let's click on their URL if I can see that because the clock's blocking it.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  Sorry, I can't read the URL.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  And again, I'm teleprompter free, but I'm on the road.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  What's the URL for me?
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  And I'll give it, there it is.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  Crowds on demand.
[36:55.000 --> 37:05.000]  Crowds on demand, celebrity events, corporate events and audiences, protests and rallies, talent, press philanthropy, who we are, contact us, request a quote.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  They're the ones when Hillary did those fake town halls.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  And I saw them and said, that's shot in like HD or 35 millimeter film.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  It was so clear it might have been 80 millimeter.
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  And then the little girl turned out was an actress and all that.
[37:17.000 --> 37:24.000]  They were the ones supplying the actors and they were in Charlottesville and they ran ads and they were there.
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  I'm not saying that they've ended the violence.
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  I'm not saying that white supremacists don't exist.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  I'm saying they were there.
[37:33.000 --> 37:42.000]  But now, like I sent you guys the video, we may play it next hour after some calls and I break this big news the next segment.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  They got State Department at high level CIA.
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  One guy has paid 320,000 a year on the payroll of Soros.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  He doesn't just get money from Soros.
[37:54.000 --> 38:02.000]  He personally has played 320 a year and then he's their CIA State Department and he's on the news.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  And then when people pointed out who he was, they took his name off the State Department website and stuff,
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  but Google has all the shots of it.
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  I mean, it's like, whoa, whoa, CIA and they use senior guys.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  Like you're so stupid on TV.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  Oh, I saw him run over.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  Oh, I saw, I saw the races.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  I saw the fight start.
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  The white supremacists attacked.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  Oh, oh, I'm the guy being interviewed first, putting out the talking points.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  This is the downfall of Trump.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  This is the beginning.
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  It shows he and it's all he worked for Podesta to John Podesta.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  I'll give you his name and stuff coming up.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  We're going to play video of him on the news and they had him first on every newscast.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  Just here he is.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  Bring him up.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  I'm just a witness of standard by here.
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  Yeah.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  Yeah.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  Yeah.
[38:52.000 --> 38:59.000]  And then all the leaders of the white supremacist formerly worked for Obama, Podesta, Hillary, the CIA,
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  or the key Virginia school there that's run by the CIA.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  And when we have Pachinic on and he says there's CIA, he has all the connections.
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  He's going to say he thinks they are and here's the evidence of why he thinks so.
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.000]  He can't legally tell you, but there's a civil war going on in the government.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  So they're going to tell you.
[39:20.000 --> 39:26.000]  Now, when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, yes, deep state said they're going to overthrow
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  Trump and they did.
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  But first, I wasn't saying Charlottesville was completely synthetic because I didn't
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  know.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  And now I can tell you, it was about 80% made up from the leadership.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  They orchestrated the whole deal.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  We'll give David a nice take on this when we come back from break, which is briefly.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Then we start the next hour.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  I'm going to give you the big inside the White House scoop that nobody else has got.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  I've got it all right here.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  All the little notice written that's coming up.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  But briefly, you want to anger the globalist that where I go out and march on the street
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  myself just to document how they come over and physically attack me and say, we're going
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  to kill you and say, we hate you and say, you better get out of here.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  And I say, I'm not getting out of here.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  You don't bully me.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  And then they are like the wicked witch getting water thrown on them.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  They melt.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  But we've got a lot of those videos coming up the next hour and tomorrow.
[40:15.000 --> 40:24.000]  But understand they've had John Oliver, Trevor Noah, all the so-called fake news comedy people
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  that poses reporters and they say, oh, we're just being, you know, fake news.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  So it's okay.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  We're comedy.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  It's not going to be fake news.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  But then their people take it as seriously.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  You've got them all attacking our products, trying to get us shut down, getting our stuff
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  tested by FDA laboratories and finding their California standard, which they couldn't believe.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  I learned they got really pissed.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  In fact, Buzzfeed, I'm told, had to send this to three different labs.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  And they had to work out some deal with this lab to give them PR promotion because this
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  lab sells supplements that are the cleanest and, quote, best, you know, they advertise
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  because they test them themselves.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  Then they third-party sell them or second-party sell them, which is a good business model.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  They said, we are California standard.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  They just kind of hid that report.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  And they said, oh, but it's too much.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  His methylcobalamin, vitamin B12, 1776, it should be $10.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  Well, it cost us $12.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  So there's nobody out there getting something for $12, selling for 1776.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  It's on sale right now still.
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  At 25, it's a steal.
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  They sell the same methylcobalamin for $35, but that's who we private label from.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  They were so dumb, they're like, here is the best B12 versus Joneses.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  And it's the same thing.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  So that's an example of how every weapon they turn against us basically blows up in their
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  ugly faces, which we predict now the globalists will go to direct staging of things, which
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  is fine.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  You don't see me.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  We walked into this fight.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  They keep freaking out like, we're going to kick your ass, Nazi.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  I'm like, go ahead.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  Attack me.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  I'm not a Nazi.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  I'm here for free speech.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  You are fascist.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  They go, oh, yeah, we are.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  But you've got to go out and do that.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  You've got to go out and show them.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  You've got to put the products out.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  You've got to build the network.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  You've got to stand against the enemy.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  Because if you don't stand, they take the day.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  All the evil men and tyrants need to flourish as good men do nothing.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  So we've got these huge specials that are going to have to end the next few days.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  I said, because I combined last month's special that was the John Oliver special with this
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  new 1776 special, because they were protesting all our products.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  Then I'm running out of a bunch of them.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  So we're going to have to end a lot of these specials the next few days.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  I'm going to have to get rid of the 1776 BuzzFeed special.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  They'll have a new special, but it won't be as extensive.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  There'll still be some good deals.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  But water filtration, air filtration, nutraceuticals, colloidal silver, caveman's back in stock,
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  disappear, knockout, DNA force, all 20 to 66% off infowarstore.com.

[42:54.000 --> 43:21.000]  Take action today.
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  Independence isn't a day.
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  It's a mindset.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  I will not be your slave.
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  Slaves are never safe.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.000]  Guard your liberty.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[43:54.000 --> 44:23.000]  For infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.

[47:25.000 --> 47:54.000]  Thank you.
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.000]  Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide broadcast.
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  InfoWars.com is our outpost.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  We've launched newswars.com.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  It's now got comments enabled.
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  It's got a lot of news feeds on it, exclusive news that does not appear at infowars.com or prismplanet.com.
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  The site I'd give an A-plus right now, but I'd give it about a 95.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  We're going to be tweaking it, adding a lot of new functions to it this week.
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  It also is a lighter site, meaning it doesn't have as many graphics.
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.000]  It's a very, very light site.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  Loads quickly on your computer, on your iPhone or Droid.
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  So be sure and bookmark that and spread the word infowars.com, prismplanet.com.
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  And now newswars.com, part of the expansion in the face of the global.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  Several new websites will get launched by the end of the year.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  We're going to launch at least two more broadcasts.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  That'll be three total after we launch David Knight's Real News tomorrow.
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  And so much more.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  I saw some emails in comments going, oh, you ripped off the president, Real News.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  I don't even respond to that.
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  Okay.
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  I don't territorialize information.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  Real News is the common sense name to counter fake news.
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  And we had the name Real News before the president launched his weekly transmission.
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  I'm honored they called it that, but they didn't get that from us.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  If you're countering the fake news, what are you?
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  You're the Real News.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  But again, that's just an example of people turn things in little side fights.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  People ask why I've been so successful, not that I'm even that smart.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  I don't inflight.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  I mean, I'll joke around about myself and others and, you know, talk about where we are failing
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  or where we're succeeding.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  But I don't get off on just running people down or territorializing information.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  So often people say, man, Sean Hannity is copying you almost every night word for word.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  I'm like, let's not make a big deal out of that.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  They're already trying to fire the guy.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  Our information's spot on.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  That's a real form of success.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  Don't you hope it spreads to everybody and we win?
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  That's what winning looks like.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  And I love Roger Stone to death.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  But I've had to call him on the carpet publicly when he's getting mad at Hannity.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  I know they had a private beef together at Hannity, got him banned off Fox News, I don't care.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  I'm not knocking Roger, by the way.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  I get the men fight with each other.
[50:14.000 --> 50:21.000]  It's that we're covering how they're trying to kill the president and trying to sell the idea before it was in the news.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  Now we cover it.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  We force them to cover it.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  We force the establishment to come out and say, hell, yeah, we're getting ready to kill him.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  Because they don't want to debate about how they're trying to do it behind the scenes.
[50:31.000 --> 50:42.000]  Our victory is hitting barbed wire, being laughed at, being ridiculed, knowing, though, we just blew the doors open for everybody else behind us.
[50:42.000 --> 50:52.000]  And knowing that when we end up rolling over and dying down the road, that we did like our ancestors did and delivered.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  In fact, I want that on my tombstone.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  I want Alex Jones delivered.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  He did what he said.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  He kept his promises.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  He committed.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  He didn't backbite.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  He didn't stab people in the back.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  He didn't join the globalist.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  He wasn't a peacock.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  He delivered.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  And that's why I love our audience.
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  It's so humbling.
[51:16.000 --> 51:26.000]  Our audience, black, white, Asian, old, young, male, female, it is so humbling to be out here in Seattle and oh my gosh, go out in the countryside by Mount Rainier.
[51:26.000 --> 51:37.000]  Every restaurant I went into, every gas station, every tavern, you know, restaurant, mobbed free drinks, free food, just absolutely loving me.
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  On the streets of Seattle, every fourth, fifth person I stop and start talking comes over once a picture.
[51:42.000 --> 51:49.000]  But then once one of them pops off, FU Nazi, they all start piling on.
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.000]  And it's like a group thing, like pheromones or like jihadi terrorists.
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.000]  The fire ants get all over you, then one finally stings, then all the fire, pheromones fire, they all sting you.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  Well, if you ever notice, fire ants don't hit you until there's a bunch on you.
[52:02.000 --> 52:08.000]  You're out there gardening or whatever, picking potatoes or taking care of the rose bushes and all of a sudden, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  And man, it was Zimmerman.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  You pointed that out yesterday.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  It's like one will go, FU always at a distance.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  Hive mind.
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  Hive mind.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  And then wait.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  That person turns and watches because they'll see a big group.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  They wait.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  They understand their own psychology of sheep.
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  They see me in a red light.
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.000]  They wait.
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.000]  They walk.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  Even though it's red, they go across.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  They turn and they go, FU Jones.
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.000]  And I notice they're not looking at me.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  They're looking at the people.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  And all of a sudden they go, yeah, FU Nazi.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  And they're like, yeah, we're getting ready to kick your ass.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  And I'm like, let's go.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  Hit me first.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  And they go, wait, why are you here?
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  Why have you come?
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  And you say, well, I'm here to expose your anti-freedom.
[52:46.000 --> 52:53.000]  Again, you've got to understand their childlike mentality.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  Like they walk to me at restaurants.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  They go, boo, everyone hates you.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  Screw you.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  Screw you.
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  And you're just like, you understand only a few failed enclaves like downtown Austin,
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  downtown Seattle, downtown, you know, South Side Chicago, New York, DC.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  You people are the schmucks of the globe.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  You're the losers that live in the coffin apartments that pay five times what you're
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.000]  supposed to and rent that just walk around signaling to everyone.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  You have no friends.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  They're all completely alone.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  The demographics, totally alone.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  Six times we're likely to steal.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  What is it?
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  Nine times more likely to not give the charity.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  Totally alone, totally scared, totally freaked out.
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.000]  But you know to double down on your religion, just like a jihadi.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  Well, I'm depressed because I'm a radical Muslim.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  Maybe I should suicide bomb somebody.
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  So coming up, I'm going to break down the exclusive.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  This isn't important just to know the inside baseball of Trump and Trumpville,
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  because Trump has set the support for him hasn't gone away,
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  but we're doing it because we know it's an existential battle against the globalist
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  and that they're freaked out by Trump.
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  It's not that we're totally enamored or think he's perfect.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  And you know, everybody gets fatigued.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  You know, I'm sticking myself much less Trump.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  Okay.
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  You know, it's like sometimes I get amazing phone calls from really important people.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  It's going, I'll take it for granted.
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  It's just kind of like, okay, you know, like this is probably just all the matrix
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  and playing this video game where I'm like beating the head bosses.
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  This isn't real, you know, but this is real and we're changing the world together.
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  And I hate the Republican establishment that created TPP IMF World Bank.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  All these wars funded radical Islam gave us Obamacare.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  I know the policymakers.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  I know the names of the bills.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  I know who lobbied for what I know who made the money.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  And I'm sitting there with people going, if you chose, you don't want to Obamacare.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  I need free healthcare.
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  If you don't see, and I'm like, it was written to rip you off.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  Can I give you the document?
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  Shut up.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  Well, on average, prices have doubled.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  They've kicked people off their free plans.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  Shut up.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  They don't want reality.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  They want to hear they're getting a magic lottery ticket and everything's going to be okay.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  So that's coming up like five, six after next hour and cover it all.
[55:05.000 --> 55:12.000]  There's a bunch of other big, big news that is extremely illustrative of everything I'm
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  talking about.
[55:16.000 --> 55:23.000]  And it is incredible to now see Al Sharpton saying, take down Thomas Jefferson.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  We knew, we knew that that was coming.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  But I want to get to Howard Dean.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  Trump has no moral character.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  America may be turning away from GOP.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  The Democrats have no moral character.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  The public establishment is the scum of the earth and we know that.
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  So let's talk about who the real players are when we get to that as well.
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  And then we have the chief saying, we had 11 police officers in a city of Detroit,
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  shot or killed the line of duty last year.
[55:48.000 --> 55:49.000]  What fuels it?
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  The anti-police rhetoric.
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  It's not about worshiping cops or saying there aren't bad cops.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  It's about globalist and George Soros trying to single police out when there's a rebellion
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  against corrupt government to scapegoat it on them.
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  The cops get killed randomly for no reason by dirtbag cowards to say, oh, well, they
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  deserve to because other cops somewhere else did something wrong.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  And so collectively, the cops have to pay.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  That is the biggest racist, tribalist mindset that the left is in.
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  They claim they're anti-racist or anti-tribalism or anti-stereotype.
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  They use the fact that the West is so anti-stereotype or strength against us.
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  Let them be set up as the controllers of language and words and then say, oh, well,
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  they might have killed an innocent black guy in Missouri.
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.000]  So let's go shoot five cops in Dallas or a cop might have shot somebody in Chicago
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  two days ago, wrongly.
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  So let's go down to Baton Rouge and shoot some cops.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  I mean, that really, and they said, I shot some cops because some other cop might have
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.000]  shot somebody and it's CNN hypes it up like they're for the people and they're populist
[56:52.000 --> 56:58.000]  when cops might kill a couple hundred innocent people a year total, maybe a hundred black
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  people, maximum total, innocent.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  I'm all against it.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  But you got thousands of blacks killing each other every year in Chicago.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  It doesn't even register.
[57:07.000 --> 57:13.000]  And then you get 11 cops killed, seven of them black.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  We don't know their names.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  We don't know nothing.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  We didn't even hear when they got killed.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  Since when do they not even matter and not even exist?
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  See, I'm against injustice, mind control and fraud.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  So people go, man, you've gone from bashing the cops constantly to like being their best
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  buddy.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  I never just bashed the cops.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  I bashed bad cops because they want to turn them into a globalist tool.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  I don't want a police state, but do I randomly want to see cops killed?
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  And then it covered up and then everybody whines and screams and acts like whites are
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  all racist killing black people when it's 10 to one the other way around.
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  I'm all about statistics.
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[57:48.000 --> 57:54.000]  I'm very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  probiotic.
[57:55.000 --> 58:02.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[58:02.000 --> 58:09.000]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[58:09.000 --> 58:16.000]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  probiotics trains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.

[58:59.000 --> 59:03.000]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its

[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  but bio truth selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.000]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[59:20.000 --> 59:26.000]  Bio truth selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  That's why they say it's satanic, because they get select big establishment religious institutions
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  to come out and attack something beautiful.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  So people hear it and say, well, if that's satanic, hell, I'm going to join Satanism.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Music in general is not satanic, folks.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  It's satanic is not caring about evil and not facing evil and I haven't had no folks at
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  No Robert Planned who wrote this song.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  This song is actually against the devil and against commercialism and people selling their soul.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Turn it up.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Here it is.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Music in general is not satanic, folks.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  He gets really mad when people call him a Satanist.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Now Paige did get him a decouple and then got out of it.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Here it is.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  Crank it up.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Music in general is not satanic, folks.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Music in general is not satanic, folks.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  You'll be a rock.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Music in general is not satanic, folks.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  All right.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Let's go back to David Knight here.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  I want to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour because I promised we're going
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  to start taking calls every day on every show.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  And so you think after all these years, the Sunday phone number is a different phone number
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  than the weekday show that I still use GCN to take the calls in Minnesota.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  They patch them through to us and I've just been loyal to GCN.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  I still use them as a satellite uplink.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  But I've been my own independent network certified on paper for at least a decade.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  And Ted is my satellite provider and he's a nice guy.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  I still intend to use GCN for some backups.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  But in the next few weeks, we're going to be going purely, purely to our own phone systems
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  in-house that are HD, that are better, that work better.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And they got five phone lines at GCN.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  I'm not knocking them.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  But I'm going to get better too about when we say we're going to your calls,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  we're going to go to your calls.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Because you go back in the day more than 10 years ago.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  I should take more calls.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  I was good at taking them.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  I was a great talk show host in that regard.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  I'm terrible in that regard.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  And I've kind of been a bad steward of you as a brain trust because the audience brings
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  up great points.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  They bring up great topics.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  They bring up great things I didn't know about.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  And the more I talk to you and the more calls I take, the better the callers are.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  We're getting, what's our number?
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  It's 877, what is it?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  877-789-Alex.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  877-789-Alex.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  I've heard of that guy.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  And so we will be taking your phone calls.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Coming up for first time callers today.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  But once we get in the rigmarole of taking your calls every day,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  not just a couple of times a week, we're going to get better at having just open phones for everybody.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  So 877-789-Alex, 877-789-Alex is the number for all of you to call.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  And I'm kind of being a piggy today because I'd ask David to co-host with me.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  But I am wound up ready to cover stuff.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  So after I give you this big news on the inside scoop on Bannon and the White House,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  shake up briefly.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Start of the next segment, we'll get David to take on the week coming up.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Some of the big stories he's looking at.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  And then we'll play some of these clips I mentioned.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And then we will go to your phone calls.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Again, David Knight and the Real News launches tomorrow.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, at 8 a.m. Central.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  And the globalists hate our work.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  And they hate what we're doing.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  And they hate the fact that so much of what we do goes viral.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  And I know that when I take time to actually watch David when he's hosting the show
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  and I name the clips and I put them out,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  David has some of the most viral videos in political views.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  We're talking 10, 20, 30 million views in some of his videos.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  But David just kind of, because we're all busy.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  It's nobody's fault.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  It kind of does the show and then it doesn't ever get packaged right.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  We are going to really get behind David Knight.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  And we're going to really work on the social media to have him be a big old juicy torpedo
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  that blows the global stock.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  We have chemicals and toxins that may harm your body.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  We carefully select pure and simple ingredients to create formulas that are certified USDA
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  made with organic.

[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  And run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, listeners on radio, TV viewers across the planet, starting tomorrow
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  on the 21st of August 2017, we'll ask, will the globalists be able to eclipse the new
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  exploding independent Americana free market?
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  Pro God, pro choice, pro freedom.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  When I say choice, we choose life.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Transmission with David Knight.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, 8am tomorrow and it's so critical for all of you to get the
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  feeds at infowarstore.com in the morning.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  It'll go up live at about 7.30 of the new show and the new podcast link for after the show
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  and everything else to then get this out to everybody you know.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  David Knight.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  A lot of folks say Alex, you're too bombastic.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Alex, you're too hyper.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  I like David Knight.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  And you know, absolutely.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  I like listening to David Knight.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  I like listening to Joe Salente.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  I like listening to Ron Paul.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  I like listening to Matt Drudge.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  You only get to hear him about once every two years.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  I like listening to Donald Trump.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  I like listening to John Rappaport.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  Way more than I like listening to myself.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  And that's, or Mike Sarnovich, or Roger Stone, or Owen Schreuer, and that's what this is
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  all about.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  So, you're going to have my show on three, four hours a day and then restream the rest
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  of the time.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  And all their shows will be restreamed and archived.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  That's what we've built here.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  You say, have your own system.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Google's censoring.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Facebook's censoring.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Twitter's censoring.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  You bet.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  We're building our own system while they try to kick us off Facebook, Twitter, and all
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  the rest of it.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  But that's why while we're still there, hey, while the sun shines.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Spread the links.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  Spread the articles.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  Spread the videos.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  And help us in the info war.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  Defeat the globalist.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  What you're doing is changing the world.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  Let's go to this little piece done by Darren McBreen, heralding the launch of Real News.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  Now, you know you're winning the information war when the other side has no response but
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  to resort to censorship.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Drain the swamp.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  We're going to have to drain the privilege out of Washington first because that's what
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  the swamp feeds on, their privilege.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  They can't stand for people to exercise their first and second amendments together.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  You found it.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  It's the real news.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  That's what you have to look forward to.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  He's not sorry when Snowflakes can't handle the truth.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  He's your host.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  David Knight.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  Watch the real news with David Knight.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m. till 11 central at inforce.com forward slash show.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  So bravo to that.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  And it's going to be great to be able to get on the treadmill or be going to the, you
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  know, doctor's office or taking the kids to school.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  And to not have to listen to Fox News or CNN or MSNBC or local radio.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  I know I can just hit my app or even turn to local station.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  I'm told make area of the show.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  And I can just bloop the free iPhone app and I or a droid app or whatever.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  I got a digital radio.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I could tune on my car.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Now cars come out.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  We just type in the website.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Comes right up.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  I got info wars.com forward slash show programmed on that.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  Boom.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  And I'm going to hear David Knight with all the breaking news, latest info, the clips,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  everything.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  So very excited about that.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  You know, I'm going to do it next segment because there's not much left in this one or
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  there's like six, seven minutes left.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  I'm going to hit the big news concerning the White House now.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  I get to some of these other clips, but we have to do this.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  If just the nightly news and my show are given the globalist connection fits.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  We've got to launch other good talk show hosts who are again live in the time they are to
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  put the clips out from the live show, not just racial radio to then counter because
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  they are the talking point that's getting picked up by everybody.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, everybody.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  I'm not saying that to brag.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  I've known this for about six, seven years.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  The enemy knows it and has figured it out.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  It's trying to shut all them down now to get it me.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Okay.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  But the thing is, it's not just like I made these talking points up.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  I've studied black budget, black ops, globalism, COG, all these things.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  So I understand it and people high level go, no, listen to this guy.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  He's got it right.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  I can't tell Sean Hannity classified stuff.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  They just go, Alex Jones.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Sean Hannity's meetings is like Alex Jones.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  The conspiracy guy?
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  This happened about six months ago.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  He goes, yeah.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  He goes, really?
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  Yeah.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  Basically, you take a word for it.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  Ask Hannity.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  I mean, I was in talk to folks that were in those meetings with him.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  But the point that's why suddenly he saw the DNC, he saw night.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  It's about eight months ago.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  I was like, I really like you guys.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Now, keep the good work because nobody's perfect.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  I used to dislike people I like now.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  We all change.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  We all grow.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  It's super hard working.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  Great guy.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  The fact that he's the new Alex Jones and bigger than I am in some respects.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  Wonderful, wonderful.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  But we need to get David Knight and other people prominently out there who are just as smart
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  as I am, just as informed, just as on target.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  So David, you won't just be hosted every few weeks now.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  I know you wanted this, but I better not.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  I don't think I will.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  I think you'll get more energy doing it.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  But doing a three hour show, and I still want you to come on some too.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  Just get ready to really enter the arena.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Are you ready?
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Absolutely.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  I'll let you know you were talking earlier about your new site, newswars.com.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  And of course, we could just go with infowars.com, but it's a different look to it.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  It's a different feel.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  It's going to have a little bit different content, but it's going to be.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Oh, that's your website too.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  Info Wars is yours too, David.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  We're all in this together.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  So, but the point is, is that when you, when you sell the different supplements and things
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  like quay or you have caveman, you've got them in different flavors.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  Same thing with your toothpaste.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  So you've got different flavors, basically the same stuff, but it's packaged in a slightly
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  different way.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  Just like we have a new look on a new website.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  And so that's basically what is behind this.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  And we look at one of the things I liked about newswars besides the nice, clean look of it.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  It looks like a newspaper.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  One of the things that they put at the top, I think to get back at the Washington Post,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  they've got the kind of strange subtitle for the Washington Post.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  They say, democracy dies in darkness.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  And that's exactly what we're seeing now.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  We see the left.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  We see the corporate media pushing back.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  We've got a story that's on Dredge Report today.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Exactly.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  Their slogan is what they're doing to us.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Exactly.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  So I think we said, tyranny dies in the light.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  Tyranny dies in the light.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  Yes.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  And you know, as well as I do, when we had this, we went to that protest there at Planned Parenthood.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  My wife was there.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  We had signs saying, this is genocide against black people.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  And the protesters, the counter protesters showed up with black signs.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  They had nothing to say in defense of abortion.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Instead, they showed up with their black signs to try to eclipse our message.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  And I think it's significant that the real news is starting on Eclipse Day, because that's the tactic of the left.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  They don't want to argue.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  They simply want to censor you and they want to shut you down.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  And so we got this story from Benjamin Media.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  That's the point.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  Can we search engine?
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  Can we search engine?
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  What was the headline like?
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  Communist attack, infowars, and anti-abortion rally, I think is the main video.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  We did a live feed.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  They showed up with black tar paper and were physically attacking us.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  And then black people were going, we murder our children.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Shut up.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  We're going to kill the blacks.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  And you're just like, what the hell?
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  And that's not the first time that's happened.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  I've told the story of weird black people with like green skin.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  The whites have green skin.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  They have green skin.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  It's all like your demonic.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  Just like in a movie.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  Just like in Omega Man.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  Everybody has green skin.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  And they're just like, we're going to kill them.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And you won't stop.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Like it's exorcist or something.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  And it really makes you believe in God.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  When you go out and people are going, they're going to kill the blacks racist.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  You'll never stop us from killing the blacks.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  And I mean, it's just, it's insane.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  Your wife's like, you know, I have a daughter adopted.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  And then they shut up white devil.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  You just did it.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Just a moral signal.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Better to kill that baby.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  And then they try on video.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  You cannot.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  That's right.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And then they tried to spit on my daughter.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  And unfortunately the glass is up, but they saw her in the car and they spit on the glass
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  where my daughter was that we had adopted.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  This is what's happening now though.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Alex, we've got Google working with liberal groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  to algorithmically censor people to label them as hate groups.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  And of course, who are they labeling as hate groups?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  We've had the Southern Poverty Law Center this last week, but out more lists.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  And this isn't the first time they've done it.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  They put Christian groups on there like family research council, like the Alliance Defending.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  Not them attacked.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  Yeah.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  And so they put them out, label them as hate groups.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  Why?
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  Because they stand for traditional marriage.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  Martin Luther King stood for traditional marriage.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Are they going to remove his name from all the streets?
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Are they going to tear down the monuments?
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  They actually are calling for removing him.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  They're calling him a homophobe and they're calling him a transphobe.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Well, that's where it goes.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  Actually major universities are removing Martin Luther King now.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  Yeah.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Because he said judge somebody off what they do.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  Yeah.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  You fix my car.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  You play good music.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  You've got good Southern cooking.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  There's some black restaurants on the east side.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Got the best Southern cooking over there.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  And you bet I'm in there eating like a little pig because they don't have to cook it.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  There's some black barbecue joints in East Austin.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  I go there not because they're black, because the barbecue falls off the bone.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  Speaking of Jimi Hendrix, we're playing his music.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  Not because he's black, but because that music's got what it takes, baby.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  I got something and I'm super bad.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more due to requests from lifters who found that
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored super blue toothpaste and more.

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Okay folks, okay folks, we are back live.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Worldwide Sunday Global Transmission.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  The start of the next segment, J.K., Ryan, Sean, Don, Kim, Nicole, many others were going to you.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  Sean gave us a little comment that reminds me of something I forgot to write about or cover Friday.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  My wife used an Uber to go see some of her friends here in Seattle while I was working Friday.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  And they sent her this whole email about racism is everywhere.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  Trump is a KKK member.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  There's evil racist everywhere.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  Please report it to us immediately.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  Help us deny service to anybody that's a Nazi.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  I mean, they're just creating a hysteria where meanwhile I'm walking down the street.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  They're trying to attack me.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  That's just pure bullying.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  It's a full corporate press and I believe it's going to backfire.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  But Sean says email from his job calling Trump a Nazi.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  So we're going to go to him first at the start of the next segment with David Knight,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  who is riding shotgun today, but we'll be hosting tomorrow at 8 a.m. Central.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  The real news.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  We're going to build a whole new radio slash TV network around that.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  And we've got an info wars dot com port slash show affiliate links.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  We're on the big establishment, you know, satellite release time, big contract.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  That's time for the next year.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  But I just show live on that and archives so they can play at any time they want off the star guide systems.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  And I've signed the contracts for two other shows that start one of them hadn't been announced yet.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  One of them is war room that starts on the 4th of September.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  So we're busy hiring people moving forward.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  Thanks for all your prayers.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  Thanks for everything you do out there info wars store.com is where you can get great products and fund the operation.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  But before we go to those callers, I wanted to mention just some big breaking news.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  And I was told I could basically get into this from both sources.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  But I'll be very, very careful about what I get into here.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  I don't really care about regular court or palace entry in an administration.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  If the palace entry is just globalist against globalist trying to get control of the president so they themselves can get better sweetheart deals.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  We've seen Democrats and Republicans sell out our infrastructure or military.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  The Panama Canal are missile secrets armed North Korea.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  It's fun the Arab Spring bipartisanly both groups are against Trump.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  And that's why I'm proud to stand against the media bullies, the Hollywood bullies, the Saudi Arabian bullies, the Islamic bullies, the Chinese Communist bullies, the EU bullies, the Democrats, all of it, the demonizations, the thugs on the street, the useful idiots.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  Because I know I'm right and we're going to change the world together because we're not the yes men, you know, selling gasoline in hell.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  We're selling snowcones in hell.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  We're selling, you know, ice cold ice tea in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  We're selling what folks want, what we want.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  Treating folks like we want to be treated.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  Good old fashioned straight up shooting.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  I couldn't sit around and scheme anything.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  I'm just straight up.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  Everybody knows that.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  And the globalists just don't know what to do at this point.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  But I don't just get into White House intrigue to cover White House intrigue.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  But you know, we tell you, hey, Trump's going to announce no boots on the ground.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  Three days later, he does it on Syria.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Or we tell you, yeah, Priebus and Spicer are not going to be out Friday.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  It happens exactly as we told you.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  We told you on Monday.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  We just have to prove to you here, you know, that we told you a few weeks ago.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  No, he is out banning is out for this book.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Devils bargain where he takes credit for everything.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  And a lot of stuff that Trump actually did and that other people did.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  He takes credit for in Devils bargain.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  And it's not about Trump wanting the credit or other people that actually made those shots getting the credit.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  Some of it's my work.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  I don't want the credit.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  I'm just telling you that was part of the issue.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  And the army, you know, he took credit for stuff the army did.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  And look, I'm not here criticizing ban.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  I think he's super smart.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  A great asset.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  I love Breitbart.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  I'm not competition with Breitbart.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  I'm not here to count coup.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  When we knew he was out two weeks ago, I was bemoaning.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  And David Knight thought it was a really bad sign that Trump was getting rid of loyalist and a few patriots that were remaining.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  I was called David two days ago.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  And I said, we should wait on this.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And I never tell us what to say or do.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  I didn't tell him what to do.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  I just said, I don't know yet.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  I'm talking to a lot of people that are very close to this and making some phone calls.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And I think it's just classic power struggles.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  A band is a great guy, a patriot, not a racist, a great guy.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  He got in there, though, and his great sin was thinking they'd eat him last.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Well, finally they got to him.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  And so he brought in the generals.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  He brought in McMaster.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  He brought in Rex Tillerson and all these corporate guys who are executing Trump's Make America a Great Again agenda.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  So all I care about is the president's agenda is executed.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  He may take goblins, his goblin guides, who went into a goblin's nest.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  As long as he's not, you know, kissing goblins and goblins are vomiting everywhere, catching them in bed with a goblin, you know, succubus with a goblin.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  As long as that's not going on, we're cool.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  And so far he's gotten more done than I thought he would in seven months.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  But right now we're in a holding pattern.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  Overall, I can tell you, though, that it was over the inner fighting.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  And it was over Bannon fighting with Jared and Ivanka and then McMaster and then McMaster and Bannon kind of teaming up against Scaramucci.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  And then out of the wreckage of Scaramucci, Bannon two weeks ago said he was going to do his resignation.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  And I'd been told he was going to resign two weeks ago within three days.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  I guess for whatever reason, they had him hold off on it.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  He had nothing to do with Charlottesville.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  That's just a fact.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  And they're admitting that.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  And I love Breitbart.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  I love the work they're doing.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  Really great folks, really good nationalist patriots.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  And so I sleep good at night knowing they're there.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  It's like I sleep good at night knowing drudgerport.com's there because I don't want to walk point all the time.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  It's good to have those folks out there with their professionalism, their funding, their crowdsourcing, everything they're doing.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  But it is of concern because right now the president says, now I'll get my agenda done.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  Now I want peace.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  I don't want to hear I'm not getting my agenda done because there's in fighting.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Well, the in fighting was over what was left of loyal opposition, battling.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  And now you got deep staters that have brought in Congolese Rice around the State Department and brought in Petraeus's people and Soros's people at National Security with McMaster.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  More and more, it looks like for my high level sources that the kingpin is aka General Mattis, aka the real Palpatine.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  And so that's the big rooster in the henhouse there.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  And as long as these are American eggs we're laying, I don't have a problem who's running around with the rooster behavior.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  But I'm going to get real upset if things start going sideways at this point.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  So let's wait and see if they're telling Trump we'll get your agenda done now, sir.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  We'll get those tax cuts, sir.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  We'll get Obamacare repealed, sir.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  We'll get the border secured.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  A lot of what they've already done and we'll get our military strengthened again and we'll finish knocking out ISIS.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  I mean, incredible successes and we'll have the seven nation ban, which we've successfully had and we'll... North Korea's kind of halfway back down.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  So Trump's just having devastating success.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  You watch mainstream media, you'd think he'd totally blown himself up.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  We're going to come back, talk to David Knight about this place, some clips and go to calls.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  But David Knight, what do you think of what I just said?
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  One of the things I'm worried about reported on this on Friday was the fact there's going to be a Camp David meeting with the generals and Trump.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  And now we see that McMasters has said, we've reached a decision on an Afghan strategy after rigorous debate.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  He said, Trump really did come in with a different course of action and I think he now needs a weekend to collect his thoughts on how he's going to explain it to the American people.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  That looks very ominous to me.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  I'm very concerned about what these generals are going to do with our foreign policy.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Well, well, I hadn't seen that quote.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  I'm going to come back and lead with that.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  What an undermining.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  Yeah.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  It sounds like they don't agree with the president on this longest war, 16 years.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  Yes.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  And that they think he's a bad guy and they're undermining.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  And well, you know, this is the moment of truth.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  He's getting rid of people one after the other is what he says and going to find out who's leaking and who's not executing.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote,
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  That is the ultimate concern.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  The concentration of power, the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  It was why the anti-federalists opposed the Constitution.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  of what the real constraints upon them are.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  or avoid most of the toxic effects to themselves.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  The elects of pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information,
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  and in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  and winning because of your support.

[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  You know, most talk show hosts are really good at plugging their websites.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  But I should just get on the air and just look at the news articles, videos,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  and every segment play a video and comment on it.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  Look at this quote. Now, I don't want to say this on air or they'll edit it out on the news
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  and then say that I said this. But you know what? I can't live like that.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Because they're going to edit when I'm going to say and play it to say I'm racist.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  Let them do it. I'm going to read what the lady says on the video.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Seriously. And again, we'll see who wins.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  We'll see if they can eclipse the truth, eclipse reality.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  There's video up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Quote, stupid black bitch supposed to be on our side,
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  Antifa yells as black officer during Boston protest.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  It's a liberal city. The police are out there.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  They're letting you beat up the Trump supporters, beat up old women.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  In fact, let's play that segment a minute of the of the woman.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  We have that clip right into the video yesterday.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  A 70 something years old woman over being beaten up.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  She has an American flag being stomped at a bunch of skanky white chicks go.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  You deserve it. You know, you're pro Trump.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  Stupid black bitch supposed to be on our side.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Antifa yells at black officer during Boston protest.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  That's just called civilization.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  That that's that's just your police.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  But there's just this bring everything down.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  Everything's our enemy.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  If a building's name Lynch get rid of it because that means Lynch black people.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  It's just rolling over to to to virtue signal to anything and everything.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  It is insane.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  White House petition calls on Trump to officially recognize the antifa as a terrorist organization.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Here's another one. New York Times applaud's far left violence.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  So does the Washington Post. So does CNN.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  So does MSNBC. They say it's good to go out.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  And if somebody's a conservative, basically kill them.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  They want a civil war.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  And they're always claiming I'm calling for violence.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  Comedian Dick Gregory guest on the show civil rights activist. He disagreed with me some of the last few years of Obama, but it doesn't matter.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  He was a great guy. He died.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  And I just got a word. Jerry Lewis died.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  You know, he exposed it menstrual dysrophy was mainly a either in utero or also after a deficiency in nutrients.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  They learned it zoos to give the folks nutrients and that would stop.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  And then they kicked him off of it once he found basically that the root cause like scurvy is caused by no vitamin C.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  Expliciation is not having oxygen.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  You know, same thing. A lot of these diseases are from nutrient deficiencies.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  So there you go. Jerry Lewis, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  And Lord have mercy. Great balls of fire.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  David Knight's riding shotgun with us.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  David, I want to go to Sean Ryan, J.K. Don Kim, Nicole Fontaine with a cool name and others before this transmission ends.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  But any comments on just the frothing anti everything from the left now, they've truly gone insane.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  Well, you know, Alex, it's kind of like that Mike judges idiocracy, but it's very violent.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  You know, idiocracy, they weren't that violent, but now they are very violent.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  And we have an article idiocracy meets road warrior.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  Yeah, let me read you this headline from the Washington Post.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  Democrats say Confederate monuments are now white supremacist rallying points.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  No, they're Democrat rallying points.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  And we've had Democrats. We had a black lady.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  And by the way, all those white supremacists, all those people were Democrats.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  It's damn statues of Democrats.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  That's right. There was a headline back in North Carolina where the news sites said the North Carolina governor said,
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  if you get rid of all the Confederate monuments and so forth and so on. So the headline, the subtitle was,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  the governor says he's going to raise Democrat history.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  And that's really what we're talking about because that was the history.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  That was a Democrat and an active Jim Crow on history.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  If you know history, it's so insulting how they flipped it all around and double cross Christian white conservatives that did all this freeing up of everybody.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  And then they turn it around on my grandfather and people that put their ass up on the line to do all this.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  And I guess he might have been wrong. I mean, I'm defending that they got rid of segregation and so I'm glad they did.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  But then it just, they brought in something worse.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  It's just like they stabbed true liberalism in the back with the dirtbag Democratic Party.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  So now they've made something just as bad.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  But that's a lot of times an evil gets replaced with an evil.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  David, you brought up the quote by a general.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  Read that again though.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Criticizing the president saying, oh, you'll have to give this strategy on Monday and make sense.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  Well, your 16 year failed war that's killed tens of thousands of people in opium production nine times what it was.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  That's a damn failure.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  So I missed it.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Which one of the gang of three, which one of those generals said that?
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  That was Mattis.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  And they've been talking about the fact they're going to go from about 4,000 to about 8,400 troops.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  So they said, no, we're going to go further than that.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  And he said, Trump came in with a very different course of action.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  I think he now needs the weekend to collect his thoughts about how he's going to explain it to the American people that evidently the generals have told him what the new strategy is going to be.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  And he's got to figure out how he's going to explain that to the American people.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  I want to read you one other thing to drive Alex.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  And this is back with AP talking about generals, Mattis and Kelly.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  Every time it's how he's going to collect his thoughts.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Every time one of these damn generals talks, it's talking about how they're going to control the president.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  God Almighty.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Let me tell you how condescending they are about this.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  The AP reported a couple of weeks ago that Mattis and Kelly, when he was still secretary of Homeland Security, agreed that in the earliest weeks of Trump's presidency,
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  one of them would remain in the United States at all times to keep tabs on the orders that were rapidly emerging from the White House.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  Wait, is that in the news now?
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  Because we broke that first.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Yeah.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  We broke that first.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  Is that in the news now?
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  That's in the news now.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  That was part of when they were talking about, hey, look, the generals and the New Yorkers have got his back.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  They don't have his back.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  When they talk about New Yorkers, they're talking about the Goldman Sachs bankers, the Wall Street people.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  They don't have his back.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  What they're saying is we're keeping him in line with what all of you want.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  And if you look at what the mainstream press is saying, they said, oh, this is really good.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  These guys are in control, enacting a very rigid chain of command.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  And of course, remember they were saying about Bannon.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  They're also saying they'll counterman his orders.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  They'll counterman his orders.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Absolutely.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  This is going into coup territory.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  Yes, yes.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  It's not a bad thing that they're controlling.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  They said the next few months something big is going to happen.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  They said the next few months they're going to remove him.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  Does he even know what's happening?
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  It's up to us to get the word out.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  We don't want to go off half-cocked, but I'm pretty close to shooting up the bat signal.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Let's go to some phone calls here.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  David Knight launches a new show tomorrow.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  8 a.m. Central, infowars.com, forward slash show.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  All of you in the info war tomorrow, on your email, on your Facebook, on your Twitter, tell folks he's covering critical issues and breaking news.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  A new conservative libertarian network launched as Fox News begins to implode.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  We fill that vacuum with the patriot information.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Sean in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  Go ahead.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  I wanted to call in to let you know I work at one of the big four accounting firms.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Just don't want to bore your audience just to let your audience know what big four accounting firms do.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  We're the ones that look at the financial statements of every publicly traded company so that investors can know whether or not the financial information they give them is true or not.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  So just getting that in the back.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  So these are very important companies.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  There's only like two or three companies that certify the stocks, the bonds that rate the companies.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  Absolutely.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  So I'm going to take a risk here because I think I need to be specific if I get fired for this, screw it.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  It's worth it.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  So I work at Ernst & Young.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  Mark Weinberger is the CEO of Ernst & Young.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  He was on the President's Policy and Strategy Forum.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  As you know, that kind of fell apart in the last few days as each CEO decided that they want to virtue signal out to the rest of America about what great liberal they are.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  So just to give you a little background of that.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  So after that got disbanded, he sent out a firm-wide email to all 60,000 employees here at Ernst & Young.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  And I'd like to read with your permission the first couple paragraphs of this email.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  However, I do have a question.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  Would you like me to read it in a normal voice or in a liberal voice?
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Dude, however you want, I wish the show was five hours long, please black out your name, whatever, send it to David Knight so we can post that in the morning and have this be a top story in the morning.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  But showtipsatinfowars.com, but go ahead.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  Yeah, but here we go.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  Policy and Strategy Forum announcement from Mark Weinberger, CEO of Ernst & Young.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  As much as I believe in engagement and dialogue today with my fellow members of the U.S. President's Policy and Strategy Forum,
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  we made the decision to disband the group.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  As I have previously stated publicly, I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the tragic and deplorable act that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia this weekend.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  In addition to the increasing divisiveness we are living with our community,
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  groups to stand for picketry and hate have no place in our society.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Stay there, finish on the other side, Sean.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  This is important.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects,
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  And this part is most important.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  That means it's clean.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  That means it's pure.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  And rest-secured.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  You're funding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  Coffee at infowarslife.com.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  The truly natural fragrance-free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  Emrex Essentials wants you to enjoy the sun and strives to bring you organic products to enhance your life.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  Naturally protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emrex Essentials.

[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  Visit infowarrestore.com and learn more about the new SPF 30 sunscreen lotion.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  I'll show folks an email sent out to Uber users about KKK's everywhere.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  We're watching and we hope things aren't too dangerous.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  Meanwhile, the new world order is run by a Nazi.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  George Soros.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  Go ahead and finish your letter there, Sean.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Yep, so I just ran around.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  This is from the CEO of Ernst & Young, Mark Weinberger, who was on the CEO forum explaining why he left it.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  So just to skip the boring part.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  He says the groups who stand for bigotry and hate have no place in our society and should be denounced.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  There should be no place in society for such views and there is no moral equivalent between those who are motivated by hate and those who oppose them.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  As with many of you, I was disappointed in President Trump's reaction to these events.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  I believe leaders should unite rather than divide people.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  This is the CEO of one of the most significant companies in the United States sending out complete propaganda crap to all of his employees.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  Oh, I've got Uber email here just saying we're all bracing, we're all under attack, it's all horrible, we're all dead.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  Oh my God, let's all stick together.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  That means do whatever the big banks say.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  Again, they're robbing us all so they create a fake tribalism that we're all fighting with each other according to what color we are.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  Thank you so much, Sean.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  Since we have the clip, here it is from Boston, a black lady yelling another black lady who's a police officer screaming at her that she's on the bad guy side.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  She's on the white people side because she's a cop.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Again, folks, this is the brainwashing.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Here it is.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  I don't know how good that audio translated into.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  I don't know how good that audio translated over the radio, but you can clearly see it when she's saying it with the lower audio and her lips moving.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  There's so much noise.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  We got, we got JK, we got Ryan, we got Kim, we got Don, we got Nicole, we got Fontaine, we got Josh.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  We got all these people to go to.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  Let's talk to Don in Seattle where I am for a few more hours.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  Don, you're on the year worldwide.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Thanks for calling.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Thanks a lot.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Just a special thank you for your survival shields, X2, and your bio trusillinium life changing.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  And then also another thank you for your secret 12.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  I have the injections, vitamin B12 for injections.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  Boy, you have saved me a sore hip.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  And then also your traveler, your proprio traveler, the water tastes so sweet.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  The only bad thing is I'm drinking over a gallon a day.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  But thank you for all of them and I'll yield my time to somebody else.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  But I just wanted to thank you for your fine product.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  Well, thank you.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  Like we're calling about the ostrich syndrome in Seattle.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  Yes, I wanted to hear.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  Well, we'll briefly tell us about ostrich syndrome.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  Well, the ostrich syndrome is basically up in Seattle out here.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  Everyone buries their head and liberal ideas and that is their sand.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  They're liberal ideas.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  And they believe that liberal ideas are going to save them and they all sit there.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  The whole bodies are exposed.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  They don't care.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  And, you know, that's just basically what the bottom line is.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  But I just wanted basically really to thank you for your product and you have a nice day
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  and I'll let somebody else get on the line.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  He sounds like the guy that says, we're a motel.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  Six won't leave the line on for you.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  What a great guy.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  Everybody outside Seattle is super awake.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  Most folks here are listeners.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  It's just that they're like a priesthood of like they're so proper and they are the good people and you are the Nazi.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  It's like, dude, you're crazy.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  You're a fruit loop.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  I want to live in America and have lower taxes and be able to defend myself and not be told I'm evil all day because I'm white.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  You're the people pushing racism and it's literally white people.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  I've had like 50 white people come over and say F you and one black dude come over and go, man, you like racism.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  I'm like, no, he goes, okay, cool.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  I'm not trying to like virtue signal and go.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  The minorities are real nice.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  The white people are whacked out.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  Something's wrong with them.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fontaine.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  Fontaine from the great state of California.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  You're on the air.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Go ahead.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  Yeah, Fontaine.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  Yeah, I just want to say I got a lot of influence in how you involved your child's mom.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  I'm a single dad too.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  And I let my kid be with the mom as much as possible.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  But on that subject, he's forced to watch CNN in school in sixth grade.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  And he comes home and tells me that everything's okay, dad.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  We apologized to North Korea and we don't have to worry about getting nuked now.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  I thought, oh my God.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  When I was in high school 25 years ago, they made us watch in multiple times a day.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  Multiple times a day because the quote government paid for the TVs in every classroom.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  So we had to watch corporate commercials, MTV and CNN every day.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  Yeah, now it's called CNN 10 or CNN student.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  I think they changed it too.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  But you know, what do I do?
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  I'm going to go to the school board or the whatever school meeting.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  CNN is force fed.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  You need to point out they're anti-American.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  They have a bias and you need to file suit on the city.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  They'll make them change the channel.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  Look, CNN is only seen in hotel lobbies, bars, restaurants, airports and government training camps.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  And so I totally agree with you.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  It's time to absolutely raise the stink and say, listen, we're not going to be bombarded by this bullying garbage.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  We have to get aggressive just like they've been.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  God bless you, Fontaine.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  Okay, let's go to another caller here.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  Let's talk to Amy in the great state of New Jersey.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  Amy, you're on the air.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  Hi, Alex, the great talk to you.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  My husband is to blame for me being obsessed with your show.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  He's the one who woke me up.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  God bless him.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  Yeah, he's wonderful.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  We're the few Jews that support our president and we're not the Trotsky ones like the liberals in my family.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  I totally understand.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  You're not the Trotsky ones that are constantly trying to kill Jews.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Absolutely.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  They're so brainwashed and they're in their little bubble and all that.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  But you did mention about the Antifa.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  My state did declare it as a domestic terrorism.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  That's good for Chris Christie.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  He did a good job.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  That's the only thing.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  I don't like him otherwise because he ruined my school.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  Well, Antifa has been calling for killing cops.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  I mean, if you just randomly call for killing people, I think that's terrorist, don't you?
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  Absolutely.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  But what's been taken so long for this to be done by our president who should have called it out when he was talking about the thing in Charlottesville?
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  He says, you got to name it for what it is.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  We named radical Islamic terrorism.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  It's time to give it a name.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  There's so many people out there that never have heard of it.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  If you went to my mother-in-law, my parents, they've never heard of the word Antifa.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  There are so many people that don't know what it is.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  They're basically communist, cop-hating.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  Anti-Semitism is like their main deal.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  They love radical Islam.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  Oh, I know.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  The problem is why?
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  He needs to do this on Tuesday night in Phoenix when everybody's there, when he has the big TV viewership.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  He needs to say that KKK is a terrorist organization and he needs to say that Antifa is a terrorist organization.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  It's an absolute democratic sound and also he needs to declare BLM and also the Muslim Brotherhood to be domestic terrorist groups too.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  I think that's something everybody should tweet at Trump.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  We should all call for that all week.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  BLM, Antifa, he needs to declare them terrorist groups.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  He needs to go on the offense and go after Soros.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  Yes, ma'am, Amy, I'm out of time. I wanted to get to Josh, Nicole, and Kim.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  Nicole and Kim, let's get their names, numbers, and Josh.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  You get a free t-shirt of your choice.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  CNN's fake news.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  M4's is real news.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  Molan Lombay, whatever t-shirt you want, your choice.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  Let's get all three of those callers I didn't get to.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Names and numbers.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  We'll send you out a free t-shirt, infowarstore.com.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  If folks want to support us, great job to the crew.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  Great job, the listeners.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  Great job to Amy.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  That's a great last caller to go to.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  I'm sorry to get to more.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  David Knight, tomorrow, 8 a.m. Central, infowarstore.com.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  David's a great guy.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  His show getting syndicated across America is going to really help people.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  But I don't want us to just get 50, 60 affiliates in the next six months.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  That's my goal.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  I want to go over 100 affiliates in the next six months.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  That's up to you.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Our great stations listening.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  David is a really professional guy, better than I am in many ways.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  Perfect for your station.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  So David Knight, you got 30 seconds.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Say bye to folks.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  And you know what she's talking about?
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  Can we get Antifa declared a terrorist organization?
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  We've got McMaster who's endorsed a book that says that al-Qaeda terrorism is simply resistance.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  That Jihad is peaceful.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  He cannot say radical Islamic terrorism.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  And anybody who says that the White House is going to be put out.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  That's the problem we've got coming.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  Thank you.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  Thank you.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  Thank you.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:50.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
