[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:37.560]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well we're not
[00:37.560 --> 00:43.240]  going to be covering Miley Cyrus and her mystery date that turned out to be a wanted man today
[00:43.240 --> 00:49.440]  I'm sorry we're gonna be talking about the headline Russian troops invade Ukraine breach
[00:49.440 --> 00:56.120]  of border again fighting alongside rebels assault intensifies that's the headline on
[00:56.120 --> 01:07.360]  dredgerport.com from Reuters Bloomberg the Washington Post you name it we also have the
[01:07.360 --> 01:16.360]  reports up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com here's the bottom line Russia has been in
[01:16.360 --> 01:21.960]  Ukraine since this all started earlier this year when the Ukrainian government and the
[01:21.960 --> 01:29.960]  people voted to not join the EU when the West basically overthrew the government in a coup
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.040]  an unelected coup that Obama called elected Russia came in and secured areas that were
[01:35.040 --> 01:42.400]  historically part of Russia I'm not defending Russia that's just a fact they act a lot less
[01:42.400 --> 01:49.520]  colonial and expansionist than the Goldman Sachs does running our country they're not
[01:49.520 --> 01:57.520]  messing with my interest they're not trying to take my liberties like the globalist are
[01:57.520 --> 02:03.840]  but since that happened they put proxy troops in they put advisors in there's been a propaganda
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.840]  war with the shoot down of the Malaysian aircraft who knows the truth on that but there have
[02:09.840 --> 02:18.280]  been CIA and NATO advisors with the Ukrainian troops the entire time trying to take over
[02:18.280 --> 02:26.560]  ethnically Russian areas on the Russian border inside eastern Ukraine that's what's going
[02:26.560 --> 02:36.040]  on
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.960]  now that said when you hear big announcements of oh my gosh Russia has invaded we heard this
[02:41.960 --> 02:47.240]  two weeks ago that supposedly a Russian column of armored vehicles got blown up remember that
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.000]  fact we guys reprint me that thank you they never retracted it but it turned out there
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.480]  was no video it didn't happen remember in 2008 when the Olympics kicked off we were
[02:59.480 --> 03:06.920]  told I woke up and saw CNN and they announced Russia has invaded Georgia Russia has invaded
[03:06.920 --> 03:12.560]  Georgia and I remember going on air hours later and saying Russia has invaded Georgia
[03:12.560 --> 03:17.920]  in an insane move of course hours later I was reading foreign press and it was after
[03:17.920 --> 03:24.400]  Georgian forces attacked South Ossetia and Abkhazia killing the entire garrisons of Russian
[03:24.400 --> 03:31.440]  troops that had been there since the end of World War two in Russian ethnic areas in that
[03:31.440 --> 03:36.440]  zone and that they had attacked and the Russians had come in to drive them out and said we're
[03:36.440 --> 03:40.360]  going to go all the way to the capital of Georgia if you don't stop attacking us and
[03:40.360 --> 03:46.480]  if NATO doesn't pull out with with with US and other mercenaries and then NATO pulled
[03:46.480 --> 03:56.480]  out and Russia pulled out Kiev says forces destroyed Russian armor inside Ukraine remember
[03:56.480 --> 04:05.120]  that back on August 15th almost two weeks ago we just keep hearing this but the media
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.000]  is running with the headline the New York Times and others that Russian troops have
[04:09.000 --> 04:23.800]  invaded Russian troops have invaded there is one and guardian Ukraine troops battled
[04:23.800 --> 04:31.720]  Russian armor column claims Kiev Russia plays down hopes for breakthrough as Minsk talks
[04:31.720 --> 04:37.840]  as tensions rise with plans to send second aid convoy into Ukraine and the Russians
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.480]  have released video that it's aid convoys then they say well they're painting military
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.600]  vehicles white well that's the oldest trick in the book I don't know what the truth is
[04:46.600 --> 04:50.880]  but they've been caught lying so many times that I don't trust NATO and the new world
[04:50.880 --> 05:00.400]  order one micron and this is a Russian interest in that area another major health threat this

[08:34.080 --> 08:43.480]  well the president of ukraine has announced that russian troops have invaded the country
[08:43.480 --> 08:52.560]  satellite photos are now being released nato released a series of satellite images on thursday
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.520]  showing that a top general described as russian combat soldiers equipped with sophisticated
[08:58.520 --> 09:04.960]  heavy weaponry are operating inside ukraine's sovereign territory according to a statement
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.840]  posted on the nato website the photos confirmed that nato and its allies had been seeing for
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.560]  weeks from other sources this is a direct contradiction of recent statements made by kremlin officials
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.280]  that a pro russian separatist leader in ukraine who said all the russian troops that entered
[09:20.280 --> 09:28.840]  the country are on their vacations and assisting the separatist on a volunteer basis well stop
[09:28.840 --> 09:35.360]  right there i have no doubt that russian troops have been in there for years there's a whole
[09:35.360 --> 09:41.120]  bunch of naval and russian army bases in ukraine it's been part of russia for hundreds of years
[09:41.120 --> 09:46.120]  i'm not on russia's side here and i'm not on goldman sacks and jp morgan that run our
[09:46.120 --> 09:51.820]  country's side or nato's side these are two different predatory power blocks fighting
[09:51.820 --> 09:58.560]  with each other but the west did overthrow the elected ukrainian government earlier this
[09:58.560 --> 10:04.320]  year and installed an unelected one that obama called elected they've since had elections
[10:04.320 --> 10:11.000]  that russia didn't dispute too much and the new president is saying russia has invaded
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.560]  well it's admitted that the cia and nato are in there bringing arms and weapons and
[10:15.560 --> 10:21.080]  advisors as well so let's get this straight there's a cold war going on just like from
[10:21.080 --> 10:27.680]  1959 to 1964 when the vietnam war officially got going with a go with a gulf atonkin staged
[10:27.680 --> 10:35.360]  event there was officially a staged event that got us into that not declassified for
[10:35.360 --> 10:45.760]  40 years but nevertheless from the time that endo china fell from the time that the french
[10:45.760 --> 10:51.720]  pulled out of vietnam in 59 and eisenhower secretly sent about 30 000 quote advisors
[10:51.720 --> 10:59.400]  in they were coming home every day in pine boxes sometimes dozens a day in pine boxes
[10:59.400 --> 11:06.520]  i know people i have family that was in vietnam in 1960 that's been declassified so it's the
[11:06.520 --> 11:13.760]  same thing you've got us forces mercenaries nato forces it's come out in the foreign
[11:13.760 --> 11:22.200]  news battling russian troops in eastern ukraine so yes that's true it's probably going on
[11:22.200 --> 11:26.040]  they announced two weeks ago or almost two weeks ago on the 15th of august that they
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.600]  destroyed a russian armored convoy of armored vehicles and tanks they showed no video later
[11:32.600 --> 11:37.280]  they showed a few white vehicles burning that the russian said were aid vehicles i'm sure
[11:37.280 --> 11:45.120]  the russians are smuggling weapons in i think most sides are lying here but who's backyard
[11:45.120 --> 11:51.040]  is it who started it who overthrew ukraine george soros bragged just type in george
[11:51.040 --> 11:56.720]  soros takes credit for ukraine overthrow this is a guy that wants our guns this is a guy
[11:56.720 --> 12:01.680]  that wants to end our free speech this is a guy trying to finance open borders here it's
[12:01.680 --> 12:06.720]  the same globalist that want destabilization worldwide there's the headline soros admits
[12:06.720 --> 12:11.360]  responsibility for coup and mass murder in ukraine color revolution collaboration began
[12:11.360 --> 12:18.880]  soon after in engineered fall of soviet union and it's now coming to a head five billion
[12:18.880 --> 12:26.080]  dollars spent in ukraine to destabilize it if they were really trying to bring the second
[12:26.080 --> 12:31.520]  amendment and freedom and not trying to take over the ukraine so the eu bankers the same
[12:31.520 --> 12:37.360]  ones that control our country could literally suck that nation dry and if ukrainians really
[12:37.360 --> 12:43.360]  wanted the russians completely out i'd be all for it but half of ukraine has always
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.880]  been traditionally russian it's over 90 plus percent russian in areas close to russian
[12:48.880 --> 12:55.640]  border overall you look up these numbers these demographics 75 percent of eastern ukraine
[12:55.640 --> 13:01.640]  is russian and they've been there for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years
[13:02.600 --> 13:06.040]  it's been part of russia scores of times this would be like
[13:07.400 --> 13:14.120]  mexico being unbacked taking back texas and saying well we had it you know 180 years ago
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.240]  and then texas start fighting back and it's on the news texas have invaded texas
[13:23.240 --> 13:30.840]  saying russians have invaded areas of eastern ukraine is like saying texas have invaded texas
[13:31.640 --> 13:38.760]  it just has no bearing in reality it'd be like saying comanches have invaded
[13:39.320 --> 13:47.000]  oklahoma or indiana it'd be like saying vikings have invaded norway
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.640]  it'd be like saying the dallas cowboys have invaded dallas the seattle seahawks have invaded
[13:55.640 --> 14:04.040]  seattle germans have invaded germany iraqis have invaded iraq no the globalist are manipulating
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.600]  all countries off against each other to sell weapons consolidate control they turned radical
[14:08.600 --> 14:15.320]  islamist run by saudi arabia financed by the west turkey you name it loose on our allies like
[14:15.320 --> 14:21.400]  hazy mubarak and egypt loose on people trying to work with the west like muhmer qaddafi loose
[14:21.400 --> 14:28.040]  on syria loose on iraq loose on the contractors and workers there are trying to put in an
[14:28.040 --> 14:33.080]  infrastructure i've watched these isis videos crossing of swords and others i can't even
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.320]  watch the whole thing where they pull families over on highways in iraq and then just shoot them
[14:37.320 --> 14:42.040]  with high-powered machine guns or walk up to utility workers trying to put in phone lines
[14:42.040 --> 14:47.080]  and blow them you know kill them and then pull up next to a guy when your wife is not wearing
[14:47.080 --> 14:52.600]  blacks he's wearing brown i mean it's just imagine living under these absolutely out of control
[14:52.600 --> 14:59.400]  a hobbyist who threaten us on a routine basis by the way notice they're not attacking israel
[14:59.400 --> 15:05.320]  they're not attacking the cia because folks they work for the group that is above the cia above
[15:05.320 --> 15:11.880]  israel above the european union above the vatican above all these power structures it is
[15:11.880 --> 15:17.560]  chaos directed against humanity almost like it's an alien force from a distant star system
[15:17.560 --> 15:22.840]  that's here posing as humans manipulating us it's that scientific that cold-blooded
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.880]  that evil in fact guys i don't remember the exact headline for but we've reposted it
[15:27.880 --> 15:35.480]  stars star trek exposes 911 i think it's the video name or star trek exposes divide and
[15:35.480 --> 15:41.800]  conquers what we called it when we posted it um it's like a seven-year-old video from youtube
[15:41.800 --> 15:46.120]  i want to play that later it's an episode from star trek i forget the name of the episode
[15:46.120 --> 15:50.360]  but i'll find the name we'll do a review of that i'd have mcbrain do a review of it he likes star
[15:50.360 --> 15:56.280]  trek uh i like star trek too we we both like this is so goofy we like the you know the original
[15:56.280 --> 16:05.320]  stuff with with uh captain curt liam shatner where there's an invisible alien on board the ship
[16:05.320 --> 16:10.200]  and it's playing the klingons and the humans off against each other to suck the energy
[16:10.200 --> 16:16.280]  and consolidate power over them and that's and i'm not saying it's a real alien doing this
[16:16.280 --> 16:23.160]  but that's an allegory of what we're dealing with and until we become aware of it there's no future
[16:23.160 --> 16:29.160]  i want to hear from military people out there again specifically contractors corporate people
[16:29.160 --> 16:34.760]  folks that have lived in ukraine or russia or poland or surrounding areas of you're in europe
[16:34.760 --> 16:39.400]  or you were a contractor or military give me your take on this because i get the cold-blooded
[16:39.400 --> 16:45.560]  chess cut russia off don't let them send gas to europe don't let them have a gas pipeline to china
[16:47.640 --> 16:53.320]  cut off uh the black sea put missile cruisers there call it missile defense when it's really a nuke
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.000]  shoot down system so russia can't respond if the west hits them first the problem is russia
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.800]  will launch on warning now because of these missiles being moved in that's what rey mcgovern
[17:03.800 --> 17:10.520]  who was ronald reagan and george hw bush's favorite morning briefer and top cia analyst
[17:11.640 --> 17:18.920]  very top for general geopolitical stuff combat vet whole nine yards and he just said the entire
[17:18.920 --> 17:26.040]  community of people that aren't nihilist deathwishers is this is the most dangerous point the world's
[17:26.040 --> 17:34.360]  ever been in and the globalist the big banks are busy manipulating and pushing the world towards
[17:34.360 --> 17:40.840]  crisis on every single front and i'm completely upset about it and completely focused i've been
[17:40.840 --> 17:45.400]  very serious this morning here at the office because you can feel the energy and the danger
[17:45.400 --> 17:57.480]  intensifying now they tried to lie and say russia had invaded georgia back in 2008 on 888
[17:57.480 --> 18:02.280]  in august of 2008 six years ago
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.720]  the question is is this another hoax where there are no russian forces
[18:09.720 --> 18:18.440]  preemptively invading i don't know are the russians there in a proxy war absolutely
[18:18.440 --> 18:23.560]  looking after their gas pipelines military enable bases and supply lines that's russia's
[18:23.560 --> 18:31.480]  main funding is supplying cheap gas to europe and cheap oil on 888 it's on record they have neocon
[18:31.480 --> 18:38.040]  known cia minions attacked me routinely for this because i expose it and they hate it that day i got
[18:38.040 --> 18:45.480]  up and went in at like six a.m. look at the news and the headline went on cnn and everywhere else
[18:45.480 --> 18:51.000]  i turned on television was russia has invaded georgia and even six years ago i was still naive
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.400]  i guess i still am naive who knows what the next shoe to drop is i was on air hours later at 11
[18:58.440 --> 19:01.080]  and went on air and said russia has invaded georgia
[19:01.080 --> 19:10.840]  and then people started emailing us bbc articles and their spiegel articles and russian news
[19:12.600 --> 19:17.720]  and it was headline president begs for help says they've been hit begs for nato who's already there
[19:17.720 --> 19:24.680]  they attacked obsesia south obsesia and abkhazia killing entire buildings full of russian troops
[19:24.680 --> 19:31.240]  in a middle of the night attack killing everyone and we're shelling in with tanks and the russians
[19:31.240 --> 19:37.000]  poured in across the border drove them back and said get out nato we're gonna attack you and nato
[19:37.000 --> 19:44.360]  pulled out russia pulled out a week later so the west is trying to take russian interest
[19:44.360 --> 19:49.000]  russia's pushing back and again i'm not seeing their angels or something the point is we don't
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.800]  have the moral high ground when when our elites are are are are directing the world towards this

[27:09.160 --> 27:13.800]  slave camps run by the west the equivalent of slave camps where they do mine the diamonds and
[27:13.800 --> 27:20.360]  then you will pay a year's salary to put a two carat diamond ring on your wife's finger and you

[33:50.280 --> 33:59.080]  from a lacerated sky bleeding its horror draining our structure now i will rain blood

[34:19.480 --> 34:23.720]  russia promotes men and women getting married and having children and not reduce their population
[34:23.720 --> 34:28.760]  the truth is russia has started to break away from the larger eugenics based new world order
[34:28.760 --> 34:35.880]  into a strong man nationalism that is brutish and ancient but compared to the new world order
[34:35.880 --> 34:42.040]  would be preferable that's all i'm saying and the west started this if you disagree with me
[34:42.040 --> 34:49.160]  go ahead and call in i think that it's a little bit of both um i think this is overall hype to
[34:49.160 --> 34:55.640]  get a larger escalation against the russians because using advisors with uh former russian
[34:55.640 --> 35:04.120]  military that lives in ukraine they are beating the nato cia mercenary forces in the mainly russian
[35:04.120 --> 35:10.840]  ethnic areas so there is a major proxy war with russia on their doorstep we know that's going on
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.840]  did they blow up an armored column two weeks ago turned out that wasn't true so you can't believe
[35:16.840 --> 35:23.000]  a word comes out of the elected president of ukraine again the first one they installed
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.560]  earlier this year was not elected in the nato coup so nato's caused the coup trying to steal
[35:29.560 --> 35:34.200]  the russian infrastructure the russian pipelines the russian bases they're not putting up with it
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.640]  and so the bankers the uh john corezine type people that make 40 to one bets with your private
[35:41.640 --> 35:46.680]  bank account money and don't get in trouble that have gotten away with anything you can imagine
[35:46.680 --> 35:52.040]  they think they can mess with russia just like napoleon did just like hitler did and even if you
[35:52.040 --> 35:57.560]  liked napoleon or hitler did it end well for them do you imagine if russia
[35:59.800 --> 36:05.000]  had helped overthrow the the mexican government and was now claiming part of texas belonged to them
[36:05.880 --> 36:12.120]  how would you feel about that that's what's happening but they prey on people's ignorance
[36:12.120 --> 36:18.200]  in fact i knew what happened now i'm hearing that a sod in the news is protecting isis which is al-qaeda
[36:18.200 --> 36:26.360]  al-qaeda in syria al-qaeda in iraq merged to form isis and then is that's all record
[36:26.360 --> 36:30.920]  doesn't matter they're saying oh we might have to take out a sod too because he he won't let us
[36:30.920 --> 36:37.480]  come in and take out isis when isis was armed by the very same globalist i mean this is so evil
[36:37.480 --> 36:42.520]  i want to hear from people that have lived in ukraine lived in russia or in russia i want to
[36:42.520 --> 36:47.800]  hear from contractors u.s military people that have been stationed over there what is your view

[37:00.200 --> 37:05.080]  just support 2 plus 2 equals 5 and i should support obama care because i'm not racist
[37:06.280 --> 37:11.640]  and everything is awesome i should just support fast and furious i should support

[37:44.920 --> 37:52.760]  globalists run enron scams and bernie made off scams no did the globalist in the last five years

[38:14.840 --> 38:22.040]  is cool they're going to start taxing us by the mile next year the department of transportation
[38:22.040 --> 38:31.640]  has announced and you know what is putin's fault if i fall on a banana peel or if i'm
[38:31.640 --> 38:37.560]  bouldering in grand in the grand canyon or bouldering in big bend and slip and tear my killies
[38:38.120 --> 38:45.720]  i don't say a cuss word under my breath i say latimer putin if i slam my finger in the car door
[38:45.720 --> 38:54.440]  i scream latimer putin if i have a stomach ache i scream latimer putin and that's normal
[38:54.440 --> 39:02.440]  but when something good happens i go barack obama new world order thank you oh thank you i mean it's
[39:02.440 --> 39:13.080]  just ridiculous toll free number 800 259 92 31 un calls emergency meeting on ukraine crisis
[39:15.080 --> 39:20.360]  ukraine's president says russian troops have been brought into ukraine calls for nato aid
[39:20.360 --> 39:27.320]  ride as nato tanks and armor show up in ukraine what would you do if nato was moving troops
[39:27.320 --> 39:31.320]  into ukraine and poland right by your gas pipelines that you get all your money from
[39:36.040 --> 39:38.520]  you would send in regular military
[39:41.960 --> 39:46.920]  let's see that's why i'm a trader i should support the foreign banks that occupy my country
[39:46.920 --> 39:52.200]  and they're going to sit this out in switzerland or the cayman islands or wherever starting a nuclear
[39:52.200 --> 39:57.320]  war i mean i'm just a bad person for not wanting a nuclear war the pentagon's been putting out
[39:57.320 --> 40:03.240]  lots of propaganda i mean truth about how we can survive a nuclear war why it's like no big deal
[40:04.520 --> 40:12.040]  radiation's good for you just to ask handculture russian and ukrainian troops battle in the south
[40:12.040 --> 40:20.040]  prompting fears that invasion has begun this is not confirmed but the washington post
[40:21.480 --> 40:28.760]  goes with the headline that russian ukrainian troops are battling in south east ukraine
[40:30.680 --> 40:36.040]  with no evidence of it they've put out some satellite photos you know i guess we got photos
[40:36.040 --> 40:40.200]  from a gulf of tanken too that the vietnamese attacked our ships and the next time i'm gonna hear
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.080]  what are you for commies oh yeah i'm a big commie that's right no i don't want nuclear war i don't
[40:45.080 --> 40:51.960]  want to start fraudulent wars our global elite that just 40 something years before the gulf of
[40:51.960 --> 41:00.920]  tanken had put linen vi linen in charge of russia owned and ran ford and general motors plants the
[41:00.920 --> 41:08.600]  biggest in the world in russia producing hundreds of thousands of trucks a year for the hochi men
[41:08.600 --> 41:17.000]  trail and missile launchers and tanks and weapons and sam missiles us and global stone factories
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.720]  all over russia building the whole thing from 1917 right through world war two and then suddenly
[41:23.720 --> 41:28.120]  oh we have a commie scare so we have to take your rights to fight stalling while the factories and
[41:28.120 --> 41:34.680]  armen hammer and and and al gore's dad senator gore shat on the board of it shipping and we
[41:34.680 --> 41:41.320]  weren't allowed to bomb the ships by the hundreds every week coming in to hanoi harbour
[41:44.840 --> 41:50.520]  going in there i'm gonna give you a big secret about richard nixon and i'll ask you a special
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.880]  report on this sometime because what's old is important what's really old news and unknown
[41:55.880 --> 42:01.400]  even though it's hiding in plain view is important vietnam went on from 1959 until 1975
[42:01.400 --> 42:08.200]  officially 1964 and 1975 you know our own military generals and others kept getting
[42:08.200 --> 42:11.960]  removed because they wanted to bomb the north they wanted to bomb that harbour they wanted to
[42:11.960 --> 42:17.480]  mine the harbour and no one would let them do it because you had all this money being made
[42:17.480 --> 42:25.720]  from russia and and in europe in the u.s company sending all the armaments in to fight our troops
[42:25.720 --> 42:31.480]  a perfect globalist war where you run both sides and make money and get power out of it and then
[42:31.480 --> 42:36.440]  destabilize the country and create a social movement you control based on socialism as the
[42:36.440 --> 42:41.080]  counter to war how do you sell socialism and collectivism and political correct you sell it
[42:41.080 --> 42:46.360]  against an illegal war so that it gives it the moral high ground see they don't want to ron paul
[42:46.360 --> 42:51.720]  who's a libertarian against war or the john birch society that was against the war and got demonized
[42:51.720 --> 42:56.200]  in the 60s and 70s because they tried to stop it because they had the insiders and the government
[42:56.200 --> 43:02.840]  that knew the truth oh that's that right wing crazy group they're traders that that are commies
[43:02.840 --> 43:07.240]  yeah the anti commie groups commie because they did one because they said our government shipping
[43:07.240 --> 43:12.680]  all the weapons in and then richard millhouse nixon for all his sins he didn't get in trouble for
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.760]  spying on people or planning to stay to terror attack against himself to blame it on the democrats
[43:16.760 --> 43:23.560]  that's declassified he didn't get in trouble for iris files he bombed the north and he ran a bunch
[43:23.560 --> 43:28.440]  of different operations bombing the communists bringing weapons in out of other countries
[43:29.080 --> 43:36.760]  cambodia and when he sent in b-52s to bomb the north the impeachment process began
[43:38.840 --> 43:43.240]  you understand that and as soon as our military all it took them years to figure it out went we're
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.960]  not allowed to take the enemy out the war ended because the morale ended because we wouldn't keep
[43:47.960 --> 43:53.400]  fighting because we knew it was a fraud that's what the al-qaeda war is that's what the war on
[43:53.400 --> 43:59.400]  drugs is all these are fake wars where they bring the drugs in they bring the al-qaeda in they bring
[43:59.400 --> 44:04.520]  in the illegals in they bring it all in and then watch the big fight that starts and then they act
[44:04.520 --> 44:09.240]  like their saviors trying to start it trying to stop it when they're only trying to start the next
[44:09.240 --> 44:15.160]  leg of it so that's why nixon was removed because he wanted to win
[44:21.960 --> 44:27.000]  and i'm not lionizing richard millhouse nixon he went over and made deals with the communist
[44:27.000 --> 44:34.200]  chinese who'd been put in power in 49 by his predecessors harry truman you believe our government
[44:34.200 --> 44:40.280]  and and and david rockefeller when mausetung died it was in 76 or 78 we've gone to the microfilm got
[44:40.280 --> 44:45.800]  shots of it's in my film in game he praised communism and bragged about why he supported putting
[44:45.800 --> 44:51.800]  now in in the first place and how communism is the way to go in america david rockefeller
[44:51.800 --> 44:58.680]  in the new york times praising the biggest mass murderer in history and saying we need communism
[44:59.720 --> 45:01.480]  for a community of purpose that's a quote
[45:01.480 --> 45:07.560]  and when the john bert society would run around freaking out about it or others they would be
[45:07.560 --> 45:16.040]  called traders by william f buckley and the cia on record run national review because how do you
[45:16.040 --> 45:23.640]  control opposition you lead it well i'm going to tell all the cia people on the right something
[45:23.640 --> 45:29.160]  you're going to be set up and brought down once the controlled left comes in the globalist
[45:29.160 --> 45:35.320]  everywhere put the left in they use the hegelian dialectic of left right but in the final countdown
[45:35.320 --> 45:42.840]  they will long knife every single libertarian or conservative trader that opens the gates
[45:45.400 --> 45:51.400]  you're going to lose everything fools oh yeah the cia fat cats other than make a bunch of money
[45:51.400 --> 45:55.640]  working with communist chinese generals using chinese as slaves to make the cheapest goods in
[45:55.640 --> 46:02.840]  the world to leverage the planet and take over and now they've done it america's betrayed
[46:02.840 --> 46:07.480]  were deindustrialized they told the cia people and then the technocrats oh we'll keep the super
[46:07.480 --> 46:12.680]  high tech stuff here we'll only give the medium tech to japan and to china and others they've
[46:12.680 --> 46:17.720]  sold all of it out folks mit came out last year with darpa and said there's no way to regain the
[46:17.720 --> 46:23.240]  industrial base or the high tech base it's been lost the us is over and they did that to make the
[46:23.240 --> 46:28.760]  elite that isn't traders give up and they're all being told all the billionaires everybody
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.080]  you play ball with the new world order world government that's going to be based out of europe
[46:33.080 --> 46:39.160]  you supply military troops and robots to it and will let you live you really think an elite like
[46:39.160 --> 46:48.280]  that's going to let you live when they finally drop the hammer ray gator hope blare we're going to
[46:48.280 --> 46:53.240]  you we want to hear what you think about this situation there's been a proxy war going on
[46:53.240 --> 47:01.320]  ukraine this whole year is this new provocation real probably not it's a bunch of hype to escalate
[47:01.320 --> 47:06.040]  what what do you do with people with nukes what do you do the russians pour in to take control
[47:06.040 --> 47:13.320]  of their area the less is trying to steal again they expect russia to stand down russia is not
[47:13.320 --> 47:19.240]  going to stand down they're just trying to win the propaganda war right now with their own lives
[47:22.840 --> 47:26.840]  i want my country back i don't want russians running it and i don't want george soros a
[47:26.840 --> 47:31.960]  nazi collaborator banker running it all you want to call me a trader some of you out there you
[47:31.960 --> 47:36.200]  neocons because i'm against nuking russia all because you're mad that your great granddaddy got
[47:36.200 --> 47:40.920]  kicked out of your grandfather got kicked out the entire neocon movement founded by trotskyites
[47:40.920 --> 47:48.680]  kicked out by stalin you think you're gonna reconquer russia and the great dream of 1917
[47:48.680 --> 47:53.480]  you got a bunch of americans going over there in 1917 taking over russia then the russians kick
[47:53.480 --> 47:57.960]  out the americans send them back they come over here set up the neocon movement
[48:01.000 --> 48:09.320]  and that's that's that's that's who runs this country a bunch of communists ray in poland
[48:09.320 --> 48:16.040]  you're on the air what is your breakdown on this uh you know i don't really know much about everything
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.160]  in the situation but i completely agree with your saying and the most craziest thing that i think
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.600]  about here since i've been in poland because i was born in california raised in texas is that
[48:26.600 --> 48:32.280]  here in poland is just as crazy as it is there in america because the people here have no idea
[48:32.280 --> 48:36.760]  what's going on they don't even have two thoughts towards the idea of what's happening right next
[48:36.760 --> 48:44.520]  door in in ukraine um i was in the ukraine and i lived there for a couple months and it's like
[48:44.520 --> 48:52.120]  eastern ukraine is completely russian and western ukraine is completely uh it's either ukrainian
[48:52.120 --> 48:59.720]  or it's polish um there and in the western part of ukraine there's no sense of regulation
[49:00.520 --> 49:05.720]  and you can see it because in the western part of ukraine it's like slums kind of it's not really
[49:05.720 --> 49:11.400]  nice the the cities are kind of broken down buildings are very old but as you go back towards
[49:11.400 --> 49:17.560]  the um eastern part of ukraine is really nice the cities are very clean very very hospitable
[49:17.560 --> 49:28.360]  very um nice there and here in poland the people get the same um messed up um news no truth because
[49:28.360 --> 49:33.720]  they get the same thing that nsb um msnp exactly they get german news as well and and expanding
[49:33.720 --> 49:40.440]  on that for people that understand the political class wants to take all the people's land and
[49:40.440 --> 49:46.200]  infrastructure who are russian so for the political class in in the poor western part they want to
[49:46.200 --> 49:52.280]  rob the east that has infrastructure everything i mean that's what's going on here i mean russia
[49:52.280 --> 49:57.560]  at one time had one of their capitals in what's eastern ukraine right now but again we're cursed
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.440]  by knowing the facts i bless you appreciate the call uh let's talk to gator in north carolina
[50:02.440 --> 50:07.720]  that hope blaren others you lived in ukraine what's your breakdown on this yeah some time ago when i
[50:07.720 --> 50:12.520]  was there professionally in the media business uh for a couple years lived in Kiev uh we still
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.120]  have family there in eastern ukraine some of which have had to send their children away to safety in
[50:18.120 --> 50:24.120]  russia actually uh to keep from being bombed uh the consensus is among uh family and friends back
[50:24.120 --> 50:30.440]  there is uh a lot of people in the know and have uh any kind of sense to them understand that this is
[50:30.440 --> 50:38.440]  all completely us promulgated event they understand that this is cia manipulation um the uh when i was
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.000]  there i did experience firsthand encounters with the underground nazi movement there though it is
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.000]  very i want to hear about this the vice president who we who our government put in the soros put in
[50:50.120 --> 50:54.600]  literally howl's hitler for those that don't know and then these are real nazis folks they
[50:54.600 --> 50:58.680]  work with hitler in world war two we'll be right back stay there gator and we'll go to hope and blare

[53:11.800 --> 53:17.800]  the total amount of debt in the u.s. has grown by more than 57 percent since september 2008 the
[53:17.800 --> 53:23.080]  two big to fail banks are much larger and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far
[53:23.080 --> 53:27.960]  out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is
[53:27.960 --> 53:33.240]  inevitably coming if you're a baby boomer with retirement funds it's time you consider exiting
[53:33.240 --> 53:37.960]  the wall street casino and start a cash flowing international business of your own there may

[54:21.640 --> 54:26.520]  gator you're saying you have family in eastern ukraine you've worked there recapping you said
[54:26.520 --> 54:30.280]  they've had to send their children out of the country into russia for those that just joined
[54:30.280 --> 54:35.640]  us their announcement russia has attacked ukraine invaded and they've been saying this over and over
[54:35.640 --> 54:40.120]  again the truth is the west is overthrown ukraine is trying to take russian infrastructure that's
[54:40.120 --> 54:45.880]  always been there russian ports russian pipelines that is not an endorsement of everything russia
[54:45.880 --> 54:55.080]  does to say it's wrong for us to start a war with them again this is not iraq that's being picked on
[54:55.080 --> 55:00.760]  by wall street and by the way it's wall street folks financing taking your guns it's wall street
[55:00.760 --> 55:06.440]  creating the culture of the nsa it's these foreign banks that have sold us that they're americana
[55:06.440 --> 55:11.960]  that run our country that are trying to start an economic and physical war with russia i'm ranting
[55:11.960 --> 55:16.040]  a gator go ahead and make your point about the first hand run in with the neo-nazis that run
[55:16.040 --> 55:22.440]  the ukrainian government yeah it was um well while there i mean it was a lot of it was underground
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.520]  and kept underground and obviously it's really it's come from underground and it and it's running
[55:26.520 --> 55:31.160]  the show now but when they're i mean i encountered the first time first hand and having actually
[55:31.160 --> 55:38.200]  intervene on the downtown street a cruciatec in downtown kiev in broad daylight with some guys
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.360]  attacking the hasidic jew and and just broad daylight walking up to them randomly starting
[55:42.360 --> 55:46.760]  to beat him down on the street um so i had to intervene in that situation that's when i really
[55:46.760 --> 55:53.320]  came to learn started investigating see how prolific the uh nazi movement was there um people
[55:53.320 --> 55:58.680]  understand who uh joe biden's son is over there they understand what's going on with control for
[55:58.680 --> 56:04.600]  those that don't know he just got control of all this russian gas that the ukrainian government
[56:04.600 --> 56:11.080]  is just saying is his now go ahead yeah so the the ukrainian people a lot of them a lot of
[56:11.080 --> 56:17.000]  portion of them especially ones we know understand that this whole thing is engineered by the cia and
[56:17.000 --> 56:24.440]  by the united states and the britain's do they try to coax russia into a war and and basically
[56:24.440 --> 56:29.480]  the bottom line they know they're doing and they're using the neo-nazis to slaughter all of the people
[56:30.200 --> 56:37.000]  that are not loyalist to the nazi party into the nazi movement and they just want to be be free
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.480]  and be left alone and maintain their sovereignty and their good relations with russia and those
[56:41.480 --> 56:45.160]  people have to be exterminated kind of like all the christians in cia need to be exterminated
[56:45.160 --> 56:49.800]  and there's a problem because half of ukraine or more is allied with russia and has russian
[56:49.800 --> 56:56.120]  ethnicity this is not something that they're ever going to win uh again what what does nato
[56:56.120 --> 57:02.520]  think they're going to do start a nuclear war with russia exactly i appreciate your call god bless
[57:02.520 --> 57:08.120]  you i mean our government funded isis and turned them loose and is now fighting them it's just it's
[57:08.120 --> 57:12.600]  not our government and i want to explain the average cop the average fbi agent even the average
[57:12.600 --> 57:20.040]  person in the cia because i've talked to him is completely freaked out as well and they know the
[57:20.040 --> 57:24.040]  government's going for broke the people that have hijacked our government are doing things so
[57:24.040 --> 57:30.920]  reckless it's scaring everybody because this is how you destroy the planet i mean this is so
[57:31.560 --> 57:37.640]  reckless and it's not a moral high ground it's so evil it's global domination
[57:37.640 --> 57:45.560]  messing with 170 million russians with high tech weapons it's just it's it's madness we're
[57:45.560 --> 57:52.680]  going to go to break come back with blare and come back with hope and uh darious and kevin and others
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.720]  i just want to remind uh folks that will also be covering a lot of other news abola outbreak

[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:45.080]  all right my friends thank you for joining us we're talking about the exploding escalation
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.760]  the crisis with merkel saying that russia is doing things that could lead to war last week two weeks
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.000]  ago they claimed a russian armored column got blown up that wasn't true clearly there's russian
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  forces each u krain it's been part of russia forever they're guarding their interests that's just a
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.840]  fact but it's being escalated as russia's invaded we've got to do something we've got to have a war
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:13.800]  right now you know move in the nato troops this is russia we're talking about this isn't like
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:24.280]  panama this isn't like the falcons falcon islands the british have a good trained focused military
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.960]  and they lost a lot of troops fighting just a few hundred soldiers that were willing to fight
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.440]  and now nato releases the satellite evidence that russia is lying about invading ukraine and they
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:42.200]  show a few armored vehicles that you can barely even tell what they are i mean and look oh there's
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:47.400]  the border their guns are pointed into ukraine well of course they are meanwhile and really
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:57.000]  important news young rivers stopped breathing during throat surgery blare in california you visited
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.840]  ukraine 12 plus times you say uh what is your take on the situation should we just be patriotic
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:09.480]  in newk russia right now maybe i should join the neocons and obama and just call for war against
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.040]  you know Assad for al-qaeda you know and and overthrow egypt and put al-qaeda in and and blow
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:22.280]  up russia is that the patriotic thing to do oh no sir it isn't um gator pretty much covered
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:29.720]  uh Kiev area and all that i'm um more familiar with uh Crimea so that's doppel area up in their
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:39.400]  at least 10 times there to sabastopal and they essentially gave russia no option they were
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.080]  going to it'd be like the chinese navy setting up a base in san diego that they just wasn't
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:51.880]  going to happen yeah that's it but but what do you think about the bravada the hutspa of the

[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.960]  are battling them in huge war cities are burning it's incredible we've got to have nato helping
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:35.320]  him right now and nato magically right on time releases photos they say are russian armored
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:44.600]  vehicles on the border with their turrets facing inwards and they show russian self-propelled
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:50.920]  artillery inside ukraine so all of this is going on of course there's russian made because they
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.240]  bought a lot of it from the russian there's there's russian missiles that both sides have
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.800]  so we don't know if any of this is true but russia has been in eastern ukraine the whole time they
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:07.800]  have military bases there and there has been all sorts of escalation of war months of ukrainian

[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:22.760]  to talk about that in detail i got a call by dr andrew wakefield who's been exonerated and sued
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:29.400]  the the journalist that put out the paper claiming that he'd run a hoax connecting vaccines to
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:35.240]  gut disorders well that was in mainline science it turned out in internal british government reports
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:40.200]  a year before wakefield did his studies there are literally scores of studies i know about
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:46.280]  showing the same thing but they had a big hoax news it's been proven and lands it that there's no
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.920]  connection to vaccines and problems and dr wakefield is a fraud now i got so busy when wakefield was
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:58.120]  calling me a few weeks ago about this breaking that um in fact he saw myself on a bunch of messages
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.040]  we should call him he wanted to break it here last week and this week and he wanted to give me the
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.960]  whistleblower and they went ahead and went ahead with it and i again i just i i'm overwhelmed and

[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:50.600]  i think we should attack china nuke china and then give it to george soros and that's the same
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.880]  thing here of course they've opened the border and are giving latin america to the united states
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.520]  so they'll vote they're conquering the u.s right now i mean they are conquering and and why why
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:08.040]  should they stop no one stands up to them nobody speaks out so i agree with the neo cons uh out
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:14.040]  there uh that we should we should attack every sovereign country out there and hand over the
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.560]  countries to different administration officials and i mean i i'm glad that guy mentioned earlier
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.680]  joe biden defended about a month ago that his son was put on the board and given partial
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:31.880]  ownership of the biggest gas company in the nation that they're claiming now controls the russian gas
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:40.360]  corridors that's a nice slice of over a hundred billion dollars a year in natural gas that russia
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:47.000]  sells alone to areas of western europe i i think that's reasonable you just you know your slick
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:55.880]  son of joe biden you get everything why not my house why not my children i mean they announced on
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:03.080]  msnbc that our kids belong to the state i didn't build my operation i didn't build anything i didn't

[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:30.440]  canada then darious in romania hope in canada you're ukrainian you say go ahead
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:40.120]  and i'd like you to know that 1.2 canadians right here in canada of ukrainian descent
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:47.480]  and we are all against russian connections the history is too bad or too hard to think about
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:53.240]  in 1922 1 million over 1 million no i understand i understand that russians
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.280]  ukrainians have been killing each other for 500 600 years and then and then we're muslims running
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:04.840]  around in there as well i mean i get the history but should we nuke russia then i said not to nuke
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:12.920]  russia but in 1933 when 10 million ukrainians we start spelling brought in millions of russians
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:19.800]  to that country and this is why today we have the russians in there the descendants of russia
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.680]  who are who we want to go if they want to be in russia that don't go sure sure sure sure but
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.680]  let me ask you a question and i want to keep you on the why this is important do you think hitler
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:36.360]  was a liberator of ukraine what do you think of hitler's role in ukraine well hitler ukraine
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:43.960]  was between russia and with russian hitler i'm going to send you a dvd about it between russia
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.560]  and hitler yes ma'am i mean i'm sure you know better than i but i do know the history of it i
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:54.760]  understand that you don't understand it no i understand that that western ukrainians have
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:00.280]  real beef the russians and i've talked about stolons starving to death of 10 million some
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:07.480]  estimates are that high ukrainians but i'm saying today is 2014 we can't have george soros the
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:14.280]  nazi collaborator overthrowing ukraine and trying to start world war three i agree with you there
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:21.080]  but you see the ukrainians are victims of both the americans the russians the europeans i agree
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:26.680]  i agree they're exactly it who destabilized it and is trying to exploit ukraine right now the

[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:31.560]  well the globalists have hijacked our country they're funding isis and al-qaeda to attack christians
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.880]  everywhere they're wanting to bomb the syrian government they've been bombing for a long time
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:42.040]  they want to intensify that in the name of uh stopping al-qaeda and now george soros and others
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:47.400]  have overthrown ukraine and they're trying to take russian held areas that have key military
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:53.800]  bases and gas pipelines they've already taken part of it and given it to joe biden's son who now owns it
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:00.200]  and uh they're claiming that russia has intensified an invasion into the area
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.800]  and i'm sure part of that's probably true but the way they're announcing it's an escalation
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:09.080]  there's nato forces in there and a lady named hope from canada was saying that 1.2 million
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:15.240]  canadians are actually ukrainians and she was talking about how horrible the russians were
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:22.040]  coming in and usurping areas of their country which i know stalin did do he also killed a
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:26.440]  bunch of russians it was terrible but there were russians in ukraine before that it's been part of
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.880]  russia before so it's a disputed territory and that's what the globalists exacerbate
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:37.240]  i'm against the whole thing i don't like the escalation of tensions it'll hurt markets it'll
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:42.920]  hurt stock markets it can lead to nuclear war top cia analyst ray mcgovern said last time he was on
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.840]  effect we ought to grab the end of that interview it's the last minute of that interview where he
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.520]  talks about that uh you'll see i analyst warns of nuclear war with russia that's a very important
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.000]  interview we should play a clip of that coming up but hope you've got the floor as a ukrainian give
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:06.200]  us your take on this well we'll say that i only learned about him the globalist or the american
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:12.760]  or sorrows a couple months ago we had never heard in canada about him so we didn't know anything
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:20.680]  about that but the problem here is sir that why would ukrainians after being starved 10 million
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:28.760]  starved in in 33 and when those people were starved Stalin brought in russians and they and
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.040]  and that's why there are so many russians up there and under russia there was no ukrainian
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:40.760]  language the language spoken was russian and only ukrainian was spoken in the house so now
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:46.120]  people are saying well those poor russians speaking russians well they weren't sure that that was the
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:51.480]  language of the day so how could they blame they didn't know ukrainian because they they controlled
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:27:00.360]  it after so many years of control we have 1.2 million canadians in canada and and would you
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:07.480]  think how many ukrainians left their country to create so much ukrainians in canada now the
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:14.680]  maydan was the canadians supported the maydan i sent money there there were a lot of ukrainian
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:21.480]  canadians demonstrating under maydan there were even several so there were pictures on tv
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:29.480]  that they took they were they were jewish rabbis fell demonstrating on under maydan so how can you
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:38.040]  tell that they were all nazis the nazi portion i didn't like because ukraine under in the second
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:45.720]  world war was on between hitler and stalin and that's how my aunt came to canada when the
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:53.960]  germans captured her and she worked in the in german camps and then finally came to canada so
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:28:02.520]  so how can you blame her per people who were subjugated by russia and by hitlers and saying
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:09.960]  that they're nazis now all the ukrainians are not nazis that's a big big lie and people were
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:17.160]  trying those words around should study the history or see how things were grand now i got a couple
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:24.840]  of these but i'm going to send you and you could look at them they're anglish about uh the famine
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:31.000]  in 33 and also the other one about the stolen land no no i understand that that some of the
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.720]  western ukrainians were wronged just like i know that uh you know the the the turks killed people
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:43.320]  in their country and other things and the armenian genocide there's been a lot of genocide says that
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:49.960]  i'm not weighing in and tribal warfare here like palestinian versus israeli or any of this i'm saying
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:29:01.800]  the current war is the cybertronic technotronic scientific dictatorship that is soft killing
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:07.720]  all of humanity dumbing everyone down destroying national sovereignty attacking the very basis of
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:13.400]  what it is to be a human and while they've all got us tribally upset with old beefs and while
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.520]  they're exacerbating those old wounds they are bringing us into a planetary world government
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:26.120]  and are using an old conflict to destabilize that entire region have the eu come in and suck
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:33.000]  ukraine dry so so hitler had his way stolen had his way with your country now the eu is going to
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.440]  have its way with you but i mean do you see any validity to what i just said you are talking the
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:44.440]  right thing but you are not saying that with yana corvich left ukraine he is parliament
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.040]  no no i mean i i i get all that just that the globalist are we're on the march fanning the

[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:53.000]  six years ago or so the 9 11 lessons from star trek
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:02.680]  dealing with a group playing two sides off against each other of this case an alien in
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:09.640]  between the klingon and federation ship and when you see the globalist above the countries playing
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:17.640]  off real beefs russians have beefs the ukrainians have serious beefs i've always been pro ukrainian
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:24.200]  anti russian because i grew up being anti-communist and i see the ukrainians not like being abused by
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:32.520]  the russians but this again is anthropologist sociologist in there manipulating the different
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:38.920]  angles but i did tweet the video out 9 11 lessons from star trek an allegory to the new world order
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:44.760]  and it's divide and conquer tactics you can see the video at real alex jones on twitter
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:51.480]  if you're a radio listener i'm going to have it reposted to info wars dot com as well
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:56.040]  well but i'm not russian and i'm not ukrainian
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.760]  it was just like when the globalists try to turn over
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.840]  kosovo to the muslims they had no stake in that the serbs had defeated the muslims when they
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:15.080]  invaded scores of times famously right there in kosovo that's the most famous battleground area
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:22.040]  of the muslims and then the west back and forth battling that's where they stopped them albania
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:28.520]  is muslim to the south nato went in bombed that area and let the muslims go in and they're still
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.480]  ethnically cleansing serbs today does that mean that serbs are little angels and haven't done the
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:39.480]  same thing back no they've done it the un zone report said that the different you know croats
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:44.680]  and muslims and other groups had killed double the serbs in the 10 years of that conflict the
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:55.400]  serbs had i'm not serbian i'm not slavic i just know the history i know the numbers i know they
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:00.440]  went and bombed belgrade's aircraft factories to build civilian aircraft they didn't want belgrade
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:06.600]  to be its own country they don't want any sovereign countries they don't want syria being successful
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.080]  or egypt being successful or america being successful they don't care who you are they want

[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:33.800]  derrius what's your view on this hi alex you're doing a very good job well i'd be
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:40.040]  waking up a lot of people and uh i thank you for that i want to give them a take on ukraine and
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:48.600]  then i want to ask you a question if you may okay so our president has had a press conference
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:57.640]  just a little while and said that it is not a russian invasion in ukraine he said russian
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:09.160]  and military technique to support the pro-russian rebels but the fact is that uh they they are they
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:16.440]  are taking the part of cream time here and they want to to create a bigger term it's a mystery
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:25.640]  well sir continue to elaborate from your perspective and uh we have a really big
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:38.680]  nato base here and uh they are on a higher alert right now i want to say something you ask if they
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:46.360]  want to have a war with russia i don't think they want a war with russia right now because it's a
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:54.200]  big deal to the united states to nato they have the thing with icis with um with africa you know
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:04.680]  and uh i want to ask you a simple question okay how how do you think the new world order will
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:11.640]  try to destroy us there will be nuclear zombie virus robot or or how do you think well they're
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:19.320]  going to beta test wars beta test superviruses beta test things to see how we react uh how we behave
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:25.560]  to war game it but they'll do it in phases if they think they can get away with uh releasing a bio
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.880]  weapon to kill the majority of people they do it right now but they can't do it while there's a sovereign
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:36.200]  russia left or a sovereign iran it doesn't mean that iran or russia are good it just means they're
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:43.960]  not part of the eugenics new world order russia was under eugenics for about 80 years and that's
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:49.640]  why their population went under it's why everything we have in america russia was under uh they just
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:55.480]  don't call it communism now they call it trendyism or or political correctness uh and so the level
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:01.880]  of tyranny we will live under is the exact level we put up with uh and it's all being phased in i
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:08.920]  mean i i i read 17 years ago that the department of transportation with darpa was going to track
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:15.080]  us by the mile tax us by the mile track everything we do and selectively tax the middle class until
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:21.160]  we collapse for social engineering and i knew that and people said you're crazy even though
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.640]  i had the documents well now it's being announced it's just if you can imagine it the globalists
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:31.320]  are doing it god bless you i appreciate your call darious from romanian now soul in poland
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:38.920]  curt in toronto martin in london shon in alaska we'll get to all of you after we air this seven-minute
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:49.400]  allegory piece 9 11 lessons from star trek but it's applicable it's applicable this 1960s tv show
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:55.400]  episode to how the globalists are above the different nations playing us off against each other
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:00.680]  and then feeding metaphorically off of our energy this is how the globalists win financing all
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:05.080]  different sides you become aware of it you understand the paradigm uh here is this piece
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:10.360]  captain's log star date arm again
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.200]  the klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers what proof do we need we know what a
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:40.520]  klingon is most interesting the bulk of your crew trapped your ship racing from this galaxy
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:47.080]  at wild speeds how did i perform this sabotage kirk all my men are here do you think some people in
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:53.640]  a cave do you think some people in a cave were able to have no i'd stand down do you think that
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:44:23.320]  people in a cave were able to have all of this happen a phantom colling imaginary distress calls
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:33.880]  the creation of these weapons we will in fact find uh weapons do you sense a pattern must
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:40.440]  respond the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist there is
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.800]  an alien on board which may have created the situation who cares what started it mr spock it
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:51.800]  is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind i think we should just trust our president
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:57.960]  and every decision that he makes this is war there isn't any war you serious i've got been in sick
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:04.520]  bay some of them dying atrocities committed on their persons you talk about making peace with
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:13.000]  these fiends the alien is the real threat that's the enemy we have to wipe out has a war been staged
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:23.320]  for us complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:31.080]  he was gas but where did he get the gas from us recent events would seem to be directed to a
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:36.760]  magnification of the basic hostilities and here is that agenda the project for the new american
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:43.160]  century much of what these men wanted is coming true they urged that the u.s abandoned the anti
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:49.480]  ballistic missile treaty it has they wanted establishment of more permanent u.s military
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:55.000]  bases abroad that is happening in the philippines and in georgia and will likely happen in iraq
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:03.720]  they urged regime change as a goal of foreign wars not just in iraq they wanted the u.s as a global
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:10.680]  constabulary their word such aspirations are unlikely to be realized without a catastrophic
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:18.120]  and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor apparently it is by design that we fight
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:27.480]  we seem to be pawns what's the game is known as the builder group could their objective be world
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:33.240]  domination we must push outward if we were to survive the constitution has not given permission
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:39.160]  for us to so-called police the world we have always thought either you are with us
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:45.000]  or you are with the terrorists as you've been listening to propaganda shut up there's another way
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:51.480]  to survive mutual trust and help we ought to stay at home mine our own business trade with people
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:59.800]  and be friends with people and we all would be a lot better off an alien entity aboard the ship
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:05.000]  it's forcing us to fight we don't want to we don't know what its motive is we're trying to find out
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:12.040]  you must help us it is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately the federal reserve
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:21.000]  is an independent agency and that means basically that uh there is no age other agency of government
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:31.960]  which can overrule actions that we take now do you believe know that you want what you're doing here
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:41.320]  kill the clay out it's never us isn't it done when the lieutenant became unconscious
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:51.400]  the alien lost energy it subsists on the emotions of others this one appears to be strengthened
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:48:02.440]  by mental radiations of hostility violent intentions it exists on the hate of others
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:10.840]  to put it simply and it has acted as a catalyst creating the situation in order to satisfy
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:17.720]  that need it has brought together opposing forces in an effort to promote the most violent mode of
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:24.360]  conflict we've got to get rid of it then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:31.640]  the fighting must end and soon oh we're a doomed ship we've got to pull our knowledge we must find
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:40.200]  a way to defeat the alien force of hate stop the war now or spend eternity in futile bloody violence
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:49.400]  it has to stop look for the rest of our lives a thousand lifetimes senseless violence fighting
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:57.880]  while an alien has total control over us and it goes on and on the good old game of war
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:10.440]  pawn against pawn stopping the bad guys while somewhere some thing sits back and laughs and starts it all over again
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:17.640]  he is telling the truth be a pawn be a toy be a good soldier the never questions orders

[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:40.040]  jones let's go ahead and go back to those calls let's talk to soul in poland you're on the air
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:47.880]  go ahead uh hello alex um can you hear me yes i can okay i'd like to make a statement about poland
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:52.040]  and then actual question and also i'd like to make a statement about the ukraine ask the question as
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:55:00.280]  well um in poland the people they don't really take this idea of war happening right next door
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:06.040]  very seriously um i ask people how do they even know what's going on most people don't know or
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:12.440]  have any inclination of what's going on because the same thing that they watch on the news here is
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:17.160]  the same thing that the trendies would watch on the news in america it doesn't tell the truth
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:23.880]  it doesn't give the the the true motive of what's going on and what's happening and then whenever i
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.760]  started realizing that um most of these people out here they they they they don't have any real
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:34.920]  sense of what it means to be free you know they don't have any real sense of freedom of of self
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:43.240]  thinking of self um of just investing in themselves because they their grandmothers their grandpas
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:48.600]  their their mothers and fathers were raised in communism and when that transfers down to the
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:54.440]  next generation how would you expect them to think do you understand what i'm saying oh i totally
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:56:00.840]  get it they just traded out one group of masters for another and we are now taking on the aspects
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:06.440]  of communism here as well yes here here they completely they do what they're told when whenever i
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:11.960]  ask people about or do do they even know about what's really going on they have no idea about
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:16.680]  what's going on and and it's insane to me because they don't have any inclination of what it really
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:21.080]  means to be free and whenever i talk to them about it they think that i'm from some other planet
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.400]  which really makes me understand what it means to be an american because i am from america and
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:30.280]  i'm living here in poland and another thing about the ukraine is that people need to understand
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:35.640]  within the ukraine because i lived in the ukraine for three months i also got married in kiev ukraine
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:40.600]  people need to understand then the ukraine the difference between eastern ukraine and western
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:48.600]  ukraine is like day and night because in western ukraine it's either polish or it's ukrainian in
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:55.880]  eastern ukraine is predominantly mostly just russian um they speak russian um the russian the
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:02.440]  signs and everything are russian and and and even people don't understand that um dating back i'm
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:09.080]  not sure what year was but a nice portion of western ukraine used to be polish and i have the
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:16.280]  question to you right now about um ukraine is that how can russia be invading into ukraine
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:21.560]  whenever half of the country pretty much is russia well all they're doing is trying to
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.160]  secure their interest there and i'm not getting in the middle of the ethnic fights and religious
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:31.240]  fights that have been going on for 600 years it's just that the west is starting this and that's a
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:39.160]  fact uh but you use the analogy of poland being right next to all this and you know you're saying
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:44.360]  people on average don't care i would imagine they care about you know sports and things just like
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.760]  most men here in the us are starting up their fantasy football leagues and don't care about
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:54.680]  anything including what their kids are doing and it's just part of this entertainment society where
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:58:00.360]  most people are in this matrix of entertainment and they think it's weird if you know about
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:05.320]  geopolitical issues they think it's weird if you're informed they think it's weird if you
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:09.800]  know the fellow reserve is private they think it's weird if you warn them that vaccines are dangerous
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:18.520]  they should read the insert uh they just they're just mindless and it's it's it's very scary but
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:24.200]  then you look at who's running things that's even more out of control and then now obama just says
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:31.080]  he'll use u.n authority but carbon taxes on the american people just like you said our military
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:37.080]  he doesn't need congress for war he's got nato authority he's beyond a dictator he works for

[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:12.200]  do part two of the interview we did live this is live as well a few weeks ago on secrets of
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:18.280]  the illuminati in the context of what's currently happening in the world what is the illuminati
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:22.440]  is it just something out of history is it a fable we'll give you some of those answers coming up
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:31.640]  along the leading experts on the subject but what we know is western groups the same groups
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.160]  they're trying to destroy our countries trying to start a war with russia and i don't think that's
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:42.040]  too smart after we take some of your calls i'll get into the latest on obola the latest on obama's
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:52.120]  approval rating numbers and a lot more that's all coming up shawn in alaska you're on the air
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:55.400]  and you visited ukraine you want to give us your take on it go ahead
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:01.800]  paul and alex yeah i've been there a couple times back in 2006 i was working for kbr in iraq for uh
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:05.640]  well you know for the operation over there so i went over there had a girlfriend and
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.280]  she was gorgeous just like you said earlier and um we dated for quite a while and i learned
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:15.480]  about the country it was down in crime and went to kiev and and uh she was telling me a lot of
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:20.440]  stories about there about her um her grandmother during world war two and the fact that um well
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:25.240]  up there in kiev i guess they uh um were set to execute a bunch of them she survived her grandmother
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:31.160]  did by hiding in the vulgar river um hanging it with her mother and um i just find it very sad
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:39.800]  that who was going to execute them commies or nazis the nazis no yeah but uh you know i i i
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:44.200]  it really stands me i mean to see all this happening going on over there it's one of my
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:49.320]  favorite countries i've ever been to i've been maybe 12 15 countries in the world and like i said
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:55.160]  it's one of my favorites they got great wine great women great vodka great land and i what i think
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.960]  americans should do i mean not that it will ever happen but we need to have like maybe an open
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:07.400]  carry march on washington just go rest them all you know well it's bigger than washington i appreciate
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.600]  your call it's it's special interests that are manipulating all our countries that have an interest
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:21.000]  in chaos it's government and culture by conquest not by free market not by the best ideas winning
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:28.280]  not by the system of people voting with their dollars voting with the decisions they make
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:35.400]  it's more more global economy based on fraud run by the private european banks that call
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:42.600]  themselves the federal reserve really a private bank and so i'm simply trying to get people to
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:49.560]  pull back outside the big paradigm that is controlled to the even bigger paradigm of basic human
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:57.960]  liberty and to realize that if you got killed by russians you hate the russians if you got killed
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:04.920]  by the nazis you hate the nazis ukraine has been exploited over and over again by different
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:16.120]  empires coming into it whether it's napolean or or or the communist russians and if you look at the
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:22.440]  cia and what other groups do they have anthropologists and sociologists that study a country and figure
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:28.040]  out how to ethnically break it and get them fighting with each other and first they'll raise
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:36.520]  ethnic awareness with political correctness in the name of fighting ethnic strife they will hype it
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:44.760]  up just like death education introduced in 1990 across the united states within three years had
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:50.840]  massively increased abc news had a piece on it you look it up still online back in like 2005
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:59.640]  within just a few years actually 2020 did within a few years it had massively increased and
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.040]  a decade later it was more than triple you start teaching 12 year olds how to commit
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:08.280]  suicide and telling them all about it people start committing suicide it was never even in
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:18.520]  their vernacular they weren't even thinking about it well you start hyping up you know in in history
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:24.040]  week the wrongs against blacks or the wrongs against women or the wrongs against they're
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:29.160]  taking reasonable ideas to talk about the wrongs that were done so they're not repeated but then
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:35.800]  it becomes the next level of where that's the whole world and so it's all people are is folks
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:42.200]  that have chips on their shoulders and then i mean who does the clan recruit from poor white people
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:47.400]  who want to have a chip on their shoulder and you take some racist black person some racist white
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:52.520]  person they probably dress the same drive the same truck have the same kind of blue collar job
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:59.480]  got the same problems with their kids what they hate each other because their skin color
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:03.960]  because it feels good to hate somebody and blame everything on that and there are real issues there
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:10.440]  and the big smart technocrats will sit back and manipulate those differences so i'm simply pointing
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:17.400]  at the higher up echelons that admit they manipulate all this our race relations better
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.520]  under obama than they were they had a survey of black americans just a few days ago that said
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:29.000]  overwhelmingly it's worse obama could have fixed race relations to a great extent but that's not
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:36.280]  what he was designed to do a large group of white people elected barack obama because they really
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:44.920]  wanted that but they're only buying the surface of political correctness and the idea of your
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:50.440]  neo-lib reconciliation it only means hey turn your guns in prove you're not racist support
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.440]  obama here prove you're not racist let the feds federalize everything prove you're not racist
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:15:00.200]  shine on to this whole agenda we've got or we'll say you're racist well gee i'm against abortion
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:04.680]  well that's because you're a homophobic racist republican white bread piece of trash you know
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:11.960]  it doesn't make sense if you look at the reality kurt in toronto canada you're on the air you've
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:19.080]  got a point on ukraine and we'll talk to martin in poland go ahead talk to you go ahead um i got a
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:24.280]  slightly different twist on the issue with the ukraine and russia might be fresh it might be
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:32.680]  disconnected i don't know how the old look will be but um essentially uh isis and al-qaeda and
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:37.000]  all these groups are uh kind of surrounding greece right now you know they're in libya they're in
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.640]  egypt they're all over and there's five five million illegals in greece at the moment they're
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:51.320]  all coming in from boats in turkey thousands by the day and uh greece geopolitically wants to
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:59.720]  align with russia because russia can come down the black sea down the helispont and go to their
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:04.440]  base in tarsus i believe yes and that's why the big banks are grabbing money out of the
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:09.800]  greek banks doing bail ins that's why they're doing it in cyprus of course it's geopolitical
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:17.000]  iran syria greece it's about encircling russia cutting russia off completely moving weapon
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:24.280]  systems in against russia and trying to have russia collapse and um there's a nationalistic party
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:30.760]  there that's equivalent to i would say the tea party in the states they're called golden dawn and
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:37.240]  they're the only ones that would like to align with russia and apparently uh the ukraine is run by
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:44.120]  neo-nazis and you know the eugenicists the bankers whatever they propagate golden dawn as a neo-nazi
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:52.600]  party and uh venezuelos uh because the european presidency is in greece this year and venezuelos
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:59.080]  is illegally politically persecuting these people they've put them in jail for you know just
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:05.320]  stupid stupidity like illegal reasons they keep changing the laws yet he went and uh
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:14.040]  he honored the neo-nazi party in the ukraine and basically what's going on is i see pretty soon
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:21.240]  that they're gonna they're gonna align the neo-nazis with golden dawn and they're pretty much
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:25.880]  they want to get them out of the picture because all these illegals that are coming in they're
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:32.680]  from the age of 18 to 35 sponsored by soros and they're gonna for those who don't know soros is
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:38.680]  sponsoring illegals from all over the world to overrun everything and then be his new political
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:44.120]  party uh it's it's an absolutely diabolical program i mean soros brags he is behind the
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:50.840]  open border right now and uh it's just incredible thank you kurt martin in london go ahead you're
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:58.280]  on the air yes hi there might go ahead sir yeah hi how you doing okay so if i may refer to your
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:04.760]  first call about a situation of uh Polish population in regards to the ukraine i think
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:10.440]  majority of the people just don't care they just don't really want to know but there's a massive
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:17.800]  awakening happening um right of the political movement through the uh party of uh mr carvin
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:24.040]  nika and um it's it's it's going really really big at the moment basically it's it's a beautiful yuki
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:32.920]  you're saying it's like yukip yeah it is basically yeah well yukip is the yukip is getting branches
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:37.560]  in all those other countries and it's it's nationalist movement to kick the globalist out
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:42.760]  and they're having trouble you know calling them racist because they're not and meanwhile the the
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:50.040]  uh globalists are actually aligning with the racist yeah exactly and and uh there's a massive
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.760]  awakening happening because people are just tired in Poland especially for the last 24 years
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:02.440]  it's nothing has been happening just as globalists come into it uh the basic they we have another um
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:09.800]  partitions happening at the moment you know i mean as it's in uh 1700 so uh people just want
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:15.160]  to something new and mr carvin nika is basically one of those people and it's uh lots of this
[02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:24.280]  finding like um mr stanislaw michal kiewicz is pretty pretty cool um figure in poland um closer
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:31.720]  to you in states in york we have another one who is supporting that movement is mr marish

[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:22.360]  august 13th just a few weeks ago ray mcgovern former top cia analyst
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:26.760]  was on the broadcast he was ronald reagan and george herbert walker bush's
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:31.240]  number one morning briefer some days a week six days a week he would
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:36.920]  brief him sometimes seven he would travel with him a top analyst combat veteran vietnam you name it
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:43.400]  served for 40 years and he said the majority of the analysts they've talked to he's written
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:48.120]  articles on this say that this could easily lead to nuclear war with russia the table launch on

[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:40.280]  isn't the u.s. government is my point we've been captured they want to capture russia now
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:45.800]  to do that they've got to grab their key port and that's in the black sea right there in ukraine
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:50.520]  in kramia and that's why i've been obsessing on this for two and a half hours i don't usually
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:55.160]  cover one topic this much i've covered some other stories as well but it's just that this is really
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:26:02.120]  bad it's how you go to a car lot they got five cars they're all bad this is the worst one it's not
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:06.760]  saying putin's good it's not saying china's good it's not saying iran's good it's just the people
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:14.200]  that are running our country are crazy let's go to reama govern a few weeks ago on the broadcast
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:20.120]  as we ended our talk talking about what would happen if this continues i mean somebody's
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:25.080]  got to restrain these people because because it looks like they're asleep at the switch i mean i
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:31.880]  think we've really reached stick of fork in us a decadence level in the ruling class where they're
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:38.120]  off playing golf ray i don't think they even know what they're doing well it's true you know and it's
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:44.520]  the old syndrome alex uh you know i've often wondered what people do with their second million
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:52.840]  or the third million i mean there's an insatiable appetite for collecting or grabbing more now i
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:57.960]  think you're right this is going to reach a no good end as the chinese are fond of saying
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:04.840]  but people don't realize this and obama is really pretty much a tool in their hands so if you're
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:13.720]  coaching how you're going to react when what happens is this missile defense system now that's the
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:23.800]  biggest corporate welfare project in the country's history it'll never work but can the russians
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:28.680]  depend on that of course not and so what are they doing they're putting it on ships they're putting
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:35.800]  it in the black sea and they're targeting icm bases within russia that's trouble so if you're
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:39.880]  you're worried about a first strike what are you going to do at the first hint that it's coming
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:46.680]  you're going to launch one kind of warning and we're all going to be dead alex and we're all
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:53.480]  going to be dead alex that is the guy that brief ronald reagan every morning
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:01.560]  that's who ronald reagan talked to five six seven times a week that's who george herbert

[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:03.720]  said that uh ice bucket challenge al s foundation admits less than 27 percent of donations fund
[02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:11.640]  research and cures and even the 27 percent goes to big pharma you know how many treatments they've
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:18.120]  got for cancer and al s and the rest of it to get warehouse to get shelved i'm all for charity and i
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:24.680]  give money to charity things like the salvation army that gives 89 directly to people the gospel
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:33.320]  food water education jobs if they show that they're able to do it they'll go out and get them a job
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:40.360]  i'm not saying it's perfect the bill clinton uh charity turns out almost all of it goes for
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:46.280]  private jets and homes almost none of it to african children but it's okay because he says he likes
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:54.120]  black people i love you black people i like black people i'm a black man i got an office in harlem
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:59.480]  so i speak for black people i'm america's first black president you didn't know that
[02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:03.240]  also didn't have sex with that woman monica lewinsky
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:12.280]  95 million later only 27 percent of donations actually help
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:17.160]  yeah i've been meaning to come up with some gimmick about the ice bucket i think we should start
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:23.000]  something where where we just dump buckets of money on our head and and just keep pointing
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:30.040]  that out and then hijack that point and then point out that all the other united way the red cross
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:33.400]  i'm not saying you're bad if you volunteer for the red cross and went out and help people in
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:39.000]  hurricane you're wonderful you're only the pr front though well over half the money ends up going to
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.640]  the executives then a bunch of the money i forget the exact statistics the other half
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:47.400]  bunch of it's advertising and then something like 25 again goes to
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:54.280]  and everyone says donations to red cross like oh they know how to hand them out
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:59.320]  but my big problem with the red cross united way is you know where else the money goes right
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:07.720]  up a good percentage of it look it up and articles on it guess where it goes gun control groups
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:15.160]  that's right and open border groups and all of it when you give money to these big organizations
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:20.920]  it goes right down a rat hole or it goes towards taking your rights and they got all these well
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:25.400]  meaning everybody it's something easy and fun they like it because it reminds them of a football
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:32.040]  coach who just won the game it's a fun little thing to do on tv like three weeks ago when this
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:35.960]  thing's first sort of getting big i was like man i need to do something you know the ice bucket
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:42.120]  challenge but i just never got around to it uh but that's an important meme to hijack so i want
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:49.720]  to challenge our listeners to uh you know do your own ice bucket challenges and uh maybe dump a bunch
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:55.880]  of diseases on yourself on on cue cards and hold them up and go yeah the vaccine companies making
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:01.080]  money off this why their own inserts say they can give you cancer or geomberray or brain damage or
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:07.320]  permanent uh narcolepsy or permanent epilepsy and maybe the ice bucket challenge should be that
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:12.680]  of course a lot of these vaccines used to use dead baby parts so maybe you fill it up with
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:19.720]  little chopped up plastic toy babies and a bunch of fake blood and go yay let's raise money because
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:23.880]  you know they're always looking for a cure for breast cancer they're never looking for why it's
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:28.040]  skyrocketing they know why the glyphosates in the water and other things and women are getting
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:33.720]  a viaduct and stuff so so i would give money every time i go up to the cash register at a drug store
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:37.400]  or wherever else they go would you like to give money for breast cancer research and i go and no
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:43.560]  thank you why not it's a little moral authority thing well i already paid 67 percent in taxes and
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:48.920]  i already give charities or i i research the charities i give to be somebody behind your
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:54.600]  line yeah right buddy oh really won't you just you give some money then to give it to the breast
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:59.720]  cancer research groups who it turned out as you know are financing Planned Parenthood
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:10.520]  and abortion that's right that's come out so see i know how things work i'm not stupid that's why
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:18.520]  i'm such a bad person i understand but as long as you act liberal it's okay it's like foxcom
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:25.400]  the company apple uses has the worst record in china suicide net forced drugging forced abortions
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:33.960]  but al gore's on the board so it's okay because he's real condescending and he's al gore oh it's
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:43.400]  a good deal nafta and gat are a good deal larry be quiet ross perot oh he was so calm and laughed
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:49.000]  at ross perot he oh he loves us just as much as our black president bill clinton
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:53.320]  bill clinton is about as white
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:00.440]  as the driven snow covered in little liver warts
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:08.440]  he looks like driven snow with a gallon of dog urine dumped on it he doesn't look black to me
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:15.160]  but you know he said he's black he's black let me tell you what else he said al gore
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:22.520]  mr noodle oh polar bears can't swim penguins or can't swim but all the ice caps melted completely
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:34.280]  they're gone you know what he said he said he invented the internet in a senate vote in 1991
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:42.280]  the internet was invented by darpa and the brain bugs running it whoever they are in 1963
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:49.480]  and my dad used it in 1968 at the university of texas and cd rom that wasn't invented supposedly
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:40:00.120]  for 20 years later not al gore but see i've committed a sacrilege al gore did invent the
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:05.000]  internet two plus two equals five if you have a business you didn't build it and russia deserves
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:12.200]  to be nuked there you go let's go now to fritz spring mire author of bloodlines the limonati
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:16.600]  i want to get his taking by the book we are the ones that put it back in the print it's available
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:21.960]  at info or store dot com it's excellent i didn't believe a lot of when i first read it for 16 17
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:26.200]  years ago and so much of its turnout to be mainstream news but i meant to get him on for a full hour
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:29.880]  but we pushed him back and then he had skype problems so we're gonna get him back on again
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:36.120]  i guess in a few weeks for you know three must be the charm someday we have on the nightly news
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:42.440]  last night or last week with leon maggot what do you make the do you disagree with me or what
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:47.320]  can you add about how the globalists create the crisis or exacerbate it put cancer viruses in
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:51.800]  the vaccine give over 100 million people cancer through the polio vaccines that was declassified
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:56.760]  in the 80s people can pull that up and then they raised hundreds of billions of dollars to fight
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:02.920]  cancer but never find the cure fritz spring mire and cancer only skyrockets up several thousand
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:08.600]  percentage points in adults over 10 000 percentage points in pediatrics in children but no one dare
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:13.880]  ask why all this is happening the answer is go jog and pay a hundred bucks to enter the jog
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:19.720]  you know the 5k or the 10k and feel good about yourself fritz uh while you give money to groups
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:23.880]  that are carrying out eugenics and funding plan parenthood and and gun control groups fritz spring
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:32.360]  mire the pattern the way the elitist work the way the illuminati function uh they followed
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:39.800]  a pattern for the last century and once you catch on to it which you have then it becomes a no
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:47.400]  brainer but most people are busy you know looking at the latest celebrity scandal or their football
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:54.920]  team and uh just sit there and absorb whatever they're told by the mass media but if once you
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:42:00.840]  catch on and you can critically think you you start seeing things just like you've been telling
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:08.520]  people and that is is they create a problem and then they create the solution but what we have
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:15.560]  with those solutions is they create a banner issue for instance sustainable development
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:22.760]  who is who doesn't want sustainable development so under the the disguise of sustainable development
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:28.200]  we we have agenda 21 we're going to save the land we're going to save women and children
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:33.400]  and then they bring their agenda behind they give themselves the moral high ground we are saving the
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:38.280]  earth and prosperity sustainability who's with us well actually you want to take my property and
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:45.080]  give it to yourself shut up racist right so for like the christians back in 1992 they do
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:52.200]  they do evangelism 2000 which what a christian doesn't want to evangelize the entire world
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:58.440]  by the year 2000 but then they run their agenda and and behind evangelism 2000 what did the
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:06.600]  christians do they went door to door like census takers and and and found out what uh religion
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:12.600]  everybody uh belonged to so they were doing mapping for the new world order this is the
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:17.960]  kind of stuff that they do under my way you said that at the time and even i rolled my eyes now it's
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:25.240]  public their clergy response teams actual fbi paperwork and cia paperwork the year not just
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:30.680]  megachurches most preachers now literally go to secret government meetings and are spying on everyone
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:38.600]  and it's even mainstream news exactly you know and so like under health care which is another
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:42.920]  banner issue who doesn't want health care you know who doesn't want to fight cancer so yeah
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:48.600]  you're not for starving children or not giving a medical treatment are you so then they bring
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:55.240]  in the vaccines and like you exposed on info wars that that one polio vaccine that they were giving
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:04.200]  in india paralyzed 48 000 children and then they they were giving a vaccine over there in africa
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:12.760]  and you expose how that was paralyzing children so this is all a lot of what we're seeing uh is is
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:20.600]  under the major uh agenda that the illuminati have and that's population reduction or they
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:28.760]  you can give it different names you know uh population stabilization but the the end result
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:36.520]  is is they want to kill a lot of us and uh so a lot of these agendas are a lot of the things
[02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:43.560]  that we see happening follow under their main uh goal which is to reduce the world's population
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:51.480]  and the ones that remain they want to control so you see the second agenda that they have
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:59.880]  is mind control so a lot of what we see happening is to control our minds now there's a scripture john
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:11.640]  742 or excuse me john 724 judge not according to appearance but judge righteous judgment and
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:16.280]  you know that's what you're doing that's what a lot of other people like yourself are doing that's
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:23.720]  what i'm doing and that is is we're we're setting aside judging by appearances because if we look at
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:30.200]  appearances like like we've been discussing oh i want to i want to save the land oh i want health
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:37.480]  for everybody i want you know but we have to judge righteously what is the truth it also
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:44.520]  tells us in the word of god in uh second thessalonians 210 it says the love of the truth is what's
[02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:50.200]  going to save us not the truth you know i can hand you a bible or i can hand you some research but
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:56.120]  if you don't love the truth you're just going to throw it away and so what you've been trying to do
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:46:02.840]  what i've been trying to do is empower people get them excited about the truth so that they they love
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:10.040]  it and they want to do something about it you know and and you and i can hand people facts and truth
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:16.600]  and information all day long but until they get to the point that they love the truth you know
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:22.440]  it's not going to affect their lives it's not going to save them so this is what we have going on
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:29.960]  you and i we're trying to empower people we're i'm trying to encourage people and um trying to pull
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:37.400]  the uh mask off of all of these falsehoods you know and the people that you're talking about you
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:44.520]  were talking about george sorris you know what i can contribute is is he's illuminati you know
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:50.120]  and then the bill gates foundation you're talking about that just recently that's a foundation that
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:58.760]  the illuminati worked through you know so where i come in to help what you're doing is that i like
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:05.720]  you were saying having researched the illuminati i come along and say you see all these corporations
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:11.160]  you see all these politicians here's how they connect to the center of power here's how they
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:17.480]  connect to the globalist the elitist the illuminati you know so you look at at like someone
[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:25.640]  sir jeremy haywood you know he's the cabinet secretary over there in the united kingdom he's the
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:32.200]  prime advisor to the prime minister he's illuminati we have all these illuminati people
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:38.600]  salted through things and then we got these little puppets like obama you know that that just do
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:47.000]  whatever they're told and and then like you say we got people like al gore running around um by the
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:53.320]  way that was an awesome puppet uh imitation you just say it looked like team america or something
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:48:05.880]  the way you did can you do that one more time i like you gary incredible sorry go ahead so what
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:09.800]  would you like to talk about i mean well i mean there's so much to get into and things that cut
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:16.200]  short again we've had bad luck twice here with the skype but it looks great now uh i wanted to get
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:22.200]  into some of the current topics let's talk about geopolitically i know that the illuminati comes
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:28.600]  out of the babelonian and egyptian mystery schools its systems of control hidden knowledge a lot of
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:37.800]  it was just pharmacia or engineering or hydrology but then a lot of it is also social control shrouded
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:44.520]  in ancient mysticism but you can see the illuminati system working worldwide but there are three
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:49.320]  different competing predator systems within it so i want you to spend some time on your view
[02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:55.240]  on who rules the earth geographically you mean you talk about the bloodlines the illuminati
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:49:00.120]  some of these key families but separately from that you've got russia you've got geopolitically
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:06.680]  what's happening now what's your view i mean how staged is it versus real conflict going on with
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:14.600]  russia well the conflict with russia just like the cold war on one level is totally real but there
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:20.760]  are some real hidden controls there were hidden controls during the cold war there are hidden
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:30.760]  controls still intact in russia it's it's not like the illuminati have no assets or no strings
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:37.240]  attached to what's going on in russia in fact you'll find a lot of their corporations are deeply
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:42.920]  entrenched in the russian economy so most of them that came out in british lawsuit were actually
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:51.480]  rough child fronts exactly so people need to bear in mind that really what we're seeing
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:50:00.520]  at the top is a staged scripted new cold war and they work off of controlled conflict
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:08.600]  and what's going on for the ukrainian people is real i mean i've talked to uh ukrainians that are
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:14.600]  now american citizens and their relatives are still back in western ukraine and those people are
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:21.640]  suffering their suffering is real because uh of the things that have happened you know the gas being
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:28.440]  shut off the economy's wound down you know there's no electricity the store they're having problems
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:37.160]  getting food i mean just the basic essentials of life are are now difficult for the ukrainians
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:41.400]  whether they're western or eastern and that's all because they didn't vote to join the e you
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:51.480]  yeah so so that suffering is real and so it's it's like in world war two if you were a soldier
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:55.880]  fighting the japanese you're suffering in your misery that's right but the emperor didn't get

[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:33.080]  be sure and scroll through the whole site xcaofficial proposes assassination of putin
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:37.400]  and a recent op-ed of former CIA official suggested the removal of president
[02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:43.240]  Vladimir Putin by assassination if necessary should be the primary objective of the obama
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:49.160]  administration in its strategy for ukraine herbert e meyer who served as special assistant to the
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:53.240]  director of central intelligence under the reg administration so the goal of the us sanctions
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:58.440]  against russia should be to get the russians who we've been keeping putin in power or tolerating
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:05.560]  putin in power to throw the knockout punch and he goes by that a bullet in the back of his head
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:10.040]  but also be okay so they're telling the russians kill him
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:16.600]  because putin did arrest i don't know six or seven oligarchs it turned out were
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:23.720]  basically Rothschild fronts Rothschild sued over the claims and it came out in court it was true
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:31.240]  the look got up last year the case settled and the judge basically said this this this suit that
[02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:37.080]  you brought proves everything against you it proved what was claimed
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:44.360]  so that's the big no-no that's what they're always like i bet putin's got billions he stole i bet
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:50.280]  i'm not defending putin the point is is that they want him out of there and and listen the
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:55.640]  globalist might assassinate obama hypothetically as a false flag to get a race war going they got a
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:01.160]  lot of wild cards they can play fritz spring mary you agree with that statement yeah there's
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:07.880]  uh all kinds of wild cards but i think that they've got their agenda pretty well under control where
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:16.520]  they're not going to have to play too many wild cards um you know going back to this whole thing
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:23.400]  about controlled conflict they're creating all of these messes but the solutions that they give us
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:29.640]  are taking us in a direction that they want to take us you know another way of describing
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:37.240]  is hegelian dialectics and um you know perfect example is syria creating isis now we've got to
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:43.960]  go back to the middle east because of isis yeah well you know the united states supplied the these
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:49.880]  groups that were fighting Assad we supplied them with weapons and money and then those weapons and
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:59.000]  money are are now being used by used by isis then to to become this powerful organization so we
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:05.800]  created the problem that now that we have to go and bomb so yeah it's the same thing and once you get
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:11.000]  these problems going they kind of be they they more where they're almost out of control that's
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:16.040]  right that's right they just trigger a lot of stuff nothing or make something that's already
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:24.680]  happening worse right it reminds me you know during the nineties i was helping some men and women
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:29.640]  that wanted out of the illuminati they they were under illuminati mind control so i was trying to
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:36.040]  deal with their trauma-based mind control and anyway where i'm going with this is is they described
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:44.280]  some men and women uh different different individuals described to me illuminati uh
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:48.840]  ceremonies where they would have gladiator fights to the death they would have two people
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:55.640]  in and they would the the spectators would watch but the the gladiators that were fighting to the
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:03.240]  death couldn't see the people watching them but uh because of the way uh the view the viewing windows
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:11.480]  were were one way but anyway they love this this conflict they love to to set something set two
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:16.760]  sides they love to play with our world like it's their little toys yeah treat us like ponds and
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:21.880]  chess wait till their judgment day comes five more minutes with fritz springmeyer i'm out of time i'll

[02:58:49.880 --> 02:58:53.960]  i began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[02:58:53.960 --> 02:59:00.120]  get healthy and detoxify most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:06.600]  world iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid i discovered a
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:12.760]  product being developed by dr group you now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine that your
[02:59:12.760 --> 02:59:17.720]  body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you think this is powerful i'm going

[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:54.280]  how the general programming is going on through the television and the culture because it's so
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:01:00.520]  obvious right now and we have the famous quote of the current attorney general saying
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:06.760]  to a big media group let's brainwash the public let's just keep repeating our messages to get
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:12.280]  their guns they don't even hide a lot of this now it's like they admit they created isis but then
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:16.920]  say so what we got to bomb them then they don't even really bomb them they get ready to bomb the
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:22.360]  opposition it's like they don't care anymore it's like one giant group of the public's totally on
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:31.960]  a way and another big giant group of the public uh knows what's going on i mean it's just crazy but
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:35.160]  i don't see things going well for them though because it's getting so obvious
[03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:43.640]  you make a good point that they're just getting in our face and saying we're gonna do this no
[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:49.160]  matter what and you can't stop us you know the illuminati want hillary to be our next president
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:56.440]  and we'll see how well that goes i notice in the checkout stands and they're getting her
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:00.280]  picture everywhere they just push her everywhere it's just pushing her and if you're against what
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:06.680]  she wants to do you're against women yeah just like if you're against obama you're against blacks
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:12.840]  you know i mean they play these silly games and people buy into the the baloney well they use
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:18.040]  really simple psychology and you can argue well the public simple but studies show the simplicity
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:25.560]  actually dumps people down they're the the dumbing down of media dumps you down yeah people aren't
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:31.480]  critically thinking fritz send me an email about topics you want to cover because now you got good
[03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:37.960]  skype and uh and i'm sorry again today you had skype problems and we had some issues um i've
[03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:41.320]  actually pushed you back a little bit because i forgot to go to calls i apologize to tasha and
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:45.400]  others i'll have to go to them tomorrow if we're here tomorrow lord willing i don't take anything
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:49.240]  for granted nightly news tonight i'll have a lot of info we're gonna have our reporters tomorrow
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:55.960]  reporting from the uh devil canyon nuclear power plant that even federal officials have said
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:03:01.960]  if there is a major uh breakdown there uh or even an 8.0 it will cause a Fukushima-like level
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:07.880]  disaster why did they build it like that to begin with our reporters went to the local uh
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:13.080]  town there and went to their library and found the old articles with scientists warning about it
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:18.040]  as well there's a bunch of reactors on the uh west coast that are built on that let me ask fritz
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:21.960]  that question briefly in a minute and a half we have left fritz why do you think the elite
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:27.400]  build the reactors on fault lines and tsunami lines i mean i've looked at where reactors are it seems
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:33.560]  like they build them only on fault lines yeah so it's been an intentional thing to create these
[03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:42.120]  problems chera noble for instance was the background to the ukrainian problem that we have right now
[03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:49.880]  because the because of chera noble the ukrainians began to hate the the soviet government and there
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:55.800]  was a group called green world that started protesting they felt like the ukrainian genetics
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:04:02.120]  had been totally ruined because of the you know and that's an example of how that then led to
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:08.680]  ukrainian sovereignty ukrainian sovereignty has then led to the crimian thing the crimian thing
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:15.720]  then led to eastern ukraine so it's like this it all fits together so yeah i think it was intentional
[03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:21.240]  a lot of evidence was they knew it was going to blow up i've seen pbs documentaries and would do
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:31.720]  nothing and then just programmed it basically to blow up yeah and and so uh people that are in the
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:39.160]  know that like the programmers and stuff they they program these kind of events into the the scripts
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:44.760]  in the minds of the mind controlled slaves so well yeah that's what i'm seeing is now they're
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:48.600]  going to full mind control publicly with the predictive programming we'll talk about it next
[03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:53.720]  week if you can do it full hour with fritz springmeyer next week riveting get the book info or store
