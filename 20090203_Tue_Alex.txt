[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.680 --> 00:19.240]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.240 --> 00:29.600]  Texas Alex Jones last Thursday I did about three hours of the four-hour radio
[00:29.600 --> 00:39.240]  show on scores of new heavily sponsored bills in the House of Representatives
[00:39.240 --> 00:44.640]  that will ban all semi-automatic handguns and rifles in the United States also
[00:44.640 --> 00:49.440]  giving the Attorney General the way it reads and now sworn in minutes ago to be
[00:49.440 --> 00:55.920]  able to ban basically any other guns he wishes he is for complete disarmament of
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.720]  the American people he has testified before the Supreme Court he has filed
[00:59.720 --> 01:04.880]  briefs supporting the DC total gun ban and believes it should be done nationwide
[01:04.880 --> 01:10.640]  we now have an Attorney General who is the most anti-American anti-second
[01:10.640 --> 01:16.760]  amendment creature ever seen Rahm Emanuel has also introduced legislation
[01:16.760 --> 01:22.320]  to completely ban guns he has supported it in Illinois as well these are crime
[01:22.320 --> 01:27.840]  bosses and when criminals come in and rob a bank folks first thing they do is
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.760]  go over to the off-duty police of the security guards the security man and
[01:31.760 --> 01:36.640]  disarm them well we've been robbed by the international bankers the first thing
[01:36.640 --> 01:41.680]  they do is hands up drop your weapons I mean if somebody was gonna go out and
[01:41.680 --> 01:46.360]  kidnap a police officer they'd come up behind them put a gun to their head and
[01:46.360 --> 01:52.280]  say put your hands up and they take their firearm away from them and that's
[01:52.280 --> 01:56.800]  what it is they're not the government they're dirty stinking pieces of
[01:56.800 --> 02:05.840]  criminal filth period and all these decades they swore up and down oh we
[02:05.840 --> 02:09.560]  don't want your guns oh we don't want to restrict them oh we don't just let us
[02:09.560 --> 02:13.160]  pass one more piece of gun control legislation then we'll stop and now
[02:13.160 --> 02:16.440]  they're up there saying we don't want your guns we don't want your guns we
[02:16.440 --> 02:24.680]  want reasonable new gun laws which mean total bans they have bills to reason I'm
[02:24.680 --> 02:31.680]  going into this history is there's new horrors that's right the White House or
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.680]  Homeland Security will be able to in an extra judicial fashion that is outside
[02:37.680 --> 02:42.440]  the courts completely outside even their kangaroo courts they have kangaroo
[02:42.440 --> 02:49.200]  family courts that kidnap children no due process no witnesses no nothing to
[02:49.200 --> 02:53.880]  where they can now there's already a million Americans as of six months ago
[02:53.880 --> 03:00.760]  I haven't seen the latest numbers they add 25,000 people a month to the list for
[03:00.760 --> 03:07.040]  the last seven years there is now over a million people on the no-fly list and
[03:07.040 --> 03:11.680]  they're saying that if you're on a no-fly list or a criminal list this is
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.280]  all under Patriot Act compliance see people think a no-fly list is no-fly
[03:16.280 --> 03:23.080]  list no no no no no no this is a no-buy-and-sell list so I'm gonna go
[03:23.080 --> 03:28.440]  over the legislation that Rahm Emanuel was talking about introducing coming up
[03:28.440 --> 03:34.840]  today we posted this last night up on prisonplanet.com and this is the
[03:34.840 --> 03:40.360]  architect this is the this is Blagojevic's little buddy this is the person
[03:40.360 --> 03:43.880]  that brought him up to power this is the individual that brought Barack Obama up
[03:43.880 --> 03:49.200]  to power so while they're saying they're gonna put 20,000 battle-hardened
[03:49.200 --> 03:53.240]  combat troops on the streets the United States to control Washington while
[03:53.240 --> 03:57.560]  they're saying they're gonna create a million man domestic army which they've
[03:57.560 --> 04:00.800]  now announced yesterday I mean officially they were always saying they
[04:00.800 --> 04:04.960]  would do it but now they've officially announced it it's all happening they're
[04:04.960 --> 04:10.000]  coming with armed force against us for your land your property your children
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.120]  they are usurpers they are pirates tyranny is when pirates get control of
[04:16.120 --> 04:23.400]  government they are a gang with a flag and they have these big official sounding
[04:23.400 --> 04:27.520]  titles but as the Declaration of Independence reads when they become
[04:27.520 --> 04:31.080]  destructive of the aims of liberty and freedom and the people it is the
[04:31.080 --> 04:37.760]  people's right it is their duty to abolish that form of government and set
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.760]  up a new one oh I want our old form these are revolutionaries I'm a counter
[04:42.760 --> 04:48.600]  revolutionary they've come in bought off our government overthrown it and now
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.160]  they're really getting ready to do a Soviet job and I don't joke when I say

[08:16.120 --> 08:20.800]  I'm going to get here and zone and use the preservation of firearms ownership
[08:20.800 --> 08:26.480]  on this week to talk about the most vicious focused savage attack a
[08:26.480 --> 08:35.720]  decapitation attack if they get this it's over barring physical war with them
[08:35.960 --> 08:41.000]  we're also going to get Larry Pratt back on this week because so much is
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.880]  happening so much is going on I knew when they tripled the size of the Bureau
[08:44.880 --> 08:50.320]  of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives the revenuers a great criminal
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.120]  history they were the folks that would go around for the feds on whiskey taxes
[08:54.120 --> 08:59.760]  and cotton taxes and other things and beat people up steal go in their houses
[08:59.760 --> 09:04.400]  without warrants rob everything and of course they became corrupt they became
[09:04.400 --> 09:12.840]  really the first national mafia in the United States by the 1850 6070s and they
[09:12.840 --> 09:15.880]  would range around during reconstruction and other times just murdering
[09:15.880 --> 09:21.360]  raping killing whoever they wanted so out of those cadres has been formed what
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.240]  we know of as the gun confiscators the brutal haters of this country brutal
[09:26.240 --> 09:36.120]  criminal gang in their gun division now you've got the explosives division you've
[09:36.120 --> 09:40.920]  got the you know taxing authority of alcohol tobacco but that still springs
[09:40.920 --> 09:45.640]  from a criminal organization I'm not saying everyone that works at the BATF
[09:45.640 --> 09:52.440]  E is a terrorist there's a lot of clerks and bureaucrats and you know people out
[09:52.440 --> 09:58.040]  there but but they're revenuers they're the original federal revenuers before
[09:58.040 --> 10:01.960]  you had the income tax this is the anniversary of the 16th amendment today
[10:01.960 --> 10:11.160]  by the way or was it yesterday the point is that they want your guns and they
[10:11.160 --> 10:16.880]  want them bad a bully wants to subjugate his slaves and they want to chain you
[10:16.880 --> 10:21.960]  down there's like a psychopath it's basic psychopathic psychology MO
[10:21.960 --> 10:27.600]  modus operandi they love getting you chained down so they can leer and smile
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.280]  and get a good look at you and terrorize you and tell you you're in my power
[10:32.280 --> 10:40.880]  there's nothing you can do man I watch the news and it's nothing but demonizing
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.480]  families of more than one or two children I watch the news it's it's
[10:45.480 --> 10:50.320]  constant demonization of industry and businesses that are low level and small
[10:50.320 --> 10:54.920]  it's constant demonization of bottled water saying drink your tap water public
[10:54.920 --> 10:58.640]  service announcements because they're putting poison in it by design and the
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.160]  brain damage public can't even imagine it's that criminal because it's so
[11:03.160 --> 11:14.680]  scary for them to understand it and last week in fact it was in my stack here
[11:14.680 --> 11:17.720]  when I left last Thursday they moved my stack of news out of here I've got to
[11:17.720 --> 11:23.680]  find it so I can dig all the bill numbers back out or I guess I could pull
[11:23.680 --> 11:27.400]  them up on info wars comm prison planet calm during the next break there's just
[11:27.400 --> 11:36.760]  so many of them out of it stack of them HR 45 and others that completely end the
[11:36.760 --> 11:45.200]  second amendment gone and see the Supreme Court pulled that pulled that
[11:45.200 --> 11:54.680]  little ruse last year claiming they'd had a pro-second amendment ruling and I
[11:54.680 --> 12:00.400]  told you it was a sneak attack it's like the Tet offensive in Vietnam when it's
[12:00.400 --> 12:09.840]  the Asian New Year and everybody stands down and they sneak attack during that
[12:09.840 --> 12:18.920]  period they have announced bills where all of us will have to be psychologically
[12:18.920 --> 12:22.720]  tested all of our medical records ought to be turned over any misdemeanor any
[12:22.720 --> 12:28.480]  type of mental designation that tens of millions of Americans have because you
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.960]  know they they advertise it as the thing to do oh you're 14 you're depressed
[12:32.960 --> 12:36.960]  over your girlfriend or your boyfriend breaking up with you the school
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.160]  counselor says listen here's a card of a local psychologist you want to go to them
[12:43.160 --> 12:47.520]  first visit they say well I'm gonna prescribe Riedelen or this Prozac drug
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.960]  to you because then the insurance kicks in well we'll give you a mental
[12:51.960 --> 13:00.320]  designation and then it'll all be covered and then now they're getting those
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.640]  juvenile files they're getting those private psychological files on tens of
[13:04.640 --> 13:10.320]  millions of Americans and now if you have a car wreck they come to you and say
[13:10.320 --> 13:13.640]  you should see a psychologist and then they they're putting millions of
[13:13.640 --> 13:17.240]  Americans a year on Prozac and other drugs and see with that comes a
[13:17.240 --> 13:21.240]  psychological designation they have to say something's wrong with you oh are
[13:21.240 --> 13:27.000]  you feeling depressed over your car wreck yeah you know I herniated you know
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.200]  three disc or ruptured some and have a broken collarbone dock I've talked to
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.520]  so many people that told this story or I you know broke both my legs and smashed
[13:34.520 --> 13:39.240]  my face in yeah I'm bummed out knocked all my teeth out they don't say well
[13:39.240 --> 13:44.120]  get back on your feet exercise you know you can get some implants to fix your
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.000]  teeth boy you're lucky you live through this they say oh well we're gonna give
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.600]  you psychological designation now and then here's some pills and now you're
[13:55.600 --> 13:59.320]  institutionalized see they can't get you on welfare they're gonna get you on
[13:59.320 --> 14:02.640]  drugs they can't do that if they're getting the criminal justice system and
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.080]  they can't do that they're gonna get you in debt and so remember what happened
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.840]  Bill Clinton left office everybody got upset then Bush continued it and so
[14:10.840 --> 14:18.920]  governors went ah it's all right they took millions Clinton started with 86,000
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.200]  was in the news but then it's now millions and millions and millions of
[14:23.200 --> 14:33.520]  veterans World War two vets Korean War vets Vietnam vets desert storm vets and
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.320]  let's say you collapse in your chemical suit in 130 degree temperatures you
[14:38.320 --> 14:43.120]  collapse when you're Bradley fighting vehicle or you got shot up or you were
[14:43.120 --> 14:49.000]  on the front lines for three days with no sleep in Korea or Vietnam and a fire
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.240]  base you collapsed and when they went ahead and said well he served nine
[14:56.240 --> 15:00.120]  months of his tour and he collapsed of exhaustion they had this plan way back
[15:00.120 --> 15:03.960]  then this has now come out in federal documents they put on their PTSD or other
[15:03.960 --> 15:10.400]  disorders and so you get flown back to the US they pin a medal on your chest
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.440]  and now you're trying to buy your grandson a rifle or you're trying to buy
[15:14.440 --> 15:19.800]  a rifle and folks I've talked to famous one guy famous you know well-known UT
[15:19.800 --> 15:24.880]  football players guys from the 60s and 70s and people with no criminal records
[15:24.880 --> 15:34.640]  they can't buy guns now folks because they were in the military you understand
[15:34.640 --> 15:41.560]  how this works and it is true that you know all the stuff is a kernel of truth
[15:41.560 --> 15:45.520]  in it that there are a lot of raving maniacs in the military but all the more
[15:45.520 --> 15:52.000]  reason I own a gun to protect myself from them and vice versa everybody gets
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.080]  to protect themselves so the 68 gun control act at the NRA promoted and
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.960]  pushed and got passed all you didn't know that on record oh you thought they
[16:03.960 --> 16:07.840]  were your friends that how are they going to disarm 150 million gun owners
[16:07.840 --> 16:11.840]  they're going to do it by can having controlling the group that supposedly is
[16:11.840 --> 16:17.960]  there to protect you and see now there's not going to be a big hoopla from the
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.960]  NRA and a big hoopla over all these gun bills it's just Obama saying I'm not
[16:21.960 --> 16:29.680]  for anything unreasonable I've seen him quote it he says we're not going to just
[16:29.680 --> 16:32.520]  ban them all in one night that's unreasonable but we are going to start
[16:32.520 --> 16:40.960]  restricting them and so they've introduced bills where the Attorney General
[16:40.960 --> 16:47.360]  can ban any guns he wants at any time where you get a federal license where
[16:47.360 --> 16:50.920]  you get a federal registration where they decide if you get the second minute
[16:50.920 --> 16:59.880]  where it's a privilege and if you have any psychological designation any time
[16:59.880 --> 17:07.600]  in your life no second amendment if you have any misdemeanors no second
[17:07.600 --> 17:13.400]  amendment and if that isn't enough boys and girls here is Rahm Emanuel
[17:13.400 --> 17:19.720]  congressman May 15 2007 speaking at DC's annual stand up for a safe America event
[17:19.720 --> 17:23.960]  means safe for these crooks to run all over this sponsored by the Brady Center
[17:23.960 --> 17:27.720]  says if your name is on a terrace no fly list you will not be allowed to own a
[17:27.720 --> 17:37.160]  gun now what do we got to do because let's be um and Sarah's right people's
[17:37.160 --> 17:41.480]  intimidation on this issue is not defined by just Republicans there are
[17:41.480 --> 17:46.320]  Democrats intimidated by this issue wrongly but intimidated they think their
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.200]  politics and their community is such they can't do this the truth is what we
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.080]  need again to get moving on this legislation is put together a crime
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.680]  strategy like we had before which is why we passed the bill today on the cops
[17:58.680 --> 18:02.680]  putting money back into putting police officers on there getting voices for
[18:02.680 --> 18:07.560]  change and then making sure that we have a president I cannot put my
[18:07.560 --> 18:14.240]  partisanship aside a Democratic president who will take that office and use it to
[18:14.240 --> 18:18.280]  protect the streets and the kids that grow up on those streets and make sure
[18:18.280 --> 18:22.440]  that we once again have an assault weapon ban a Brady bill with the full force
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.320]  of the law on land because we need somebody in the Oval Office that moves
[18:26.320 --> 18:30.360]  this Congress we had an election about change people are clear about the
[18:30.360 --> 18:34.640]  special interest they are tired of that gridlock the special interest cause in
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.600]  Washington and I think the most simple thing we can do and we've got to make
[18:38.600 --> 18:43.160]  this a number one issue as a test vote and then take it into the election that
[18:43.160 --> 18:47.440]  is if you are on the no-fly list because you are known as maybe a
[18:47.440 --> 18:54.240]  possible terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in America
[18:59.080 --> 19:04.560]  and I am not one far from liking the mixing of politics and policy but as my
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.040]  old boss used to say give me that vote and throw me into that prior patch I'll
[19:09.040 --> 19:13.360]  make politics out of that every day because if it's between that terrorist
[19:13.360 --> 19:18.280]  list and the NRA I know where America is going to be every time and they're going
[19:18.280 --> 19:22.040]  to make the right choice and we have got to start building on that that is the
[19:22.040 --> 19:25.640]  right thing to take into the election it's the right policy if you're on that
[19:25.640 --> 19:30.600]  no-fly list your access to the right to bear arms is cancelled because you're
[19:30.600 --> 19:34.560]  not part of the American family you don't deserve that right there is no
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.960]  right for you if you're on that terrorist list that should be number one in what we
[19:38.960 --> 19:43.040]  do make sure there's a full force of the law behind the Brady belt so to all those
[19:43.040 --> 19:47.760]  who dedicate their lives to seeing sensible gun laws remember it's sensible
[19:47.760 --> 19:51.680]  gun laws at least on the beat

[24:02.160 --> 24:08.760]  all right let's go right back into this live transmission ladies and gentlemen
[24:08.760 --> 24:15.840]  Rahm Emanuel is saying we're gonna have a democratic president to carry out the
[24:15.840 --> 24:20.520]  Brady campaign's operation now they've introduced all the bills and it is
[24:20.520 --> 24:27.000]  nowhere in the mainstream media alert this is a sneak attack alert alert the
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.640]  second amendment is hanging by a thread and they have the razor blade a
[24:32.640 --> 24:38.160]  millimeter away they are moving towards it in the past they would try to sell the
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.000]  public on turning in their guns and they seized a lot of major cities and
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.760]  states and had outright bans or near bands and harass gun owners they've
[24:46.760 --> 24:51.320]  been suing gun manufacturers they shut down the majority of them we have a
[24:51.320 --> 24:55.280]  handful of what we had a decade ago they shut down most importation they
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.960]  harassed and find and feed most ammo manufacturers out of business they are
[24:59.960 --> 25:05.760]  harassing and terrorizing gun dealers and gun shops and gun shows and putting
[25:05.760 --> 25:09.960]  VATF and other secret police in the gun shows trying to set people up they are
[25:09.960 --> 25:14.120]  harassing I mean I know so many people that have been rated for no reason I see
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.720]  articles every day about you know some banker or collector some you know
[25:17.720 --> 25:22.480]  semi-wealthy person who is 60 years old and has got a hundred guns there's no
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.000]  law against that they call it an arsenal SWAT team of arrest them call them a
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.760]  terrorist on the news they are attacking the American people they are
[25:30.760 --> 25:39.160]  criminals and illegitimate now you just heard Rahm Emanuel say extra judicial
[25:39.160 --> 25:46.720]  outside the judicial system there are over a million Americans over a million
[25:46.720 --> 25:53.400]  Americans now on the no fly list this is done on purpose they act like it's a
[25:53.400 --> 25:59.440]  mistake or people with similar names and they're saying that if you were on a no
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.360]  fly list no judge no jury no nothing there are congressmen who have been on
[26:04.360 --> 26:12.000]  it for five years who can't get off Ted Kennedy can't get off who's a senator I
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.400]  know people businessmen with no criminal record who can't get off and they're
[26:18.400 --> 26:21.920]  saying if you haven't paid your taxes they're going to put it on there because
[26:21.920 --> 26:26.320]  under the Patriot Act and any person who's in financial services knows about
[26:26.320 --> 26:34.040]  this and under the know your customer legislation within the Patriot Act there
[26:34.040 --> 26:40.880]  is Patriot Act compliance and there is a criminal list of over three million
[26:40.880 --> 26:46.520]  names and that was a year ago six months ago it passed a million I saw that
[26:46.520 --> 26:51.080]  headline in the news no fly list pass a million the no fly list in
[26:51.080 --> 26:55.960]  England passed two million and they're only 65 68 million people so they're
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.080]  doing this all over the world this is a program and the secret police and the
[27:00.080 --> 27:04.280]  computer databases just say that you're a person of interest and that you are on
[27:04.280 --> 27:13.960]  the no fly list but they have the Patriot Act criminal list as well and
[27:13.960 --> 27:20.040]  remember a couple years ago all these big check cashing places said well we're
[27:20.040 --> 27:23.840]  gonna have to shut down because under Patriot compliance we have to run
[27:23.840 --> 27:27.880]  everybody through a criminal database they're not not convicted it's just a
[27:27.880 --> 27:32.360]  criminal database and if there is suspected criminal they can't even cast
[27:32.360 --> 27:38.040]  checks so talk about not being able to buy nor sell this is what the cashless
[27:38.040 --> 27:42.200]  society control grid is about so when they squeeze you and squeeze you and
[27:42.200 --> 27:49.440]  squeeze you and the IRS says that you haven't paid the taxes or you didn't
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.280]  pay them $10,000 because you didn't have it in a year later it's $100,000 with
[27:54.280 --> 27:58.240]  penalties and interest and you just don't have the money your credit cards
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.960]  aren't going to work you're not going to be allowed to have a bank account they
[28:01.960 --> 28:05.440]  have announced this this is what life is gonna it's not just gun owners you
[28:05.440 --> 28:11.680]  understand this is a total grid of control I was on Southwest Airlines this
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.560]  weekend they don't accept cash anymore other airlines a lot of businesses aren't
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.760]  accepting cash they're phasing you over to a cashless society because then it
[28:19.760 --> 28:23.920]  kills the underground economy and even if you're not in the underground
[28:23.920 --> 28:29.920]  economy in any way and by the way if you ever have a garage sale you're in the
[28:29.920 --> 28:33.560]  underground economy that states are trying to pass laws the feds are trying
[28:33.560 --> 28:38.560]  to pass laws where you have to tax report on yourself for that so this is a
[28:38.560 --> 28:44.200]  total grid a net of control coming in and right smack dab in the middle of it
[28:44.200 --> 28:51.080]  Rahm Emanuel is saying we need to get a democratic president for change so he's
[28:51.080 --> 28:53.840]  the guy that came up with all these terms he's the guy behind Obama he's the
[28:53.840 --> 28:59.400]  guy that cracks his knuckles in Obama's ear in front of the Congress and Barack
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.280]  Obama says quit it he gets up in his face right fair body and basically says
[29:03.280 --> 29:09.240]  I'm the boss punk you got it and he's not even an American he's an IDF soldier
[29:09.240 --> 29:14.400]  his father was one of the founders of the Israeli terror group that's mainstream
[29:14.400 --> 29:21.400]  news so this is just adding insult and injury I find it very insulting that
[29:21.400 --> 29:27.640]  Schwarzenegger is a foreigner calling for gun bans basically in California so
[29:27.640 --> 29:31.440]  I'm gonna break this down we get back and play more around the manual did you
[29:31.440 --> 29:39.760]  hear him did you hear what he had to say if you're on a no-fly list and it's
[29:39.760 --> 29:45.800]  gonna mean the criminal database as well no gun for you no more judge no more
[29:45.800 --> 29:49.280]  jury you don't even need to have a misdemeanor they're coming after your
[29:49.280 --> 29:56.400]  second amendment we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[34:15.520 --> 34:18.440]  were gonna put in their president they were going to move ahead with the gun
[34:18.440 --> 34:24.360]  control let's just play the entire clip is only played half of it earlier let's
[34:24.360 --> 34:29.320]  just play it all in one piece it's up on prison planet dot com right now here it
[34:29.320 --> 34:37.240]  is now what do we got to do because let's be on and Sarah's right people's
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.560]  intimidation on this issue is not defined by just Republicans there are
[34:41.560 --> 34:46.240]  Democrats intimidated by this issue wrongly but intimidating they think
[34:46.240 --> 34:51.000]  their politics and their community is such they can't do this the truth is
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.200]  what we need again to get moving on this legislation is put together a crime
[34:55.200 --> 34:59.440]  strategy like we had before which is why we passed the bill today on the cops
[34:59.440 --> 35:02.760]  putting money back into putting police officers on there getting voices for
[35:02.760 --> 35:07.640]  change and then making sure that we have a president I cannot put my
[35:07.640 --> 35:14.320]  partisanship aside a democratic president who will take that office and use it to
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.360]  protect the streets and the kids that grow up on those streets and make sure
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.200]  that we once again have an assault weapon ban a Brady bill with the full
[35:22.200 --> 35:26.040]  force of the law on land because we need somebody in the Oval Office that
[35:26.040 --> 35:30.440]  moves this Congress we had an election about change people are clear about the
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.800]  special interest yeah they had an election about change that he engineered
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.560]  lying saying they didn't the war well Rahm Emanuel made sure Democrats didn't
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.640]  get elected and in some cases even got Republicans elected who were pro-war so
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.480]  he wants to ensure that his quarry his slaves are disarmed so he and his
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.760]  vampire crew can feed on this country and basically carry out something akin to
[35:52.760 --> 35:58.400]  the Bolshevik Revolution here and I'm not joking it's the same crew but they're
[35:58.400 --> 36:01.800]  not communists they just use that as a way to con the public and promise them a
[36:01.800 --> 36:06.360]  bunch of goodies look what's happening to America total socialism right now they
[36:06.360 --> 36:10.520]  are tired of that gridlock the special interest cause in the people are not
[36:10.520 --> 36:16.680]  tired 30 years ago around half the public in major polls were for gun
[36:16.680 --> 36:20.280]  control and were fooled by it now it's more than 70% that are against it and
[36:20.280 --> 36:24.200]  most liberals are out buying guns because they figured out it's a scam and
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.240]  the government isn't and doesn't want to protect you and it's illegitimate so
[36:28.240 --> 36:31.360]  stop acting like you've got the people on your side you know at the first he
[36:31.360 --> 36:38.080]  admits that all of these Democrats are intimidated by the issue they know
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.040]  they'll get voted out of office that's why they're racing to put in their
[36:41.040 --> 36:46.440]  fraudulent federal voting machines that have been proven to be frauds folks if
[36:46.440 --> 36:49.360]  they get our guns or they can pass laws against the Second Amendment they're
[36:49.360 --> 36:53.200]  gonna wage war on you and you're gonna see on the news every day SWAT teams
[36:53.200 --> 36:55.880]  killing people and folks are gonna get scared and most people are gonna turn
[36:55.880 --> 36:59.360]  their guns in but a lot of people are gonna fight back and then if I was the
[36:59.360 --> 37:02.840]  police the military and the SWAT teams I wouldn't be wanting this I mean you're
[37:02.840 --> 37:08.280]  forcing people into a corner who are gonna not back off folks this may be a
[37:08.280 --> 37:11.960]  nation that's been domesticated and been castrated but there's still people who
[37:11.960 --> 37:14.880]  haven't been castrated and there's people out there that they understand what
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.800]  the Second Amendment is and my gosh you're putting yourselves in an
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.560]  incredible position but Rahm Emanuel he'll be in his armored DC compound he
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.680]  won't care how many gun confiscators get killed they want this war with the
[37:27.680 --> 37:31.440]  American people they want to swing the entire drug war apparatus the entire
[37:31.440 --> 37:35.160]  anti-terror system around on the American people and they're doing it
[37:35.160 --> 37:41.240]  right now on record it's happening let's play that now listen you will be put on
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.800]  a watch list no judge no jury no conviction over a million Americans
[37:45.800 --> 37:52.040]  already on it meanwhile real terrorists are allowed into the country that's on
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.320]  record and this guy's up here saying this and pushing all of this but it's
[37:57.320 --> 38:02.320]  bigger than that it's anyone with a psychological record it's anyone with a
[38:02.320 --> 38:10.920]  misdemeanor it is anyone oh it's just amazing it is anyone who's on the crime
[38:10.920 --> 38:15.320]  watch list millions of Americans on that one I'm gonna get into patriarch
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.800]  compliance to take your calls in a moment here we go Washington and I think the
[38:19.800 --> 38:23.400]  most simple thing we can do and we've got to make this a number one issue as a
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.840]  test vote and then take it into the election that is if you are on the no
[38:27.840 --> 38:34.280]  fly list because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist you cannot because
[38:34.280 --> 38:41.360]  you are known maybe as a possible terrorist because you are known maybe
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.760]  as a possible terrorist over a million Americans and they're not coming off of
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.560]  the list then the fed say oh well come register with us have every American
[38:51.560 --> 38:55.360]  registered properly then this won't happen to get you to openly acquiesce to
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.840]  a database they say under homeland security I remember Governor Ridge on
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.200]  television saying this first he said let's get rid of posse commentators they
[39:03.200 --> 39:06.840]  basically done that then they expand out from there they say oh you'll have to
[39:06.840 --> 39:12.800]  have a federally approved ID real ID to have a job and then if you're on not in
[39:12.800 --> 39:16.720]  favor with the homeland security haven't paid your taxes you just don't get a job
[39:16.720 --> 39:23.520]  this is total control over everything with a million domestic spies a million
[39:23.520 --> 39:29.880]  man army of obama noids with national ad council ads running on TV billboards
[39:29.880 --> 39:36.080]  radio everywhere to get the citizens to go join USA service org to literally be
[39:36.080 --> 39:44.280]  enforcers of this I mean you couldn't make up a more nightmare scenario imagine
[39:44.280 --> 39:47.800]  these control freak nobodies who've never had a business never done anything in
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.920]  their lives they just go get a uniform they get a little tattletale phone a lot
[39:51.920 --> 39:56.480]  of them get guns tasers just running around and they want your houses they
[39:56.480 --> 40:01.360]  want your property they're greedy low-down little scumbag bastards they hate
[40:01.360 --> 40:05.960]  the middle class they're gonna turn loose the bureaucrat bloodsucker parasite
[40:05.960 --> 40:08.880]  class on the people
[40:10.200 --> 40:16.160]  armored trucks pulling up led by little commie brigades oh it makes me sick and
[40:16.160 --> 40:18.640]  folks everything I've told you has come through so far I mean are you ready for
[40:18.640 --> 40:22.200]  the rest to come through or are we gonna just go absolutely aping the info war
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.800]  and defeat these bastards because what they're doing is so over the top if we
[40:25.800 --> 40:30.120]  just point out what these bastards are doing there's no way they're gonna get
[40:30.120 --> 40:36.280]  away with it by a handgun in america
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.680]  I'm gonna play that again one issue as a test vote and then take it into the
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.400]  election that is if you are on the no fly list because you are known as maybe a
[40:48.400 --> 41:02.160]  possible terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in america and I am not one far
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.600]  from liking the mixing of politics and policy but as my old boss used to say
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.960]  give me that vote and throw me into that prior patch I'll make politics out of
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.480]  that every day because if it's between that terrorists terrorists list and the
[41:15.480 --> 41:19.560]  NRA I know where America is gonna be every time and they're gonna make the
[41:19.560 --> 41:23.400]  right choice and we have got to start building on that that is the right thing
[41:23.400 --> 41:27.400]  to take into the election it's the right policy if you're on that no fly list
[41:27.400 --> 41:32.800]  your access to the right to bear arms is canceled because you're not part of your
[41:32.800 --> 41:37.080]  access see they control the access to the right to keep their arms and controlling
[41:37.080 --> 41:41.080]  the access means turning into a privilege and they've introduced the bill
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.880]  where they say you've got a psychological problem and remember the guy doing
[41:45.880 --> 41:49.720]  the vice presidential debates who was a CNN YouTube reporter and he holds up his
[41:49.720 --> 41:55.360]  AR-15 and the video and says vice presidential democratic candidates will
[41:55.360 --> 42:00.640]  you take my gun away and Biden just stands back and on says you're mentally ill
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.880]  no I will take your gun and the crowd of little communists goes get it then we
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.720]  can suck everything out of them because we're lazy pieces of crap oh yes oh gosh
[42:12.720 --> 42:18.520]  just let us have that guns over the degenerate parasites oh and they're
[42:18.520 --> 42:22.960]  coming they're coming he tried to introduce this and failed now he is the
[42:22.960 --> 42:29.200]  president the American family you don't deserve that right there is no right for
[42:29.200 --> 42:33.160]  you if you're on that terrorist list that should be number one in what we do
[42:33.160 --> 42:37.040]  make sure there's a full force of the law behind the Brady Bill so to all those
[42:37.040 --> 42:42.200]  who've dedicated their lives to seeing so you heard that the Brady Bill the
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.280]  instant check which is the instant registration as a gun owner with your
[42:45.280 --> 42:51.160]  address and what you got and where you're at how many guns you got there
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.280]  integrate all those lists all those databases put your psychological
[42:54.280 --> 42:57.880]  records on there they're already doing it the troops and these troops get home
[42:57.880 --> 43:02.080]  after disarming the Iraqis bring your own guns anymore and they call me up
[43:02.080 --> 43:08.040]  crying hey listen buddy you're a chump okay the battle for the republics going
[43:08.040 --> 43:12.080]  on here it know they're killing a million three hundred thousand Iraqis I
[43:12.080 --> 43:17.560]  don't care how many two doors down propaganda American warrior propaganda
[43:17.560 --> 43:22.960]  pieces they show at movie theaters you know the military isn't our military
[43:22.960 --> 43:26.960]  anymore and and they're gonna say are you for the military are you for the
[43:26.960 --> 43:31.440]  terrorists the known guns I stand with the second amendment not with our hijacked
[43:31.440 --> 43:38.360]  military I don't want to hear it they use all this phony patriotism to gut our
[43:38.360 --> 43:41.640]  country we're already in the North American Union that's high treason
[43:41.640 --> 43:46.440]  serving this criminal government means you lose your pension funds your second
[43:46.440 --> 43:50.440]  amendment you lose everything and they could steal all our money Liberty would
[43:50.440 --> 43:54.240]  let us build it back as Ron Paul said but they take the liberty folks we're
[43:54.240 --> 44:00.920]  conquered and there is no quarter these people are gonna give us sensible gun
[44:00.920 --> 44:06.480]  laws remember it's sensible gun laws police on the beat giving our kids an
[44:06.480 --> 44:10.280]  alternative to that street and making sure that we have the drug laws so
[44:10.280 --> 44:13.480]  people because those are the type of people who are made most access to most
[44:13.480 --> 44:18.200]  violent types of crimes once the cops program ended once we let those gun laws
[44:18.200 --> 44:26.280]  like a fan bands expire 40% increase in homicide rate of 35% increase in violent
[44:26.280 --> 44:33.560]  crimes total lie that's not true crime rates from the 1990s dropped
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.000]  precipitously mainly because of concealed carry which turns the right to
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.440]  a privilege but it put guns out on the streets but it created the idea of
[44:40.440 --> 44:43.360]  everybody who's able to have a gun being licensed when it was something you just
[44:43.360 --> 44:47.800]  opted into and now because the economy's been imploding for at least four years
[44:47.800 --> 44:52.160]  some violent crime has gone up and robberies have gone up because we know
[44:52.160 --> 44:56.120]  that when the economy falls apart crime goes up but the highest increases in the
[44:56.120 --> 45:02.280]  numbers he's quoting are from New York and Chicago and LA and most of it is the
[45:02.280 --> 45:08.480]  Mexican mafia and ms-13 killing each other when he uses those numbers and ms-13
[45:08.480 --> 45:12.920]  targeting blacks and killing blacks which is now even mainstream news to
[45:12.920 --> 45:17.000]  become a made member of those groups you got to go kill a black man because those
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.400]  groups really hate each other so there you have it ladies and gentlemen that
[45:22.400 --> 45:29.600]  is the score that is what is being dealt with and he's calling it reasonable
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.520]  to not have a second amendment right if they and no one will it's secret how
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.080]  they put you on the list no judge no jury no arrest no indictment no facing
[45:40.080 --> 45:47.160]  your accusers they just say and by 19 by 2007 it was 700,000 plus people with
[45:47.160 --> 45:52.520]  20 plus thousand added every month and now it's over a million people on the
[45:52.520 --> 45:59.880]  list and growing over a million people over a million people and federal
[45:59.880 --> 46:02.880]  marshals last year in the Denver Post came out senior ones and said look
[46:02.880 --> 46:06.760]  there are no terrorists out here we're ordered at the airport let us tell you
[46:06.760 --> 46:12.160]  how you get on a no-fly list one way and they you can go pull the Denver Post
[46:12.160 --> 46:19.180]  article they said if you take a picture of your children while you're in the
[46:19.180 --> 46:25.520]  gate or if you take a picture out the window you are put on a terror list for
[46:25.520 --> 46:30.240]  life that's just one way or you don't pay income taxes you're put on the list
[46:30.240 --> 46:34.800]  this is harassment this is like going to your door of your apartment you haven't
[46:34.800 --> 46:38.280]  paid so there's a big lock on it or going to your car and there's a boot on
[46:38.280 --> 46:42.120]  it because you haven't you know paid but but this is your second amendment right
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.960]  oh you haven't paid the offshore bankers and it came out again every person he's
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.280]  proposing every person for his cabinet or sub-cabinet doesn't pay income taxes
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.160]  65 plus percent that was in the news years ago of Congress doesn't and never
[46:56.160 --> 47:01.840]  pays them they just don't pay it's not they're criminals they don't follow their
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.140]  own stinking laws and so under know your customer under Patriot Act compliance
[47:07.140 --> 47:10.720]  when you buy a used car when you rent a car when you get a hotel room when you
[47:10.720 --> 47:15.120]  get a $500 loan or these check cashing places when you cash a check when you
[47:15.120 --> 47:18.880]  get a bank account when you deposit checks it's all instantly uploaded to the
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.400]  government everything is watched and it isn't even our government it's a criminal
[47:22.400 --> 47:32.040]  group that's using the government as its apparatus of control I'm gonna get more
[47:32.040 --> 47:37.120]  into this one micro vero coming up but this is it isn't a game isn't a drill
[47:37.120 --> 47:48.320]  this is the big one and they are coming at us from every single side they are
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.200]  rabid anti-second amendment anti-self-defense they are coming they
[47:53.200 --> 47:57.280]  are going to use the military against you they have built FEMA camps they are
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.320]  bankrupt and we've got to stand up in one voice and say we know your dirt bag
[48:01.320 --> 48:07.120]  criminals coming up next hour to Obama did what I told you to do is come out he
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.960]  wants bailout to but of course they're saying that will be secret and the
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.200]  Federal Reserve testified last week in Congress and said we won't tell you where
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.520]  the trillions have gone to congressman and now they want not trillions more
[48:17.520 --> 48:19.920]  because they've already got that pass where they can steal whatever they want
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.760]  it's secret this new one is to move the Federal Reserve offshore and you'll pay
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.080]  your taxes to a completely private offshore group and pay new carbon taxes
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.520]  to them and a bunch of out-of-work gangbangers are all filling up the
[48:34.520 --> 48:35.520]  military now
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.600]  oh heaven help us just heaven help us
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.120]  Reb in Colorado you're on the air go ahead
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.560]  okay let's let Reb go Mike in Wyoming you're on the air
[48:52.560 --> 48:59.000]  yes good morning Alex welcome I I tried to call last week but my
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.280]  message was this that a couple times a week you get a caller who will say well
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.320]  other than waking up my neighbors and and showing them DVDs what can I do and
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.400]  they sound very frustrated well one thing you can do is when you hear a
[49:13.400 --> 49:19.080]  major story like your story about the emergency camps the FEMA camps call the
[49:19.080 --> 49:23.320]  the congressman who sponsors it I called Elsie Hastings
[49:23.320 --> 49:27.800]  Hastings office last week and I talked to the receptionist there you know
[49:27.800 --> 49:33.320]  young girls always who I I could tell she hadn't taken any calls on this I know
[49:33.320 --> 49:36.880]  you have hundreds of thousands of listeners you know if these guys get
[49:36.880 --> 49:43.720]  deluge with with phone calls they will back off and and your crowd alone is
[49:43.720 --> 49:48.280]  is capable of doing that so you know don't sit on your hands and assume that
[49:48.280 --> 49:53.960]  someone else is calling and and complaining about these measures at
[49:53.960 --> 49:58.120]  least do that much Mike what do you think of everything that's happening I mean
[49:58.120 --> 50:01.800]  it's even worse than I predicted it's it's horrible there they're going full
[50:01.800 --> 50:09.200]  tilt buggy it is and I I talked to some of the people I work with and I show
[50:09.200 --> 50:14.840]  them articles and and they'd rather argue with me than confront the the ugly
[50:14.840 --> 50:19.240]  truth you know I'm looking at other countries but frankly where the heck do
[50:19.240 --> 50:24.120]  you go and I'm sure you've gone down the same thought trail before I mean the
[50:24.120 --> 50:28.520]  America really is the last island and yeah I could go live with my wife in
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.240]  the Philippines she's from the Philippines but you know that thought is
[50:32.240 --> 50:37.080]  not a lot attractive to me and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let these criminals
[50:37.080 --> 50:43.840]  chase me out of my own country Mike anything else you want to add no sir
[50:43.840 --> 50:49.680]  good to hear from you Mike all right ladies and gentlemen Mike's been calling
[50:49.680 --> 50:56.640]  for ten years the gun grabbers are out to get us folks there's no doubt we'll be
[50:56.640 --> 50:59.000]  right back
[51:00.120 --> 51:05.040]  the day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist

[54:12.120 --> 54:16.520]  getting into the FEMA camps the massive gun confiscation legislation
[54:16.520 --> 54:20.640]  extra judiciary without even a court they just come confiscate your guns they
[54:20.640 --> 54:26.680]  put you on a no-fly list or a criminal list and they swat team you couldn't
[54:26.680 --> 54:31.040]  make this stuff up it's actually happening so we go live simulcasting at
[54:31.040 --> 54:34.920]  prison planet on TV and T-minus five minutes Brent in Pennsylvania you're on
[54:34.920 --> 54:42.800]  the air hello mr. Jones hi I have some great news for you I Brent light have
[54:42.800 --> 54:47.880]  decided to join the info war I start my own website Brent light dot u.s. and the
[54:47.880 --> 54:51.280]  first thing you see when you go there is me giving a 25-minute speech about the
[54:51.280 --> 54:54.320]  new world order I tell field about eugenics and some of the things they're
[54:54.320 --> 54:56.960]  being forced to waste and I tell them about the federal reserve and a you
[54:56.960 --> 55:00.620]  carbon taxes when I finish off my speech by telling them about the behemian
[55:00.620 --> 55:05.240]  grove and the Shiva statue at CERN but by far the biggest contribution I'm
[55:05.240 --> 55:09.400]  making today info war is the revolution made easy it's basically a list of
[55:09.400 --> 55:13.080]  recycled advertising techniques if your listeners read through this list of
[55:13.080 --> 55:16.920]  ideas they'll be armed with a whole new arsenal weapons to fight this war and we
[55:16.920 --> 55:21.200]  need them because we're running out of time mr. Jones you're right and everybody
[55:21.200 --> 55:25.520]  needs to start websites start local radio shows start access TV shows go to
[55:25.520 --> 55:29.360]  city council hold up the legislation with mainstream articles to build FEMA
[55:29.360 --> 55:35.160]  camps for gun confiscation the media before tried to sell us on tyranny and
[55:35.160 --> 55:39.280]  the public said no so now they're just doing it and not even talking about it
[55:39.280 --> 55:45.000]  it's it's again not all good men and women need to come to the aid of their
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.120]  country right now because looting pension funds taking over nations bankrupting
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.120]  them always goes along with physical tyranny because the criminals engaging
[55:55.120 --> 56:01.600]  in the heist have to be able to protect themselves from the public absolutely
[56:01.600 --> 56:06.400]  and and see the thing is like I found out I've been talking to a lot of people
[56:06.400 --> 56:11.400]  a lot of them are you know they're smart people from you know good colleges and
[56:11.400 --> 56:17.640]  stuff and they're there's no nice way to put this there they're they're ignorant
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.720]  they want to be fools they don't want to know what's going on they were taught
[56:21.720 --> 56:26.280]  that it's cute to not care that it's cute to be stupid it's cute to be a know it
[56:26.280 --> 56:29.960]  all who's dumb as dirt that it's cute to laugh about government corruption
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.080]  because they were taught that didn't exist and now they're going to be hurt
[56:33.080 --> 56:36.760]  very badly by these criminals these criminals killed hundreds of millions of
[56:36.760 --> 56:41.000]  people last century the group running America funded the Bolsheviks funded the
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.640]  Nazis funded now they have brought down hundreds of third world countries and
[56:44.640 --> 56:49.160]  now they're doing it here I know I honestly don't know how you stay staying
[56:49.160 --> 56:54.920]  like I like this is so scary like they really are they're they're gonna we're
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.680]  all gonna be killed if we don't start advertising well they're gonna kill a lot
[56:58.680 --> 57:01.160]  of us yeah I mean you think we're the most imprisoned country in the world
[57:01.160 --> 57:04.960]  it's gonna get a lot worse good to hear from me jamming in another call let's

[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.520]  uh... www.meetup.com you can go there and if you just search for Orlando
[1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:38.080]  9-11 truth it should pop right up got it
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:41.600]  hey good to hear from you call us back in the next few days of the report on
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:45.760]  your action against the enemy if good people take action and educate the
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:48.760]  other sheep about what's going on they will be able to get away with this
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:52.220]  Mike Rivera we're about to break but i want to bring you up uh... what really
[1:02:52.220 --> 1:02:54.920]  happened dot com will be with us a little bit in the next hour
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:57.100]  open phones is a lot to talk about
[1:02:57.100 --> 1:02:59.480]  uh... today a host of issues but let's talk about
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:03.280]  the second amendment first out this is bold
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:07.600]  uh... the attack they're launching with a lot of sponsorship for bills
[1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:11.520]  and we've been holding listening psychological testing outright bands
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:14.520]  uh... anybody on the no-fly list or the criminal watch list it's over two
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:16.280]  million no-fly list over a million
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:18.000]  past that number last year
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.680]  uh... this is huge
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:23.000]  uh... mike so your take on that as we go into break
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.320]  well basically uh... this morning on what really happened dot com we have the
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:30.200]  video by ron emmanuel basically coming out and saying that anybody on the no
[1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:33.440]  fly list should not be allowed to purchase a handgun
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.800]  and outside of being an absolute violation of the second amendment the
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:41.760]  reality is that we know a lot of people on that no-fly list shouldn't be there
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:44.760]  they're there because they share a name with the terrace they've been put on
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:48.040]  there by mistake we've heard stories about even senators
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:51.560]  uh... and congressman being blocked from entering airplanes because their name
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:53.440]  somehow winds up on the list
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:57.120]  so with the credibility and accuracy of the list so much in doubt
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:00.760]  how does the government and how does ron emmanuel get off basically saying if
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:03.720]  you're on the list you're not an american and you don't deserve any of the
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:08.200]  rights anymore which is on video saying this and it is an absolute outright
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:11.920]  gun grab and that the government is afraid of the american people starting
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:14.520]  to protest the way we're seeing in europe right now
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:17.600]  but if you go back and you read the founding documents of this country the
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:21.720]  second amendment was not about hunting or sport shooting it was about making
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:27.160]  sure the american people have the means to resist government gone wrong
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:30.520]  absolutely we're gonna come back to mike revero after this quick break and get
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:31.840]  more into this
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:36.320]  uh... there's more than ten bills introduced they've got massive sponsorship
[1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:39.080]  there's hardly any mainstream news reporting on this
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:43.400]  where the attorney general outside of any courts can just ban any guns he wants
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:46.000]  they say they're gonna ban basically all semi-autos
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.880]  that's the majority of firearms
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:51.800]  uh... and uh... everybody if you have any kind of psychological issue they
[1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:55.560]  make you give over your private records even juvenile hand-owned guns the no
[1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:57.680]  fly list is a political weapon
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:01.240]  uh... they're gonna do this no judge no jury this is total tyranny

[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:52.280]  law
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:55.440]  and they're coming after the second amendment

[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.400]  they want to wear
[1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:27.080]  and then they've been floating this
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:30.200]  this is from two years ago we play the rama manual audio earlier later will
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:31.400]  play the video
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:35.440]  uh... for body watching a prison planet dot tv and folks listening on the radio
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.680]  he just says no second right for you if you're on the no-fly list if we think
[1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:39.440]  maybe
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.600]  you might be a terrorist
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:45.160]  but under the patriot act it's all misdemeanors it's it's people
[1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:48.720]  drew uh... talking back to a flight attendant it's owning marijuana
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:50.480]  no more second amendment
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:53.640]  but people are on the list and can't get off the list
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:56.920]  micro vero of what we have a dot com this is
[1:09:56.920 --> 1:09:59.040]  just just just classic
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:01.080]  extra judiciary tyranny
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:02.560]  outside the system
[1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:05.360]  and they're doing it on every front just what we're not even the president but
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:06.880]  even his designants
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:12.440]  can just say band band band or i put you on a list band band band or we decide
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:13.760]  if you can own a gun
[1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:17.400]  uh... i mean this is really happening it ties into patriot act compliance
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:21.040]  where they're saying no bank account if you haven't paid your taxes no job if you
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:22.360]  haven't paid your taxes
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:25.000]  uh... or or if you don't pay but we said
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.040]  uh... you know but then his entire cabinet turns out
[1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:31.920]  don't pay taxes i mean this is a crew of criminals
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:35.640]  yet absolutely is there's a double standard it's the do as we say don't do
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:37.280]  as we do mentality
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:39.640]  and it's almost a joke they're talking about
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:42.840]  uh... this uh... you know the the taxes are going to have to go up to cover all
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:45.440]  of this deficit spending for the stimulus package
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:48.800]  which isn't really stimulating much of anything except if you special interest
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:52.360]  and yet we're finding out all of the insiders in the upper level people
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:55.240]  they're all using these tax havens they're avoiding taxes that they're
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:56.840]  outright refusing to pay
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:10:59.760]  and relying on their political uh... connections to keep them safe from
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:00.920]  prosecution
[1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:04.560]  and it really is a very obvious hypocrisy but the bottom line is
[1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:08.200]  the u.s. government recognizes they push the american people to the edge
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:12.080]  of an outright revolt they're seeing it happen all across europe i had a uh...
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:14.960]  uh... phone call from a friend of mine in europe yesterday's is
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.960]  you are not even beginning to hear the depth of this over there in the united
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.680]  states it is far far worse
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:23.040]  that is being reported in the international media
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:27.320]  just rioting everywhere in france and iceland and and ireland now and it's
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:30.920]  just it's really out of control and the u.s. government knows it's going to be
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.600]  coming here they're trying to keep people from thinking about it
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:36.640]  that's why we're getting john bennett ramsey on the news again today
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:40.120]  after all this time they're desperate to put out something that sounds like
[1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:44.000]  news without talking about how bad the economy is and without talking about the
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:44.800]  fact that
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:48.000]  pretty much around the world people are saying enough to this
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.960]  debt-based monetary system of enslavement we're talking about uh... michael
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:54.400]  felps and he smoked some weed
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:57.880]  you know forget the bankers stealing trillions and not even paying taxes and
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:01.600]  just open corruption everywhere that doesn't matter it's it's michael felps
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:03.320]  is the news
[1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:07.520]  yeah absolutely it's just trivialization it's tabloid ism and really is it's
[1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:10.640]  just one distraction after another that's why we can never seem to get rid
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.280]  of sarah paleon in the news
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:16.120]  it's just anything they can put out there that they hope will distract us and i
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:19.920]  like to call it the conditization of the news because back in two thousand and
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:20.640]  one
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:23.480]  when the u.s. was telling every other country we're getting ready to invade
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:28.200]  afghanistan all we got in this country was gary condit and chandra levy for a
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:30.280]  week after week after week after a
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:34.600]  until boom nine eleven happens and all of a sudden we're off to war in afghanistan
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:38.240]  big surprise for the americans no surprise for anybody else
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:41.080]  you know that's a key point of nine eleven in inside job that forty four
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:43.840]  thousand u.s. troops eighteen thousand british troops
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:46.240]  masjid to jica stand is because stand
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:51.480]  in a six-month armored build up it's all over foreign news they're gonna invade
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:55.120]  and then the nine eleven magically happens so they can invade
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:59.160]  and bush signs the launch order to attack in one week on september tenth and
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:00.240]  his brother
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:04.600]  gets a bill passed to declare marshal law if they wanted to in florida
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:05.880]  they knew
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:09.440]  that it was nine eleven was going to be worse but for some reason flight ninety
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:13.600]  three didn't go into the capital or its real target they were planning federal
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:16.440]  decapitation of the government
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:19.880]  uh... well they were definitely planning on hijacking the government into a war
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:23.920]  machine and as far as flight ninety three is concerned i'm convinced that the
[1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:28.720]  crew regain control of the airplane and had it landed safely the whole story the
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.280]  whole cover-up would have been blown and that's why they had to shoot it down and
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:37.120]  we know that from high-level colonels and officers and state police who
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:40.520]  witnessed the f sixteen's in the explosion that's why it was an eight mile
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:44.440]  uh... debris field that sources the state police they try to debunk that but it
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:46.440]  we have the news articles in the videos
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:48.400]  uh... but to make a long story short
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:49.640]  yeah we know they shot
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:52.480]  to aim nines that even came out the norad tapes
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:56.600]  they fired to aim nines which are sidewinder missiles into it
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:00.000]  and uh... yeah they had to bring it down because of the whole cover-up and
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.800]  deception of this false flag
[1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:05.520]  rested on there being no survivors it's like when israel attacked us as
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:08.240]  liberty they were going to frame egypt for us
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:12.600]  and uh... sucker the u.s. into the war on israel side but the ship didn't sink
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:14.920]  and so the whole operation fell apart
[1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:17.800]  but if you're against them killing our sailors in
[1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:20.720]  most highly decorated ship in u.s. history keeping it afloat
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:23.560]  under three hours of uh... fighter bomber attack
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:26.680]  patrol boat attack torpedo blowing a thirty five-foot hole in it
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:30.560]  you're then anti america if you don't support the false flag to kill our troops
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:31.840]  because to the
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:35.480]  people running the government's patriotic to kill our troops
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:39.520]  if it serves the war cause i mean we have documents now how franklin roosevelt
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:41.600]  was saying i'm willing to sacrifice
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:45.720]  so many ships and so many men to get us into the war against
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:49.660]  and this was in the month's leading up of course to pearl harbor
[1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:53.120]  absolutely and if you expand on that i'm not defending the imperial japanese
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:56.600]  government of because they're all corrupt it's the nature of it but
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:59.400]  the flying tigers were private contractors
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:04.200]  uh... for three years before the war started attacking japanese out of china
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:07.440]  uh... and then blocking uh... their their oil shipments
[1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:10.140]  uh... and so japan kept saying why are you attacking us
[1:15:10.140 --> 1:15:13.240]  uh... they even uh... you know killed top military people
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:16.880]  uh... uh... so so the united states was already attacking japan
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:19.620]  to also elicit that attack and then order the ships
[1:15:19.620 --> 1:15:23.480]  uh... to stand down they they've been had four submarines you live in hawaii
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:27.200]  attack in the two hours before they were sinking them and getting an emergency
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:28.200]  broadcast
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:31.420]  they've won even for the coming into the harbor was only a mile outside they
[1:15:31.420 --> 1:15:35.600]  sunk it out by a reef and this is not even on cnn and even have one of the
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:38.560]  submarines that they sunk out at the frederick's bird
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:39.400]  pacific
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:44.200]  uh... war museum in frederick's bird texas one of the subs the midget subs they
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:47.440]  sunk that day and still ordered the stand down
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:50.260]  imagined subs are attacking
[1:15:50.260 --> 1:15:53.600]  and they've got ships out destroying them and then they're ordering a stand
[1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:54.640]  down is
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:58.480]  people at the base at pearl harbor saying we're under attack no no stand down
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:00.840]  stand down stand down
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:04.840]  yeah it yet you know all wars based on deception a sense who says
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:07.520]  and uh... it's interesting to know how many people
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:11.360]  wrote in their diaries that nine eleven was the twenty
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:15.760]  first century version of pearl harbor and everybody was making that connection
[1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:16.800]  and that illusion
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.720]  and the bottom line is that pearl harbor there was a lot of deception about that
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.520]  uh... we now know that
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:25.840]  uh... fdr deliberately go to japan into the attack
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:29.360]  and then tried to pretend it was a big surprise we know there were no torpedoes
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:30.560]  in the gulf of tonkin
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:34.280]  we know that there was no spanish mind that blew up the u s s main just time
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:38.760]  and time again there's an incident it turned into a cause for war and right
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:43.280]  now today we're seeing this previous push for new war in iran because every
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:47.000]  time the u s gets into an economic mess they get out of it by getting into a
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.120]  world war and i think that's what's on everybody's mind right now if they can
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:55.040]  kick up a new world war starting in the mitties that everybody's economic
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:58.240]  problems will go away or at least nobody will talk about them because it's
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:16:59.520]  unpatriotic
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:02.200]  well that's what the rand corporation said three months ago and made big
[1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:05.520]  european news it's confirmed that was never on the news here they said
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:08.720]  this is the top think tank advising the trilateral commission cfr for those
[1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:09.560]  that don't know
[1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:12.120]  they said we've got to have something on a world war level
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:15.560]  but not to get us out of trouble to get the people to stand down in false
[1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:16.600]  patriotism
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:19.280]  while the foreign banks takeover while we
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:23.320]  uh... are losing our homes and that's what obama saying it's going to get tough
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:24.520]  austerity
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:28.440]  stick together stick together means us losing our jobs losing our pensions
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:31.480]  while the bankers set up world government on the corpse of the united
[1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:33.000]  states
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.560]  and uh... it really is silly because globalism got us into this mess and
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:40.920]  saying that globalism can get us out that's like saying that if we whack the
[1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:44.320]  front of the titanic against the other side of the iceberg that maybe we can
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:46.160]  save the ship
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:49.880]  that's what i thought is really uh... this weekend i watch hours on c-span
[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:51.400]  stuck in a hotel room
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:54.880]  uh... watch hours of c-span of davos
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:57.800]  and they would just repeat the same thing like parents
[1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:00.440]  they have these panels of prime ministers and presidents and leaders
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:04.960]  and it was all globalism new world order only globalism will fix this problem
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:06.880]  this is worldwide crises
[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:10.840]  this is a worldwide economic takedown by design they got this global grid in
[1:18:10.840 --> 1:18:12.320]  place as they said they would
[1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:14.680]  in their own documents to implode things
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:17.960]  and then now they're posing as the saviors
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:21.200]  well every time i hear the word globalism i keep reminding myself that
[1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:25.160]  globalism is what alexander the great wanted
[1:18:25.160 --> 1:18:27.720]  hitler wanted it's what napoleon wanted
[1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:30.960]  and it's never worked out well for the ordinary people when somebody starts
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:33.760]  thinking i should run the whole planet
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:36.080]  well you're right uh...
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:39.080]  you know i don't have a lot of optimism but
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:42.560]  these guys are so bold i it looks like they've gone to the point of return
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:47.400]  regardless it looks like they're gonna go ahead and press for total turning
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:51.040]  well they're certainly pushing for it as as you say they've gone too far they
[1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:52.760]  can't turn around and turn back
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:56.680]  whether they can achieve it or not i don't know i am very buoyed by the
[1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:59.160]  events of europe where we're seeing all these riots
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:01.480]  the government of iceland has had to step down
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:05.560]  i am amazed that we are not seeing those kind of riots here in the u.s. yet
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:07.560]  although with california now being broke
[1:19:07.560 --> 1:19:10.160]  and cutting off the welfare payments i think that may
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:11.560]  certainly start
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:14.640]  uh... we used to joke all the time about the government putting tranquilizers in
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:17.240]  the drinking water i'm kind of wondering if uh...
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:20.400]  uh... you know given the amounts of pharmaceuticals that are known to be in
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:23.600]  the tap water if there isn't some element of truth there because i don't
[1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:27.560]  understand why the american people are not showing more anger at this point
[1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:31.040]  well you know they've done studies where there's water supplies that aren't
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:32.800]  connected to sewage
[1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:34.560]  and they still have
[1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:37.840]  levels way off the charts of prozac
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:41.040]  uh... molecules certainly have taken a bit of class
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:45.480]  and did you know that on the news they propose putting prozac in the water and
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:47.240]  statins for heart
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:48.960]  so uh... mike it's
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:50.000]  already going on
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.240]  every major waters apply in the country

[1:19:56.560 --> 1:20:02.400]  runoff so they are putting drugs in the water

[1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:21.560]  want to open the phones up coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:27.840]  microbarrow riding shotgun a little bit in the next hour with us there's a lot
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:31.280]  of other important news I want to go over where they the bottom line for
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:35.640]  everybody out there realizes this the nature of what we're facing with the
[1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:41.680]  criminal globalist is so real and so over the top that I want to stress to you
[1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:46.040]  that it is far worse than we can even explain to you they are engaging in
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:50.840]  economic warfare against all of us they have passed the point of our return they
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:54.920]  are believing their momentum and just the over-the-top savageness of what
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:24:57.440]  they're doing is going to carry them through they are racing to bring in
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:02.400]  military you know illegal aliens criminals felons into the military they
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:06.320]  are racing to bring in private mercenaries and domestic armies and I
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:10.600]  want to go over that because as you know Mike Rivera we wrote a story about it
[1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:14.240]  info wars dot net last Friday Defense Department announces civilian
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:18.080]  expeditionary force they're going to be joint trained for domestic operations and
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:21.640]  foreign operations that will not be combat and then they're going to
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:26.480]  integrate this in this is the Defense Department 1404.10 and integrates into
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:30.320]  the FEMA camp bill they've introduced saying the clergy will be there telling
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:34.720]  the public it's safe to go in to turn their guns in I mean they're really
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:41.400]  making their move with a huge mechanism to to carry this out but I mean if I
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:46.040]  don't see it working Mike well I have to agree with you I know they're making the
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:49.880]  plans and they're moving forward with it but some of these people seem very very
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:54.760]  detached from reality and I get this the sense that because so many old cold war
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:59.640]  fossils are in charge of these operations they just don't get how the world has
[1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:02.760]  changed around them because of the blogs and the internet websites like yours
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:06.960]  and mine alternative radio like this they really I think have an over-exaggerated
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:11.720]  sense of their own success and I think ultimately it's doomed to failure sadly I
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:15.520]  think a lot of people are going to get hurt in the process and it'll always be
[1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:22.040]  the wrong people the innocent will die and but really I I I do think they can't
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:27.280]  pull it off because we have seen this time and time again and I like go back
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:30.880]  to the words of Gandhi who said sometimes tyrants can seem to be
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:35.360]  incredibly powerful but they always fall in the end and he was absolutely right
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:42.440]  about that in this case I think the fact that they had to delay because of the
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:47.000]  Iran Contra scandal and because the first attempt to bomb the world trade
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:51.520]  towers did not produce the desired result I think they delayed longer than they
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:54.880]  really felt they they could handle because of the deteriorating economy
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:59.680]  and as I said before right now everyone perceives globalism is the reason the
[1:26:59.680 --> 1:27:03.440]  entire world is in this economic mess it's going to be a tough sell saying
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:09.080]  that globalism will get us out as far as and so in her Barack Obama this rock
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:13.600]  star the full media gets behind him saying he will fix it trying to use him
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:17.520]  as a foil or a front for what they're doing behind the scenes I think in the
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:21.440]  final equation we're doing a Barack Obama a favor admitting and you know
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:24.680]  that he's just a puppet and then he's got all these globalist controlling him
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:28.120]  because if we can get out of the political left right diversion and get
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:32.560]  past him to the real power behind the scenes we can unify the people will
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:36.920]  they be successful though using him as to sucker the public I don't think so at
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:39.960]  this point I think this has to be the shortest political honeymoon on record
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:43.280]  he's only into the second week of the job and already pretty much everybody
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:47.960]  even those his most ardent supporters are saying there is no change that we can
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:52.280]  believe in it's the same old stuff I'm already calling him the token president
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:56.200]  not because of his skin color but because everything he does in line with his
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:28:00.040]  campaign promises it's a token amount he was going to cut defense spending it
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:03.520]  was a token amount he was going to end torture he did the token measure of
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:07.240]  closing Guantanamo but those prisoners are still other places and still being
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:11.040]  abused he was going to end the war but it's a token troop cut now they're
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:14.920]  talking about even abandoning the 16 month promise to get our kids home so
[1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:19.120]  there is no change it's just more the same and yes Barack Obama is just the
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.680]  frontman it's the same old faces he's got the Clinton cabinet Clinton light if
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:27.000]  you want to call him behind him and certainly having Rahm Emanuel there is
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.680]  chief of staff in the White House is a very very dangerous sign regarding
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:35.160]  Israel's control over our government it was in the New York Times that Rahm
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:38.960]  Emanuel he was cracking his knuckles in the congressional meeting with
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:42.880]  congressional leadership with Obama there and and he said please Rahm that
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:45.880]  you know that's distracting don't do that because you know he's got this
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:49.240]  decorum you know he you know he is a gentleman has a lot of dignity the
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:53.840]  projects and Rahm got up in Barack's ear in front of the leaders of Congress and
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:58.120]  popped his knuckles in his ear and said I'll do whatever I want and then they
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:01.640]  put that in the New York Times and giggle about it with a headline the second
[1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:05.800]  most powerful man in America I mean he did that to let Congress know I run
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:11.600]  things yeah that was definitely a very defiant thing if I had been Barack Obama
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:15.480]  in that situation Rahm would have been fired right there on the spot and if
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:20.800]  Barack Obama does not move to establish or assert his control over the White
[1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:25.920]  House process then he's basically he's already crippled for the rest of his
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:29.400]  administration for any business owner imagine you got 10 employees around you
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:32.240]  to conference table one of his popular knuckles you say please stop that and
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:36.600]  they get up in your ear and pop it here you'd be like you're fired and any other
[1:29:36.600 --> 1:29:40.600]  president the whole staff kisses up to him not happening it's in the news that
[1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:44.760]  Rahm bosses Barack Obama around in front of everybody he's doing that let
[1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:48.720]  everybody know he is the president and he's not even an American ladies and
[1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:51.840]  gentlemen he's an IDF soldier his father one of the founders of massage we're on

[1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:25.040]  know when I'm stuck in prison and time keeps dragging on but that's rain keeps
[1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:35.640]  rolling on down to San Antonio all right let's go back to my brother oh like I
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:38.280]  want to go to some calls here in a few minutes but I want to run through and get
[1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:48.000]  your great great political expertise take on it um we see this pattern when
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.720]  they propose a national compulsory service 18 to 24 and they also say when
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:55.400]  you're in high school you'll have to serve compulsory government federal
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:34:01.400]  service openly federal curriculum under the brand name Barack Obama so now the
[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:04.720]  covert federalizations opening up they've introduced legislation that's
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:08.640]  rapidly moving to congress to federalize college security under homeland
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:12.840]  security so they're grabbing more and more enclaves of federal control they're
[1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:15.480]  announcing they're gonna grab more highways and make them international
[1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:18.680]  zones for taxation they're now announcing they're gonna continue the
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:22.600]  North American Union but when they come out with national compulsory service
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:26.680]  they always give it a nice front or package they say oh well it's national
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:30.600]  compulsory soup kitchens you gotta help but then it's also tattletale squads and
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:36.120]  military and and and environmental squads and the rest of it other areas
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:39.360]  you've noticed about how they're packaging things whether using modern
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:42.760]  marketing because i am seeing the dinosaurs realize they're behind the
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:48.520]  curve and i think i see a newer management team more dangerous coming in
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:52.600]  under obama so i think that edge we had where they were still in delusional
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:56.200]  la la land i think we're starting to lose that now we had all that time to
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:35:00.760]  build up our forces and and and the globalists are starting to you know get
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:04.720]  in some trouble in my opinion but uh... don't you see them modernizing their
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:06.320]  propaganda
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:09.880]  yeah i see them uh... getting into uh... some new marketing strategies but
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:13.680]  the reality is and and you can know this from advertising history
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:19.080]  uh... once your audience or once your customers are skeptical of the product
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:23.840]  if it was changing advertising is seldom going to work i mean uh... look at
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:27.600]  uh... new coke versus classic coke look at the end so
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:31.320]  uh... i mean history is full of all of these disasters of good products that
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:34.880]  got a bad rep and then no advertising could save them
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:38.520]  i know at execs don't like to admit that but that really is the truth
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:42.360]  the bottom line here is that government operates like a religion it relies on
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:44.160]  the faith of the masses
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:48.120]  in order to function and we've already had our crisis of faith we don't trust
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:52.200]  the government we know the government like to us about sedams nuclear bombs
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:56.440]  so all the new packaging and blitz and glamour and and confetti
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:35:59.120]  i don't think it's going to really sway a lot of people
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:02.200]  uh... we we know we've got a government that is lying to us we know a
[1:36:02.200 --> 1:36:05.960]  government is acting unconstitutionally this whole civilian
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:09.840]  workforce thing is a violation of the thirteenth amendment against involuntary
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:10.920]  servitude
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:15.160]  so if the american people are going to be just wrapping it in a new uh... shiny
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:20.320]  packages and going to change it is still the same old manure inside
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:25.120]  i agree with you on another issue i saw this this morning and didn't have time
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:28.960]  to go pull up the sources but the people want to check them out and i'm
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:31.640]  i know you're really up to speed on this i can really exact
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:32.960]  name
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:36.200]  of the military plans from nineteen eighty three
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:38.240]  re-propose in ninety four
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:39.760]  then i saw it
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:44.000]  uh... in nineteen ninety golf war planning by the pentagon
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:48.280]  adopted from israel but israel first proposed in eighty three eighty four
[1:36:48.280 --> 1:36:51.680]  one of their top generals proposed that it was in their white papers
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:55.840]  i did find doing some research this morning a bunch of top israeli rabbis
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:58.120]  saying in and on their own websites
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:01.000]  uh... groups in israel the greater israel
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.920]  where it runs from where israel is today basically as a triangle
[1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:07.520]  all the way over to the straight of our moves
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:10.720]  uh... taking over that key waterway and grabbing about eighty percent of what
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:12.200]  is iraq today
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.840]  about forty percent of saudi arabia
[1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:19.000]  i should have brought that up guys google greater israel
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:20.720]  just put up the photos
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:24.240]  uh... oh you can't get my couple that computer will find it printed up so so
[1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:24.920]  we can't
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:26.920]  pull up images right now
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:30.680]  period all we can on that computer okay good find it and i'll show you which
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:31.280]  one
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:33.760]  and because i mean this is an official with he brought on it
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:35.040]  this is really going on
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:36.840]  a larger israel
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:38.600]  and in that same plan
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:41.800]  several plans that the dot by the pentagon you just google this is no
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:43.440]  time to run out this morning
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:47.680]  uh... because i've done research previously but i wanted to have it here
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:50.720]  uh... because i noticed that uh... wayne madson
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:52.280]  wrote an article about
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:54.600]  uh... how israel saying they want to start
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:59.800]  creating settlements through courage who are jewish
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:01.200]  i did print this morning here
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:03.480]  here's the he brought a map of it
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:06.160]  you guys can give me a close up over there all show folks
[1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:07.720]  of greater israel
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:10.640]  and the plan is to break iraq
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:15.240]  in three parts break syria in four parts break iran in five to seven
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:17.640]  parts and i've even heard this on npr so
[1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:20.040]  so it is out there
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:23.800]  so here you have what is originally israel
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:25.520]  they want to grab part of egypt
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:28.240]  grab part of saudi arabia grab a bunch of iraq
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:30.480]  all the way over here to the straight of hormush
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:32.440]  and then even grab some of the waterway
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:35.880]  uh... there and and and this is being proposed by the israeli military
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:37.360]  was a research again
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:41.480]  can see it there and the iraq invasion was just about oil weapons sales
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:45.400]  uh... but about population control they're trying to bring in eugenics now
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:47.400]  in iraq where you can have more than two children
[1:38:47.400 --> 1:38:49.280]  proposing that now in our media
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:51.240]  was watching a lot of tv this weekend saw
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:53.400]  them attacking a woman who had eight babies
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:55.960]  you know the doctor admitted that they usually implant
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:38:57.720]  eight made up in only two or three
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:01.600]  take hold they were saying how evil she is should the children be taken away
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:04.840]  having more than two children is evil it hurts the earth it hurts our economy
[1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:07.440]  and really it's the future of our economy all these baby boomers
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:10.000]  uh... who are retiring but they want to replace the that with their role
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:11.040]  populations
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:12.640]  uh... being brought in
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:14.760]  so so that's a big set up there mike
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:16.600]  uh... but but but the point is
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:18.800]  uh... greater israel
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:21.480]  uh... about uh... thirty forty times bigger
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:24.840]  uh... that is now this really is been proposed
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:26.040]  uh... by israel
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:27.840]  as i want to pick your brain
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:31.120]  do you remember the name of the israeli reports uh... in eighty three eighty four
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:33.840]  and then the adoption of that by the u s in ninety
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:36.280]  uh... and then your comments on it
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:40.160]  okay i actually don't recall the exact name of the picture absolutely correct
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:42.640]  israel's plan all along has been for a much
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:47.120]  wider area of uh... that part of the world to be considered israel
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:51.200]  and the two stripes on the flag of israel represent the nile and you
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:52.440]  fray's rivers
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:54.760]  which according to their religious
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:56.040]  uh... beliefs
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:01.040]  uh... comprise the land that god gave to the twelve tribes that followed moses
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:02.240]  out of egypt
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:06.360]  and so they see everything that they do in terms of grabbing more land as
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:09.880]  justified because in their minds they already own it
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:12.640]  anyway and there was a very interesting article came out over the weekend that
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:15.120]  said one of the reasons there is so much support
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:16.840]  for operation cast lead
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:20.720]  in israel is because the israeli government and media
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:24.960]  are already portraying to the israeli people that this is israel land
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:28.680]  that is involved in gaza in the west bank they're not saying it's palestine or
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:29.760]  occupied territories
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:33.200]  they're already saying this is israel in those palestinians are just living on
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:34.400]  our land
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:37.920]  and uh... you know again this last weekend they're talking about their
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:40.160]  starting to build settlements in iraq
[1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:43.760]  and uh... my advice to the people of iraq is take a look at what happened when
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:48.040]  they start old started building settlements in the west bank and gaza
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:52.080]  and that is your future unless you put your foot down now and say you know
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:53.520]  absolutely not
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:56.400]  because it's just going to keep on spreading and there's going to be more
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:40:57.040]  war
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:00.400]  and more death and we the american people are going to be forced to pay for it
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:01.160]  all
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:03.080]  yeah for those that don't know
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:05.200]  here's a crude map
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:06.400]  of israel
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:08.240]  in nineteen
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:09.400]  forty
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:10.720]  seven
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:14.680]  there were some tiny settlements
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:18.360]  uh... that the israelis had moved into it basically look like that
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:21.320]  gave those little circles are where you had israeli enclaves
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:25.240]  then law and this is on record uh... led by the chief of staff of the white
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:26.760]  house's father
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:29.960]  as the com one of the commanders they launched attacks into all the arab
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:31.280]  settlements
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:34.000]  around them
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:38.280]  pushing most of them out of the country bombing going in and shooting up
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:41.320]  uh... the different bazaar is the different uh... grocery stores the
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:43.600]  different markets
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:45.040]  and then
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:47.520]  if you look at the map today
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:51.640]  because of the pushing the people out
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:54.960]  you know by the nineteen fifties it was this and by the nineteen sixties
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:57.800]  it was this and now today
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:01.400]  and all you have is a few little
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:05.240]  tiny spots
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:07.480]  now there's a map of greater israel
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:08.320]  uh...
[1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:11.840]  that's one of the bigger ones but the but the government of israeli groups have
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:12.480]  put out
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:13.200]  these
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:14.040]  to where
[1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:17.080]  for the Arabs are in just a few tiny
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:18.880]  tiny little pockets
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:22.160]  and all and so so the settlements are sent out as
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:24.320]  as as like probe droids
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:27.040]  and then and then they expand out from their mike you want to explain this
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:30.280]  because israel israeli papers and that's a different article about it
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:32.280]  and in the source a lot of them on
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:35.120]  uh... people are all i don't believe this but i've i've just over and over
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:37.040]  and see this israeli newspapers
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:40.520]  and i've i've read and i did pull up some of their religious leaders saying it
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:43.000]  this morning maybe you should want to your great what really happened
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.960]  data pages which is all the mainline proof
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:48.760]  of this because a lot of people are in denial
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:50.560]  about this and and
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:54.000]  uh... imagine the war we've already seen
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.760]  uh... that israel tries to expand out and take over iraq and saudi and large
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:42:59.040]  parts of Saudi arabia
[1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:00.720]  what's gonna happen
[1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:04.360]  well you know it's it's easy to see and i do have a data page like that i'll put
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:06.720]  it up on my website as soon as i'm off the air with you
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.920]  but uh... what's going on of course is that israel gets other people to do the
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:12.240]  conquering for them
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:16.800]  i mean they're moving into iraq now but it was american men and american women
[1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:18.400]  and american tax dollars
[1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:22.440]  that paid to smash iraq so that israel can start moving into it
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:25.000]  and now they're getting ready to repeat the same thing in iran and they're
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.480]  using the same lines about nuclear weapons
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:31.160]  and all what a danger iran is and everybody's going to attack iran and
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:35.840]  once iran is shattered and smashed you can see the same thing israel will start
[1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:38.240]  setting up settlements inside iran
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:41.480]  with the goal of taking it all over and it is
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:46.240]  conquest and it goes all the way back to the Torah the old testament
[1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:50.000]  god wants us to go out and smite the wicked and take over their lands
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.440]  and it's being done here in the twenty first century with modern warfare and
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:56.080]  israel gets american
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:01.160]  kids to die for israel's war and that has got to stop and is it this also just
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:03.040]  classic colonialism
[1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:07.120]  where where a group comes in and then just start setting up settlements and
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:08.680]  expanding
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:12.080]  that it is classic colonialism and more than that
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:14.440]  israel has done to palestine
[1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:18.560]  what hitler tried to do to poland and france and the whole world got together
[1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:20.800]  and told hitler you can't do that
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.200]  and yet for some reason when israel does it to palestine nobody dares say
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:27.400]  anything
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:31.920]  well i mean plus i mean this isn't good for for jews
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:34.520]  i mean to have all the herbs in the world hating them
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:38.040]  i mean look at the conflict we've already seen in israel and it's in the
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:40.640]  united states in israel just get more and more hated
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:41.920]  and we're bankrupt
[1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:43.960]  and everything's falling apart
[1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:48.200]  and all the establishment seems want to do is launch even bigger wars
[1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:50.640]  and and and which shocks me is israel's on record
[1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:53.200]  saying they want to expand out
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:54.080]  and
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:57.240]  then if you talk about it people deny it's even going on so
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:44:59.680]  uh... i've done all this research in the past i'm gonna pull a bunch of this
[1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:01.560]  together this week i know you are as well
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:03.880]  and i'm gonna come into a presentation on this
[1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:05.320]  uh... because uh...
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:07.520]  i mean if you think we got wars now folks
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:08.760]  imagine
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:10.920]  imagine a map like this
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:13.720]  i mean it it it it's just hard for me to
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:15.560]  hard for me to deal with and hard for me to
[1:45:15.560 --> 1:45:17.840]  even get my mind around this
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:20.560]  all the calls in a moment like can you stay with us about twenty minutes the
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:21.600]  next hour
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:22.520]  uh... certainly
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:24.960]  okay because we start taking calls about five minutes enough
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:26.200]  only a time for those
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:28.040]  uh... obama
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:31.560]  he spearhead from a manual they bragged as the architect of the bailout that's
[1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:33.480]  in mangy polo sees on words
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:35.360]  uh... romney architect
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:37.720]  uh... of course he's a frontman for the big banks
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:41.360]  they're coming in they've already got an unlimited blank check
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:46.000]  to steal any amount of money they want congress is even allowed to look into it
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.360]  is not a congressional hearings of the federal services will tell you where the
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:49.520]  money went
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:54.200]  now the new bailout will create this new international bank with no oversight
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:58.160]  with the power and regulatory power over u.s. banks so they can come in and
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:00.880]  snatch up the real banks and insurance companies
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:04.320]  uh... how and then last week obama was on tv
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:06.520]  was watch this in my hotel room friday night
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:10.600]  angry going out there the people in the bailout steal this money for bonuses i
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:12.720]  want investigation with a name no names
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:14.880]  i mean this is like the fox caught with
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:16.080]  with with the
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:17.160]  feathers
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:21.240]  uh... of the pigeons of the feathers of the chickens sticking out of its mouth
[1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:24.160]  and it's going i'm gonna do something about this with chicken blood all over its
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:24.920]  chest
[1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:27.400]  you know it's got a bit on a knife and fork
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:29.960]  and there's dead chickens laying around or it's got a chicken in its mouth
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:30.680]  because
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:34.200]  i'm gonna do something about that darn fox i mean do they think the public is
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:36.400]  that dumb so your analysis of
[1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:38.920]  uh... this new banker takeover
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:42.200]  well yes unfortunately they do think the public is that done
[1:46:42.200 --> 1:46:46.000]  as far as this new bank this new global bank it's just another river reserve
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.640]  system it's another debt-based institution
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:51.320]  it's like the federal reserve on steroids
[1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:54.320]  and again this is what got us into this mess
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:57.960]  and we need to get away from this imaginary money economy
[1:46:57.960 --> 1:47:01.600]  and get back to a monetary system like we had when the country was set up
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:05.720]  which was a fixed unit of value is represented by every single dollar
[1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:09.800]  dollar originally meant a weight measure of silver something that had a fixed
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:13.320]  intrinsic value and on the basis of that monetary system
[1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:15.800]  the united states built the highest standard of living
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:18.120]  in the first hundred some odd years of its history
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:22.160]  then in nineteen thirteen we get changed over to this debt-based economy
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:23.760]  the federal reserve system
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:27.000]  over the course of the next couple of decades they wipe out any alternative
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:28.440]  forms of economy
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:30.960]  including up to injure on kennedy tried to start
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:32.880]  an alternative currency system
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:36.240]  and as a result of this debt-based economy everyone talks about where did
[1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:38.440]  the money go it never existed
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:42.120]  because most of what they're counting is interest that's owed on the money that
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:46.240]  was already printed up but we don't have the new borrowers to borrow the new
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:51.200]  money created to pay back that imaginary uh... run up on interest and then you've
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.600]  got the derivative situation the problem is the money never existed it's all
[1:47:55.600 --> 1:47:59.680]  bookkeeping rules and regulations that are designed to convince you that you've
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:03.160]  got to spend the rest of your life working your guts out for the bankers
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:06.280]  and i want to add from eighteen hundred
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:09.480]  uh... until nineteen thirteen
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:10.920]  this country
[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:14.960]  had money that was worth the same amount and in some cases
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:17.760]  uh... it even uh... lost
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:19.600]  actually gain some of its value or
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:20.960]  lost inflation
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:21.800]  so
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:23.240]  that means
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:27.000]  the inflation tax conservative lead about fifteen percent a year right now
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  is such an incredible form
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.080]  of theft and such a
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:36.200]  such a blight over the uh... convention of savings
[1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:39.800]  initial add that in this is on record me a volume written congressional
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:40.920]  testimony on this
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:43.240]  the private sent bankers that wanted to
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:45.360]  bankrupt the u.s. they could hijack it
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:48.920]  and set up a central bank they tried to bankrupt the united states from the
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:50.200]  eighteen nineties
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:53.880]  right into nineteen thirteen they had all these runs on banks they staged all
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:55.480]  these golden silver runs
[1:48:55.480 --> 1:48:58.680]  and then they advertise for decades in their battle plans are even public how
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:48:59.360]  they did it
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:01.920]  bought up the newspaper so they could then propaganda is
[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:05.400]  and said we'll never have another recession or depression again
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:08.440]  and before those were just localized only in certain industries are certain
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:10.080]  areas they weren't nationwide
[1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:12.560]  so it wasn't a big deal to the average person
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:15.920]  they said let us have central control never have a depression again
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:19.480]  then they accelerated the money supply nineteen thirteen they bought real
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:21.360]  assets with it and then popped
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:22.760]  the uh...
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:26.200]  bubble they engineered this is on record by design in twenty nine
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:30.080]  and so they do the same thing then they give us an income tax then they give us
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:34.000]  the federal control they expand their power and now they're making a move much
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.760]  bigger but globally this time
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:40.120]  and i think the globe is rebelling against that and that's the real
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:42.560]  underlying reason between these rides in greece
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:46.400]  and iceland and ireland and france and all these other places where people
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:49.160]  standing up and saying they recognize
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:52.640]  what's going on they've seen the guy behind the curtain they realize it's all
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:57.960]  a scam that's designed to reduce them to being indentured servants for the rest
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:49:58.840]  of their life
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:02.120]  and they're fighting back against it and i as i said i don't understand why
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:04.560]  we're not seeing it here in the u.s. yet
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:07.440]  well mike i can pull up the mainstream news articles i'm sure you've seen them
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:10.520]  where they propose putting serotonin re uptake inhibitors
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:12.600]  or the pros that class of drugs
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:15.320]  which are also fluoride based for those that don't know
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:17.320]  uh... in the water supply
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:19.960]  they just manipulate the fluoride uh... molecule for the scientists we've
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:20.920]  interviewed
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:23.000]  uh... and so
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:26.320]  uh... when for some reason there are much higher levels of these drugs in
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:28.440]  water supplies where it shouldn't even be there
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:30.040]  you know these are water supplies many of them
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:33.000]  i've seen the articles where they're there isn't runoff from sewage
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:36.760]  from humans you know putting in the sewage system so why is it there in
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:40.080]  high levels mike you think an easter bunny put it there
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:43.840]  well i'm not sure but i know you can't go in and examine the water systems
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:45.560]  these days
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:48.560]  government loves us don't they
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:51.800]  they really care about us a lot folks to drink lots of tap water
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:55.520]  you see all the tv ads saying drink tap water it's safe it's good
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:58.120]  they also tell you corn syrup's good
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:01.320]  it's filled with mercury of course
[1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:05.480]  this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back
[1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:09.560]  on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future
[1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:13.160]  in these troubled times one of the most important things your family can have

[1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:08.360]  all right let's go right back into this transmission ladies and gentlemen
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:12.280]  you know i mentioned that 90 percent of baby formula
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:16.280]  melamine that attacks their brains and kidneys and every other organ
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:19.640]  i mentioned this a week and a half ago i got emails not believing it it's in
[1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:23.240]  hundreds of publications study finds high fructose corn syrup contains
[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:28.520]  mercury half of 55 popular brand-name foods breads
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:33.160]  cookies everything with high fructose corn syrup has mercury in it
[1:54:33.160 --> 1:54:36.360]  and they don't know why because it's not involved in the manufacturing at any
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:39.880]  point it's being added ladies and gentlemen
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:43.240]  they have found it is the ultimate chemical weapon heavy metal
[1:54:43.240 --> 1:54:47.240]  because other heavy metals just create plaques mercury continues to kill
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:50.680]  see the movie alien when it drips the acid just keeps burning through the
[1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:53.080]  hull of the ship that's what it does electrochemically
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:56.840]  bam bam bam bam chain reaction just keeps killing keeps killing keeps
[1:54:56.840 --> 1:55:00.440]  killing your brain damaged i'm brain damaged i would have been
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:05.000]  genius level i'm just average intelligence i have chemical lobotomy
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  and i'm not joking when i say that this is chemical warfare we have it in the
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:12.120]  u n zone documents we have it from top globalist
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:16.040]  80 90 years ago saying they were going to do this and as scary as it sounds
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:19.720]  microvera why does what a half the brand names have high levels of mercury in them
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:22.520]  when it's not even supposed to be there mike is just the i mean again is an
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:27.080]  easter bunny putting it in there well it is a mystery why that's going on and
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:30.920]  mercury is a very contraindicated if you've ever heard the expression mad as
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:34.600]  a hatter from the allison wonderland books it's actually
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:39.720]  based on on a real fact which was that hat makers would use mercury to prepare
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:44.120]  the felt to make hats and over time it would drive them insane
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:48.280]  and so uh... mental illness just sort of became synonymous
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:52.280]  with being a milliner and we get mad as a hatter from that so when we find
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:56.120]  mercury is being put into products like the the big stink over mercury based
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:59.960]  preservatives in vaccines and a possible link to autism
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:04.120]  and you know the companies like to use it because it's it solves their immediate
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  problems economically uh... and the long-term problems are somebody else's
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:12.040]  uh... issue to have to deal with and certainly we know that our u s government
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:16.920]  has absolutely abandoned it's uh... former role of keeping an eye on our
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:20.920]  health and safety from uh... risks from the products that we're getting from
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:23.960]  the corporations and now we have uh... the the the
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:27.160]  pharmaceutical companies are building the government labs that the national
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:30.600]  cancer institute is using g i wonder if we're going to get some objective
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:34.520]  analysis and reports on the efficacy of these drugs
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:36.840]  we're gonna come back and start going directly to everybody that's holding
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:40.280]  mark bill michael dan davin others told her number to join us eight hundred
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:44.760]  two five nine nine two three one uh... forgot six folks a lot of people at six
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:47.960]  months are given their baby sugar fruit juice drinks
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:51.480]  that that uh... has fructose corn syrup
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:55.160]  even if you don't care about yourself and you want to say that
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:56:59.640]  that that mercury isn't in at least the half of the products that have it it's
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:04.440]  in thousands of products at least care about your children mercury is not good
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:08.280]  for your children it is deadly poison and attacks their brains
[1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:12.040]  and so that's another big reason we're seeing autism go up so high
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:16.840]  but you look at the amish no known cases in illinois where they did a study a
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:19.560]  university study of over two hundred thousand amish
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:25.160]  over a decade no cases of it because they don't eat corn syrup
[1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:31.240]  they don't take vaccines it's a fact ladies and gentlemen you do not
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:36.360]  want mercury in your brain microvera absolutely it's highly toxic
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:40.840]  and again we have seen such recklessness with products being put out on the
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:43.400]  market and i remember you were mentioning melamine before
[1:57:43.400 --> 1:57:46.520]  when it was a big stink when it was showing up in these chinese products
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:50.040]  and then all of a sudden it turned up in american manufactured baby food products
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:54.040]  and uh... the uh... fda consensus oh well we've changed our mind and certain
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:58.040]  amounts are acceptable and safe and coincidentally the safe level was set
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:00.920]  just above what all the american manufacturers were using
[1:58:00.920 --> 1:58:03.720]  and it turned out the american manufacturers they're dying tens of
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:07.160]  thousands in hospitals tens of thousands you know in hospitals
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:10.920]  thousands dying and then here they just say oh we're even worse than china but
[1:58:10.920 --> 1:58:15.400]  it's now good for you dying is good
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:17.800]  talk about mad as a hatter i think people running things are mad as
[1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:21.640]  hatters mike i think they're drunk on their power
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:24.920]  well i mean it's the ultimate psycho power trip
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:29.240]  what does the uh... joker do in the first batman movie puts poison
[1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:33.240]  in the cosmetics and in the food see the
[1:58:33.240 --> 1:58:36.200]  and then they say just like the gulf of tonkin in that movie
[1:58:36.200 --> 1:58:42.760]  throwing in your face in hollywood we'll be right back with microvera

[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:47.560]  which will put out more than all human activity in history each one but
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:51.240]  we'll get into that with micro arrow later as well uh... mark in canada you're
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:55.560]  on the air welcome thanks for taking my call alex thanks for calling
[2:00:55.560 --> 2:01:00.360]  okay a couple of things i just uh... want your listeners to hear and uh...
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:03.800]  then i'll get into it uh... first off here in canada
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:07.000]  i've seen only uh... one time where they've announced that uh... we've
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.400]  already got one guy in british columbia
[2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:14.440]  who has uh... the avian bird flu and they've already destroyed
[2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:19.800]  about eighty thousand turkeys and chickens for farms across british columbia
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:24.120]  now i'm going to get into what i believe are three important dates that
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:26.040]  everybody needs to look into
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:31.160]  february ten which is the date that uh... hr four zero four zero goes into
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:36.120]  effect february seventeen which is when the united
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:39.480]  states is going to switch from analog to digital
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:43.240]  and february nineteen is when barack obama is coming to canada
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:47.080]  i believe that these are pieces to a puzzle i've put together
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:52.120]  simply when you switch over from analog to digital it serves two purposes
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:56.120]  one it frees up the analog signal for the rescue squad
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:02:00.120]  the police and the firemen to have more bandwidth
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:04.280]  and i believe it's also a way to track everybody through the rfid chip
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:08.440]  because analog signals go through radio frequency goes through walls
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:13.000]  and buildings and in the digital signal you can hide
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:16.600]  subliminal messages to keep the sheep asleep well that's been admitted with a
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:20.280]  sub with i mean it's all very effective in old television
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:22.520]  i just don't like to
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:26.520]  i mean i'll look at a pattern like massing u.s. troops around afghanistan
[2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:28.920]  the news introducing obama
[2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:31.840]  you know is the savior you know years ago
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:34.200]  you'll see things like that and be able to trend it
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:37.760]  but looking at dates i see this over and over again people putting dates on
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:38.560]  things
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:40.840]  you know july twenty-fifth i went on air and said they're going to attack the
[2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:43.000]  world trade center and i'm gonna blame it on
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:46.040]  uh... on uh... some of the line
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:49.000]  and i was able to go on air and say the next few months i believe
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.240]  this is going to happen call the white house tell them don't do it
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:53.000]  but i couldn't put dates on it
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.800]  uh... microbarrow you want to comment on this
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:59.560]  yeah it's it's very hard to put dates on it because usually when people are
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:03.520]  planning these kinds of covert operations whether it's nine eleven or
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:05.120]  various assassinations
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:08.520]  uh... they'll put the plans in place and then they'll wait for an opportune
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:11.480]  moment or what they think is an opportune moment very often
[2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:14.440]  it'll be like the night before the day before they'll say yeah we're going to
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:15.400]  go tomorrow
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:19.720]  and so it's it's really rather hard to say a particularly given date
[2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:21.560]  is when something is going to happen
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:23.080]  we know that
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:26.840]  the uh... u s government is probably considering some kind of a false flag
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:29.080]  attack to kick off a new war with iran
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:32.600]  we just don't know when it's going to happen one of the frustrating things
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:34.920]  about fighting against war itself
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:38.600]  is you never know when you've won only when you fail
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:40.840]  absolutely and at the same time
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:44.360]  the fact that nine eleven truth is so huge international the fact that
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:47.560]  it's now in the mental meme in lexicon
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:51.880]  uh... it's now in the dictionary in a false flag stage terror
[2:03:51.880 --> 2:03:55.520]  self-inflicted wound that has damaged their tool but there's other false
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:03:57.960]  flags economic false flags were in one now
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:03:59.640]  an economic nine eleven
[2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:04.320]  the bio attack i do believe is one of the chief things they can claim it
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:07.960]  you know incidentally accidentally that it came from pigs or sheep or cows or
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:09.160]  chickens or goats
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:13.200]  and and and then still will be the government that organizes that
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:16.640]  and uses that to control take the foot mouth release
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:17.800]  in two thousand
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:20.520]  that took over uh... most the cows and and and sheep and
[2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:23.480]  the government killed him uh... in england those that weren't even infected
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:26.760]  it turned out the government release that it was a weaponized form
[2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:28.400]  then they said it was an accident
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:32.240]  we don't know how it got out of the level four bioweapons lab mike
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:35.480]  well we know that the anthrax sent with the anthrax letters was also
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:40.560]  weaponized anthrax from a u.s. lab it wasn't from the mideast at all
[2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:44.200]  and they denied that but now they've been forced to admit that
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:47.000]  we were right again thank you caller appreciate the call watch those dates
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  though
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:48.880]  uh...

[2:08:17.720 --> 2:08:23.300]  by the way I just thought of this is Rob reminded me I was watching Super Bowl
[2:08:23.300 --> 2:08:32.200]  ads in the airport before I flew back Sunday and it's Alec Baldwin talking
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:35.600]  about how the TV set by design has destroyed half your brain cells is
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:38.920]  going to destroy the other half he goes I'm also a reptoid alien ruling the
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:44.960]  earth so it's in a direct attack on David Ike and then another rad and again I
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:50.360]  was sitting there 30 minutes in pregame stuff at the airport so I that's all I
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:55.360]  saw another one about high fructose corn syrup it's so good for you nutritious
[2:08:55.360 --> 2:08:59.560]  there's lying conspiracy theorists that say it isn't good doesn't matter if
[2:08:59.560 --> 2:09:04.160]  literally hundreds of studies show that the way its molecules is on it's not
[2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:08.000]  like regular sugar it goes into the liver that metabolizes it and the body
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:15.280]  then doesn't say I'm full yet you're still hungry so that's one reason they
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:21.080]  put it in things not just that it's cheap but it makes you eat more and it
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:25.080]  also has been directly linked in a bunch of studies and diabetes it fries your
[2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:30.080]  body it's it's it's it's it's chemically extracted and manufactured and then
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:33.960]  carried around these big tankers on the trains and it's put in most foods now
[2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:36.400]  that are processed along with everything else the MSG the other
[2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:40.040]  excitotoxins aspartame is in most candies that aren't even sugar-free they
[2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:43.120]  just add it look on the back of your gum or your candy they're putting it in
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:48.080]  candy bars now chocolate bars they know what it does they know people won't eat
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:51.320]  it now but we were saying no to diet coke which is a drug by the way an
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:55.680]  excitotoxin so they're moving on to other things and now they're running TV ads
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:10:00.640]  going on it's people are lying about it it's really good Mike that shows we're
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:04.400]  having an effect on them that there's all these ads on TV now about how
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:08.480]  wonderful vaccines are and how it's alive they're not good for you and and
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:13.200]  how it doesn't cause autism I'm at this shows they're really getting desperate
[2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:17.160]  aren't they yeah absolutely it does there's a new show out called the
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:21.700]  Beast starring Patrick Swayze and in one of their first episodes they had a 9
[2:10:21.700 --> 2:10:26.720]  11 truth activists but they portrayed him as just as completely wackle bananas
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:30.560]  character and it's just part of that general smearing but yeah they're
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:34.800]  absolutely afraid they're losing their grip on the minds of America and so yeah
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:38.640]  it's going to be demonization and smearing and all they're doing is they're
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:42.800]  raising people's awareness because it's the band in Boston effect people are
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:46.320]  going to start tuning into the websites and say you know I want to find out what
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:50.720]  all the fuss is about there you know a role in Emmerich's new film 2012
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:55.960]  apparently Woody Harrelson is playing a radio show host who's always predicting
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:59.440]  disaster in doom and he says he's got the curse of Cassandra on him and I'm
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:03.120]  getting emails from people saying that it sounds like this Woody Harrelson
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:08.000]  character is based either on you or on me and you know I'm waiting to see whether
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.800]  he'll be treated as a serious character or if they're just going to make him a
[2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:13.920]  goofball you know I actually was in a movie scanner darkly with Woody
[2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:19.560]  Harrelson and he is on out with him a lot he is totally anti-new-world order he
[2:11:19.560 --> 2:11:23.160]  knows all about the globalist he knows all about how the government ships the
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:29.800]  narcotics in he's very very smart and he gave me his card this is how not into
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:33.240]  stars I am said it back then I didn't realize how important it was to have
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:36.040]  him on there because it really gets the buzz going people then tune in to see
[2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:41.080]  what the deal is I don't know where the card is Chuck Norris gave me his number
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:46.440]  and an email I last night woke up and went my god Chuck Norris gave me his
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:49.960]  contact I never even gave it to the producer and I got up in the middle of
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:53.880]  the night went and dug out the book and got you know not the producer contact
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:57.840]  the publicist but found it so I've got to remember to use all these contacts and
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:05.040]  but but side issue from Chuck Norris the point is is that Woody Harrelson is
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:10.280]  completely and totally anti-new-world order and I need somebody call me with
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:13.800]  his best contact in Maui I guess I could call Willie Nelson but I don't like
[2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:17.880]  calling him and bugging him for phone numbers I had Woody Harrelson's number
[2:12:17.880 --> 2:12:22.200]  then I was contacted about a year ago by his office saying are you in
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:26.600]  California some of they thought I lived there can you come see Woody and then
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:29.640]  when I called back a day later they said oh yeah no he had to go to something
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:34.120]  else I never really tracked it down but I don't have time to network with these
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:38.720]  people but it's important so I need to reach out to Woody Harrelson is the
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:44.840]  point of the rant well to get back to the media coverage yeah they're they're
[2:12:44.840 --> 2:12:49.720]  very nervous they're very scared they see the poll numbers indicating that
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:53.400]  America has lost faith in the corporate media they're turning to the
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:12:56.240]  alternative media because they want to go where they think they're gonna find the
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:01.240]  truth and certainly looking at my numbers they continue to go up your
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:04.400]  numbers continue to go up and yet every day we hear about traditional
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:08.480]  newspapers having to let people go cut back there on their editions we're here
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:13.480]  TV TV news programs are losing their audience the trend is definitely there
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:20.640]  and as as the media gets into this survival mode I expect we're gonna see a
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:24.920]  lot of just outright bashing and attacks and smears coming from their side of
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:29.040]  the room also they're admitting in a lot of policy reports we've covered here
[2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:33.000]  with the internet to and they have the internet to consortium admits they have
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:36.840]  a plan to shut down the old web force us on to a controlled web I want to get to
[2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:41.240]  that after calls let's don't go to bill in Iowa bill you're on the air with
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:47.800]  micro vero welcome yeah thank you for taking my call two brilliant minds
[2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:56.880]  together small town by a lot oh by the way I'm a long-time
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:06.200]  listener and a TV member and I have been doing my homework we migrated up here
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:12.040]  from Lake Charles Louisiana because of my work and since we lived I've been
[2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:17.680]  living here I go to city council meetings and I've been sharing your DVDs
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:23.800]  and material and get a lot of people around here to kind of wake up a little
[2:14:23.800 --> 2:14:32.280]  bit and I actually probably 50% of the homes in this little town had Ron Paul
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:38.920]  signs in their yard during the primary anyway about the second amendment I have
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:49.360]  a small collection I don't whatever you have a president that can't prove
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:56.200]  citizenship that to me that obliterates the Constitution to start with and I'm
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:01.280]  a very passionate in what I believe in and I believe in the Constitution of the
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:07.160]  United States and I'm prepared to defend that to the end to give me liberty or
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:13.040]  give me death now besides that I have a very important question years ago in
[2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:20.280]  2004 you had a guest on your show his name was retired Colonel Don D. Grand
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:25.640]  Prix yes and I listened to that interview and I was highly impressed I
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:32.280]  even that he had the transcript on your website and I printed that out and he
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:39.600]  said wasn't he a member of the joint chief of staff at one time he was
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:49.040]  assigned to it okay he said that 70% that he he was in communication on a
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:56.080]  weekly basis with friends of his that work in the Pentagon and he said that
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:16:04.600]  70 I believe it was 70% of the highest ranking military people were on our side
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:13.880]  and he believed that they were going to have like the counter counter coup
[2:16:13.880 --> 2:16:17.600]  d'etat is how he put it but it didn't look like listen I appreciate your call
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.480]  is that your question yes I'm wondering what happened to that and another thing
[2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:29.000]  is it just blows my mind there that there is no that seems to me like there
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:35.360]  is some people in the military higher ups with some integrity now I hear you

[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:50.480]  want to get into his things he told me privately he didn't say don't tell
[2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:55.040]  people but I don't like it in people's medical problems he was in serious
[2:16:55.040 --> 2:17:02.160]  medical trouble four or five years ago and couldn't come back on then I talked

[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:57.200]  closely as I'd like to so sadly no yeah he was a guy a lot of it flushed down
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:18:00.400]  who named the name of the pilot who shot down 93 and did say there was an
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:05.080]  order to shoot it down and so he got it all that let's go to another caller
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:09.120]  here let's talk to Michael in mass Michael you're on the air
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:15.520]  yeah I was going guys good go ahead well we're talking about the great shift
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:20.160]  that appears to be happening in Western society and I wanted to read you guys a
[2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:25.880]  quote going all the way back to the 30s it was in William Shiver's Berlin diary
[2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:31.560]  he was an American journalist in Berlin during the during the Nazi takeover and
[2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:36.400]  he was talking to somebody right rise and fall the third right yeah that was his
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:41.440]  big work yeah go ahead and this is incredible he's he's he's talking to a
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:45.880]  man whose parents were German but he was an American here's a character here goes
[2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:49.440]  by the way he also wrote about them putting floor on the water but go ahead
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:54.640]  oh he sure did we discussed the German conception of ethics honor conduct said
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:19:00.280]  he quote for German for Germans a thing is right ethical honorable if it squares
[2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:04.160]  with the tradition of what a German thinks a German should do or if it
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:08.600]  advances the interests of Germanism or Germany but the Germans have no abstract
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:13.560]  idea of ethics or honor or right conduct and quote he gave a pretty illustration
[2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:18.840]  a German friend said to him isn't it terrible what the Finns are doing taking
[2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:25.280]  on Russia it's utterly wrong when mr. W remonstrated that after all the Finns
[2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:29.360]  are only doing what you would expect all decent Germans to do if they got in the
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:34.120]  same fix namely defending their liberty and independence against wants and
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:39.080]  aggression stand over here this quote we come back to finish the quote up or
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:43.880]  recap it and we'll get Mike Roberto's take with you and then go to more phone

[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:38.560]  capitalism or was Jefferson correct when he said a central bank issuing a
[2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:41.920]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a

[2:24:37.800 --> 2:24:49.320]  Michael's asked me during the break what my numbers were if I could give
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:55.200]  them spent phone on prozac and other drugs in the water in Hawaii what I know
[2:24:55.200 --> 2:25:08.120]  is over the years we have seen government reports where the cities won't
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:13.040]  even let private groups test it and even try to block other state agencies from
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:18.680]  testing water supplies and I've seen different numbers the AP does a report
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:24.000]  every year of just hundreds and hundreds of us cities with massive amounts of
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:28.400]  prozac riddling birth hormones from the birth control pills but in a lot of
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:33.440]  cities you go pull these up they found water supplies not connected to water
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:38.040]  treatment or you know not toilet to tap where you don't have sewage involved in
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:42.120]  the water cycle so it shouldn't be there and it's there you can pull that up but
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:46.240]  it is interesting Mike isn't it yeah it really is and one of the reasons I was
[2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:51.680]  asking about Hawaii is there's a long history of government experimentation
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:55.280]  here in the islands because we're so remote from the mainland if something
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:00.280]  goes really bad they figure you know it's it's isolated a lot of people don't
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:04.080]  realize this but Agent Orange the Vietnam era defoliate was actually
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:08.120]  developed here at the University of Hawaii and tested there are still parts
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:11.120]  of the big island that are completely defoliated you can't go in there because
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:14.440]  it's so toxic and there were some bad accidents and a couple of students
[2:26:14.440 --> 2:26:19.200]  apparently died during that whole thing so anytime we hear about the
[2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:23.920]  government is testing x y z i have to wonder is it being done out here
[2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:26.120]  absolutely let's go to some calls
[2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:29.760]  uh... michael and masher on the air with microvaro
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:32.840]  he has a going on actually the guy who's reading that quote um...
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:37.360]  i was going to spend a few years on a real quick about mister sure go ahead
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:40.640]  yeah he he you know they were talking about it in the context of the fins
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:44.280]  repelling the attack of the russians who at the time was germany's friend
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:48.520]  and uh... but the last seconds uh... the last sentence in this is
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:49.680]  in other words
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:53.840]  for a germany to defend his country's liberty and independence is right
[2:26:53.840 --> 2:26:56.880]  for a fin to do the same is wrong
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:01.720]  because it disturbs germany's relations with russia the abstract idea there is
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:05.120]  missing in the german mentality apply this to today
[2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:10.120]  people think it's okay to basically turn iraq into a parking lot because
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:12.360]  we're fighting for freedom
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:13.840]  it's double-think
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:17.660]  yep it's we're allowed to torture but they're not
[2:27:17.660 --> 2:27:21.280]  our politicians are allowed to not pay taxes but the citizens have to
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:23.400]  it's double-think microvaro
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:25.840]  absolutely it's a blatant double standard
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:28.800]  and they were there what they're trying to do is to make the interests of the
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:29.520]  state
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:31.520]  become the new morality
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:35.560]  instead of saying it's wrong to kill it's wrong to steal it's wrong to cover
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:39.880]  by neighbors property the new morality is it's okay to steal if it's if it's for
[2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:43.600]  the country it's okay to murder if it's for your country it's bad for the other
[2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:44.480]  people to do it
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:45.880]  but it's okay for us to do it
[2:27:45.880 --> 2:27:49.520]  we have never seen that more blatantly demonstrated in israel's attitude toward
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:53.920]  its immediate neighbors in the middle east
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:55.000]  you know where
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:56.160]  any more comments
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:27:58.040]  that no i was just going to say
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:03.000]  mike you hit the nail on the head that it is is exactly what i was getting to
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:03.880]  is that
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:06.880]  it just like alex is talking about and i'm sure he's going to talk about this
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:07.800]  new film
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:11.440]  they are really evolving this thing into obama worship i mean
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:13.320]  if we start to
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:18.000]  basically ascribe our morality in terms of what's best for the nation
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:21.280]  you know it's going to justify a lot of horrible things for which the
[2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:23.360]  infrastructure is
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:27.920]  ready in place and that's another that's another lie in the system
[2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:31.240]  we're not doing all these evil things
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:34.360]  the american people we're paying for the empire where
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:36.280]  the losing our liberties
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:38.920]  being a center of an empire is always one of the worst
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:40.080]  places to be
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:43.840]  so there's another good old boys go yeah we're in there for the oil so what
[2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:47.200]  you know them dirty iraqis don't deserve it we're good
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:49.840]  don't they understand that they're not going to be getting that oil even if
[2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:51.360]  they were an immoral person
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:54.120]  this elite is getting rid of our sovereignty
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:55.800]  they're getting running i have
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:57.000]  articles
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:00.200]  where they're now announcing that the california pension funds are bankrupt
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:01.720]  people to start to get their money
[2:29:01.720 --> 2:29:03.800]  the globalist have alluded everything

[2:29:06.920 --> 2:29:08.460]  that that they were going to do great
[2:29:08.460 --> 2:29:11.680]  in the end he decried the german people mike
[2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:15.160]  yeah we saw the same thing in russia understaffed and all the the russian
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:18.440]  people who supported him in his rise to power he turned on them and double
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:21.120]  cross we call them all useful idiots
[2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:24.560]  and uh... you know tyrants have no respect for the people who support look

[2:30:05.160 --> 2:30:09.160]  in a ph balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly
[2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:12.840]  acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise
[2:30:12.840 --> 2:30:16.320]  ph balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health
[2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:20.200]  as well as prevention of disease people who alkalis the water they drink

[2:30:27.960 --> 2:30:28.600]  of life
[2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:32.840]  most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an
[2:30:32.840 --> 2:30:34.120]  alkaline environment
[2:30:34.120 --> 2:30:37.680]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis

[2:31:07.920 --> 2:31:13.160]  what to do at least we thought we did truth rising as a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:31:13.160 --> 2:31:17.040]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story
[2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:20.840]  Whitman E.P.A. director

[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:04.520]  more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:07.960]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking
[2:32:07.960 --> 2:32:11.640]  hot showers than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are
[2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:15.000]  inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  the kdf dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water

[2:33:35.080 --> 2:33:39.720]  and uh mike this is also important subject to the pre-interview i've been
[2:33:39.720 --> 2:33:43.880]  on hold for quite some time uh is anyone there yet familiar with
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:50.920]  the uh new hampshire house of concurrent resolution number six
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:55.480]  it's as close to uh article succession that i've seen
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:34:00.120]  um it's also been uh recommended by the states of massachusetts new york north
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:04.600]  carolina road island in virginia basically basically
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:07.960]  information uh they are drawing a line in the sand
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:11.400]  as far as i understand here there are six articles at the bottom
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:14.920]  um many of those being further infringement to the right to keep and
[2:34:14.920 --> 2:34:19.720]  bear arms including prohibition uh prohibiting the type and quantity of
[2:34:19.720 --> 2:34:22.600]  arms and ammunition any act regarding religion for the
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:25.960]  limitations of freedom political speech and for the limitations of the freedom
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:29.400]  of the press and it goes on uh enforcing
[2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:32.760]  martial law without the general consensus state legislator
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:36.760]  uh basically let me stop you let me stop you i'm not aware of this i'm not
[2:34:36.760 --> 2:34:39.880]  omnipresent uh specifically i know that
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:43.960]  new hampshire invoked right to revolt article 10 i mean i'm aware of the
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:47.640]  article i just know they invoked it article 10 had been invoked
[2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:51.960]  in the month before 9 11 they were going to have a state convention
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:54.760]  on september 12th i'm not saying they carried out the attack
[2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:59.240]  uh because of that um because there are these cities and counties themselves
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:04.280]  can uh make the state secede that's originally in there the states are
[2:35:04.280 --> 2:35:08.680]  on top of the federal government they claim that the civil war decided that
[2:35:08.680 --> 2:35:11.560]  for the feds but the feds are completely illegitimate and rolled by
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:14.680]  offshore banks through a corporate takeover specifically you're saying
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:18.040]  this is article six where and what are they saying
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:22.680]  just google hcr six and it'll be the first thing that comes up it just came
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:25.640]  out yesterday at house concurrent resolution
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:30.040]  six yes okay house concurrent resolution six in the in the in the
[2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:35.800]  in new hampshire yes 2009 session it's uh now now has this been introduced or is
[2:35:35.800 --> 2:35:38.280]  this gotten sponsors and being brought forward
[2:35:38.280 --> 2:35:42.360]  it's sponsored by several representatives and senator denly
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:46.520]  uh the house concurrent resolution of firm states rights based on jeffersonian
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:50.840]  principle okay i'm going to get these state reps on immediately
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:53.800]  uh so house concurrent resolution six new hampshire
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:57.320]  and we'll call all the sponsors you'll probably hear them here uh tomorrow in
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:00.200]  fact we just found it we're going to punch it up on screen here in just a
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:02.840]  moment thank you thank you for calling with that info
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:07.320]  micro vero your take on this yeah i had heard of this because i am from new
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:10.360]  hampshire originally and uh basically all of these
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:12.760]  resolutions and we're seeing a lot of them start up now
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:16.120]  they're all reaffirmations of the declaration of independence
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:19.960]  and the very principles by which this country threw out the last government
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:23.160]  and said we're going to be a new nation that is founded on these principles of
[2:36:23.160 --> 2:36:26.040]  freedom freedom of speech freedom to be armed
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:29.960]  and uh they are largely symbolic at this point
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:34.360]  but as we get to a situation with a serious economic crisis
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:37.720]  there is real discussion out there about secession we have an independent
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:41.080]  movement here in hawaii um which is founded on the fact
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:45.240]  that hawaii statehood is not legal to begin with and so i would think that as
[2:36:45.240 --> 2:36:49.160]  we saw with the fall of roam as the central government bankrupts itself the
[2:36:49.160 --> 2:36:52.840]  outlying provinces or in this case states start to break away and assert
[2:36:52.840 --> 2:36:55.640]  their independence and i think ultimately that's what we're going to see
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:36:58.760]  happen in the united states i want to be clear i'm for the union
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.800]  but it isn't a union we have to break apart first
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:06.360]  to come back together give the people so choose because the globalist
[2:37:06.360 --> 2:37:10.360]  as they did in china 150 years ago the same system here
[2:37:10.360 --> 2:37:12.920]  starting with phony drugs they you know shipped in to then break down the
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:18.040]  society that's mainline history they're going to break us up that's what
[2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:22.760]  globalism is they merge larger units in the continental
[2:37:22.760 --> 2:37:26.360]  unions to then break up and destroy the sovereignty
[2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:30.920]  of the original units into smaller parts through balkanization so
[2:37:30.920 --> 2:37:35.480]  we've got to break apart ourselves if we're ever going to reconstitute
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:39.000]  the republic and i can't see how hawaii couldn't break away
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:43.160]  what that was less than you know a hundred years ago that they killed a
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:46.200]  bunch of the royal family and i mean you live there tell folks briefly the
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:49.960]  story about that well basically uh... the united states
[2:37:49.960 --> 2:37:53.320]  illegally annexed hawaii during the spanish-american war
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:57.000]  and in 1993 president bill clinton signed a public law of apology
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:00.680]  acknowledging that the hawaiian people had never really surrendered their
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:05.720]  national sovereignty so technically on paper there is still a nation of hawaii
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:09.080]  there are several groups arguing over who should be in charge of it
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:13.000]  uh... but the bottom line is that were there to be a major economic upheaval
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.720]  on the mainland there's a very strong movement
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:19.560]  uh... not necessarily to succeed because they're not acknowledging that
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:22.200]  statehood is uh... legal to begin with but there's
[2:38:22.200 --> 2:38:26.200]  certainly a strong independence movement here in hawaii
[2:38:26.200 --> 2:38:28.840]  absolutely a great call sir appreciate
[2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:31.880]  uh... you calling in uh... with information down quickly
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:34.600]  uh... dave in florida than micah new york and let might go
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:37.400]  now go ahead david on the air
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:41.240]  yeah uh... hey i just want to follow up on that what that uh...
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:45.160]  about these gun bills uh...
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:47.360]  i think it was a uh...
[2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:51.480]  confusion earlier when they were saying that alcy haystings had introduced
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:53.720]  hr forty five
[2:38:53.720 --> 2:38:57.320]  uh... it looks like it was bobby rush
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:58.800]  from uh...
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:00.160]  i bet you can guess
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:02.840]  from district one in uh... illinois
[2:39:02.840 --> 2:39:04.840]  well i did see
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:07.680]  name on the bill when i covered it last week
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:09.480]  i think that was the uh...
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:13.440]  that was the uh... fema camp but well here's the deal i this is a problem i
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:16.760]  can't keep track of it all your right fema camp bill you're right

[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:37.160]  uh... so we got to be careful about this but yes he introduced the fema camp

[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:58.360]  people need to call them
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:39:59.520]  so we were right
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:04.080]  then another caller called in and said here's his number on the gun bill

[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:14.040]  haystings and if you look at this guy bobby rush you just wonder you know
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:16.240]  where do they come up with this stuff
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:18.600]  and that congressman yesterday said
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:22.800]  you know he he had no new lc
[2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:23.680]  your

[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:34.320]  he knew that
[2:40:34.320 --> 2:40:37.560]  you know that he was really dirty and they had a lot of stuff on him and they
[2:40:37.560 --> 2:40:40.600]  said they could get him to introduce anything
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:44.480]  you know and what i just want to tell you i think everybody use that word
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:46.760]  they so much you know
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:51.040]  who if we talk to me and well let me tell you that he's let me tell you i
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:52.920]  appreciate the call to let mike go in a moment
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:55.000]  when we'll comment on this
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:58.600]  they is the military industrial complex it's the big lobbying interest that are
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:00.320]  all in support of globalism
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:03.960]  they combine their forces together to buy off government to remove the checks
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:07.280]  and balances from the people remove our power over the system
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:10.760]  and give it to themselves so they can use governments to shut down their
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:14.120]  political competition their economic their industrial
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:16.200]  uh... their their scientific competition
[2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:20.520]  and so they can extract more more well from the people and social engineer us
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:22.400]  so that's who they are
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:25.240]  and yesterday i listed a bunch of trilateral commission people in obama's
[2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:26.080]  could
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:29.120]  uh... administration and who were neocons and things so
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:31.400]  we are listing who they are
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:34.600]  but if all we did was list they there's what we had rough cop that
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:37.280]  wrote the book superclass he says there's six thousand globalist
[2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:39.200]  run everything they want world government
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:42.280]  he was here it's in the new york times there they are
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:44.920]  that's two questions i'm gonna let mike go
[2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:47.440]  a
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:49.560]  you know who are they and then be
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:52.840]  why are they suddenly in hundreds of newspapers a week
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:56.120]  going on with american unions the answer to the crises
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:59.480]  all you know what uh... fema camps are the answer to all of this you know why
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:03.520]  are they now admitting what they denied so long those two questions might
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:07.280]  well they obviously is the little click if you remember back in high school
[2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:10.000]  there was always the click of beautiful rich people
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:13.160]  who sort of got away with everything and look down on everyone else
[2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:16.440]  well it's the same thing only grown up and now they're in congress and now
[2:42:16.440 --> 2:42:18.360]  they're in the media now they're basically
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:22.560]  all working together to basically as you said extract real wealth from the
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:23.720]  ordinary people
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:27.080]  as for the reason why they're going public with it right about now i think
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:29.440]  it goes back to what you said earlier in the show
[2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:32.120]  there's a degree of panic they're beginning to recognize
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:35.760]  they don't have the iron grip on the minds of america that they thought they
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:38.280]  did once before so now they're having to come up
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:40.240]  it's a pitch it's a sales pitch
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:43.560]  they're out here trying to sell us that these are really good things to do
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:44.880]  and like i said before
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:48.080]  the public is aware globalism goddess into this mess
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:50.080]  selling globalism is the cure all
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:53.320]  that's a really really tough sell and they're pushing it as hard as they can
[2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:55.080]  and it really is a war between
[2:42:55.080 --> 2:43:00.440]  they and their advertising p r agencies and we who have the truth on our side
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:04.360]  and the first one to quit loses
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.360]  and that's it mike
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:09.600]  they denied all this while they were building it
[2:43:09.600 --> 2:43:12.640]  but with the alternative media we expose the architecture
[2:43:12.640 --> 2:43:15.680]  as it was being uh... developed
[2:43:15.680 --> 2:43:18.920]  now the people are aware of it so they're forced to go ahead and admit it's
[2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:19.840]  all true
[2:43:19.840 --> 2:43:22.200]  but put a spin on it that it will save you
[2:43:22.200 --> 2:43:25.520]  from the economic collapse of people go wait a minute
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:27.640]  you're the ones that get all this
[2:43:27.640 --> 2:43:30.880]  and you promise the last bailout would fix it
[2:43:30.880 --> 2:43:33.440]  and they'll probably pass another one another one in the end and announce
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:36.200]  themselves to be emperors but then everybody will see through it that
[2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:39.240]  they're a bunch of illegitimate criminals then what happens
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:42.160]  well war on the streets and they think their military
[2:43:42.160 --> 2:43:44.880]  is going to be able to carry this out a lot of military police are going to go
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:45.760]  along with this
[2:43:45.760 --> 2:43:49.000]  even if their thoughts some of them are not going to like their what happens
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:50.880]  when they go up against the american people
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:54.800]  and they're not going to want to show up to work
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:43:57.920]  well that's not working so far in europe because those protesters they've
[2:43:57.920 --> 2:44:00.880]  already pulled on the government of iceland and uh... some of these other
[2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:04.040]  governments like greets there in serious serious trouble right now
[2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:07.520]  and uh... i think the same thing is going to happen here
[2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:09.680]  how do you stop the shark teeth effect
[2:44:09.680 --> 2:44:13.240]  we've seen in argentina and nigeria and places where the globalist have done
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:13.880]  this
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:16.280]  you know declassified it's admitted
[2:44:16.280 --> 2:44:18.920]  bring their economies down economically consolidate
[2:44:18.920 --> 2:44:20.320]  and then you'll see
[2:44:20.320 --> 2:44:22.840]  five prime minister six seven presidents
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:26.080]  in one year as the people figure out no he's a public it really
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:28.880]  no he's a public it really no he's a public it really
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:32.280]  and then finally the government's are just insolvent but still the private
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:34.040]  banks now on the infrastructure
[2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:36.480]  and they have police forces machine guns guarding it
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:39.720]  and the country just sinks into the mud but the globalist then on the
[2:44:39.720 --> 2:44:42.160]  pile of down
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:45.280]  well that if you go back and you look at the history of the french revolution
[2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:49.480]  uh... they talk about the revolution but they were actually a series of
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:52.840]  several revolutions as the same thing each new government that came in
[2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:55.600]  proved it was just as corrupt as the previous one
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:59.200]  they were brought down and kicked out and ultimately in the french revolution
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:02.880]  the bankers were brought down with the royal families at the same time
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:05.760]  and they basically restarted their economy and their government from
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:06.640]  scratch
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:09.120]  and i think that's what's going to happen here in the u.s i think ultimately
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:11.400]  the federal reserve has to be gotten rid of
[2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:14.680]  we need to go back to the monetary system that we had when we founded this
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:15.400]  country
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:20.320]  which is a monetary system based on units of value rather than units of death
[2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:22.160]  all right mike amazing
[2:45:22.160 --> 2:45:24.240]  interview today i really want to thank you

[2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:34.480]  and i really appreciate you spending time with us take care
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:35.800]  my pleasure
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:37.600]  there he goes folks what really happened
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:38.720]  dot com
[2:45:38.720 --> 2:45:43.400]  all right uh... we've got an hour and fourteen minutes left
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:47.680]  in the transmission time today
[2:45:47.680 --> 2:45:51.800]  and i i i i didn't get to a bunch of news articles that i saw yesterday about
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:54.080]  how
[2:45:54.080 --> 2:45:56.720]  they're saying we shouldn't be able to have more than two children there should
[2:45:56.720 --> 2:46:00.400]  be tax incentives to only have one but if you have more than two you get fines
[2:46:00.400 --> 2:46:02.080]  and fees put on
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:04.800]  that
[2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:07.200]  is how they started the one child policy in china
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:09.600]  started in nineteen seventy four
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:12.880]  uh... with the treaty with the united states in the i'm at world bank
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:14.720]  who paid the communist chinese
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:17.480]  to institute they put fines on you
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:18.840]  and harassed you
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:20.720]  if you had more than one child
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:22.640]  then in nineteen eighty it became wall
[2:46:22.640 --> 2:46:25.000]  now i've told you for years are going to propose this
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.800]  now i watched a lot of uh...
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:30.440]  television this weekend i was a rarely do
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:33.400]  and on show after show after show after show
[2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:37.120]  new shows they would demonize people with more than one or two children
[2:46:37.120 --> 2:46:40.960]  i mean uh... there's a whole new level it was just that it was everything was
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:42.880]  propaganda
[2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:44.920]  i saw cnn say
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:46.720]  mean everything's propaganda
[2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:50.160]  there was another election iraq and finally women got a chance to vote for
[2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:51.840]  the first time
[2:46:51.840 --> 2:46:54.000]  well a it wasn't the first time i've had a chance to vote
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:55.120]  and be
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:59.760]  should i was saying had more women graduating from colleges doctors and
[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:01.000]  lawyers and scientists
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:03.200]  the men around sixty percent
[2:47:03.200 --> 2:47:07.560]  uh... was said on the same was trying to stop religious muslims from having
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:09.600]  women basically cover themselves up
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:13.840]  said on the same wanted to empower women i'm not defending said on the same
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:15.760]  the point here is
[2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:19.520]  the globalist created the guy he actually though wanted to progress his
[2:47:19.520 --> 2:47:20.280]  country
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:22.280]  that was making it first world
[2:47:22.280 --> 2:47:24.340]  and that's why he had to be stopped so
[2:47:24.340 --> 2:47:27.920]  again the idea is to back up the war it was out the war is going great less
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:30.000]  killing very little violence at the elections
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:33.440]  and women get to vote now
[2:47:33.440 --> 2:47:36.360]  implying that women never had rights women now
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:37.760]  have less rights
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:41.680]  because they put the religious people in control over there
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:45.320]  which is what the globalist always do they over through iran for that
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:46.200]  they
[2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:47.840]  don't
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:50.000]  secular governments they don't
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.440]  them the the the muslims the arabs the the the persons they want to build
[2:47:54.440 --> 2:47:58.000]  giant hotels they want to build giant resort they want to build giant factories
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:01.840]  they're smart they're just as smart as people in the west folks
[2:48:01.840 --> 2:48:03.600]  it's a smart
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:05.200]  they want to live
[2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:07.560]  the british
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:10.200]  it's the story of laurence arabia that movies true
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:13.120]  that movies historical that's a historic film
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:14.960]  it's nonfiction
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:18.040]  they went and they found a group of rag tag
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:19.320]  uh... uh...
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:20.360]  better one
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:22.480]  i'm not attacking the battle was just a fact
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:25.680]  and they hired them and gave a machine guns and hand grenades
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:27.960]  and had them go over throw the governments and then they set up the

[3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:50.760]  and they list what the feds are doing and what they're moving ahead with so
[3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:54.600]  the states are rallying the people are waking up shame on texas
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:00:58.520]  shame on arizona shame on places like vermont they claim they're so pro second
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:03.160]  amendment gun owners are delusional going my guns are fine but rock says
[3:01:03.160 --> 3:01:06.360]  as they introduce the bills to ban every semi-auto
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:09.720]  to make you be federally licensed psychological federal testing
[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:16.840]  by fiat they can just claim that uh you've got a psychological problem i mean
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:19.880]  this is the end and earlier we played rama manual i'm gonna play that again
[3:01:19.880 --> 3:01:23.160]  later because we just played the audio earlier before we were simulcasting at
[3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:28.200]  prison planet dot tv we said if we think maybe
[3:01:28.200 --> 3:01:32.040]  you're a terrorist so that means if we think maybe
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:35.720]  you've committed a misdemeanor because section 802 of terrorism in the patriot
[3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:39.000]  act says any misdemeanor you'll be on the no fly list you won't build on a gun
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:43.560]  well that no fly list is a criminal list over a million americans now on it
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:47.400]  no judge no jury congressman senators business owners
[3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:50.280]  a lot of you are on that list and it's growing it's gotta be over a million now
[3:01:50.280 --> 3:01:54.120]  last time i saw it six months ago was in the news over a million on no fly list
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:58.280]  and over two million on the criminal list no conviction no nothing
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:04.040]  just total tyranny that's what the bad guys do folks they want your guns so
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:08.280]  we're gonna work on getting some of these state reps on so we can spread the word
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:11.720]  about this happening at other state reps under this legislation
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:14.760]  because of the feds announced return your guns and folks you better hope
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:18.440]  your state stands up and says no that's the last line of defense
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:23.560]  that's why they've been getting rid of the states
[3:02:23.560 --> 3:02:26.520]  let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:29.400]  micah new york thanks for holding her on the air
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:33.800]  hey alex how you doing good it's a pleasure to talk to you god bless you
[3:02:33.800 --> 3:02:36.600]  for what you're doing and the information you're releasing everybody
[3:02:36.600 --> 3:02:41.320]  and keeping everybody a little smarter than they normally would be without you
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:44.760]  uh... you were mentioned on george nori last night about the uh...
[3:02:44.760 --> 3:02:48.200]  fema camps and how you've been screaming and yelling about it all these
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:52.040]  years no one's been listening to you and i think people are starting to wake up
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:02:55.320]  little by little but i think it might be a little too late
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:02:59.480]  i think that uh... they've just pushed and pushed and
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:03.640]  and i think that it's it's a scary world out there alex and it's
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:08.680]  just getting worse and worse every day and i don't know what to do
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:11.880]  i think it was george talking about how the bills are introduced to
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:16.280]  yeah i think uh... the florida florida introduced a bill uh... senator i
[3:03:16.280 --> 3:03:20.440]  believe from florida yes the bill and uh...
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.440]  i mean that's it's gonna pass there's there did they're just gonna stand right
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:27.640]  up one after the other and and vote for it and pass it
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:30.920]  because of criminals yeah absolutely and it's just
[3:03:30.920 --> 3:03:34.120]  i mean they have handed us over to foreign banks
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:37.080]  they've looted us they're stealing all the pension funds as i told you years ago
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:39.320]  they were planning to read their own documents
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:42.520]  and then they're going to sit there and say military attack the people
[3:03:42.520 --> 3:03:45.720]  that you know they don't like their savings being taken the military's gonna
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:50.360]  go knocking loads of absolutely they're all bring on tv ads when look at our
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:52.760]  heroes look at them they'll have rock bands going
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:03:57.320]  there's there a war yeah fighting the evil american yeah
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:04:02.040]  oh yeah scary world out there we're expecting our first daughter in order
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:05.480]  yeah we're trying we're gonna avoid uh...
[3:04:05.480 --> 3:04:10.120]  given her the uh... vaccinations and thank god for religious exemption and
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:15.160]  actually new york state is trying to strengthen the religious exemption
[3:04:15.160 --> 3:04:19.080]  for vaccinations so that's some good news
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:23.640]  up to that point the the the fight is on the people no
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:27.720]  except for let me see fifty seven percent of voters
[3:04:27.720 --> 3:04:31.880]  is almost sixty but the voted for barack obama sixty percent vote for barack
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:34.840]  obama well but no that's not accurate
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:39.720]  let me get this right we had sixty two percent voter turnout
[3:04:39.720 --> 3:04:44.120]  and close to sixty percent of the voters voted for barack obama
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:48.840]  so what is sixty percent of sixty percent
[3:04:48.840 --> 3:04:53.960]  we're talking about thirty five percent or so thirty seven percent i'm going to
[3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:57.080]  calculate around of the country voted for obama
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:01.240]  anything else sir no that'll do it i appreciate your time
[3:05:01.240 --> 3:05:04.840]  appreciate you phase one of the insiders plan for a one-world government has been

[3:05:27.400 --> 3:05:30.440]  power phase one is a one-world currency which
[3:05:30.440 --> 3:05:32.440]  we are currently being prepared to accept

[3:08:21.720 --> 3:08:26.600]  the globalists want to keep their mind shut small petty
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:30.600]  in abject tyranny just giving in to corruption
[3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:33.640]  we want to just unlock people's minds so they can look at the world for
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:36.200]  themselves and assess what's really happening what's
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:40.440]  really going on in their area and to decide if they want to be part of this
[3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:46.040]  fight for liberty in history or they want evil to be able to take over now
[3:08:46.040 --> 3:08:49.400]  i'm going to say this again i say this every show and i'm going to beg the
[3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:53.480]  audience now the number one thing you can do
[3:08:53.480 --> 3:08:56.440]  to fight the new world order is to spread the word and what is most effective
[3:08:56.440 --> 3:08:59.240]  films so get my films other films make copies
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:03.240]  have viewing parties get it out call congress go speak to your city council
[3:09:03.240 --> 3:09:06.600]  call your state legislatures tell them introduce legislation like new hampshire
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:09.880]  did seven states passed a bill saying we're not
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:13.320]  going to follow the patriot act it's unamerican and instructed the state
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:16.360]  police not to follow it and instructed their states because the
[3:09:16.360 --> 3:09:20.040]  states are over the counties and cities told their counties and cities do not
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:22.600]  violate the bill rights the constitution it's still in effect here
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:26.440]  don't use the patriot act against us citizens the feds oh no we're not doing
[3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:31.000]  that and then they did and a lot of states are now using it
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:35.560]  that was all because i had the idea to do that and people picked it up ran with it
[3:09:35.560 --> 3:09:39.160]  people formed organizations in 800 plus cities and seven states did it
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:41.720]  now this could domino effect with what's happening
[3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:46.440]  with this house resolution six in new hampshire
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:50.760]  and other states have similar things we've had the state rep on
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:53.880]  uh... what's your state senator on many times
[3:09:53.880 --> 3:09:56.760]  didn't get her back on who introduced legislation similar to this
[3:09:56.760 --> 3:09:59.560]  years ago after she saw my film police state 2000
[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:03.080]  another example we call her to have her on as a guest ago i'd introduce this oh i
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:07.080]  saw police state 2000 checked it out that was back in
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:12.120]  2000 and now she's a big 9-11 truther but karen johnston
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:16.040]  so other states are doing similar things we don't just want to have these
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:18.040]  introduced we want to have these passed saying
[3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:21.720]  we know you're setting up martial law we know you're setting up tyranny
[3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:25.400]  we know you're engaged in all this corruption we know you're illegitimate
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:28.760]  we are not going to let the feds come in here and take the guns we are not going
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:32.600]  to take part in this and go along with this
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:35.720]  it can happen you have to believe that it can happen first and that means you
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:38.360]  have to form groups form groups get focused
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:42.120]  get the legislation from new hampshire and other legislation put it together
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:46.280]  and bring it in and speak to committees and shake hands and get down there
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:50.120]  it can happen the people are really listening right now
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:53.240]  a lot of folks in politics are scared they know what's going on
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:56.520]  they just want to see people supporting them for what's right
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:11:00.600]  now the big issue is we don't have a choice you can say it's a tough road we
[3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:03.560]  got to go down well it's the other one's a lot tougher
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:06.600]  i'm not going to just lay here on a ditch on my knees i'll put a bullet in my
[3:11:06.600 --> 3:11:10.280]  head and it could come to that now listen
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:13.800]  another big solution is spreading the word there are hundreds of thousands of
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:17.160]  people that listen every 15 minutes that's even gotten ratings from our
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:20.040]  stations before it's like 315 thousand people for 15 minutes
[3:11:20.040 --> 3:11:23.240]  listening i'm just the amen at them then shortwave satellite
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:26.840]  internet number one show on shoutcast and now they changed it where
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:30.520]  like a third of our streams can be seen before it was half our streams now a
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:33.800]  third of our streams can be seen on shoutcast and we're routinely number
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:37.880]  one in talk and routinely in the top five period
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:40.680]  and the reason i don't like not being in the top because we're sending more
[3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:43.160]  streams other places trying to work out the system
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:46.920]  is being on the top of shoutcast people want to hear what number one is
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:50.280]  and it makes more people listen so we're working that out try to get more of our
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:54.440]  streams uh pointed at that because a lot of them are going through cdn's not
[3:11:54.440 --> 3:11:59.480]  single servers and uh but side issue the point is
[3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:05.320]  it's kind of stuff i deal with all day um i want you as listeners to please tell
[3:12:05.320 --> 3:12:08.600]  your email list your friends your family your neighbors this is a hard hitting
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:11.160]  serious show you want to know what's really happening with the corporate
[3:12:11.160 --> 3:12:15.320]  takeover the bailouts the depression and gun control the fema camps
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:19.320]  this is the place info wars dot com prison planet dot com the backup sites
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:22.760]  prison planet uh dot tv is the big video site
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:26.120]  info wars dot net truth news dot us

[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:43.960]  or at the beach uh because i mean i'm putting everything on the
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:47.560]  line and and whether you know it or not you're on the line too your butt is
[3:12:47.560 --> 3:12:50.760]  hanging out over the edge of a cliff folks only chance we've got is to claw

[3:35:22.680 --> 3:35:28.760]  multiple variants of three doors down and and this particular one
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:33.320]  is equating being in the national guard with being in the militia and the
[3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:35.960]  revolutionary war people know that's bedrock america

[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:31.240]  everything's unhappy but then it cuts to a beautiful park with that magic
[3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:34.840]  golden hour about an hour before sunset and they're playing football in the
[3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:39.640]  park and outside the boundaries of your cities
[3:36:39.640 --> 3:36:44.760]  you know here's the psychology you're in the garden of eden
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:52.840]  you'll protect in your woman but outside it's dangerous who protects this eden
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:57.000]  our troops do yeah yeah yeah but in reality it's the troops that are
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:01.480]  bringing in the new world order the enforcement to destroy our eden
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:05.880]  it's this basic human instinct your little village and the enemy tribe 20
[3:37:05.880 --> 3:37:09.160]  miles away that raids you a couple times a year and kills your people and
[3:37:09.160 --> 3:37:12.120]  hauls your women off and you're sitting there in the cave or in the hut
[3:37:12.120 --> 3:37:14.040]  looking at your woman looking at your three children
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:16.840]  you're out hunting all day and fishing trying to bring them food in
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:19.320]  you're always you know you've got your weapon there you don't want to fight
[3:37:19.320 --> 3:37:22.040]  because the other tribe is bigger and they're stronger but you've got to
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:25.320]  protect your family it's it's a base instinct so you got to protect your
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:30.440]  women when in reality the military is owned by
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:34.040]  the foreign banks that are destroying your family
[3:37:34.040 --> 3:37:40.280]  now play this devilish propaganda for folks
[3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:44.200]  oh my god we put out propaganda for the government
[3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:49.640]  oh playing football protects america

[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:14.600]  soldiers are stuck outside the city lights they're stuck battling
[3:38:14.600 --> 3:38:17.800]  you need to join the military to save americans that are out gunned and out
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:21.400]  numbered fighting hard to kill 1.3 million iraq

[3:38:52.680 --> 3:38:56.440]  service but the first thing they push is helping people in floods and hurricanes
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:38:59.560]  and soup kitchens well who's against that but the real mission's taking your
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:02.280]  guns the bills are introduced to do it and they've announced troops are in the
[3:39:02.280 --> 3:39:05.720]  u.s to be used against it's for that and they did it new
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:09.480]  orleans and illinois
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:12.360]  so this is a different version than i saw last night
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:15.720]  um
[3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:18.920]  there must be a whole bunch of these things out there and what was the one
[3:39:18.920 --> 3:39:21.960]  you were well keep going
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:27.240]  get paused see now they're associating it with
[3:39:27.240 --> 3:39:30.520]  everything's an image a meme a art type
[3:39:30.520 --> 3:39:34.280]  you know now you see one of the revolutionary swamp foxes he's running
[3:39:34.280 --> 3:39:37.480]  from cannon fire he's a militia when in truth the feds are demonizing
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:41.400]  militias trying to outlaw him trying to disarm the american people
[3:39:41.400 --> 3:39:44.760]  but they show you that image oh we're the guys that are with the founding
[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:47.560]  fathers when i have femon video teaching the founding fathers were
[3:39:47.560 --> 3:39:50.600]  terrorist that america's bad oh it's in rhoda tyranny you want me to
[3:39:50.600 --> 3:39:53.480]  play that clip you're out there doubting me
[3:39:53.480 --> 3:39:57.400]  oh just like i told you all simers is being caused by watching tv and all the
[3:39:57.400 --> 3:40:00.920]  mercury in your food would you like me to would you like me to show fema
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:04.760]  saying the founding fathers were bad we have time we will do that but it's in
[3:40:04.760 --> 3:40:08.760]  rhoda tyranny so look at that that's an that's a that's a
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:11.960]  minute man who that's been taboo that's been bad in the
[3:40:11.960 --> 3:40:15.320]  media but now it's okay you can be a minute man
[3:40:15.320 --> 3:40:18.440]  you can be a minute man you can help take over iraq and make sure all the kids
[3:40:18.440 --> 3:40:22.200]  get their shots so they can't have babies but they'll tell you so they don't get
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:25.400]  smallpox let's go ahead and go back to the clip
[3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:47.320]  all right hit pause hit pause notice how the guy running
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:50.200]  looks like or made me the same guy playing football
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:53.800]  we all know we're connected instinctively to our ancestors and that we are
[3:40:53.800 --> 3:40:57.400]  connected to those who come after us we truly live forever through our progeny
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:00.840]  so they're actually reaching into base human programming and
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:06.520]  not just with our heritage but but directly with it being the same person
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:12.440]  saying he fought before be part of that great heritage
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:17.080]  this is hardcore psych warfare continue with the pentagon attack on the american
[3:41:17.080 --> 3:41:23.000]  people go ahead
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  i fired the shot that started the nation
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:31.080]  i fired the shot that started the nation right there
[3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:34.760]  they've introduced the gun control bills to literally ban all semi-autos to make
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:38.120]  everybody be licensed in america with psychological federal testing where the
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:41.880]  feds can say you're on a terror or crime list with no judge no jury no arrest
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:45.320]  and ban you owning any guns it's all introduced we covered it earlier in the
[3:41:45.320 --> 3:41:47.480]  show
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:50.440]  they've introduced bills to build FEMA camps they've already built the camps but
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:52.920]  now they're saying they're going to merge local police with them
[3:41:52.920 --> 3:41:56.440]  they're destroying what these guys went to war because the british were
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:00.680]  confiscating their guns now the very same new world orders here doing it
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:04.200]  claiming there are ancestors this is high treason
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:08.280]  our military isn't ours anymore we are the
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:11.560]  men and men we are the sons of liberty that fight the new world order
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:17.480]  not the people in the military there are good people in the military who know
[3:42:17.480 --> 3:42:20.040]  what's going on are upset in fact the majority of them but they're being
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:23.080]  replaced with illegal aliens and crime syndicate operatives and the biggest
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:26.120]  recruiting stations are in mexico city manila philippines and of course in the
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:29.480]  major cities in the eastern block former eastern block like ukraine the
[3:42:29.480 --> 3:42:32.680]  check republic check into it they're signing
[3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:36.120]  deals to bring foreign troops into america not just in the combined force
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:42.280]  now remember that remember who you work for you work for the bankers that have
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:46.840]  hijacked america and now have to use the military to suppress the people so we
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:50.840]  don't get justice while your banker bosses take over the pension funds
[3:42:50.840 --> 3:42:53.480]  back it up about 20 seconds i want to play this for folks
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:58.440]  oh you started a nation that's good at play you started a nation
[3:42:58.440 --> 3:43:01.800]  you know because you're in the new world order military you know you are the
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:05.080]  ones killing the country and killing other sovereign countries
[3:43:05.080 --> 3:43:08.280]  your country killers your freedom killers
[3:43:08.280 --> 3:43:11.800]  you're training to take our guns and i've got video 10 years ago of it and
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:37.560]  now it's openly announced play the video
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:45.320]  all right pause the the men and men are fighting the red coats and then it cuts
[3:43:45.320 --> 3:43:50.360]  to a patchy helicopters blowing up cities no the red coats were the apache
[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:57.080]  helicopters blowing up cities the rag tag people
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:00.840]  fighting them are the equivalent of 1776ers
[3:44:00.840 --> 3:44:04.680]  let's get that straight to we were the underdogs the iraqis are the underdogs
[3:44:04.680 --> 3:44:08.920]  not the big giant behemoth blowing the hell out everything in its way
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:13.320]  this is disgusting sickening filthy propaganda and everything the military
[3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:16.440]  works for now is destroying the bill of rights and constitution that all the
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:20.120]  other veterans before them fought for this is a disgrace and is an
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:24.840]  abomination to the republic i rebuke this accursed piece of
[3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:39.080]  propaganda go to the continue with the evil
[3:44:39.080 --> 3:44:42.840]  stop right there why are the women starving for a meal to eat in all
[3:44:42.840 --> 3:44:45.800]  these countries because the globalists came in and blew up their water
[3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:48.520]  structures their power plants their roads their bridges their
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:52.040]  infrastructure and put siege on them for decades
[3:44:52.040 --> 3:44:57.000]  women starving for something to eat all this bull
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:00.040]  i mean you know the nazis had propaganda posters where it showed a nazi
[3:45:00.040 --> 3:45:05.240]  soldier you know in russia or poland handing someone a loaf of bread
[3:45:05.240 --> 3:45:07.640]  there's literally pictures of them handing a woman a loaf who's going like
[3:45:07.640 --> 3:45:09.960]  this below them and they're going hyal Hitler below it
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:13.800]  handing the woman a piece of bread
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:19.080]  and by the way i know when i just did that the psyops are going to go put that
[3:45:19.080 --> 3:45:21.640]  and say i was hyaline hitler but then people are going to find out you lied
[3:45:21.640 --> 3:45:24.040]  about it and find out you're working for the government and then they'll know
[3:45:24.040 --> 3:45:27.320]  how credible we are so go ahead and run your psyop on that one too
[3:45:27.320 --> 3:45:32.600]  you lying scum you will be defeated the republic is going to kick your ass get
[3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:37.320]  that straight the real 1776ers not this counterfeit
[3:45:37.320 --> 3:46:03.320]  now go back to the video
[3:46:03.320 --> 3:46:06.600]  stop right there another huge lie it's saying while the military is off
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:10.280]  feeding and helping people actually blowing their countries up and then
[3:46:10.280 --> 3:46:13.880]  it's like shooting somebody in the head and giving them a bandaid
[3:46:13.880 --> 3:46:16.760]  while the troops see they're sucking in good men and women who mean well to
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:19.960]  join the military but they're lying to them saying you'll be a
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:23.640]  citizen soldier you'll be right here at home
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:26.120]  so this is people that don't want to fight they're saying you join the
[3:46:26.120 --> 3:46:30.360]  national guard you support the real troops here in the u.s
[3:46:30.360 --> 3:46:34.040]  they've been deploying over 80 percent of the national guard
[3:46:34.040 --> 3:46:36.680]  they're getting rid of the national guard completely federalizing it for
[3:46:36.680 --> 3:46:40.120]  combat duty domestically and internationally so this video ought to
[3:46:40.120 --> 3:46:43.080]  show national guard confiscating people's guns
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:46.200]  going into people's houses taking down their american flags
[3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:49.640]  stealing their property taking it ought to show the troops at a bank helping the
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:54.600]  bankers steal all the pension funds then this would be an accurate video
[3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:56.920]  and again we're not even we're not against the troops that we're against
[3:46:56.920 --> 3:47:01.320]  you being propagandized and brainwashed so so continue it's just every five
[3:47:01.320 --> 3:47:05.800]  seconds is pure lies go back to it
[3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:09.320]  all right hit pause right there oh i stormed the beaches of normandy see
[3:47:09.320 --> 3:47:12.280]  they're going back through all the heritage
[3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:15.400]  meanwhile it was big u.s and british banks that actually installed hitler
[3:47:15.400 --> 3:47:19.160]  he was time magazine man of the year twice and worship in the united states
[3:47:19.160 --> 3:47:22.040]  and told to go ahead invade those countries then they set him up and
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:25.480]  brought him down they create these evil demons
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:29.080]  just like saddam hussein and some have been lauding all of them
[3:47:29.080 --> 3:47:32.040]  so they're equating joining the national guard with all this when the
[3:47:32.040 --> 3:47:35.000]  national guard is openly going to be used against the american people
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:38.520]  and gun confiscation continue
[3:47:46.680 --> 3:47:49.560]  he loves his wife they just tug on every heart string
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:53.000]  he's kissing his ring families you're watching this makes you think of your
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:56.840]  wife you know so that's for the old people
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:48:01.320]  watching this is all unified propaganda to sell the public on war
[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:04.920]  to sell the public on tyranny to get young people to join the national guard
[3:48:04.920 --> 3:48:07.560]  thinking they won't be shipped overseas they'll be backing up the citizen
[3:48:07.560 --> 3:48:28.120]  soldiers continue
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:32.200]  okay so they mix war in with soldiers helping people here in the us
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:35.400]  more propaganda in truth the national guard would be there confiscating the
[3:48:35.400 --> 3:48:38.440]  firearms as they do all the country there's a disaster now
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:42.680]  so again selling just like barack obama says well i'm for compulsory suit
[3:48:42.680 --> 3:48:45.640]  kitchens but really behind that is domestic police
[3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:49.160]  brigades so see this is all just propaganda they put
[3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:51.880]  in here continue
[3:48:55.160 --> 3:48:59.560]  i always place the mission first then they say pray you know the government
[3:48:59.560 --> 3:49:03.400]  they're destroying religion when they don't like it or using it to
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:06.760]  control people when they can with the clergy response teams
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:09.960]  right at a red dawn the local preachers trained until american citizens to turn
[3:49:09.960 --> 3:49:13.880]  their guns in and go to fema camps
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:20.200]  it was i will never accept defeat defeat to them is leaving an occupied
[3:49:20.200 --> 3:49:23.800]  country and now obama is basically saying the
[3:49:23.800 --> 3:49:26.920]  troops will just stay in iraq forever they're going to increase the troops
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:30.440]  in other areas of the world like afghanistan and the message is i never
[3:49:30.440 --> 3:49:34.120]  show a white flag we never retreat we never leave
[3:49:34.120 --> 3:49:37.400]  they said we'd be there six months they promised we were but the documents said
[3:49:37.400 --> 3:49:40.920]  they were going to be there forever hundred year war
[3:49:40.920 --> 3:49:44.920]  so again just every five seconds pure propaganda continue
[3:49:44.920 --> 3:49:49.480]  i walk beside you but you may not see me
[3:49:49.480 --> 3:49:54.840]  the strongest among you may not wear a crown
[3:49:54.840 --> 3:49:59.880]  on that day okay the strongest among you may not
[3:49:59.880 --> 3:50:03.080]  wear a crown you have the red coats coming to confiscate guns that's
[3:50:03.080 --> 3:50:06.440]  out started you have the militia shooting them
[3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:10.600]  and now they cut to us military doing a breach entry blowing open the door for
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:14.360]  gun confiscation the red coats are coming to take the guns
[3:50:14.360 --> 3:50:17.480]  they show you the image of the minutemen firing back
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:23.160]  then it cuts to us military doing an entry for gun confiscation
[3:50:23.160 --> 3:50:26.840]  back it up a few seconds here they've all been trained they're coming back to be
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:29.080]  cops and domestic military they've been kicking
[3:50:29.080 --> 3:50:32.120]  down doors thousands of times they're trained in it they brought back the
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:37.400]  main brigade who are the top folks in this to the united states for this
[3:50:37.400 --> 3:50:40.760]  just play out we're going to come back and finish it up i meant to get all
[3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:43.480]  these calls but i started analyzing propaganda

[3:50:49.400 --> 3:50:53.320]  tested at high levels of mercury but on the ads they go
[3:50:53.320 --> 3:50:57.400]  there's no proof there's anything wrong corn syrup it's a conspiracy theory
