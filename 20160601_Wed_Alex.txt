[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  It's the first day of June 2016 on this Wednesday edition.
[00:06.160 --> 00:08.720]  We kick it off with a report from John Bound.
[00:08.720 --> 00:10.680]  Social justice warriors.
[00:10.680 --> 00:15.120]  Forget all of the death threats you have spewed out towards Donald Trump, deeming him a bigot
[00:15.120 --> 00:20.840]  simply because you can't swallow the truth.
[00:20.840 --> 00:25.360]  Reality is on the verge of entering the comfort zone you so adamantly defend.
[00:25.360 --> 00:30.440]  The tsunami of immigration strategized by Bilderberg elites to divide and conquer the
[00:30.440 --> 00:36.440]  US and Europe is only growing stronger and more dangerous as the days roll by.
[00:36.440 --> 00:42.000]  And now, as London's newly elected pro-caliphate mayor strengthens the foothold of Sharia
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.680]  law, it appears Jolly Old England may be the first country to completely fall if nothing
[00:47.680 --> 00:48.680]  is done.
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.160]  Breitbart, UK, reports.
[00:51.160 --> 00:55.680]  Up to half a million migrants and their families who have fled from the Middle East, North Africa
[00:55.680 --> 01:03.360]  and elsewhere could head to the UK after 2020 under European Union free movement rules.
[01:03.360 --> 01:10.720]  Between 240,000 and 480,000 may travel to UK and while countries such as Greece, Italy
[01:10.720 --> 01:16.960]  and Germany have been hardest hit by the migrant crisis so far, a secondary wave will likely
[01:16.960 --> 01:19.760]  move on to Britain once they have the right.
[01:19.760 --> 01:26.360]  Meanwhile, as Obama is challenged by 26 states on the constitutionality of the 2014 DAPA
[01:26.360 --> 01:32.520]  program, the dam has completely burst as a surge of unchecked illegal immigrants entering
[01:32.520 --> 01:35.640]  the United States swells into record numbers.
[01:35.640 --> 01:42.240]  WCQS reports, immigrants fleeing gang violence in Central America are again surging across
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.600]  the US-Mexico border, approaching the numbers that created an immigration crisis in the
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.560]  summer of 2014.
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.400]  While the flow of immigrants slowed for much of last year, nothing the US government does
[01:54.400 --> 01:57.560]  seems to deter the current wave of travelers.
[01:57.560 --> 01:59.240]  Yet the numbers are daunting.
[01:59.240 --> 02:04.760]  From last October to March, the US Border Patrol averaged 330 apprehensions of Central
[02:04.760 --> 02:10.160]  Americans a day, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center, an increase of
[02:10.160 --> 02:14.240]  100% over the same time period a year earlier.
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.880]  And it's not just the surging numbers of criminals given the revolving door into the
[02:18.880 --> 02:25.240]  United States, freely killing and yes, raping US citizens, or the quiet strengthening of
[02:25.240 --> 02:29.640]  Sharia communities in the United States that is fully underway.
[02:29.640 --> 02:37.760]  We have had Somalians here, once they got on that special alien list, they won't tell
[02:37.760 --> 02:46.000]  us that anymore, but there have been Somalians, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chinese, you name
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.520]  it, we've had it here.
[02:47.520 --> 02:53.480]  But as one of them was climbing over the fence, he dropped a package.
[02:53.480 --> 03:01.640]  And that package was an Urdu dictionary, Urdu is a language spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[03:01.640 --> 03:10.240]  And in that translation book, Urdu and English, there were a lot of phrases circled and outlined.
[03:10.240 --> 03:12.040]  Do you speak Spanish?
[03:12.040 --> 03:13.600]  Do you speak English?
[03:13.600 --> 03:16.960]  So it's easier for them to slip through this private property.
[03:16.960 --> 03:20.520]  Disease lives inside this Trojan horse.
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.400]  The rates of tuberculosis infections are rising for the first time in nearly 20 years.
[03:25.400 --> 03:30.200]  And the evidence points to people coming from overseas to the United States.
[03:30.200 --> 03:35.040]  Our own investigation has found that everyone, US born or foreign born, who lives in a refugee
[03:35.040 --> 03:38.880]  resettlement area is at risk for contracting tuberculosis.
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.920]  An outbreak of measles, the highly contagious measles that began with an inmate at the Eloi
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.720]  Detention Center has now grown to 11 confirmed cases.
[03:47.720 --> 03:52.480]  And now state county health officials are working to try to stop it from spreading further.
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.640]  Breitbart reports a flesh eating tropical disease is ravaging the war-torn Middle East after
[03:58.640 --> 04:03.240]  Islamic State destruction created the ideal breeding conditions.
[04:03.240 --> 04:10.040]  The parasitic disease called cutaneous Lycemoniasis, also known as the Aleppo evil, is caused
[04:10.040 --> 04:15.320]  by bites from tiny infected sand flies which thrive in the squalid conditions left in
[04:15.320 --> 04:18.920]  the wake of the Islamic State terror and conflict.
[04:18.920 --> 04:25.000]  The number of cases has shot up from just 6 in 2012 to thousands just a year later.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.280]  The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the disease has recently begun
[04:30.280 --> 04:33.280]  to flourish in Syria's neighboring countries.
[04:33.280 --> 04:39.120]  The time has come to shut down George Soros' social justice warriors wreaking havoc on
[04:39.120 --> 04:40.120]  the narrative.
[04:40.120 --> 04:43.480]  Freedom of speech is needed now more than ever.
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.560]  Ignorance can't be the darkened midnight path we lead our families and fellow Americans
[04:48.560 --> 04:49.560]  down.
[04:49.560 --> 04:55.000]  The trail winds its way towards certain doom emboldened by our own inaction.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.800]  John Bound for Infowars.com Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[04:59.800 --> 05:02.440]  The big broadcast kicks off now.
[05:02.440 --> 05:06.800]  New research is warning about a possible link between common over-the-counter medications
[05:06.800 --> 05:07.800]  and dementia.
[05:07.800 --> 05:14.240]  CBS2 reports an antihistamine known as diphenhydramine may increase the risk of dementia and even
[05:14.240 --> 05:16.000]  cause irreparable harm.
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.680]  It's commonly sold as benadryl and it's included in many over-the-counter medications for cold
[05:20.680 --> 05:21.680]  and allergies.
[05:21.680 --> 05:27.200]  It also causes drowsiness so it's popular in sleep aids such as Tylenol PM, Advil PM
[05:27.200 --> 05:28.200]  and Zequal.
[05:28.200 --> 05:31.680]  Recent research found that older adults who took these type of drugs continuously for
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.960]  years performed worse on tests that measured short-term memory, verbal reasoning, planning
[05:36.960 --> 05:38.240]  and problem solving.
[05:38.240 --> 05:42.760]  And now experts are concerned that the cognitive functions lost might not come back even after
[05:42.760 --> 05:44.640]  stopping the medications.
[05:44.640 --> 05:48.760]  Now the studies are not conclusive but it does add more credence to the idea that in
[05:48.760 --> 05:53.320]  our overly-medicated society, we are the long-term test subjects.
[05:53.320 --> 06:23.280]  Leigh-Anne McIntyre reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:53.320 --> 07:05.880]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[07:05.880 --> 07:11.240]  a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the Infowars, a 360 win.
[07:11.240 --> 07:16.200]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[07:16.200 --> 07:17.800]  at Infowarsstore.com.

[07:21.640 --> 07:25.760]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[07:25.760 --> 07:30.680]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:30.680 --> 07:35.040]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[07:35.040 --> 07:36.840]  the products that you need each month.
[07:36.840 --> 07:41.440]  Just go to Infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto-ship and

[07:49.880 --> 07:51.280]  this is a sure win.
[07:51.280 --> 07:57.240]  10% off on auto-ship, win, win, win at Infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[07:57.240 --> 08:00.920]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[08:00.920 --> 08:03.920]  We've got it, we've got it.
[08:03.920 --> 08:09.400]  Thank you, space is coming to you.
[08:09.400 --> 08:11.400]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:11.400 --> 08:13.760]  All right, you're on, go.
[08:13.760 --> 08:21.600]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[08:21.600 --> 08:35.760]  Now we see the earth, you've got it, now we see the earth, now we see the earth, you've
[08:35.760 --> 08:36.760]  got it.
[08:36.760 --> 08:42.760]  Well, it's already June 1st, 2016 on this Wednesday Worldwide live broadcast.
[08:42.760 --> 08:46.200]  I'm here to host Alex Jones, we're going to be here obviously for the next four hours.
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.040]  David Knight will host the fourth hour.
[08:49.040 --> 08:56.960]  Joe Biggs is following a Breitbart politically incorrect tour in California where the Social
[08:56.960 --> 09:01.160]  Justice Warriors try to block free speech everywhere it's taking place with truly monstrous
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.160]  different people.
[09:02.160 --> 09:05.960]  We have a bunch of videos up on Infowars.com, we're writing articles about them right now,
[09:05.960 --> 09:08.520]  just what happened last night with the kickoff of the tour.
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.300]  But we can't obviously play them here because the Social Justice Warriors do not have any
[09:12.300 --> 09:18.280]  forms of English other than just screaming, frothing, and cussing.
[09:18.280 --> 09:24.480]  Headlines, Social Justice Warriors, whiners attempt to block free speech at UCLA, that's
[09:24.480 --> 09:33.240]  too kind of a headline, anti-free speech goons attempt to destroy free speech at a university
[09:33.240 --> 09:34.240]  again.
[09:34.240 --> 09:36.800]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[09:36.800 --> 09:40.240]  And they revel in it.
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.240]  And this is not some aberration.
[09:46.240 --> 09:53.200]  Everywhere you go, you are faced with the age-scree-lax and the trigly-puffs of the world, that's their
[09:53.200 --> 09:58.480]  meme names, who just absolutely want to shut freedom in this country down.
[09:58.480 --> 10:02.280]  They do not want to let you speak, they do not want to let you raise your children the
[10:02.280 --> 10:08.280]  way you see fit, they want to run your life, period.
[10:08.280 --> 10:12.640]  That's all it comes down to, and we have to exercise our free speech or lose it because
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.400]  here's the big news.
[10:16.400 --> 10:23.480]  All over Europe and now in the United States, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, Apple platforms
[10:23.480 --> 10:30.760]  are censoring popular speech, nationalist speech, conservative speech, libertarian speech,
[10:30.760 --> 10:36.120]  Christian speech, leftist speech that's concerned about Islam.
[10:36.120 --> 10:37.120]  You name it.
[10:37.120 --> 10:43.800]  And by the way, if you're in Mongolia or you're in Tibet or you're in India especially, you're
[10:43.800 --> 10:52.120]  afraid of Muslims because there are bombings every day for the last 60, 70 years and shootings
[10:52.120 --> 10:59.960]  and beatings and stabbings every day against Buddhists and against Hindus and against other
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.160]  groups that traditionally get along with each other, but the Muslims come in and try to
[11:04.160 --> 11:05.160]  take over.
[11:05.160 --> 11:11.160]  The Dalai Lama has come out against radical Islam and warned Germany to stop opening its
[11:11.160 --> 11:20.480]  borders and stop killing itself because to people in China and Tibet and Japan and all
[11:20.480 --> 11:22.720]  over, they are what on earth are you doing?
[11:22.720 --> 11:25.240]  They were all attacked by booby pirates.
[11:25.240 --> 11:31.480]  That's where the term booby comes from is an Islamic pirate that all over the South
[11:31.480 --> 11:32.480]  Pacific.
[11:32.480 --> 11:37.160]  I mean, you know, Islam took over most of the South Pacific and all around Australia
[11:37.160 --> 11:39.760]  and you know that, right?
[11:39.760 --> 11:43.320]  The only place they didn't get was the Philippines.
[11:43.320 --> 11:46.400]  I mean, everybody knows that, right?
[11:46.400 --> 11:47.600]  No, people don't know that.
[11:47.600 --> 11:52.320]  It wasn't just Europe that got overrun, it wasn't just Russia that got overrun, it wasn't
[11:52.320 --> 11:58.640]  just Poland, it wasn't just Romania and Hungary and Serbia and Greece and Rome.
[11:58.640 --> 12:03.960]  Rome had to build big walls around Vatican City because of the Islamic invasions.
[12:03.960 --> 12:07.280]  And then the people showing up were screaming, we're here to invade, we're here to take over,
[12:07.280 --> 12:08.960]  we're here to get your women.
[12:08.960 --> 12:16.480]  White people are bad, everyone's like, oh, I'm white, I'm evil, you slit my throat.
[12:16.480 --> 12:17.480]  It's wild.
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.200]  And again, we're not bringing in the Muslims from areas of Iraq or areas of Jordan or even
[12:22.200 --> 12:27.160]  areas from Egypt where they really do like the left on average and really do just want
[12:27.160 --> 12:28.720]  to have civilization.
[12:28.720 --> 12:31.680]  We're bringing in the Saudi brainwash Wahhabist.
[12:31.680 --> 12:38.680]  In fact, there's new numbers out today where they claim out of the couple thousand refugees
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.960]  they brought to the United States so far this year in the last six months, because we're
[12:43.960 --> 12:51.360]  kicking off the six months, yes, so almost six months here, that there's almost zero
[12:51.360 --> 12:59.520]  Christians, 1037 Syrian refugees admitted in May, two Christians, that's 0.19, Syria
[12:59.520 --> 13:03.120]  is 20% plus Christian.
[13:03.120 --> 13:08.160]  It was almost 30, hundreds of thousands got killed, other 10% got out, but they're not
[13:08.160 --> 13:10.160]  allowed to go into Europe.
[13:10.160 --> 13:14.280]  Christians are blocked by Germany, by France, by Sweden, because you heard the Pope do
[13:14.280 --> 13:22.360]  two weeks ago, he said Europe should be embarrassed by its traditional Christian roots.
[13:22.360 --> 13:29.720]  He used a term much worse than it was, he abhors and is repulsed, what was the exact
[13:29.720 --> 13:30.720]  word?
[13:30.720 --> 13:34.680]  It was repulsed or abhored.
[13:34.680 --> 13:40.520]  We can pull up the LaCroix newspaper, the English translation on infohors.com and he
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.800]  just talks about how horrible it is and how good it is, this is happening because Christian
[13:44.800 --> 13:52.520]  Europe is bad, and that Jesus sent his disciples out like ISIS did, and this is stuff I'd
[13:52.520 --> 13:57.840]  expect to hear at some satanic mass, with black altars is the kind of stuff they spew
[13:57.840 --> 14:04.040]  out of their mouths, blasphemy, but now it just flows, open blasphemy out of the Pope's
[14:04.040 --> 14:06.800]  mouth like a satanic high priest.
[14:06.800 --> 14:11.440]  I mean where are the women over the altars?
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.160]  And the Pope kisses the rose of Venus' shame, let's put them back up on screen, put them
[14:16.160 --> 14:23.040]  up there, Pope Palpatine compares Christianity to ISIS, go watch my original report, but
[14:23.040 --> 14:26.440]  if we go back to the actual text in the article you had previously, thank you for pulling
[14:26.440 --> 14:31.360]  up so quick, we don't script this folks, they're just going and gunning as I talk about it.
[14:31.360 --> 14:36.880]  Pope Francis likens Jesus for ISIS, says Muslims must breed with Europeans, Francis
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.080]  claims ISIS similar to Jesus, sending his disciples into all nations.
[14:42.080 --> 14:48.880]  And then he went on, in a shocking interview, Pope Francis likens Jesus Christ to ISIS.
[14:48.880 --> 14:54.200]  Today, I don't think there is fear of Islam as such as ISIS and its war of conquest, which
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.840]  is partly drawn from Islam, he told the French paper LeCroy, quote, it is true that the idea
[14:59.840 --> 15:04.360]  of conquest is inherent in the soul of Islam, however it is also possible to interpret the
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.680]  objective in Matthew's Gospel where Jesus sends his disciples to all nations in terms
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.880]  of the same idea of conquest.
[15:12.880 --> 15:19.560]  The opposite, the Pope also said he quote, yes dreaded, dreaded, hearing about Christian
[15:19.560 --> 15:25.080]  roots of Europe because to him they take on colonialist overtones, close quote, he called
[15:25.080 --> 15:31.080]  on European nations quote, to integrate Muslim migrants into the continent, I bet those German
[15:31.080 --> 15:36.800]  girls are going to love not being able to wear those little, those aren't even so much
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.320]  German, German outfits as they are.
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.960]  What's the more classical liberal area of Germany that I, that's more libertarian, kind
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.440]  of like the Texas of Germany, I'm having one of those, one of those momentary blips on
[15:50.440 --> 15:55.760]  my mental, mental, mental capacity to call it a brain flatulence, I guess will be the
[15:55.760 --> 15:56.760]  proper nomenclature.
[15:56.760 --> 15:57.760]  Bavaria?
[15:57.760 --> 16:00.760]  Bavaria, thank you Bavaria, there you go, there you go.
[16:00.760 --> 16:04.080]  I always love running into German Bavarians, I don't think I've run into any Bavarians
[16:04.080 --> 16:07.440]  that aren't listeners, I'll be on trips, you know, Germans are probably the most prolific
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.840]  travelers out there, maybe after the Japanese, it's a cliche, it's a stereotype because statistically
[16:12.840 --> 16:21.000]  it's true, it looks like Americans have the least amount of passports of any free country.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.120]  It's like Kim Jong-un looks like a psychopath, excuse me, just facts, but getting back to
[16:27.120 --> 16:33.360]  the news and information here, where was I, oh yes, they are opening up the borders at
[16:33.360 --> 16:38.480]  a very rapid clip and allowing TB in at massive levels and spreading everywhere and people
[16:38.480 --> 16:43.040]  are dying from it, it's so glorious because the government wants to protect you and wants
[16:43.040 --> 16:46.480]  to keep you safe.
[16:46.480 --> 16:54.480]  And now even Reuters is forced to report on the latest sexual assaults, asylum seekers
[16:54.480 --> 17:01.520]  investigated over sex attacks at German festival, now it was reportedly 27 women were groped
[17:01.520 --> 17:07.320]  or raped or both, but now by the time it hits our news, three Pakistani men seeing asylum
[17:07.320 --> 17:13.200]  in Germany are being investigated after dozens of women said they were sexually harassed
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.920]  at a music festival over the weekend, prosecutors said, all you gotta do is buy them a beer and
[17:18.920 --> 17:22.040]  talk to them guys, you don't need to try to rape them, I understand you see a free woman
[17:22.040 --> 17:26.400]  out, it's like fair game because they're slaves in a lot of your countries, but I understand
[17:26.400 --> 17:29.680]  I'm an evil person that I don't like that and so the feminists don't like me because
[17:29.680 --> 17:34.280]  I don't want to have women chained up and sexually mutilated, but if women want to be
[17:34.280 --> 17:39.520]  in slave galleys, they know where to go, the accusations follow mass sexual attacks on
[17:39.520 --> 17:44.000]  women at New Year's Eve and Cologne, which the police were ordered to cover up, but
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.960]  the police later leaked it so we know the truth, which fueled a backlash against Chancellor
[17:47.960 --> 17:50.800]  Angela Merkel's open door migrant policy.
[17:50.800 --> 17:54.880]  Of course, the answer is when they vote out the government, they just have an election
[17:54.880 --> 17:57.240]  fraud so they don't get voted out.
[17:57.240 --> 18:02.440]  After the festival in the western city of Darmistat, do I pronounce that right, which
[18:02.440 --> 18:08.440]  attracted 300 to 400,000 people over four days, 26 women made complaints of harassment
[18:08.440 --> 18:13.560]  and there are officially 18 injured parties, a spokeswoman for prosecutors said on Wednesday,
[18:13.560 --> 18:18.320]  they've got the rug up sweeping it under immediately, the women complained that they were surrounded
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.960]  by a small group of men who then touched them inappropriately, a police spokesman said,
[18:22.960 --> 18:26.600]  of course, we know about what happened in Cologne everywhere else and everything they
[18:26.600 --> 18:33.640]  can to cover this up, because if you got an unintended woman, even if she's wearing long
[18:33.640 --> 18:38.040]  dress and stuff, she is fair game, and if you can rape her, then you can even go to
[18:38.040 --> 18:42.920]  the public execution a month later, where they chop her head off in front of everybody
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.400]  because you raped her, the men don't get in trouble.
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.920]  Let's see, nothing from Gloria Steinem, nothing from the CIA run, Miss Magazine Combine, nothing
[18:52.920 --> 19:00.160]  from Sumner Redstone and Viacom, nothing from any of these people, nothing, because they
[19:00.160 --> 19:04.960]  want to trash the West from one end to the other, because they know the West time and
[19:04.960 --> 19:08.840]  time again is overthrown tyranny, and they don't want there to be any escape from the
[19:08.840 --> 19:13.480]  final technotronic takeover.
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.920]  Here's the headline, Dalai Lama, this is from the French news agency, Germany cannot become
[19:17.920 --> 19:23.360]  an Arab country, EU taking too many refugees, but that's impossible, the Dalai Lama has
[19:23.360 --> 19:30.160]  brown skin, and there's been this giant long-term demonization campaign of the Dalai Lama, that's
[19:30.160 --> 19:33.440]  because the Chinese government has taken over that country and is forcing the Tibetans
[19:33.440 --> 19:39.000]  to breed themselves out, and I think some of the lefts have lionized the Tibetans a
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.920]  little too much, but I've said it's a pretty interesting culture, it's an ancient culture,
[19:43.920 --> 19:49.760]  it's a culture that the Muslims tried to overrun before, so they're not stupid, and
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.440]  they know that they won't be allowed to practice their religion if the Muslims take over, so
[19:54.440 --> 19:59.880]  let's find out, the Muslims aren't tolerant, they're not tolerant, so anyone that is tolerant
[19:59.880 --> 20:02.040]  is concerned.

[22:35.120 --> 22:39.560]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.720]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.

[24:28.200 --> 24:33.000]  We broadcast on fine stations across the country. We also return 7 o'clock Central in Full Wars
[24:33.000 --> 24:42.800]  Nightly News. Okay, let me start plowing into some of the political news here in the United
[24:42.800 --> 24:45.880]  States. And then after the break, I'm going to get into the really big news. This is not
[24:45.880 --> 24:51.640]  a defense one. So that's basically one of the mouths of the Pentagon. So when you hear
[24:51.640 --> 24:59.320]  talk like this, it's serious. Beijing is setting the stage for war in the South China Sea. That's
[24:59.320 --> 25:05.920]  how the defense won. And you see the Communist Chinese generals and Navy admirals being quoted
[25:05.920 --> 25:10.360]  by the People's Daily and others saying, we are preparing for war with the United States
[25:10.360 --> 25:18.760]  and Japan. So that is the type of big issues we've got we need to focus in on. Meanwhile,
[25:18.760 --> 25:24.120]  the big headline around the world is Amazon CEO. We should settle Mars because it's cool.
[25:24.120 --> 25:31.080]  And even though I don't like Bezos activity when it comes to politics supporting obozo,
[25:31.080 --> 25:34.720]  I do like the fact that he promotes space travel and innovation because that's exactly
[25:34.720 --> 25:41.360]  what we need. And yeah, we should settle Mars because it's cool. Now, let's continue here.
[25:41.360 --> 25:45.840]  Let me get into this little jiblet of news that is one of the most important of the day,
[25:45.840 --> 25:51.920]  obviously, and I tend to open the phones up and get your take on this. The establishments
[25:51.920 --> 25:55.640]  like a pack of wolves and Hillary's blackmailing people and she knows where the bodies are
[25:55.640 --> 25:59.000]  buried and she's got so many other people in government involved in corruption with
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.960]  her. That's her real protection. Going back to Kin Star, not going after her for the missile
[26:03.960 --> 26:10.680]  secrets to the Communist Chinese when she was co-president with Laurel and Hughes. True
[26:10.680 --> 26:18.040]  high treason. But then now he basically works for the Clintons and praises them. And it's
[26:18.040 --> 26:22.800]  the same story today, but at a certain point when it all comes out in the open, our private
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.280]  email server Benghazi, the persecution of Christians, all of it, at a certain point
[26:27.280 --> 26:31.840]  in the court of public opinion, they have to bring her down. It's just too ridiculous.
[26:31.840 --> 26:37.040]  The stories from zero hedge. It's up on info wars.com. Wiki leaks ask if this is the smoking
[26:37.040 --> 26:45.360]  gun email that will bring down Hillary Clinton. And strangely enough, the FBI, Kurt Nemo is
[26:45.360 --> 26:50.760]  writing, it's smoking gun evidence in Clinton email scandal. Wiki leaks cable shows Clinton
[26:50.760 --> 26:56.880]  willfully abused confidential documents. And this has been out a while, but I'm glad it's
[26:56.880 --> 27:04.920]  now getting a little bit of attention. Here's a copy of the email. If you're a TV viewer,
[27:04.920 --> 27:15.440]  here it is classified U.S. Department of State number F dash 224 or 214 dash 20439 December.
[27:15.440 --> 27:23.960]  Dock number. And then it goes to the dock number C 05787519. And this is from the Secretary
[27:23.960 --> 27:34.320]  of State. And it says if they can't turn into non paper with no identifying heading.
[27:34.320 --> 27:41.600]  And send non secure. So she's saying an abbreviation if they can't send it to me the way I want
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.480]  it. Cut the top off and send it to me is non secure. This has been known for years. It's
[27:47.480 --> 27:55.640]  from 2011. And Hillary then has the nerve. I'm going to play this clip to go on television
[27:55.640 --> 28:03.560]  yesterday and say quote on CNN. She claims it's obvious that she always puts an actual
[28:03.560 --> 28:08.800]  security over self interest and that personal email use was a common practice. That's a
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.120]  quote under other Secretary of State urges voters to look at the big picture and the
[28:14.120 --> 28:21.080]  full threat posed by Donald Trump presidency. Because they're the ones turning ISIS and
[28:21.080 --> 28:24.880]  Al Qaeda loose in the world. They're the ones giving missile secrets to the communist Chinese.
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.240]  They're the ones starting war with Russia. They're the ones just running around destabilizing
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.000]  everything to bring in a world government out of the crisis. And they say Donald Trump's
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.040]  the problem and that she's standing up for financial security when she takes money from
[28:36.040 --> 28:40.520]  all these foreign dictators at her foundation to then sign waivers of the State Department
[28:40.520 --> 28:42.840]  to give them high tech weapons systems. Let's play the clip.
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.960]  Is it a challenge that you have to face to convince voters you'll put national security
[28:47.960 --> 28:58.400]  ahead of your own interests? Well, I think that is obvious. I always have. And the report
[28:58.400 --> 29:05.000]  just to go back to the actual report makes it clear that personal email use was the practice
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.360]  under other Secretaries of State and that the rules that they are now referencing were
[29:10.360 --> 29:15.800]  not clarified until after I had left. But look, I've said many times it was still a
[29:15.800 --> 29:18.040]  mistake. And if I could go back, I would do it.
[29:18.040 --> 29:22.160]  He's got a bottle tub. And I understand people may have concerns
[29:22.160 --> 29:27.240]  about this, but I hope voters look at the full picture of everything I've done in my
[29:27.240 --> 29:29.240]  career and the full threat.
[29:29.240 --> 29:32.920]  And we know what you've done in your career, Hillary. Thank you.
[29:32.920 --> 29:34.760]  I have faith in the American people.
[29:34.760 --> 29:37.360]  Yeah, you know, faith in the American people, right? You've got everything you can to ship
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.320]  our jobs overseas, take our guns, dumb our kids down and make us be obsessed with psychological
[29:42.320 --> 29:51.160]  warfare, tranny garbage. We'll be back. Stay with us.

[33:22.160 --> 33:28.400]  motorcade in downtown Dallas. The first report to say that President Kennedy has been seriously
[33:28.400 --> 33:39.600]  wounded by this shooting. It is a big idea. A new order. It was almost as if it were a
[33:39.600 --> 34:06.000]  war. But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands
[34:06.000 --> 34:17.520]  of soldiers, not the hands of criminals. For many of the police and guard troops, it is
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.520]  an uncomfortable job to do this in America. This is global governance at last. Is it one
[34:22.520 --> 34:27.280]  world the central bank is in charge? But aren't we all just living and dying from what the
[34:27.280 --> 34:36.800]  central banks do? And for me, give me liberty or give me death. Live from the infowars.com
[34:36.800 --> 34:43.040]  studios, it's Alex Jones. Now, 20, 30 years ago, you'd tell people the Federal Reserve
[34:43.040 --> 34:47.160]  was a private central bank and they'd say, you're a racist or you're a conspiracy theorist.
[34:47.160 --> 34:52.000]  Now it's, you know, five, six years. It's on CNN. It's on ABC News. Oh, yeah, we're run
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.280]  by foreign banks. They're above the law. Don't pay taxes. And we pay our taxes to them mainly
[34:56.280 --> 35:02.280]  and they control us. That's how far the Liberty Movement's come. That's how far you've come,
[35:02.280 --> 35:06.880]  spreading the word and waking people up. Alex Jones here. Thank you for joining us. I want
[35:06.880 --> 35:12.160]  to get more into geopolitical news and open the phones up and get into the latest on Trump,
[35:12.160 --> 35:16.560]  really going after Katie Couric. See, that's smart. Destroy these media whores. Destroy
[35:16.560 --> 35:22.920]  these evil deceivers to help expose the entire Brian Williams media. In fact, that is, that's
[35:22.920 --> 35:27.480]  the name, not the dinosaur media, not the prostitute media, not the Decepticon media,
[35:27.480 --> 35:32.320]  not the collaborator media, not the scum media, not the filth media, not the anti-American
[35:32.320 --> 35:42.800]  media, not the predator media, not the state run media. No, not the media whore system,
[35:42.800 --> 35:52.440]  but the Brian Williams media. That's it, the Brian Williams con artist, fraud media. That's
[35:52.440 --> 35:57.880]  Hillary. She's in combat. Sniper attacks her's video. No such thing. Just like Brian Williams
[35:57.880 --> 36:02.280]  and Katie Couric. Let's see. Why isn't the story so big? I'm going to get to it. The
[36:02.280 --> 36:05.640]  reason I've been harping on it for over a week since it broke over it. Or is it like
[36:05.640 --> 36:11.360]  Breitbart, Drudge and everywhere? Is because the gun owners that were interviewed were
[36:11.360 --> 36:15.760]  smart enough with their smartphones to use the little tech systems against Big Brother
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.760]  and record her knowing she'd set them up. And guess what? She did. They're using old
[36:21.760 --> 36:28.640]  tactics in a new war. And the dinosaurs are dropping faster and faster. And that just
[36:28.640 --> 36:34.120]  warms my little heart. Because when you look at Katie Couric, she's a sparkly eyed white
[36:34.120 --> 36:38.600]  devil praying on you and your family. Lewis Farrakhan's looking for white devils. Let
[36:38.600 --> 36:43.640]  me tell you, there's one right there. We should have the white devil award. I tell you a lot
[36:43.640 --> 36:47.160]  of evil people running this thing are white, but they're not me. And I'm not, you know,
[36:47.160 --> 36:50.640]  there's a lot of evil people and other groups too. But I tell you, a lot of these people
[36:50.640 --> 36:54.840]  are disproportionately white. And they're posing as liberals praying on people when
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.360]  they have armed guards. And I'm sick of that sack of garbage. She knows full well that
[36:59.360 --> 37:04.080]  guns are good. She's got guns. So is Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein. They just don't
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.040]  want you to have a gun because they're a big fat, stinking predator. That's time to
[37:09.040 --> 37:14.680]  call them out. Then I'm going to get into Beijing is setting the stage for war in the
[37:14.680 --> 37:23.520]  South China Sea. Defense one. Are you so wrong? No, I am the mouth of so wrong. I'm not saying
[37:23.520 --> 37:28.800]  the Pentagon so wrong, but it's funny because pretty much is the mouth of the Pentagon.
[37:28.800 --> 37:34.200]  The ministry of death. Before it was the ministry of war, but propagandists ever nation call
[37:34.200 --> 37:40.440]  it the defense department. Why not just call it the ministry of death? I mean, good or
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.760]  bad. That's what it deals is death. I'm not even against our military. I want to take
[37:45.760 --> 37:49.880]  it back over for America, not have to be hijacked with the globalist, but let's just get honest.
[37:49.880 --> 37:54.680]  It's like calling progressive progressive. Everything with them is a sick joke. Progressive
[37:54.680 --> 38:05.640]  like brain tumors or melanoma or leukemia or spongiform encephalopathy, prions, mad
[38:05.640 --> 38:11.520]  cow disease. I mean, it's not a good thing. Progressive. Your cancer is progressing. Your
[38:11.520 --> 38:16.440]  heart disease is progressing. Oh, yes. But they're eugenicists who want us to go backward
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.600]  and be controlled and live in a post industrial age. Well, they enjoy the fruits of high tech
[38:20.600 --> 38:26.920]  that we develop and build. And they just test on us. See, so they don't want us to progress.
[38:26.920 --> 38:31.720]  So it's even more of a light says progressing on cancer, but it's actually regressive. I
[38:31.720 --> 38:39.140]  am a progressive. I am a Renaissance man. I want to build. I want to see you so prosperous.
[38:39.140 --> 38:45.240]  I have dreams for the species. I want to share them with others and our children to go on
[38:45.240 --> 38:55.720]  into the future with their children for ever. Schools out for summer. Schools been blown
[38:55.720 --> 39:03.200]  to pieces. We don't need any education. We don't need no thought control, no dark sarcasms
[39:03.200 --> 39:09.800]  in the classroom. Hey, teachers, leave them kids alone. Get off our backs. Let us go to
[39:09.800 --> 39:16.440]  the next level. Don't try to suppress us anymore, controllers, because you're really not teachers.
[39:16.440 --> 39:22.600]  You want to keep us like cattle across between gremlins and minions. What do you call that
[39:22.600 --> 39:29.640]  a gremlin, a grim men, a grim men? A new creature has just been developed. Sure, it'll be a
[39:29.640 --> 39:34.480]  new internet meme, but we actually want to go to space. We want to go to the next level
[39:34.480 --> 39:40.320]  of species and we're here to push it. Period. Free will. We're here to show folks the rabbit
[39:40.320 --> 39:46.080]  trick, show people the hat trick so the scammers can't rule the world and so that innovators
[39:46.080 --> 39:53.600]  can lead the world. See, I don't want to rule. I want to lead and I want to see others that
[39:53.600 --> 39:59.080]  have got better right stuff than I do. And I want to put them upfront and launch them
[39:59.080 --> 40:05.120]  and support them. And I want to see them support me right back and I want to see them charge
[40:05.120 --> 40:11.640]  hard against parasites and enemies and run them over for this species. Full gear, full
[40:11.640 --> 40:19.600]  power, automatic maximum, more of it now. Period. Nothing's stopping us. God made us.
[40:19.600 --> 40:29.520]  The vision is unstoppable. It's not megalomania of an individual. It is the animating contest
[40:29.520 --> 40:40.120]  of beauty and creation and discovery and a vision, a true purpose driven life. That's
[40:40.120 --> 40:46.920]  why everything we do here is about empowering you because when you're empowered, we're empowered.
[40:46.920 --> 40:50.160]  When you raise your awareness, when you raise your consciousness, I don't mean that New
[40:50.160 --> 40:55.520]  Age mumbo jumbo. I mean literally your brainwaves go up and study it for study. Other peoples
[40:55.520 --> 41:02.600]  in the room, even if they're asleep, go up. I want the brainwaves up. I want the spiritual
[41:02.600 --> 41:09.600]  understanding intensified. I want to see everyone succeed. How many losers do we know that think
[41:09.600 --> 41:15.720]  to win somebody else has to fail? Yes, in classic animal competition, that's the case,
[41:15.720 --> 41:22.800]  not in the innovative system of humans where we build our own reality. We create our own
[41:22.800 --> 41:28.520]  environment. Look at where we were 1,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago, and look where we are
[41:28.520 --> 41:35.160]  today and imagine that would be unthinkable to people 1,000 years ago. And the levels
[41:35.160 --> 41:40.000]  we're going to go to are going to be so fantastical once we make it past this next hurdle that
[41:40.000 --> 41:49.000]  it's going to be undreamt of. And the people in the future are going to love us for what
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  we did, and they're going to love their children, and they're prizing going forward, and we're
[41:53.000 --> 42:02.720]  all in kinship together forever in the great victory, in the great species ascension. And
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.920]  the globalists want to strangle us in the crib and sacrifice us to the devil, the whole
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.680]  planet like a baby. That's what it is. It's a big egg. The planet is a big launch base.
[42:11.680 --> 42:17.160]  The planet is, is an egg. But frankly, it's meant to be consumed, probably, but we will
[42:17.160 --> 42:25.240]  build a trillion worlds. The globalists don't want you to know this, they're total filth.
[42:25.240 --> 42:30.000]  I'm going to stop right now. Buckley's been talking about this, and then we'll get back
[42:30.000 --> 42:36.760]  on the news for six months or actually longer. The folks that run the biggest swarable food
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.720]  system in the country, they've only been around about seven, eight years. They've become the
[42:41.720 --> 42:45.120]  dominant group because of the best prices, the best quality. You know, it's run by all
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.800]  the great folks up in Utah that are the experts in swarble foods and inventions and you know,
[42:48.800 --> 42:53.800]  all the rest of it. So much of the dental stuff in the country is developed up in Utah.
[42:53.800 --> 42:56.960]  But back when we were still at Dennis, we traveled there a lot on big supply missions
[42:56.960 --> 43:01.880]  to make deals. One of the very innovative folks up in Utah, that area, and they have
[43:01.880 --> 43:06.600]  designed incredible water filtration systems, the Alexa Pure, the owner where they got the
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.120]  name, that you hear it sold all over talk radio. You name it, we have the lowest prices
[43:12.120 --> 43:18.400]  of them for store.com. Very high quality gravity fed system that just absolutely cuts out hundreds
[43:18.400 --> 43:23.600]  of our pathogens and chemicals and hundreds of others. It lowers it to nearly non detectable.
[43:23.600 --> 43:27.280]  So you know, scientifically, they can still expect parameters fine, you know, one billionth
[43:27.280 --> 43:33.040]  of whatever in it of this or that, but it basically cuts everything out. Gliposate, fluoride,
[43:33.040 --> 43:36.280]  lead mercury, arsenic, you know, all these are fuel additives. I mean, it's just our
[43:36.280 --> 43:41.840]  water table super, super, super, you know, contaminated. Well, now they've launched something
[43:41.840 --> 43:46.200]  many years in the making. I've been hearing about it for six months. It's here. It's introduced
[43:46.200 --> 43:51.480]  today at the lowest price ever. I have air filters in my house is all the bad pollen here
[43:51.480 --> 43:58.240]  in central Texas. This thing has ratings as good as units I have that cost me a thousand
[43:58.240 --> 44:04.960]  dollars. And it's super quiet and lightweight and is the next level. And it's so inexpensive.
[44:04.960 --> 44:09.160]  I expect this to be one of our best selling products ever. And to help fund the info war
[44:09.160 --> 44:15.600]  in the small profit we do make. But Buckley's here to tell us about the Alexa Pure breeze,
[44:15.600 --> 44:20.960]  which operates as a fan. It's super quiet. It cleans the air. Every major room in your
[44:20.960 --> 44:26.400]  house really should have one of these because, you know, we put air filters on our cars. We
[44:26.400 --> 44:29.960]  put and we put water filters on the water for our bodies. But what we're breathing is so
[44:29.960 --> 44:35.360]  important as well. That's why I mean, I had the date I have it in my computer, you know,
[44:35.360 --> 44:39.320]  on my calendar was time to change the filters in the house and change the filters in my
[44:39.320 --> 44:44.960]  car because it makes the, you know, it manageable to be in the worst area for allergies in the
[44:44.960 --> 44:48.480]  United States is awesome. It's hands down. I thought it was hypochondria. My friends
[44:48.480 --> 44:51.200]  in Dallas would have it, you know, back plant football or whatever. And I moved here like
[44:51.200 --> 44:55.480]  what on earth is this? This is how I manage the allergies. Plus I take, you know, some
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.560]  of the herbal remedies that are basically just the plant itself. That's been helping
[44:59.560 --> 45:03.400]  me and wild honey. But I'm telling you, this is something everybody needs, especially in
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.960]  your baby's room, your children's room. Babies can't tell you that their nose is clogged
[45:07.960 --> 45:12.400]  up with all the artificial garbage. The houses are so toxic. Buckley, tell us about Alexa
[45:12.400 --> 45:21.520]  Pure Breeze discounted over 25% off as an introductory promotion to $184. I mean, at the normal
[45:21.520 --> 45:25.920]  price, it's already a steal and you're supporting info or tell us about Alexa Pure Breeze.
[45:25.920 --> 45:31.640]  Well, you know, you were talking about innovations and products that make, you know, humanity
[45:31.640 --> 45:35.800]  be able to progress and to be stronger and to be more clear eyed with this is definitely
[45:35.800 --> 45:41.040]  one. We've been working on this for a long time. We've rejected a lot of different models.
[45:41.040 --> 45:44.800]  A lot of them from other companies. Exactly. From other companies blown away by the, these
[45:44.800 --> 45:48.040]  guys always want the great stuff that had, you know, weird ozone smells. They were too
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.040]  loud or other problems and issues that they had. The filters were too expensive because
[45:53.040 --> 45:56.360]  that's the way they got you. You bought the unit and then later on you had to buy expensive
[45:56.360 --> 46:00.400]  filters. So at any rate, this is really, really amazing. It's the Alexa Pure Breeze. We're
[46:00.400 --> 46:06.000]  really proud to have partnered with the guys up there in Utah and it's an energy efficient
[46:06.000 --> 46:12.600]  HEPA ion cluster air purification system. And right now we're selling it for the lowest
[46:12.600 --> 46:16.480]  price available anywhere, anywhere. It's only available one other place on the internet
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.600]  and we're selling it for the introductory offer 184.99, which is over 25% off retail
[46:21.600 --> 46:28.120]  equivalent units. The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95 and there are other units
[46:28.120 --> 46:34.040]  that are up to $899 to $1,000 to do exactly what this unit does, but they're not as quiet
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.960]  because this one has a silent mode, which runs at 16 decibels and it's quieter. I can't
[46:38.960 --> 46:42.240]  hear it. It's on rather than running. It's running right now and I'll put the microphone
[46:42.240 --> 46:48.320]  up to it and you can't even hear it. I literally, it's super quiet. But however, beyond being
[46:48.320 --> 46:54.560]  quiet, it has a four stage purification process that creates superior air quality. It has
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.960]  a HEPA filter and it has other filters that go inside of it. There's a pre filters and
[46:58.960 --> 47:03.440]  a carbon activated filters. And the most amazing thing about it is that it has this patented
[47:03.440 --> 47:09.960]  ion cluster technology that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water,
[47:09.960 --> 47:13.360]  not ozone. Cause there's a lot of units out there that do that that will sterilize the
[47:13.360 --> 47:20.600]  air. They will take out toxins and microbes and biological particles out of the air, but
[47:20.600 --> 47:24.400]  you always come back into the room and the room smells, you have that ozone smell. And
[47:24.400 --> 47:27.680]  as a matter of fact, if you leave a room sealed and you have one of those running toxic, it
[47:27.680 --> 47:33.200]  is toxic and it's kind of dangerous. So this is non toxic. It's a beautiful unit. It really
[47:33.200 --> 47:36.840]  looks good. I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a corner, but beyond that,
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.440]  it is really, really powerful. It looks very modern. Absolutely. And the value is amazing
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.520]  at $184. You know, you could probably buy a couple of these for different places in your
[47:46.520 --> 47:50.280]  house and the small problem we make, which we're free market, that's good to make profit.
[47:50.280 --> 47:55.760]  We're not going to be arguing taxpayer money or MSNBC. This is free will association. Whatever
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.680]  the most innovative, cool stuff is like, like the units we sell that will charge like, you
[48:00.680 --> 48:05.480]  know, dozens of different phones and appliances and jump your car a dozen times. And it's
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.560]  like a third the size of a briefcase. And you know, it's a very best unit. When a new,
[48:09.560 --> 48:13.840]  even better unit comes out, we'll buy thousands of those and sell those. It's like whatever
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.920]  is the coolest stuff, we're always adding it to infoorstore.com to promote and fund ourselves
[48:18.920 --> 48:23.320]  with things that we ourselves like and use and have tested and think are great. You know,
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.880]  it's real simple. That's what we do at infoorstore.com. I want to thank you for funding true independent
[48:27.880 --> 48:33.880]  media this way. So folks that check that out infoorstore.com. Check out the Alexa pure family
[48:33.880 --> 48:38.240]  of water filters that are excellent as well. Pro pure is excellent as well. There's again,
[48:38.240 --> 48:41.800]  there's a lot of great brands out there, but we carry whatever is the highest quality at
[48:41.800 --> 48:47.160]  the lowest prices, 10% off promo code water on the water filtration. But this is a promo
[48:47.160 --> 48:51.600]  code needed on this to get there is no promo code. We have slashed the price to over 25%
[48:51.600 --> 48:57.960]  off of retail. And it's only 184.99 right now. You're this, the price is going to go
[48:57.960 --> 49:02.400]  up soon, like within a few days, because this is an introduction offer only. And the reason
[49:02.400 --> 49:06.680]  why is we want a lot of people out there to try it and give us their feedback on the website.
[49:06.680 --> 49:10.400]  All of our other products are rated four and a half to five stars plus notice. There's
[49:10.400 --> 49:13.600]  no ratings checks. We just started doing this five minutes ago. Exactly. So please purchase
[49:13.600 --> 49:16.720]  one of these units that are at this really, really low. And you have a sure real review.
[49:16.720 --> 49:19.360]  You know, that's what I mean. It's a third party review side. And we want to see which
[49:19.360 --> 49:22.440]  thing, but we love this. I'm going to put a bunch. In fact, I'm going to replace those
[49:22.440 --> 49:25.720]  big giant $1,000 ones because I looked at the ratings about those years ago. So stuff's
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.720]  going down in price. And this is a $184 unit. I mean, I guess I get it for 140. That's our
[49:30.720 --> 49:35.120]  big problem. Like 40 bucks. But we saw a lot of those. It'll help fund the operation. I
[49:35.120 --> 49:37.760]  mean, I want a bunch of these. I want these in the office. We already have some in the
[49:37.760 --> 49:41.680]  office, but I'm always turn that ozone thing off. That's toxic. And we only put them out
[49:41.680 --> 49:45.760]  like if you know, it floods and something leaks in the carpet stinks, you know, we bring
[49:45.760 --> 49:49.920]  those things out, but they're still not good for regular use in my research view. You can
[49:49.920 --> 49:53.640]  have your own opinion all day if you want. Yeah, that stuff will kill bacteria and stuff,
[49:53.640 --> 49:57.440]  but it will also, you know, not too hot for you in my view.
[49:57.440 --> 50:02.120]  And you know, one thing that I encourage everybody to do is go and just look up online the toxicity
[50:02.120 --> 50:07.840]  of being inside all the time. And now in this current age, we're inside the vast majority
[50:07.840 --> 50:12.160]  of the time. Hardly do we ever get outside in the sun. We're usually out inside doing
[50:12.160 --> 50:18.280]  something in our office or at home. And the houses have all kinds of stuff that's outgassing.
[50:18.280 --> 50:22.520]  Just look into it. I, I'm not going to tell you what the story is, but just go and Google
[50:22.520 --> 50:28.760]  that and look at a toxicity. Great job and great job. Alexa pure info or store.com info
[50:28.760 --> 50:33.000]  or his life.com for all the nutraceuticals. But we thank you so much, my friend. And make
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.400]  sure I get a whole bunch of those for myself. All right, we're going to go to break and
[50:36.400 --> 50:39.680]  I'm going to get into the big China. And as a supporter of local affiliates as well,
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.240]  become local sponsors. It's just as important to support local stations. Hell set them a
[50:43.240 --> 50:46.960]  hundred bucks, put a billboard up for a local affiliates. That is just as important as supporting
[50:46.960 --> 50:51.680]  our broadcast and getting the new Alexa pure brief system. When we come back, Beijing is
[50:51.680 --> 50:56.600]  setting the stage for war in the South China Sea. It's a big, thick 20 something page report

[53:09.920 --> 53:14.160]  chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[53:14.160 --> 53:19.120]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[54:27.120 --> 54:39.520]  Yeah, who are you? I mean, who is Hillary Clinton funding ISIS in al-Qaeda, going up
[54:39.520 --> 54:43.280]  to Christians and veterans, and trying to destroy the country and selling missile secrets
[54:43.280 --> 54:50.320]  out of the communist Chinese? Remember that, the MIRV technology? What do I say? I'm not
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.760]  putting up with you. What do I say? I don't care what you do to me. What do I say I'm
[54:55.760 --> 55:08.160]  coming after you? What do I say? I'm the crazy one. What do I say I'm the fearless one?
[55:08.160 --> 55:17.760]  What do I say I'm not your slave? What do I say I'm not the pretender? You're the pretender.
[55:17.760 --> 55:21.720]  You pretend you have a right to rule over humanity when you can't even rule your own
[55:21.720 --> 55:33.320]  self, you parasites. And now, we are faced with the communist Chinese with their perfected
[55:33.320 --> 55:40.960]  long march missiles in the 1990s that couldn't get off the launch pad half the time, rarely
[55:40.960 --> 55:46.680]  could get into orbit. And now they've done Chinese missile tests where they fire them
[55:46.680 --> 55:58.120]  over the North Pole and into the Atlantic North Sea. You look at a globe, you know, we
[55:58.120 --> 56:04.160]  don't fire nukes at Russia around the world. We shoot it over the top, very short distance.
[56:04.160 --> 56:08.080]  That's how Russia fires its missiles. And that's how China fires its ICBMs. But then,
[56:08.080 --> 56:15.400]  of course, they've got sea launch systems that are copies of U.S. submarine-based missiles
[56:15.400 --> 56:22.080]  and cruise missiles, exact copies, everything from our tow anti-tank missiles right down
[56:22.080 --> 56:29.840]  to our howitzers. China has it all. And our government made deals with them to move most
[56:29.840 --> 56:34.320]  of our industry there to not help the Chinese people, but to help the megabanks consolidate
[56:34.320 --> 56:42.320]  control. And now, there is a huge defense one report.
[56:42.320 --> 56:50.800]  Beijing is setting the stage for war in the South China Sea. But Hillary told ABC News
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.720]  just last week that she's tough on national security. And she just told CNN that last
[56:54.720 --> 56:59.640]  night. She said, it's obvious to voters I will put national security over self-interest.
[56:59.640 --> 57:05.160]  She said that. I put the clip earlier in the hour. We're just trying to not play it again
[57:05.160 --> 57:14.920]  because I don't want to hear her voice. It's like metal nails on a chalkboard. I absolutely
[57:14.920 --> 57:19.720]  hate that noise, don't you? It gives me the willies. And Hillary Clinton has that effect
[57:19.720 --> 57:23.120]  on me. And I've tried to get to where it doesn't happen. But when I see her with that big Joker
[57:23.120 --> 57:29.120]  smile, I am repulsed. I am physically, physically see her as a vampire. I mean, if I saw that
[57:29.120 --> 57:34.680]  in the dark, pop up with that big, think about the illusion. So that's her just looking ugly.
[57:34.680 --> 57:40.240]  Look at the one. Just type in Hillary, scary smile. And man, I just got chills thinking
[57:40.240 --> 57:46.560]  about her. I mean, she is an evil entity. Anyways, side issue. That's who with her evil
[57:46.560 --> 57:54.440]  crone is undead husband. That's more a goofy one. She's got these, these, you see the one
[57:54.440 --> 57:59.360]  where she has this fake smile. We were showing it earlier. I mean, yeah, that's what she
[57:59.360 --> 58:05.080]  really looks like. I mean, she is a psychotic look at her as psychotic demon out to mount
[58:05.080 --> 58:10.760]  our head on the wall. She wants to dominate us. And you know what? She is dominating us.
[58:10.760 --> 58:16.760]  She rules us. It shows how pathetic we are, including FBI officials looking into whether
[58:16.760 --> 58:23.680]  national security was compromised because get her off, get her off, get her off. I'm not
[58:23.680 --> 58:30.160]  kidding. I can't look. People think I'm joking. I'm not kidding. Okay. I'm sick of her squatting
[58:30.160 --> 58:36.200]  on me, ruling me, hurting my family, and selling us out. And now the Pentagon admits China's
[58:36.200 --> 58:40.480]  gearing up for war. These traitors have sold us out. These people make me want to throw
[58:40.480 --> 58:46.480]  up another idiot moron followers scum of the earth, the dumbest, most pathetic people
[58:46.480 --> 58:49.320]  on the planet that follow this worm.

[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:29.160]  Jones.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:40.040]  You want to fight? Oh, you're going to get one. I'm just dumping my full will on you.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:01:09.200]  I just overdosed on Hillary Clinton. And, uh, I just overdosed on Hillary Clinton.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.360]  And, uh, went into absolute panic mode. That's okay. Yes, Hillary makes me go crazy. I was
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.160]  actually laughing during the break. Like a 70 second break. I started watching the video.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:26.720]  It's up on info wars.com. Let's get this queued up. Threat to freedom. Feminist goons wage
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:33.960]  war on free speech. Look at how that woman looks. Talk about scramble braid and it says
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:40.600]  threat to freedom. First amendment now attacked as much as the second. I love the new name
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:49.880]  bigs is giving her Alice the goon. And look, these are dangerous anti free speech people.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:56.880]  So they need to be demonized because they're not letting us try to have our free speech
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.400]  and they are acting like demons. So you're not demonizing them when you point out what
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.800]  they've done. We need to exercise our free speech or lose it to these authoritarians.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.260]  This woman has the same look on her eye. It's like, you know, I see like Chinese police
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.320]  when they're dragging some dissonant off and there's look at her. I mean that that that
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.280]  thousand yard stare. She thinks people at university being able to speak some libertarian
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.720]  gay guy is sick of people telling him what he can and can't do what words he can use.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.640]  So we're going to get that guy on the show. Bigs is out there covering it. He's like
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.000]  the Breitbart editor for tech and they just are crazy. It says Alice the good and her
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.520]  fellow feminists. These aren't empowering women. Look at these women want to eradicate
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.880]  the first amendment because free speech hurts their feelings. And again, I'm not against
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.360]  these women because they I don't know what they're into. But you know, she looks like
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.200]  she's into the Rachel Maddow Janet, Janet Reno style selection. And I mean, you know,
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.600]  I'm the same way. I don't like having to mess with my hair and stuff. I got short hair.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.440]  I mean, I don't a lot of women who have short hair. I mean, that's fine. You know, dress
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.560]  like a guy or whatever. My big thing is you just need to leave me alone. Let me have my
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.600]  own life. That's how that works because you have no idea what I do in my life. You have
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.280]  no idea what I'm into. You have no idea in your little fantasy land how people actually
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.480]  operate and you want to just tell everybody what to do and then we're going to follow
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.720]  your roadmap. You see, let's say I agree with you 80%, which I don't. But let's just say
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.560]  I agree with you 100%. You're not going to dictate to everybody how they talking what
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.960]  they do. You understand that. That's not liberal. And so we're going to ridicule you because
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.880]  you need to be ridiculed. You are a joke. You're, these people are trying to block things
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.040]  and these in the social justice warriors and black lives matter are trying to violently
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.600]  push police horses over and laugh when the horse breaks its leg and then has to be killed
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.080]  in the video. I'm celebrating and whooping and whooping and running around. These people
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.280]  are aggressive. They're dangerous. Most of them want to lock conservatives up in FEMA
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.160]  camps and they, they're out of control. Now I want to be able to play these videos for
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.920]  you, but there's so much cussing by that. I know we have a limited crew, but by the
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.360]  time bigs gets here on a lot of books from vacation right now, it's kind of summer vacation
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.520]  time. We have a skeleton crew right now. Can somebody get me some of these leads so I can
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.280]  play some of them because they are golden. Of course we should send it all off to the
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:28.520]  drudge mothership. You know, these are funny headlines, but threat to freedom. Feminist
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.560]  goons wage war on speech. First woman now attacked as much as a second. And I would
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:39.080]  just say threat to freedom. Feminist crazed feminists try to block free speech in California.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:45.680]  I mean, I mean, that's what it is. So Alice, the goon is set to probably be a new meme.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:53.000]  Now she's not going to be as good as Carl the Cuck or AIDS Screelex, according to the
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:02.400]  popular nomenclature. I don't know the real names and other people. You're a white male.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.760]  New research is warning about a possible link between common over the counter medications
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:12.800]  and dementia. CBS2 reports an antihistamine known as Difenhydramine may increase the
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.960]  risk of dementia and even cause irreparable harm. It's commonly sold as Benadryl and
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:23.120]  it's included in many over the counter medications for cold and allergies. It also causes drowsiness
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.560]  so it's popular in sleep aids such as Tylenol PM, Advil PM and Zequal. Recent research
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.600]  found that older adults who took these type of drugs continuously for years performed
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:38.200]  worse on tests that measured short term memory, verbal reasoning, planning and problem solving.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.680]  And now experts are concerned that the cognitive functions lost might not come back even after
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.640]  stopping the medications. Now the studies are not conclusive but it does add more credence
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:53.240]  to the idea that in our overly medicated society we are the long term test subjects.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:06:23.160]  Leigh-Anne McAdder reporting for infowars.com.

[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:25.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. I have got literally hundreds of really important
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.760]  news items that in the next two or three hours we're going to at least mention most of them
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.000]  here today. A lot of clips I want to play. We're now in the second hour. Thanks for
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.680]  joining us. Before we go to Pastor Manning who is a monthly guest with us of Othla World
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:43.200]  Church based in Harlem and to get his analysis. Let me throw a few stories out for stations
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.720]  that just joined us. Despite the fact that I have hundreds of stories I'm going to go
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.760]  back to something I've been covering for over a week and really hammering. And I loved
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:56.840]  Donald Trump's instincts because nine times out of ten he goes with what I'm already covering
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:02.160]  days after we are hammering and days after Drudge is hammering and or somebody like Pastor
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.120]  Manning who's met with him several times is hammering. He just gets the zeitgeist. He's
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.960]  like us. He doesn't like the tyranny. And Katie Couric has had her Brian Williams moment
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:18.360]  in this documentary we covered a whole bunch the last few weeks where she asked them how
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:22.080]  do you stop criminals from getting guns without background checks. And the answer is criminals
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.880]  will always get guns without background checks. You have more guns to counter them and that
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:31.120]  causes a lower crime rate historically. And they all answered that way. She just cut to
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.040]  them sitting there in the chairs. We've already covered it but for new listeners it's the
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.520]  Katie Couric gun documentary controversy. Just Google that you'll get hundreds of stories.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.320]  And she's already you know nobody wants to watch her nobody likes her. She's already
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.040]  washed up failure losers Trump tweeted. But now he's talking about her given when he gives
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:54.160]  speeches how she's emblematic of the sleazy media. In fact let's cue it up and play it
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.920]  since you guys were able to draw that up so fast because this is so central. I've had
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:06.760]  them do stuff like this to me. Or I've had them when I've been on CNN live the satellite
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.320]  cut my audio off for 10 seconds and then the host is going answer my question why won't
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.440]  you answer it and you're going and they're asking you if you're a racist or they're asking
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.120]  you if you support the Boston bombing. And then later you get off and your phone's ringing
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.480]  and everybody's like why didn't you answer that. This is what they did to Trump on the
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:31.520]  thing with whatever his name is the Klansman David Duke. I mean they cut your audio off
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.680]  you're sitting there asking excuse me what was that question. He already said dozens
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.400]  of times he didn't like David Duke. He said it a decade ago before it was ever a controversy.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:44.760]  But see this is how they do it. But why it's important is I figured out about a decade
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.320]  ago and would start telling CNN as I've been on there probably 40 50 times over the years
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.160]  and Fox and others but CNN was the worst. CNN is the most deceptive MSNBC is openly
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.840]  evil and worse overall but CNN is more deceptive. You know blue screens they say they're in
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:10.840]  Iraq they're in Atlanta blue screens up at the tragic events in Newtown. I don't know
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.360]  what's going on at CNN but they're very deceptive is what I'm getting at. But the reason I bring
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.560]  this story up first Pastor Manning will cover the waterfront that he wants to get into is
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.000]  we started recording it and started telling CNN we're recording the whole thing with our
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.120]  own camera in the studio because they have a satellite studio here in Austin and that's
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.880]  when they quit interviewing us entirely because they couldn't game things and manipulate it.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.200]  They would tape it and then tell their viewers it was live. They'd say it was live later
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.560]  and even have it taped. This is how they game things. And so the fact that people now when
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.120]  they get interviewed for a documentary or for CNN or Fox or whatever it is they record
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.920]  it. Then the interview comes out and they show what really happened and it'll destroy
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:12:00.160]  these dirty, slimy people's so-called careers because they deserve to be destroyed because
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:06.480]  they're deceivers of the people and they're deceiving people to take a basic right hard
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:14.040]  fought for. And so I call it the New World Order's Brian Williams moment. Hillary Clinton's
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.320]  Brian Williams moment. Katie Couric's Brian Williams moment. They are the Brian Williams
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:25.080]  media. A bunch of lion fake garbage with stolen glory telling you things that are completely
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:31.920]  and totally utterly untrue and are scientists of deception. Remember Gruber four years ago,
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.680]  three years ago saying on all those C-SPAN videos, thank God the American people are
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.120]  so stupid. I was brought into double and triple prices for the insurance companies and rip
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.640]  them off and he'd sit there at universities with PhDs and with other professors nodding
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.240]  and worshiping. Oh, we can be liars too. See, that's the new economy is lying and deceiving.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:13:01.400]  It's always been there. But now these guys get out in the open and lie to everyone and
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.760]  then tell us that they're producing something and they're great people. Katie Couric is
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:12.880]  a predator. Katie Couric literally wants to deceive you and I know most of you know that
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:18.760]  but we should not just let them sit up there and lie. We should destroy them because they're
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:24.360]  trying to destroy us is my point. And that's what Trump's doing when they're like, you
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.680]  know, he gets millions of dollars raised, get six million pledged a few months ago.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.760]  It finally all came in. People pledged, sir, I'm going to give a million. I'm going to
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.960]  give a half million. I'm going to give a hundred thousand. All these businessmen, he knows.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.440]  He marks it down his book. He goes, we have six million pledged. Remember when he was
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.000]  winning those primaries? The media goes, he didn't really get six million. He just lied
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.200]  to you and he goes, I said pledged. Well, he has the event. Six million has come in.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:53.000]  They go, you didn't have it. You lied. See, they try to take truthfulness as if it's a
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.240]  lie and then they take the lie and sell it as if it's the truth is what I'm getting at.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.880]  And he just goes, you're a sleaze, ABC reporter. You're a sleaze. You're a liar. You're pathetic.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:10.200]  He goes, okay, let's call these veterans groups up. How much money did I give you that was
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:21.280]  collected? 100%. Most charities keep 60, 70%. 100%. Let's see, they can turn Trump matching
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.040]  people's funds, 100%, giving millions of dollars himself. They can turn that into a bad thing.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.480]  But you know what? They can't do that anymore. So Pastor Manning joins us. We're going to
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:36.920]  cover a lot of news in this hour with him today. Pastor Manning of otlaatlah.org. And
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.080]  he is a prominent pastor. He was speaking out against Obama from before he was even elected
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.240]  warning of the great evil. I thought he was not exaggerating, but I thought he was miscalculating
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:49.000]  how bad it would be. I was wrong. It's far worse than I thought. It's been dead on. He
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.760]  has waged war against Christians. He is a wicked devil and he's being opposed by folks
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.920]  right there in Harlem, like Pastor Manning also called for the boycott and the kicking
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.960]  of Sharpton off of MSNBC. That happens. So he's got a lot of courage because let me tell
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.440]  you, the kingpin in Harlem, at least for 30 years has been Al Sharpton. So to take on
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.360]  a kingpin in New York is a big deal. So I admire Pastor James David Manning for his
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:21.000]  courage, otlaatlah.org. So God bless you, my friend. And you heard my little five minute
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.640]  intro here. Do you think it's, I mean, you get, do you get my point of we need to punish
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:30.320]  these media whores and go after them and bring them down so the other liars know they're
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.920]  not safe? Of course. And in fact, Alex, what you're saying
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.840]  with respect to Donald Trump's natural instinct to be truthful, to be powerful, to be fearless,
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.040]  that's natural for him. He doesn't have to think about that. He doesn't have to have
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:48.880]  the poll, people in the polls or pre meditate what he's going to do. But you know, the other
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.840]  thing there's a scientific axiom that says for every action, there's an opposite and
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:16:00.520]  equal reaction. And that is true as well. As a result of Donald Trump's natural instinct
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:07.160]  to be powerful, to be truthful, to be fearless, it brings out the natural instinct of the
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.920]  media to be sleazy, to be skanked, to be liars, to be dishonest, to be deceitful. That's just
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:18.360]  the opposite reaction that they have to Trump. Now, you notice if there's someone else, I
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.560]  don't know if they're Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton or whoever the hell else else
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:27.680]  that comes on, they treat them differently because their natural reaction is different.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:34.000]  But with Trump, the media is just getting worse. And the stronger he gets, the more
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.440]  I suppose skanky or sleazy they become. So that's why that's happening, and it's going
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:47.320]  to continue in that mode as well, as long as Trump is in the public spotlight.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:53.160]  You targeted Sharpton and deservedly really crippled him. I'd say he's 80% fallen. He
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:58.320]  deserves it. We're going after Williams, Couric, all these folks, not in a vindictive way.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.000]  These are lying predators squatting on us. Right. And if we just start going after them,
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  they always fall.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.160]  Hello. Are you there? Yes, Pastor. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Sorry, Scott Blumtow.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.360]  Go ahead, sir. Yeah, you're right. We need to go after them. We went out to Sharpton and
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:20.320]  let me say that we went out to him and God took him down. Listen, Alex, Sharpton had
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:28.440]  a six o'clock spot on MSNBC, drive time, people just getting home, watching the news for more
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:34.440]  than three and a half years. We went after him. We went down to MSNBC and stood in front
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.120]  of the studio. They're at Rockefeller Center. For eight hours, we stood in front of that
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.280]  studio and called Sharpton out. He wouldn't come out. In fact, all the other reporters
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.920]  that worked for MSNBC went in another door. We found out exactly what door they go into
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:54.480]  when they go in to report for duty. Anyway, he came down. God took him down. We shut down
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.280]  a local restaurant. It was a very powerful restaurant here in New York City. We went
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:05.320]  before that restaurant one Sunday afternoon without people out in front of that restaurant,
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:11.200]  telling them that they're advertising on Sharpton's broadcast. And we were there for 15 minutes,
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.000]  a hot 15 minutes. The manager, who was in someplace else, owner of the restaurant called
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.720]  us and said they'll never advertise on MSNBC again. He's gone. He's now at eight o'clock
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:26.520]  on Sunday morning. There's nobody watching him now. It's just a matter of time now before
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520]  he completely fades.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.080]  Sure, they say face. That's what they did with that Pierce Morgan guy.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.840]  Yeah, right, right. They gave him that, but he's gone. He's through. But we need to, I
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.280]  mean, you're going after Katie Couric. She needs to be going after. The truth of the
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.280]  matter is there's nothing left there. She's hanging on by a wing and a press. She's not
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.000]  entertaining. She's certainly not a good journalist. Yeah, she makes fraudulent documentaries
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  now.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.360]  Yeah, but you know, the other thing you were talking about how CNN, I've watched you on
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.200]  CNN on several times and how they manipulate your presence there. But I was amazed that
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.520]  you were able to satellite broadcast, bring your own camera in to see it in because, you
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.480]  know, they're very strict about that kind of thing. But I've watched them, how they manipulate.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.600]  And they too, by the way, Alex have a sense of evil, have a sense of lying and a sense
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.080]  of deception. We got to reach the people that watch CNN and let them know what's being done
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.880]  to them, that they're being brainwashed, that they're allowed to be.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:26.120]  That's a great point. There's still a remnant of people that buy into mainstream media. Now,
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.080]  the general public still somewhat asleep too, but they get the propaganda from entertainment
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.640]  and things that are embedded in media. That's why Obama goes on every show in the sun from
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.640]  ESPN to Jimmy Fallon. How do we reach those people that are still in Zombo land, Pastor
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640]  Manning?
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.280]  Well, you know, we got to continue to do what we're doing. But I think one of the great
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:49.360]  rate ways that I reached them here is by staring up the truth here in Harlem. I get the attention
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:55.280]  of the New York Times and a lot of these people are New York Times readers of the CNN people.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:00.160]  They're in that liberal mode that there was nothing too aggressive. But when you actually
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.360]  confront them with the troops, such as what I do, confronting black people, and there
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.840]  may be something that perhaps I can only I can do because I'm able to confront black
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.400]  people in Harlem. I've been to tell them the truth. I've been able to tell them about
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:20.200]  themselves, about the EBT cards, about their track phones, about this so-called black president.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:24.760]  That gets the media stirred to the point where they come to talk to me. And that way I can
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.640]  get these same people that listen to CNN, watch CNN, and get a little sentiments of
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.960]  truth there, if you will, a piece of truth. But it's very difficult because they insulate
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:38.120]  it. And they've got the media coverage, so they don't let a person like yourself get
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:42.760]  to them, but we can get them. Sure. And just to clarify, I would say that
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.560]  I'm not doing the interview unless I can have my own camera person there. I would then record
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.160]  what was really said. They would try to distort it later, and I would show it was really said.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.680]  And so then they just stopped interviewing me. Like you said, they're very controlling.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.480]  Period. And for years I wasn't on until they agreed to have me live with Piers Morgan, and
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:02.720]  they cut that short as well. So that's why they never let me on live because they want
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.480]  to act like it's live with the host. Take an hour before, edit it however they want,
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:10.760]  get your audio off, play games, and try to make it look like you said things you didn't
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:11.760]  say.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.280]  You know, I saw, I saw a clip I think was on CNN a week or so ago, where, no, it was
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:23.000]  on MSNBC, where they were talking about how Trump was on your broadcast and how you, and
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.600]  trying to align Trump with being off the charts or lose cannon because he talks to Alex Jones.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.680]  I was sitting there watching it. And that's exactly, I think it was MSNBC, Chris Matthews,
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:38.280]  I don't know that creep, that low life. It's all over. Yeah. Slimeball is his name. Yeah,
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.360]  that's okay. He hosts the show. Slimeball. Yeah. Okay. All right. But he's the one who
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:48.080]  said it. Oh, Trump, it talks to loose counters like, like Alex Jones had your picture up
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.520]  there and had you. I mean, he stayed on you for a while. And the other little guy that
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:57.200]  comes on after him went after you as well, as well. I said, why, why they're trying to
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:02.160]  skew Alex? Because they know if Trump goes with hardcore Americana, he will win. They're
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.400]  trying to manipulate his campaign people to buy into the fact that, oh, don't go in the
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.000]  briar patch. And of course, Trump's smart. He's jumping in the briar patch because he
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.520]  knows that's where the populism is. Listen, behind the scenes, maybe they may be thinking
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.080]  as well, Alex, that if Trump wins, which I think he's going to do, that that's going
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.440]  to elevate your position to reach a lot of people because Trump is going to come. You're
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.840]  right. The New York Times actually said that last week. They said it's horrible. Alex Jones
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.880]  and they're afraid of you. It's not Trump. They're afraid of whether they are afraid
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.240]  of Trump, but they will be afraid of your influence. And you too. It's just everybody
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.880]  that's straight talking. That's all we're doing. But the New York Times actually said
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:40.680]  that they said the horror of Alex Jones being elevated and legitimate. And they said, it
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.600]  appears it's already happened. Right. Right. I mean, the whole Pentagon listens. Of course,
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.000]  it already happened. Absolutely. So that's the thing they're afraid of. And I think
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.960]  that's the thing that needs to happen in America. You know, it has been reported throughout
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.560]  history that, you know, you rise, you fall, you go up, you go down. Kingdoms come and
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:03.520]  kingdoms fall. And it's their era is ending. Their era is ending. Is that what you're
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.240]  saying? That's all. That's all I'm trying to say. That's exactly what I'm trying to
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:09.560]  say. So what's coming, my friend? Well, I think persons such as yourself are coming
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:15.200]  and modestly, I'd like to think that I am coming as well. Modestly, I'd like to say,
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:21.920]  but to be sure, persons like yourself are coming. Drudge needs more exposure as well.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.800]  Because they beat Drudge down. We need Breitbart out there more effectively as well. And I
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:32.720]  think once we get that kind of an American patriotic, if you will, with a godly Christian
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:38.880]  base dealing with America again, we can see America in fact, Trump is going to need you,
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.440]  Breitbart and Drudge to make America great again. Hell, the New York Times is not going
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:47.040]  to help him. Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, they're not going to help him. So he's
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040]  going to need people like that.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.720]  Sure, if they endorse him, that will hurt him. And they're just now figuring out 6% of
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.320]  the public trust mainstream media. But getting a side Alex Jones or Matt Drudge, because
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.960]  we're all in this fight like you to fight tyranny, we're just manifestations are growing
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:04.480]  success and the establishment's fear that they have no credibility. It's not that we're
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:09.120]  that good. It's that they're that bad. As you said earlier, Trump just naturally somebody
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.600]  charges a stage. He runs at them. You know, somebody gets in his face and lies about him.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.160]  He says, you're a piece of garbage liar. You know, they're so scared of the fact. But then
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.120]  they get around evil people like Hillary or Obama or Michael Moore, they all just fawn
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:28.200]  over each other. In fact, I know two people that know the heir to the Astor fortune, tens
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.080]  of billions of dollars folks and hidden assets and things like that. CIA operative Anderson
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.480]  Cooper folks looking up. He's really CIA and disinformation operative.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.040]  His mother's Gloria Vandebel. You know, you know, his mother is Gloria Vandebel. That's
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.160]  who his mother was. I think she's deceased now.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.240]  Absolutely. So he's the heir to that. And I have multiple people that know him and I'm
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:53.160]  going to stop there. He had a driver for three years that he never talked to. And people
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:57.760]  that work for him are told don't look him in the eye. He doesn't give people bonuses
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.840]  reportedly. It's the same with Hillary and all of them. These people don't like Hillary.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.520]  They don't pay their taxes. They steal money from charities. I'm about Hillary. Now he
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.880]  they don't, you can't look him in the eye. They're the most hateful, anti liberal people
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.240]  on earth. And they sit up there telling us all day how they love us and how they love
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.680]  America and how they're the moral authority when he's a guy worth billions and billions
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:25.240]  of dollars in tax free foundations in the CIA, attacking America and won't even talk to
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.960]  his driver or his butler for three years, sir.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:34.160]  Exactly what you have just said is the reason why the media is attacking Trump the way they're
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:39.600]  attacking him because they recognize a Trump presidency. Forget about the Trump president.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.200]  And he treats his employees super good and is super real. That's what they're scared
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:47.920]  of. Let's just look at a Trump candidacy, how the Trump candidacy is revealing all
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.120]  the things you've just said about the billions of not millions, but billions of dollars
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.280]  are being stole. The fact that they don't pay taxes, the fact that the CIA becomes their
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:02.000]  own protective security agency and how they, if you will, propagandize everything to the
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.360]  American people who are still asleep in their sofas, riding around their silver rodders
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.640]  and not paying attention to what the hell is going on. That's what a Trump candidacy
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.560]  is done. Imagine what a Trump presidency will do.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.160]  Exactly. But getting off on that rant, when you talk about Henry Kissinger, Hillary, Michael
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.960]  Moore, any of them, I've seen them personally around their people. They treat their people
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:28.640]  like they're not human. You're not supposed to look them in the eyes. These are monstrous
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.320]  people. How could you have a driver for three years? I mean, I'd be my driver. I don't have
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.400]  a driver, but I'd be, they'd be my best friend probably in a month or something. I just don't
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.480]  get how you can be around people. You said something a few moments ago early on in your
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:49.480]  first segment about demonizing. And then you went on to explain that in a great way that
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.120]  you're referencing that they're demonizing or that they have demons rather because they
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.800]  are demonizing, which makes a whole lot of sense. I forgot exactly how you said it.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.240]  And I kind of let it get passed out. Well, we have to demonize them because they are
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.920]  out coming after us acting like demons. They are demons. So when we expose them, we're
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.360]  demonizing them because they are demons. So when you talk about people like Henry Kissinger,
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.680]  and Bill Clinton, and all the rest of that crowd, you just made mention of these people
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.320]  are high into demon possession. They just are. Listen, Alex, you cannot reach the level
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:24.520]  of debauchery and evil that they are in and still be a Sunday school student. You just
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:31.120]  can't do it. It is required. It is a require, a requirement that you have a certain amount
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.360]  of demonic power to be part of the club. You got to do bad things.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.040]  Absolutely. Absolutely. So they got to be demon inspired to do what they do. And we need to
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.880]  maybe, you know, but they present this facade to the people. The press then in cold case
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.360]  that facade make people think that out there that was just watching in their easy chair
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.960]  that these are normal people that have just worked very hard to become who the hell they
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.560]  are. That's not true at all. It's just the opposite of that.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:02.640]  They've been led into a evil society. It's a spirit. They've been led into a cult of
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.200]  no name, a cult of predators. I mean, you think about the Skull and Bone Society, which
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.360]  all the bushes belong to, the Yale students all participate in, where you lie in a coffin
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.600]  and people come by and urinate on you. You know, you can think about what does that do
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:24.240]  to a person's psyche and where do you have to be in order to want to be a part of that.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:29.800]  And then once you get out of that so that piss soaked coffin, what are you willing to
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.920]  do or say or be if you allow yourself to do that or participate and say, I'd never let
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.640]  another man piss on me while I'm lying. And by the way, that's only the first level of
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:47.000]  it. It goes right into hardcore stuff later. I'm glad you pointed that up. But yeah, that's
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.240]  so that's what we're, that's what we're dealing with in America, Alex. And, you know, as you
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.000]  stated earlier, we're not that good at what we do. I mean, okay, we might know something
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:03.920]  about you by broadcasting, but it's just that what they do is so obviously evil. And thank
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:08.760]  God some of us have the ability to look and to see what they're doing. And I, you know,
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.520]  I want to thank God for your audience too, Alex. I think you have to give them credit
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:18.040]  that they're able to hear you. Yeah, because listen, I mean, you can you imagine how your
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:23.840]  audience people to listen to you all over the world, but especially in America are bombarded
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:30.520]  by their coworkers, bombarded by the liberal media, bombarded by the politicians to try
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.120]  to break the bullying. The bullying doesn't control them. I want to ask you to agree with
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:38.080]  you another great turning's coming. They know a time of great changes coming. They're trying
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:43.400]  to stop that. What do you expect to see in the future? What will Obama do? What are you
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:50.320]  watching on your radar? Pastor Manning is our guest, otla.org. I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com.

[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.800]  statistics despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.360]  and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.360]  are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:27.720]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.160]  with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity

[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:20.560]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:49.600]  Jones show. Get on with the fascination. You know, our founders in this country were
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.480]  predominantly Christians. They were predominantly Protestants. Nothing against Catholics. I don't
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:59.640]  get into that whole bash fest. But they really wanted to build a free world and they tried
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:05.680]  to end the evils of slavery in Europe. And England finally did end it and ended it worldwide.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.400]  Put ships on the seas for 50 years to kill anybody that was running slaves. And then
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.360]  America tried to end it in 1776 but could. And we ended up having a horrible civil war
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.560]  that killed over a million people. But you notice in the modern age they always pointed
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:23.160]  at America's evils but not that slavery is going on in the Middle East right now. The
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:30.000]  women are slaves. And I raise that point every day because they're demonizing the idea of
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.800]  Christ eliminating us. You know, the Luminati, that's the Luminati, no. The globalists saw
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.300]  our revolution, the Jacobins, they created the French Revolution. They created a counterfeit
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:45.960]  to the Christians that wanted to bring light to the world, who wanted to truly build a
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.160]  new world. They knew they couldn't end all that corruption in that system. They tried
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:56.160]  to set up a new one and it wasn't perfect either. But it had the idea to reach for something
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:03.720]  better. And that's why you only hear about the sins of America or the West because the
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:09.640]  globalists are against that because they want to go back to tyranny. Back to older and Western
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:16.160]  tyranny, similar to what Rome had. Absolute rule, absolute control. And that's where we're
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.720]  going today. And I simply don't like seeing people oppressed or controlled. And I see
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.720]  the social justice war as I'm going to pass your money about this in a moment. We have
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:30.600]  like, it's got to be 15, 20 videos or more. New ones are going up every 10 minutes. Biggs
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.840]  is just doing a great job by himself. We didn't have the crew or we're short on crew right
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.520]  now because folks are on vacation and he wanted to go out to California to follow the social
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:45.320]  justice wars at universities where any libertarians or Christians or a conservative speak, they
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:49.960]  come to shut it down. Or even folks that are concerned about liberals are putting this
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:56.240]  on. I'd call the guy part liberal from Breitbart, their tech editor, who is, you know, against
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.600]  them trying to ban free speech, even though he is AKA a homosexual, they don't even want
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.080]  to let him speak. So these people are anti free speech. I think that's going to be their
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:12.680]  answer to the new enlightenment, the new renaissance of awakening and empowerment that we're starting
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.920]  to see happen worldwide because things got to get bad before they get better. We're talking
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.800]  to Pastor Manning here in just a moment. I want to have your quick questions or comments
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.520]  for Pastor Manning here in about 10 minutes, 800-25-99-231. He's going to get a bunch of
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:29.960]  you on 800-25-99-231. Pastor Manning will release about five after next hour. Then Joe
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:33.480]  Biggs is going to be joining us from the ground in the middle of this. He's already been
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:39.160]  to two universities. It's total battle. These people are attacking, screaming racist. They're
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:43.320]  mainly white people screaming. You're a white male. You're not allowed to speak. I mean,
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:50.320]  it is the most bizarre stuff you've ever seen. It's like that guardian guy that is saying
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.480]  that whites are inherently evil and the guy looks like he's like 80% Anglo. It's just
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:00.320]  a reverse mental illness, racism. I want to ask Pastor Manning what he calls it. I call
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:06.280]  it divide and conquer, but we're going to be talking about that in just a minute.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:10.960]  Now briefly, we are listener-supported. I'm going to leave it at that. So is Pastor Manning
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:15.400]  with his broadcast, what he does, feeding hundreds of children and youth a day, really
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.720]  waking up Harlem. He's a great place for you to support as well. He didn't pay me to say
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.200]  that. I get guests on. I admire and I appreciate. I think you ought to know about. It's just
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.360]  hard for me to find good churches to tithe to. I do give the Salvation Army and just
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.720]  some small country churches and things, but most of these big mega churches are just sold
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:37.000]  out to make her by feel good and not stand, you know, find a church that goes and protest
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.600]  abortion clinics. That's where you ought to be given money or replace it, feed poor people
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:44.200]  or a place that goes and gets bums off the street and tries to rehabilitate them. You
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:49.040]  know, that's what this comes down to and he's doing it. So outlet.org. I think folks should
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.720]  support him. If you really want to bring some light to Harlem and he's brought already brought
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.880]  a lot of light with his great congregation. They're very exciting and we need to be supported
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:02.600]  and our local affiliates need to be supported. We have the new Alexa pure breeze energy efficient
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:08.360]  HEPA ion cluster air purification system. This is the highest rated. There are similar
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:13.760]  units that are upwards of $1000. This is normally 200 and something bucks. It's 184 introductory
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.560]  offer for states purification process for superior air quality patented ion cluster
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:24.480]  technology kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water. No ozone. That's
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.880]  good. Cause all those, those own machines are toxic in my view. I mean, I know when something
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.240]  makes me feel sick, intelligent air quality sensor and indicators, easy to clean and maintain
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:43.000]  silent mode, 16 DB quieter than the whisper energy efficient cycles 120 feet every 12
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.480]  minutes, air change per hour, ACH exceeds allergy and asthma foundation recommendations,
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.680]  space saving design about the size of a large briefcase, perfect for rooms up to 800 square
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.320]  feet. One purification unit with ion cluster technology, one pre filter, one true HEPA
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:03.880]  filter, one carbon activated filter. And these last a long time. You can also clean them.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:09.960]  We have a breakdown of them up against leading competitors. It's just amazing. The innovation,
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.400]  we only bring in the very best sponsors. We direct sell this to you from the manufacturer
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.360]  in Utah. They're patriots. So it's a win, win, win, support the show, support American
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:23.200]  industry, support your family info or store.com. And I'd buy one of these for every room. Just
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.400]  buy one, see if you like it and then get more. It's truly amazing. They make great water

[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.600]  if I've got to work at night. I mean, I've had one cup of coffee today and I'm bouncing
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:52.000]  off the walls. So I don't need more energy with super male vitality and X2. But but
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.200]  if you want to kick in the pants, this is it. So my buddy took, he took three knockouts
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.280]  last night and he could hardly get up this morning. So when you take our sleep aid, I
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.280]  wouldn't take more than two folks and throw plexus back in stock. It's basically like
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.760]  the powder version, the lower price, but high quality of a super male vitality. Secret

[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:19.760]  life.com as well. So thank you so much again for joining us. I don't do a plug every segment
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.240]  like most of us. I do like a five minute plug each hour. And please support us because
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.680]  you are what allows us to continue on. And we're all in this together. I want to thank
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:32.160]  you all and salute you all for your support, your prayers, most importantly. And then of
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:35.680]  course, spread the word about the broadcast. They're trying to censor us. They're globally
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:41.040]  announcing censorship. And that's what I want to turn to now. They have somehow taken liberals
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.040]  who had a lot of good ideas about empowering everybody and everybody a shot. They just
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.440]  stole the Christian ethic of the abolitionist. That wasn't just here. That was in Europe.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:54.720]  And that's what happened. And they just turned it into a social justice warrior thing now
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:58.960]  where they want to get rid of speech and the right of assembly and Christians rights in
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.200]  the name of total equality. Now you can't say mother or father on government forums
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.480]  or say it in school, literally, because that might hurt somebody who doesn't have a mother
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.040]  or father. See, now you can't have something because somebody else doesn't have it. This
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.480]  is going into pure communism. All the elite are offshore and you know, have billions of
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:22.720]  dollars in red carpets. It's so hypocritical. But they're also promoting globally with Facebook
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.440]  and others with the EU to start. Just don't criticize this one. We're going to arrest
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.080]  your kick off Facebook. The global initiative to censor is now here because they want to
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:37.320]  hold back humanity, wanting choice, wanting true diversity, wanting the power to discriminate.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.120]  Yeah, it's wrong to discriminate against somebody just because they're a woman or they're a man
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.920]  or they're white or they're black or whatever. But to say I go to this restaurant because
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:50.320]  their food's better than the other restaurant where I get food poisoning, that's discrimination.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.760]  If you're walking down the street and there's potholes and you step over once, you don't
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:59.120]  get your shoes wet, that's discrimination. If you hire somebody and that you catch them
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:04.920]  stealing a day after, discrimination is just knowing what's going on. So they've twisted
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:10.280]  words and I think we're going to see a huge reign of censorship. My response is don't
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.160]  get into it. But Pastor Manny, you've got the floor the next 10 minutes or so before
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.440]  we go to calls. Correct me if I'm wrong. Augment that. Take your time. Walk through how you
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.760]  think they're going to counter strike this huge global awakening that's happening, sir.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.840]  But in a couple of things, Alex, I think that we need to be very mindful of a post-Obama
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:34.320]  era. And one of the things that I've noticed about the recent activities of Obama, number
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:40.280]  one was that he, the first of the president to visit some maximum security prisons and
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:46.040]  to begin to hammer the judges, the Supreme courts and the federal courts to release their
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:51.440]  sentence practices on prisoners and to try to reverse some of the sentences that have
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.280]  already been handed down, given the opportunity for many of these prisoners, people that are
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:03.120]  in prison that are inculcated with Islam because black men to go to prison, learn about Islam.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:08.360]  It's a very pervasive in the prisons, but also black men to go to prison and white
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:13.760]  folk, they are very inculcated with the whole idea of hating America. And they already had
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.120]  to have a before going to prison to become criminals. They had a warped sense of what
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:25.520]  is right and what is wrong in a warped sense of justice. I'm very concerned now as well
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:32.680]  that the movie industry has all of a sudden released a remake of the 1970s edition of
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:39.280]  the eight segment movie of Root that stirred the hearts of young men that sent men to prison
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:48.440]  in large numbers. Root as a documentary declaring that it was authentic, demonstrating the horrific
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.520]  or alleged horrific events that happened to black people with the slave trade, where most
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:58.600]  of the slave trade went on in Africa with blacks on blacks, that haven't been said,
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:04.080]  but I see a storm coming with the releasing of Root.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:11.720]  Oh the media is hyping race war 24 seven everywhere. No one's defending European slavery, but exactly
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.280]  no one talks about that everybody's done it, it's wrong, it's evil, humans are wicked,
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.000]  we should repent, but they are just hyping it. What's going on?
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  Well I think that we're going to see the release of a lot of prisoners and I think that most
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.600]  Americans are locked and loaded and ready to deal with whatever comes down.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.440]  I was about to ask you, what do you think this moved by Obama because obviously there's
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:35.720]  a lot of nonviolent people and prisoners should be let out, but what about this push to let
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.440]  violent felons out, what's behind that? Because I think that he wants to return to a period
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:46.720]  of the 1960s, the 60s and the 70s where the black panthers with the Mao Mao's knew where
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:52.320]  black liberation groups, if you will, were very prevalent, that mindset is still locked
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:57.440]  away in prison. What you have today with the rappers, young black men that are rappers
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:02.800]  and wear their pants below their butts, they don't have that kind of mindset and hatred
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:08.200]  against America. I think that Obama's setting up preachers to come back from the prison
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:14.720]  and reignite communities and I would say anybody living within 100 to 150 miles of a major
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:22.160]  urban area need to get prepared to see the riot and if anything goes amiss or awry with
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:28.080]  Obama or somehow another Obama or something done to Obama's political ideas such as the
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:35.480]  removal of Obamacare. I mean, listen, Alex, if Trump or anyone else were to take down
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:42.320]  Obamacare and it effectively goes away, you can see these people coming from prison now
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.040]  training young men who now wear their pants below their butts, rapping but really having
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:53.280]  no teeth now beginning to look like the 60s, the mid 60s and the early 70s when it comes
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:59.280]  to the Viacom CIA run weapon system is activating the Beyonce's and all the rest of the folks
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.160]  to, you know, say go out and kill the pigs. Yeah. So I but not just big but people that
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.440]  are part for instance, if you are a part of the whole idea that will cause a giant counter
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.720]  oppression of black people just trying to, you know, live the American dream. Absolutely.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:20.880]  So I cannot imagine that this is not going to take place. I can't see how I don't think
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:25.560]  Obama would have gone to the prisons unless he wanted to indicate to judges everywhere
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:30.880]  and most of the federal and state judges are very liberal. And if Obama says that the system,
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.000]  the penal system has been oppressive, you're going to see cases coming back before the
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.160]  courts, you're going to see parole officers releasing people who normally would be kept
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:43.480]  in prison and they're going to make room for the libertarians, the patriots, the Christians
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.000]  who they're now throwing the book at as the new enemy.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.920]  Absolutely. So I think we need to be very mindful of this and we need to be mindful
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:56.720]  of this catalyst now being released in this roots presentation. It's not good, Alex. It's
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:57.720]  not good for America.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.360]  And we have new motionaries, the Justice Department announced the last month that they're moving
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:07.520]  to basically tell judges and others we're going to prosecute you or come after prosecutors.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.680]  If you don't let people off or let folks out of prison. And again, these are mainly violent
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:15.840]  folks they're talking about. I'm also letting nonviolent people out, but no, they're talking,
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.040]  they're not saying, they're saying period to start letting people out.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.680]  Absolutely. Because I think Obama wants to have a different kind of a brown shirts. If
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:30.760]  you remember that from back in 2008 and 2009, militia rather than the what would have been
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:35.920]  the, what the initially idea of brown shirts all about. I can't imagine Obama walking
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.480]  away from power, Alex. I can't, I've told you this eight years ago.
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:43.360]  So you think letting the prisoners out like the Soviets and like the Nazis, when the Nazis
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.360]  took over, they released all the people out of the prisons that were aligned with the
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.240]  national socialist hundreds of thousands of them and put them in charge.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.320]  Listen, when Castro released the prisoners during the Mario boat lift from Cuba, they
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:03.680]  all flooded into, into Miami, into Florida and then across over to Texas. That was the
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.720]  real start of the major drug problems in America because those and many of them were
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.160]  psychopaths that came out of the prisons in Cuba. So I think that what we see happening
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:19.600]  with Alex, I just can't imagine Obama walking away from power and riding off into the sunset.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.320]  When he knows right now, he's got the courts. He's got the Supreme Court. He's got the judges.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:29.440]  He's got the politicians. He's got the media in his hands. Why should he walk away and
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:34.040]  say, well, I had my eight years, my, I agree with you. He might try something. They're
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.040]  so bold. Who knows.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.520]  I want to try something that he's going to. He's already put it in the works. I mean,
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:46.640]  remember Obama is CIA. Understand that he is. He's a compadre with family. Yeah. He's
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:52.000]  a compadre with Putin and Russia. He's not going to walk away from world power. He just
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.800]  isn't going to do it. And anybody who thinks that he does now, I'm all for Trump. And you
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.960]  know, I am. I'm all in on Trump, but anybody who thinks that Obama is going to walk away
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:03.800]  from power, you're not thinking you're just, I think let me play this clip, the chilling
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.520]  clip about the national security force, where they want to make everybody serve three years
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:13.640]  out of high school as domestic political police, social justice warriors with badges, with
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.320]  guns. By the third year, they can graduate and get the badges and get the guns. And it's
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:21.760]  already happening with federal police and others. They're, they're arming every agency
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:27.960]  and hiring social justice warrior types. Let's play the clip. We cannot continue to rely
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:33.960]  only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:40.160]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:45.040]  just as well funded. I mean, this is, this is chilling what they're doing. So, so, sir,
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:49.120]  you studied it. You're in the middle of it. You were right about Obama more than I was.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.680]  How dangerous he'd be. I hate the Republicans so much that I was kind of neutral the first
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:55.600]  election. I'm actually embarrassed about that. I didn't support him, but I just couldn't
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.520]  push it so bad. You know, the bomb, bomb, it'd be three times worse. I'm going to stand
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:01.320]  that. I'm going to stand. I'll support him. But go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no. Just
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.640]  in the moment we have for break, what else is Obama going to pull then? Well, I think
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:11.960]  he's going to continue to exercise his powers, no matter who goes into office. He's put everything
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:19.160]  in place as any reasonably person, thinking person would do except for idiots like Bush.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.480]  And I think that Bush initially thought that by putting Obama in power as president, because
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.240]  you know, Bush had the opportunity to stop Obama's president. Sure, he did. Yeah. He
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:34.000]  had the CIA report. George Tenet had all the information. He let the economy slide. He
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.520]  even helped Obama get in. Absolutely. Absolutely. So I think Obama has what I've seen more of
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:47.080]  a race war coming like we've never seen before. But you know, more and more has Obama double
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.640]  crossed even the establishment. Is that what you're saying? I know he's double crossed
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.680]  black people and he's getting ready to do it again. But they love it. You can't talk
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:59.640]  to them. They love it. But he's getting ready to double cross them again. We'll be back

[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.320]  us. He's going to get on early with us. He's on at the bottom of the hour. He's out there
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.960]  covering social justice warriors foaming at the mouth. I want to go to Michael on Louisiana,
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:43.640]  AJ in Ohio, Joseph in New York, Ed in California. The caller I was about to go to just hung
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:51.920]  up on line two. They had a really good question about economic collapse. But another person,
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.240]  AJ has the same question, because that's what I'm concerned about. I mean, when the Royal
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.040]  Bank of Scotland says sell everything that's paper and the elites are getting armored redoubts,
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:04.080]  I mean, it's all over the news now. I'm hoping things don't collapse. But I mean, this bubble
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:09.440]  so big, AJ, you're on the air. Go ahead and talk to Pastor Manning of Otla. Yeah. Hi,
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:13.280]  Pastor Manning. Love you to death. And that's a white man telling you that. I know it's
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:22.360]  politically incorrect, but I'll let it slide. Anyhow, my friend. Yeah, I just I'm having
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:29.240]  a hard time seeing Obama actually leaving the presidency. I think, you know, there he
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:34.000]  has lots of weapons in his toolbox. And I think one of them would definitely be an engineered
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.320]  collapse of the economy. I just kind of wanted to get your thoughts on that because, you
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:41.960]  know, absolutely, I think collapse is his big, you know, ace in the hole. What do you
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:49.800]  think? Well, I agree with you 100% that he's not going to leave power. If he may possibly
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.240]  officially leave the office, but he's not going to leave power. And if he doesn't put
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.800]  it on his people, but yeah, yeah, well, he's already got the deck stacked everywhere as
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:07.080]  to how he will manipulate America and the world. He's got the globalist at we he's
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:13.360]  at their beck and call. But an economic collapse is the best way you can always manipulate
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.480]  people when you can take food off the table and off the shelves of the supermarket and
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:24.160]  you can devalue everything that people have and see about your accounts. Yeah. So I think
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:27.760]  economic collapse, it will be better than a race war. You're not going to that's not
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:33.360]  going to be very effective. It will, of course, ignite some concerns. But you're right on
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:37.400]  both both cows. One, he's not going to leave power and two, he's going to use an economic
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:41.960]  collapse. And though we all love Donald Trump and want to see him in power, we're looking
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:45.520]  at a very dark future for America. Very, very dark.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.520]  Great question. Anything else?
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:54.720]  Yeah, just real quick. I know it's a little off the subject, but I had this dry cough
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.360]  for months and I bought your lung cleanse and not to get too graphic, but let's just
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:02.840]  say it cleared things up very well. So great product. Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.240]  Thank you. That's just a whole bunch of known concentrated herbs. The problem is it's so
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:10.880]  oily. You got to keep the spout clean under hot water because it clogs because it's just
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:15.560]  a whole bunch of essential oils concentrated. Most lung stuff is a couple sprays and some
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:18.520]  feel good stuff doesn't really help you. I mean, we have to make something really good.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:23.240]  So thank you for the plug. Lung cleanse is amazing. InformersLives.com. Thank you, AJ.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:26.080]  Thanks to get one more calls. We got a break here into one more segment with Pastor Manning
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:30.520]  before he does his own broadcast. Let's talk to Ed in California. You're on the air. Go
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:31.520]  ahead, Ed.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:37.960]  Good morning, gentlemen. Alex, thanks for the show. Thanks for waking me up. Pastor Manning,
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:41.680]  I didn't call to start an argument or pick on you. I'm a black American. I work hard
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:46.800]  every day. I have a family with some of this strong, proud history in America. And a lot
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:51.360]  of times when I watch your outlaw broadcast, you're very negative toward black people.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:55.840]  I just want to know why do you do that? Or why do I have that perception of perhaps?
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:59.760]  It could largely be your perception, but I can tell you, there is some meat to what
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:04.600]  you're perceiving, mainly because you have to get black folks attention. Listen, I live
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:11.080]  in Harlem and I've been black for a good number of years. I have seen socially, politically,
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:15.480]  religiously, what black folk have done. When you're living in the midst of a community
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:21.240]  where 90% of the households are headed by women and men have no sense of responsibility,
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:26.760]  and you see children that are hungry and cold and a poor, you can only speak that as a truth.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.160]  And to a lot of people, it seems very hard. I was about to say, Pastor Manning, stay there.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:32.720]  Come back and have the floor on this. We'll go back to the caller, but I want you to be
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.720]  able to speak on this because it's called tough love, folks. I mean, it's like if an
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:40.600]  alcoholic is drinking two bottles of vodka a day, you got to tell them to stop it. We'll
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:53.360]  be back. Stay with us. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today. Thousands
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:59.480]  of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:05.040]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense. Sixty years
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:10.920]  ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:18.120]  own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathanogens
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:23.160]  added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:29.200]  off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:36.520]  with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:43.040]  the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body. Discover why Anthroplex
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:47.160]  has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:54.240]  hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:59:54.240 --> 02:00:01.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:31.760]  Pastor Manning is our guest. I love humanity. In my gut, I'm a God-fearing person, no matter
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:35.360]  how much propaganda is out there, no matter how bad people treat me because of what color
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:43.360]  I am in my life. I know in my gut and my heart that if I start hating children of any color
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:48.540]  that I basically forfeited my soul, I just feel it. I love humanity. And it's a total
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:53.800]  setup where they play us off against each other. It's all divide and conquer. And when
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:01:00.480]  they sit there and have black liberation theology in the presence, that's all Ford Foundation,
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:04.280]  CIA run, that's declassified. It's to make sure people are mentally crippled. They come
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.320]  out. They're controlled by those groups. They won't integrate or work with anybody else
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:12.080]  or be happy. Then that makes whites get paired on even more races because that's going on
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.640]  the other side. Then you have a little mini race war and then black people get even more
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:22.320]  suppressed. Blacks are with 30% of the population, half that's men, 6.5%. And you're going to
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:28.560]  get in a fight with all the honkies that are armed to the teeth and how to go around the
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.720]  world killing everybody. I mean, that is just not a good move. And that's what they're
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.040]  setting up. That's what they're pushing. And then Pastor Manning's over here saying,
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:39.960]  let's not do this. Let's be Christian. Let's get jobs. Let's build our communities. Let's
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.360]  have men in the homes. And that's called not liking black people. I don't know what broadcast
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:49.000]  Ed's listening to, but I hear somebody who loves humanity and loves his people. Now I'm
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.960]  going to go back to Ed in a minute. But Manning, is that accurate what I said? Oh, it's absolutely
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:02:00.360]  spot on. I mean, we've had 70 years of panty ways, policies and activities towards black
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:05.800]  people, office skating their responsibility, allowing them to think and to do and tell
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:10.680]  them how bad the world has treated them and look at where you make somebody strong week.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:17.400]  You pamper them so they are weak. That was a total attack. Absolutely. And it was a plan
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:22.920]  attacked as well. So we have to realize that, you know, Harry Truman said when he was president,
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:26.960]  they used to call them give them hell, Harry. And the president, Harry said, I don't give
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:30.960]  them hell. I'm just telling the truth. And they think it's hell. You know, when you've
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.560]  got a society of people who are at the bottom of the world's social register, and there's
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:41.120]  no denying that I didn't put black people at the bottom of the economic ladder. I didn't
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:45.760]  put them at the bottom of the family ladder. I didn't put them at the bottom of every social
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:51.000]  remedy. I didn't put them there. They are there. How do you get them out? You don't get
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.080]  them out by telling them it's okay for them to stay the hell there.
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:59.400]  And adversity makes men. Prosperity makes monsters. That's Victor Hugo. And so we have
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.960]  got to be able to tell people, listen, you know, here's the truth. You need to go back
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.880]  to leadership of your home. You need to go back to taking care of your family and your
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.360]  children. And you need to realize that all of the so-called leaders over the last 60
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:16.920]  years have made the conditions. I mean, look at Chicago. You got, you got Louis Farr con
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.360]  living in Chicago. You got Obama claiming to come from Chicago. You've got Jesse Jackson.
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:27.680]  You got three of the black greatest leaders in Chicago. Yet you've got, and they are the
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:32.360]  ones who are panting, panting, wasting black men. Yet they've got more killings of black
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:35.560]  people in Chicago than we have anyplace else.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:39.920]  It does Alex won't. I did this, Albert Horpe. And he is, want me to have the same kind of
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:45.200]  rhetoric that Jesse Jackson, Louis Farr con and, and Obama has for black men.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:49.200]  Well, sure. I'm not defending Farrakhan's compendium of work, but Jackson others do
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.400]  want the liberal social stuff. I mean, Farrakhan at least tries to get folks to get jobs and
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.400]  have their own business.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I have to give him credit for that. He does. He understands that there
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:02.160]  was, that, that, that is the way in which we must go. But I think that when you, I live
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:08.200]  in Harlem and I see the suffering, I'm a past of women who've got no man in their life.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:13.240]  They go to bed lonely and cold every night. I'm the past of children who don't know who
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:19.440]  their fathers are. I see this go on and on and I see, I see politicians get up and talk
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:24.560]  about how bad the white man is. Hell, listen, you can take care of your children. I don't
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:30.320]  care what the circumstances are, be a father, work two jobs, three jobs. What's wrong with
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:31.320]  that?
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:35.680]  I know that's what I tell. It's incredible. I'm telling these men are just, they think
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:39.440]  being lazy, I'm about white men, Hispanics, you name it. They think laying around is
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:41.600]  fun. A man busts his ass.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:47.000]  Absolutely. Absolutely. You defend your children with your life. And I think if we had more
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.360]  of that kind of a spirit, more of that spirit, we wouldn't see black people.
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:53.960]  Well, Pastor Manning, I always feel like I had a big old drink of cold water on a hot
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:58.360]  day when you've been on your great patriot. I love your spirit. I would not at all RG.
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:00.880]  Alex, Alex, Alex, thank you so very much. It's a big honor.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.320]  Thank you. A big honor to have you, brother.
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:06.680]  New research is warning about a possible link between common over-the-counter medications
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:12.720]  and dementia. CBS2 reports an antihistamine known as diphenhydramine may increase the
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.880]  risk of dementia and even cause irreparable harm. It's commonly sold as Benadryl and
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:23.160]  it's included in many over-the-counter medications for cold and allergies. It also causes drowsiness,
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:28.480]  so it's popular in sleep aids such as Tylenol PM, Advil PM, and Zequal. Recent research
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:32.520]  found that older adults who took these type of drugs continuously for years performed
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:38.120]  worse on tests that measured short-term memory, verbal reasoning, planning, and problem solving.
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:42.600]  And now experts are concerned that the cognitive functions lost might not come back even after
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:47.560]  stopping the medications. Now the studies are not conclusive, but it does add more credence
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:53.040]  to the idea that in our overly-medicated society, we are the long-term test subjects.
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:06:00.040]  Leigh-Anne McAdder reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:07:05.760]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:11.120]  a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the Infowars. A 360 win.

[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:34.920]  Listeners have been requesting this for years, because it's so easy to forget to reorder

[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:04.000]  when you sign up for auto-ship. This is the most transparent administration
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:09.760]  in history, and I can document how that is the case. American journalists at a media
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:16.240]  event have criticized the U.S. administration over transparency issues. We cover what we
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.760]  are allowed to cover. Black transparency is a huge political advantage. Information
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:26.440]  management has become so sophisticated, every administration learns from the previous.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:31.080]  I've got a pen, and I've got a phone. There are actions I have the legal authority to
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.760]  take as president. What do you say to someone who believes the
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:39.000]  president took action to change the law? We did not change the law. We acted within the
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.280]  law. What you're not paying attention to is the
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:46.480]  fact that I just took an action to change the law.

[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:18.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:24.920]  We now take you live to the highway between San Diego and Los Angeles at UCLA as Joe
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:27.480]  Biggs follows a faint-links of police cars.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.600]  We can put up Fox, CNN, you name it.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:33.600]  It looks like 500 cops, different agencies, LAPD, you name it.
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:42.560]  Just standing around waiting to raid UCLA and to find out, as we cover the media, what's
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  going on.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:48.080]  So, two victims, and it's like the end of the world, and I'm sad somebody got shot,
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:54.320]  but most of the time it's gang-related, which just shows that's part of the whole drug culture.
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.400]  And if two people die on a bus accident, nobody cares, but if it's guns, it's the end of the
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.400]  world.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:03.320]  This gun crime is down over 20 years, mass shootings are flat, but we'll find out what
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:07.400]  Joe Biggs who's been dealing with social justice warriors and following that whole
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:11.880]  term that Breitbart's got is going and having free speech events that they try to shut down
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:13.520]  everywhere to illustrate their tyranny.
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:18.360]  In fact, if I was running the Trump campaign, I'd be out in California every week just to
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.480]  show these people.
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:23.620]  Every time he does it, his poll numbers go up a point or two, I mean, just to show how
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:27.760]  authoritarian these folks are, but another so-called mass shooting, which two people,
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:30.960]  two victims, Joe Biggs, you're driving there, joining us via Skype.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:31.960]  Thank you.
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:33.520]  How the hell do you have us?
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:36.920]  Well, so far, it's confirmed, yeah, two people have been shot, they're saying they're still
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:37.920]  an active shooter.
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:43.280]  I'm on the 405 right now, speeding as fast as I can behind what seems to be about 50
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.360]  to 80 cops that have passed me already.
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:47.360]  They're in the sideline.
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:51.440]  I'm in the passenger zone lane right now, driving up there as quickly as possible to
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.440]  get there.
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:57.040]  And as you know, I was actually on the UCLA campus last night and I just spoke with Milo's
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:58.040]  manager.
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:01.920]  They had left and went outside and were talking to some friends and then decided to go back
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.640]  inside that building and they actually had a bomb threat called on them.
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:10.800]  So now they're worried that if they continue on with the event today in Long Beach that
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:12.760]  this could be related in some way.
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:15.720]  So they're trying to find, figure out what they want to do with Breitbart if they still
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:17.080]  want to have this event.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:22.880]  But you know, last night I was inside the building where Milo was given a speech and
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:27.920]  there were these people outside of the building, banging and beating on the wall, screaming
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:28.920]  and yelling.
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:29.920]  You know, it was ridiculous.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.360]  People are insane.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.960]  So you're saying that they've been having bomb threats to shut down these events.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:38.600]  That's where they're right there.
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:41.640]  And this could be related to that as a way to try to shut things down.
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:42.640]  I hope.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:48.080]  I hope they, but those workers haven't shot someone, is that what you're saying?
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:49.080]  I don't know.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:53.640]  I mean, I literally just got off the phone with Milo's manager and they were worried
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.920]  about that because they were leaving and then they decided they had some more friends show
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:02.120]  a player on and they went back inside the building where they had the venue last night
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:03.120]  or whatever.
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:07.800]  And they said that the police got worried that there was a bomb threat and they were
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:10.560]  all told to evacuate, swept out of there.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:14.000]  And now they're worried that this might be related in a way so they might shut down this
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.440]  event that they were going to have at Long Beach today.
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:17.440]  So it's very interesting.
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.120]  This is, you know, very intense.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:23.480]  I'm driving the staff like, and there's tons of traffic on my right side that said a sand
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:25.480]  field on the 405 heading north.
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:28.920]  So hopefully we can get there in time, we can find out what's going on.
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:34.320]  Well, you're in the fast track behind the police, we'll get a video skype feed as soon
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.320]  as you get there.
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:36.320]  How far out are you?
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.920]  It looks like 3.5 miles away with traffic about 13 minutes.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:42.920]  So I'm getting closer.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:48.400]  I've been on the road for a little bit now, take a break, we'll get you on a 40 after
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:53.560]  so once you can set up a video feed there on the ground, but that is certainly newsworthy.
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:13:00.640]  Please call in a report to Don Salazar, Kit Daniels or Michele Thalen or any of our reporters,
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:06.240]  Paul Watson's listening to give us the basic facts because wow, the fact that there's been
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.640]  a bomb threat, slowly go over it all one more time for our reporters and listeners, exactly
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:15.520]  where you've been, the tour you're on, what's happening and what's unfolded.
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:21.800]  Well, I'm on the free speech tour with Milo Yiannopoulos, he's a rider for Breitbart
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:26.560]  and he's known for a lot of controversial statements, he says feminism is cancer and
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:31.240]  I came out and I was invited by his manager to come cover a few of his events.
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:36.480]  He had three events in a row, last night UCLA, today, Long Beach and tomorrow UC Irvine,
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:40.600]  which is actually right beside Costa Mesa, we all saw that epic footage that our reporters
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:44.200]  got when they were down there covering the Trump event and they're expecting a lot more
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:49.080]  like that to happen again as well at this UC Irvine event.
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:53.760]  So what happened last night when we were at the UCLA event, a lot of social justice
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:58.320]  warriors showed up, beating and banging on doors, they made a human chain with their
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:04.560]  arms and their links, they were literally attacking and pushing people and it was beyond
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:08.600]  anything I've seen at some of these, I mean, they were literally jumping in front of people
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:09.600]  and throwing themselves.
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.560]  I saw a girl jump and start backing into a guy hitting him or a reporter and then told
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:19.320]  the cops he assaulted her and then the cops basically were like, you know, talking to
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:22.880]  him like he was like some criminal.
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:28.200]  That was crazy from Portland and in upstate New York, everywhere, they'll have the social
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:32.440]  justice warriors when you were there, hitting people saying you're not allowed to have a
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:37.440]  Trump event with six people and then the cops come and say, yes, we agree, you're not allowed.
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:38.560]  Good job beating them up.
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:42.120]  I mean, these cops are like whacked out loons.
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:46.560]  Now there's ambulances coming, swerving out of the roads around me right now.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:47.560]  Wow.
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:48.560]  This is intense.
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.560]  I mean, this, this place is everywhere.
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:51.560]  I mean, they're total hysteria.
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:53.440]  They do this to demonize guns.
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:56.880]  Anytime there's a shooting or a banana pill on the ground, they, they make a huge deal
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:57.880]  out of it.
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:00.440]  Joe, I'm going to let you focus.
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:01.560]  We'll talk to you in about 20 minutes.
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:02.560]  Be safe.
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.560]  Okay.
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:04.560]  All right.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:05.560]  There goes Joe Biggs.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:09.360]  I got loaded phone lines, past remaining left because I had Joe Biggs coming up.
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:13.280]  He was going to be there at the university, the side of the next event.
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:16.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we need other patriots to go out because Joe will be in the midst
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:21.680]  of like 500 anti-American weirdo, whether they're black, white, Hispanic, they'll have
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:23.520]  like zits all over their face, drooling.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:24.520]  They can hardly talk.
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:26.080]  A lot of them weigh like 400 pounds.
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:27.360]  I might be mad at fat people.
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:30.840]  It's just that it's like, it seems to be what they're into, you know, just sitting on their
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:38.880]  couch all day, just screaming, no free speech, kill Trump, you know, all this garbage.
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.480]  We need everybody to go to these events and just document it because we'll have people
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:47.360]  in a crowd and get incredible footage that gets, you know, 10 million views and is on
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:53.440]  Drudge and, you know, on CNN and Fox, but we're missing the real gold.
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:57.680]  I mean, so many times you got a camera and you miss just the most insane stuff you wish
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:15:58.680]  you to caught.
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:03.080]  I don't care what a Bernie shirt on and just go out there and infiltrate these groups.
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:07.800]  You could get the footage that is the meme that shoots the black arrow into the dragon's
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.960]  heart and brings it down.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:11.040]  I mean, we're so close.
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:13.200]  This fight is so close right now.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:17.440]  I cannot express to you how you need to be on the ground as boots on the ground.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:19.160]  I just got chills.
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:21.120]  I just get chills.
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:22.840]  This is the battle for the Republic, folks.
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:26.520]  This is up against people that want to make us poor to control us.
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:28.960]  They want to blow the engine of free market.
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:31.200]  We're barely keeping the country going right now.
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.200]  We have had so many victories.
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:33.760]  We've had so many defeats.
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.160]  We're in a toe-to-toe death battle.
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:40.920]  When you're out there taking action, when you're out there speaking out, when you're
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:46.480]  out there, even more importantly, getting intel on these brainwashed zombies that are
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.480]  the enemy.
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:48.480]  Right?
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:49.480]  They'll sorry for them.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:50.480]  They're idiots.
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:53.480]  They're dangerous, but they're like a zombie attack wave.
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.560]  I mean, they're still the enemy.
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:55.840]  You got to deal with them.
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:58.000]  And that's just the way it is, okay?
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.160]  So get out there.
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:02.160]  Just do it.
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:03.280]  Just get into their groups.
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.640]  Act like a hateful, anti-human piece of trash, and they'll start spewing.
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:08.760]  We're going to murder everybody.
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:09.760]  We're communists.
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:14.400]  Oh, God, I wish years ago I had caught on tape, anarchists that are really communists
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:17.000]  coming up and telling me they're going to kill me and they're going to take over the
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  country and stuff.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.720]  I mean, I just, back then, you'd have phones recorded or whatever, and I'd have a camera
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:23.720]  guy and he'd be 10 feet away when they do it, you know, they'd come over when nobody
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:28.320]  was watching and punch you in the back, you know, and try to get you to physically attack
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  them.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:30.320]  They try all sorts of scams.
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:34.400]  And I'm just telling you, if the American people get up off the bench of every race,
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:38.120]  color, and creed, every stupid sexual persuasion, I don't care.
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:39.120]  Don't you believe in freedom?
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:41.520]  Don't you believe in the freedom of speech and property?
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:45.200]  I mean, that's why everybody wants to come here, because we have a little bit of freedom.
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:47.480]  Hell, we're a rat hole.
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:53.640]  We're a cesspit in many respects, but compared to other cesspits, we're looking pretty good
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:54.640]  right now.
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:18:00.160]  And just get off the bench, get up off the bench, get up off the stool, get up and
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.840]  just get in the fight.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.800]  It's going to feel so good once you're in it.
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:10.520]  There were so many times there'd be some bully flunk three, four grades waiting for me in
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.440]  junior high or high school, and that's how I'm going to be waiting right here.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:15.440]  And you know what?
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:16.440]  I'd be walking out.
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:17.440]  My mom was there to pick me up.
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:18.440]  Probably taking the bus.
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:19.440]  And I'd say, you know what?
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:20.440]  I'm going to go on down there to that park.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:24.080]  That guy thinks he weighs 50 pounds, 100 pounds more, and he's beat up a whole string of folks.
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:27.680]  Because the weird thing about it was it was so fun to just march up to those people.
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:32.640]  No matter what they did to me, I was going to beat their ass in the end.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:33.640]  You know what?
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:37.120]  At the end of the day, they'd be sitting there on the ground, laid out, blot all over their
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.040]  face or nose broken or teeth loose.
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.720]  Everybody would be going, look at that 13-year-old kid just beat up that 17-year-old bully.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:46.880]  I'd look at him and I'd say, that's how you get the job done right there.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:47.880]  And that's living.
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:52.000]  And I'm here to tell people right now, you need to stop being cowards and stop being
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.640]  afraid of these people.
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:58.160]  It's time to take them on, because the fight isn't with schoolyard bullies here.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:02.560]  It's with people that want to rape our rights, abort our children, chop their body parts
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:08.200]  up and sell them, and have this witch filth, Katie Couric, sit up there and edit videos
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:13.400]  like gun owners are a bunch of mentally retarded idiots, sick of her crap.
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:17.680]  I salute Trump for going after that witch.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.600]  Everything Trump does from destroying political correctness to destroying globalism, destroying
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:24.840]  it, destroys them.
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:28.920]  It doesn't matter if he sells out or sold out, that's why he hasn't sold out.
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:35.240]  You speak these truths, it's big, long, black coffin nails, driven right into their heart.
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:37.920]  You don't put stuff like this back in the bottle.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.040]  A fight's already here.
[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:42.920]  Like Patrick Henry said, our friends may cry peace, peace.
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:43.920]  There is no peace.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:45.400]  There's already war in the North.
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:47.080]  The next gale will bring it here.
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:51.840]  Listen to our brethren, if you want to sell out, may your chains set lightly upon you
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:58.840]  to paraphrase, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.

[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:40.720]  No trophy, no flowers, no flashbolts, no line, he's haunted by something he cannot define.

[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:03.320]  He's in UCLA, I mean it's like, LA, he's locked down, a skit from LA, two people got shot
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:12.640]  at UCLA in a city of 10 million people, meanwhile there's like probably 20 car deaths, motorcycle
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:17.360]  deaths, people being robbed, stabbed, but oh no, but when it's a shooting at a government
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:22.480]  facility, they have it all set up to lock everything down and let it go for hours where
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:29.280]  no one knows what's happened, no one knows what's happened, this is how they brainwashed
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:32.960]  the public against guns to quote John P. Holdren.
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:37.200]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's the White House science article that says he wants to kill you and
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:41.920]  your family with flora in the water, that's Eric Holder that does fast and furious Oklahoma
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:45.400]  City and other false flags.
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:51.920]  So let's go ahead and talk to Roger in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for calling.
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:58.560]  Alex, thanks for taking my call, I'm in San Antonio, I'm a long time listener, first
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:07.360]  time caller, thank you so much and I'm an Indian American and so what I've been doing
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:12.680]  and you know, folks here in the U.S., a lot of folks they don't know about the danger,
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:18.560]  I mean everyone calls it radical Islam, but that's not it, the problem is Islam itself
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:26.280]  and India's been dealing with this for 1400 years and there's a thing called satia and
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:33.200]  that is deception and it says deceive the infidel and once you're in, slit his throat
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:39.440]  and we see that in London, we see the mayor, so the huge, I mean it's Islam itself.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:42.640]  Sure, so you've seen it before with the western people coming in saying we're going to be
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:45.400]  friendly and then stabbing in the back, yeah.
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:49.680]  Absolutely, that's been happening for 1400 years in India and so I've been doing that
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:53.000]  and the other thing and when you're out in the back with them.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.080]  Sure, I mean you talk about India itself and we normally think of India, you know, the
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:02.360]  subcontinent as east or the Middle East is east, but the Middle East is west of that
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:09.200]  so describe to folks as a true Indian from India, what Islam has done in India?
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.920]  Well for 1400 years they come in, they say okay we're going to be traders, we're going
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:19.680]  to be living peacefully and then they come in, they migrate and they're let in because
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:24.960]  they say we've been persecuted in our country so let us in and then they come in and local
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:29.560]  people build a mosque and give them food and shelter and everything and then they come
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:35.440]  in, the first thing they do is because it's in the Quran it says take over, in order to
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.520]  subjugate your enemy, take over their women and that's how you humiliate them and you
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:48.000]  subjugate them so that's how they start and then once it hits that critical mass, 10%
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.600]  that's when they say okay we need our own sharia, we need mosques, we need other people, we
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:54.600]  need all the insiders.
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:58.800]  They call for the next wave to come in, no, it's admittedly a religion of conquest, that's
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:03.360]  what they teach and then any Muslims that aren't part of that are actually heretics
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:07.560]  that are being hunted down by their more radical brethren, of course folks don't know
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:11.240]  there's a huge war with Islam in India because India has been invaded by it for 1400 years
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:15.000]  as you said, 1300 years, what do you make of the Dalai Lama coming out and saying Germany
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.640]  shouldn't bring in the Muslims?
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:25.120]  Now that was so funny because I have a lot of folks here and for first and second generation
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:29.520]  Indian Americans, they're kind of confused, they're like okay we're immigrants too, should
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:35.360]  we be against all these Muslims coming in but then what I've been doing is I do an initiation
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:40.240]  ceremony, I say anyone that becomes a new citizen, a nationalized citizen, you need
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:45.040]  to listen to the Alex Jones film because a lot of these folks are smart and once they
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:49.680]  listen to a couple episodes of your show and then they see, they connect the dots, they're
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.480]  like oh we've seen this before.
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:57.400]  That's right, you don't see Indians running around trying to blow buildings up or make
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:59.400]  everybody submit to their will.
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:05.880]  Exactly, so I try to in a way, I know and that's what the pastor said as well, sometimes
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:14.720]  I have to change these folks into, it's a kind of tough love, I say hey okay, this country
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:20.280]  invited all of us to come in and open this arm, it's our duty to come in, once we become
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:26.840]  citizens, we need to make sure that this country is safe and so that's their problem.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:30.320]  Sure, I mean look at the Middle East, all they do is kill each other and it's because
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.680]  of the conquest nature of what Islam has turned into, there have been some periods when Islam
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:41.360]  was a better force than Christianity when it became dark but the truth is now it's very
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:47.040]  radical, it's very conquest oriented and the globalist and socialist are allied with it
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:51.040]  because they only want short term power, they don't care about what happens in 50 years.
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:30:01.680]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:04.560]  Have you checked your privacy settings on Facebook lately?
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:09.120]  You might be surprised to find out that the social media site changed your settings without
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:10.120]  your consent.
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:16.400]  Facebook is targeting both users and non-users across the web to show them targeted advertisements,
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:20.080]  they're tracking you with everything from cookies to like buttons.
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:24.360]  The company announced its advertisers will now appear on third party apps and websites
[02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:28.720]  for anyone who's ever visited Facebook, not just for those who are logged in.
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:32.680]  And that's not all, if you have the Facebook app on your phone, it could be listening
[02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:35.680]  to what you say at all times.
[02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:39.940]  Facebook says its app does listen to what's happening around it but only as a way to see
[02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:43.280]  what people are into so they can suggest you post about it.
[02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:47.360]  They claim not to use microphone audio for targeted advertising.

[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:43.120]  reporting from the scene. He was there to cover all the social justice warriors running around
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:47.200]  demonizing the First Amendment trying to shut down free speech. Joe Biggs, great job getting
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:53.760]  there so quickly. What is your intel? So what I have so far is here at the UCLA campus there has
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:59.600]  actually been possibly three dead. Police have actually found a gun and it happened at the
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:04.960]  engineering number four building is what I'm being told here by some of the locals. Now there's
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.080]  been small groups of students being rushed out of here from the campus under this bridge here and
[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:13.520]  you can see there's tons of people on top construction workers that were working on some
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:17.360]  of the buildings they've been told to stand back. You've got police here you've got a lot of media
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:22.720]  around through here as well talking or trying to talk to students as they come out. So far many of
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:28.240]  them haven't said much but we're gonna be out here as much as we can. Hopefully we can find out where
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:31.840]  Fox is getting their feed from where all the police are maybe I can get over that way as well
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:36.080]  but this was just the first spot that I could get to that I found I'm not really uh familiar with
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:42.560]  this campus. Well I tell you Joe you're doing a great job uh be safe but I mean just the hysteria
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:48.320]  it's on every news channel LA's being locked down hundreds of schools it's just total hysteria over
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:54.160]  two people shot and we're not getting details. We aren't the police just storming in to wherever
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:58.320]  this supposed shooting happened. What is this thing with like hundreds of SWAT team guys standing
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:04.720]  around you know sitting on their thumbs. Yeah I know it was interesting because last night you
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:10.320]  know I was up here covering the free speech event with Milo and at that time there were students
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:15.120]  that were being extremely violent students who don't like free speech students who hate really
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:19.760]  what America stands for they hate freedom and they were banging on these doors oh we got a ton
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:28.480]  of cops swarming in right now. Keep going Joe. And as and as that was happening there were students
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:33.040]  banging on the outside protest was trying to get into the building and I was able to speak with
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:38.480]  Milo's agent just a little bit ago and what they told me is they had left the event went outside
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:42.480]  we're walking around decided to go back inside and when they were hanging out inside there was
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:47.280]  a bomb threat called in on them and the police had to usher them out so I'm in the works of
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:52.400]  trying to get an interview with Milo's agent and have them talk about what happened to them in that
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.800]  situation but now it's at the point where they're even worried about having this event today in
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:03.280]  Long Beach where I was actually at earlier today. Well packed halls all over the country when a
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:08.000]  Breitbart editor goes screaming trying to stop some gay guy from having free speech these people
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.960]  are so shameful and I've got a short clip I want to play with audio that's had the cuss words cut out
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:18.480]  the fact we get 57 seconds out of like an hour of footage is amazing there's so much cussing on
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:23.280]  this by these people you think the only language they have is cuss words strung together as they
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:27.920]  try to shut down free speech let's play a clip of what of what joe experienced last night here it is
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:54.640]  I guess we got to bleep out all this is the cuss words but just just total hysteria
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:39:02.320]  they have no future no jobs the the the degrees are worthless so they just psych warfare them
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:13.440]  with high-tech brainwashing they're just hysterical idiots screaming shouting down speech
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:22.640]  by the way we always debate them to come on the show we tell them to they won't do it
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:28.880]  uh joe joe described while you shoot footage of the helicopters and the police and the two
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:32.640]  supposedly shot but they won't give us any details for hours just dominating the news cycle
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:36.320]  oh my god there's guns everywhere over all dead you know great white sharks kill 50 million people
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:41.920]  a year soda guns were all dead uh Easter bunnies kill five billion while all this hysteria is going
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:46.400]  on this looks like a scythe up to me that's gone on this long or there's just a paralyzed
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:52.080]  wicked flea when i'm pursued uh comments on this comments on being nesting with the social justice
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:57.920]  warriors well the interesting thing that happened last night there were two two of these social
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:02.080]  justice warriors that had skinheads and i'm actually going to be walking around the campus i'm
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:06.960]  going to see if i can get closer and get some good footage while we're watching you there was two
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:11.920]  guys or there was a male and a female that had skinheads and they were as people were passing by
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:15.680]  with donald trump hats on the make america great again hats they were screaming and calling them
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:20.800]  nazis so in the one conversation you see where the guy with the bald head looks at me i was like i
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:26.400]  was like oh my god look it's a nazi and he goes i'm a jew leave me alone at least you start screaming
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:30.000]  and flipping out i was like dude i'm making fun of the fact that you're attacking people you're
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.480]  pushing people that are trying to get into an event that promotes free speech yes that's very
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:39.840]  much like a nazi i'm not talking about the fact that exactly where you fall and attack you and
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:48.880]  want to shut you down if you respond they go it's on video i mean they're nuts yeah completely and
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:55.200]  totally insane so what else happened well like i said these people were they would the women kept
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:41:00.080]  jumping they were the most violent ones to the women would jump and back into these uh male
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:04.320]  reporters and they look like total mental patients i mean if i was trying to cast people to act like
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:08.640]  mentally ill zombies as a hollywood producer i would hire these women i mean these are basket
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:12.720]  cases yeah they were they were sitting here trying to play the victim they would assault
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.720]  someone and then scream that they were a victim and then try to get the police to come over there
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:21.360]  to arrest them i mean it was complete and total insanity and if you're watching i'm actually
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:26.080]  going up a walkway right now that's going to overlook the campus hopefully um i can see news
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:31.040]  crews off to the right they're sitting there like good little boys i'm doing their job on the corner
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:36.080]  i'm gonna actually try to get in close and like i said there still is an active shooter a gun has
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:41.440]  been found possibly three people have been shot and killed out here and this is the exact same
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:46.000]  place where mylo had his free speech event last night and the whole thing about this these guys
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:50.800]  are worried i mean that's that's what these insane people do all right joe you're going up on an
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:55.840]  overpass above a parking garage try to get a better advantage of things be careful because you are a
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:00.160]  white male it was reported on fox news they showed them they're making all the white males lay down
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:06.800]  are you serious yes so i guess uh aid screalac who's goes you're an f-ing white male you're not
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:09.680]  allowed to talk i guess he's probably pleased right now even though he's a white male
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.480]  yeah is it not too happy about his white privilege at this point then
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:20.480]  in fact we have a free looks yet we have him and we can actually show some there he is this carl
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:25.520]  the cock i can see a bunch of police over here now looks like i'm walking into their area
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:31.440]  these people are funny i shouldn't make jokes about this is too crazy i mean you got a city of
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:38.080]  ten million people like locked down in hysteria over two shot right now you have to laugh at it
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:41.760]  because you have to laugh at it and you have to point out the insanity or else other people
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:45.680]  aren't going to see that it's wrong that's what's happened it's been a lack of parenting by some of
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:49.600]  these people and they've been these kids have been coddled their entire lives they think they can
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:54.400]  run around acting like a bunch of crazy people without any kind of repercussions or anything like that
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:42:59.200]  all right now let me let me have you pause for a minute i'm going to give some fair time under
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:04.080]  FCC rules under fair you know fair use and and under the fairness doctrine let i want to give
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:09.440]  aid screalacs that our reporter rob do got footage of uh with what he responds intellectually to
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:23.840]  what you have to say here let's go and play that
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:58.880]  i mean these people have been
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:04.320]  oh there's there's there's your age tree legs carl the cock and what's the woman's name
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:10.640]  there's tons of police outside of this building i think i'm at the right building now yes joe
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:14.320]  tell us what you're now saying be careful all right so i just came over this uh
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:17.440]  overpass area now i'm walking into where there's a whole bunch of students
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:22.960]  looks like there's tons of police lined up on both sides of the road over here this seems to
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:28.080]  be the main area where they've got yellow tape up everywhere what is going on
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:34.800]  i'm gonna try to zoom in oh it doesn't let me with sky you got a bunch of police waiting there
[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:36.080]  yeah
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:46.000]  got a lot of students there those look like police describe for tv viewers what you're
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.240]  saying job eggs are regular so as we're saying right now there's a lot of people of this breezeway
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:56.160]  area and we're looking over into where all the police have migrated to this seems to be like the
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:00.640]  main area that they're focused on though there's a woman in wedge shoes right there in blue jeans
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:05.520]  let's talk to her real quick dear left there you go let's do more important work here where'd she
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:10.080]  go you guys you guys know what's going on so far yeah there's actually from what i gather
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:14.720]  that's been a shooting in there great sorry he's um he's just calling to do a phone or witness right
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:21.120]  now okay cool what's he saying to you he said he loves the show he'll talk to us later i really
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:26.080]  what does she say she says that he's calling in to do an interview with her first okay she's like
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:31.920]  thanks for trying to steal her big interview oh my god i love his a little keybrain uh anyways uh
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:37.680]  so yeah joe keep going for radio listeners so as you can see there's tons of police vehicle
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:41.440]  looks like there's SWAT officers coming up and down that way on the other side here there's a
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:48.960]  whole lot of police of a mass helicopters are flying all over but basically most people are
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:51.840]  just kind of frozen right here trying to figure out what's going on
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:00.720]  once again if you're just joining and we're at the uh ucla campus in southern california around la
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:07.760]  man look at there's like dozens of police cars where you're at and i heard they got like most
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:13.200]  of campus lockdown joe yeah i mean i've been able to walk around pretty easily so far this is the
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:17.760]  first area i've really seen where there's tape and they're not allowing anybody to go in but
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:21.600]  well i mean i've been watching the press conference they still don't have any information i mean how
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:27.120]  many hours is this going to go on yeah it's been going on for about an hour and a half two hours
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:34.800]  i guess now here it is ucla ucla shooting another gunfree zone paul watson info wars.com
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:41.280]  victim disarmament policy plans more lives at least two people were killed during a shooting on
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:48.080]  ucla campus today and another victim disarmament gunfree zone a ucla police spokesperson said
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:53.360]  officers responded to a engineering lab and asked students to go to a secure location how about they
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:58.160]  have guns to shoot the person after the campus white alert system issued a notification which is
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:02.480]  totally worthless it's like having tsa at the border's open at time of press the governor's
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:07.040]  showing the loose and has not been apprehended according to california state law gun ownership
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:12.800]  is strictly regulated on the campus of ucla yeah why is this always on gunfree zones job eggs
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:19.680]  because criminals don't abide by laws and therefore when you make something in gunfree zone you then
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:24.640]  make it a kill zone that's a soft target criminals bad guys who want to do harm they don't go after
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:28.960]  something that's hard like you don't run at a buffalo you don't run at an elephant why because
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:33.520]  it's bigger than you and has a good chance of taking you out unless you have an elephant gun
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:37.200]  which is the great equalizer so you have to have things that make things
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:40.560]  an equalizer and there's criminals out there that want to kill you they just want to take
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:43.840]  your stuff they don't care about you to have no care about life they don't care about and they all
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:49.520]  moved to chicago la new york dc where they have a lot more to feed on i mean if i was a predator
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:54.640]  i'd want to go after the folks that that that that mark dice interviews these people do not know
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:48:00.560]  how to find their butt with both hands and these are all democrat states these are all areas where
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:05.680]  there are people who are just completely brainwashed by this whole notion that if you take guns away
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:09.360]  you're going to make everything exactly i'm no fan of republicans they got their problems that
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:13.760]  you know a lot of them are dumb too but democrats are the dumbest idiots and they all talk about
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:18.800]  how smart they are but they know nothing i mean they really are a plague of idiots yeah they're
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:26.400]  like the leading cause of death in america it's a good point it's documented uh joe just continuing
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:30.640]  here i'm going to want you to go into the next hour off and on popping in and uh david night is
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:35.920]  hosting uh and you know but but obviously try to find and you did a great job getting there
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:40.720]  wherever the press conference is maybe we can give him the information the intel so you can
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:43.280]  actually get to one of these stupid press conferences but we're not going to hear anything
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:48.000]  i mean i would ask in the press conference go ahead press conference would be out uh down there
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:53.680]  okay anyway i just go into that line they're fine and then and then try to ask a question
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:59.120]  as you've done other press conferences this is another victim disarmament zone with like 500 cops
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:04.640]  you can't find the guy we don't expect you to find him it's not your job your job's not to stop crime
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:09.280]  it is to arrest you know people who've done bad things and bring them to the people's court the
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:16.080]  jury the grand jury but another victim disarmament zone your gun control doesn't work it creates a
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:20.880]  vacuum for criminals to enter job eggs exactly and i mean that's what we're seeing in all these
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:25.120]  other places look at all the other look at history look at every time they've taken guns away from
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:31.280]  things like that the place has fallen tyrants move in they take over and now we have a
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:37.040]  presidential candidate who wants to you know this uh self-confess socialists and people are
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:42.560]  actually falling for and they don't understand that they're basically jumping on a sword by voting
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:46.880]  for him but you know the second he's just getting rid of the most interesting man and actually getting
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:53.680]  bernie sanders be the most interesting man joe god i hope not i mean it's horrible yeah i know it's
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:50:00.000]  a joke bernie's is the most idiotic moron you could have out there but see i think he believes
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:05.360]  what he spews that's why they don't want him in power they love socialism got an armored vehicle
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:09.680]  right there huh joe yeah look at his disciples though look at the people that show up to these
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:15.760]  free speech events the fact that you see large amounts of americans now completely against what
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:20.640]  america stands for freedom of speech freedom protects yourself and what's happening where
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:24.080]  are these people of mass out where you see all this stuff are the places where there are shootings
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:29.520]  all the time there's soft targets soft targets are areas that always get hit
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:36.000]  okay what happened when icers came to texas alex they got taken out we got the second amendment there
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:43.520]  that's right joe begs it's crazy out there to cover the social justice warriors led by

[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:44.960]  son of the shooting you were there to cover the anti-free speech moms could this be a false flag joe
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:49.680]  i mean if the if the justice department got caught running fast and furious cbs news to blame the
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:55.920]  second amendment could they have staged something here joe okay cool uh there's some guy told me
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:59.520]  if i go back over there again i can't come back but who cares i'll still do it was that a cop telling
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:04.640]  you that no some campus patrol guy oh just i'm down a power trip him sure he loves loves the
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:08.880]  new order go ahead yeah it's fine who cares i'll i'll get around him i was able to get through
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:14.640]  all the police and uh in north paris and saint anee when the uh riot or the uh raids on the uh
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:18.400]  isis guys were happening so i'm sure it's not going to be too hard for me to get past this guy
[02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:24.080]  absolutely just another buck tooth and moron go ahead so so you heard my question could this be
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:30.160]  a false flag i mean looking at what happened last night at the event the fact that there was a bomb
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.440]  threat called the fact that now this is happening the very next day that after one of these events
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:39.120]  happens i mean it's really interesting when you see something like that happen i mean
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:44.960]  i don't know it's too hard to tell right now there's not a lot of information i hear you and
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:49.120]  because they have a past history of this that's why i don't trust them i'm just saying the possibility
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:53.040]  has to be admitted because they've got it before it's like if the guys that convicted child molester
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:57.680]  on your block and a kid gets molested they're a suspect we don't know they did it they've done it
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:03.920]  before though yeah exactly as you can see they've already got dogs out now they get the uh canine
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:10.000]  police shows there's a question will they keep la locked down for days looking for the shooter
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:18.640]  too dead it never know possibly i mean that's somebody's child or father that got a shot so
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:25.040]  yeah someone's going to keep looking it's very very sad i'm just saying it is it is how much of la
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:31.120]  is locked down right now well it wasn't too bad i mean i got here in about 40 minutes from 45 minutes
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:36.560]  from long beach but uh you know as i was on the way up here this was kind of unfolding
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:41.520]  and more more police were on their way and it looked like a lot of the overpasses and
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:46.240]  stuff started to have police parking under it so let me ask you this question what would
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:53.200]  treggly puff or age screelets do right now cry and blame the fact that uh guns exist on it instead
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:58.160]  of actually being a realist and understanding that guess what they've been invented they're here to
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:02.960]  say they're not going anywhere and what we need to do is to have that great equalizer everyone
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:06.560]  needs to have a way to protect that's right it's always going to be crazy people like in japan
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:11.440]  they have stabbings every week some crazy those you know stabs 18 people on a school bus do we
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:19.040]  bat knives no we try to identify fruit loops yeah it's insane the way that people try to uh weigh
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:25.120]  this out with it's just not it's not rational thinking at all all right i want to get your

[03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:02.640]  highways today but the fetish of hating you know hating the guns uh joe you're going to be following
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:08.240]  more of this tour at other universities as the trigly pubs try to shut down free speech tell
[03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:13.600]  us about that and other points well right now i have some uh an update on the situation now what
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:18.640]  i've heard so far is they believe it was a murder suicide they found a note and they found a gun
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:23.680]  as well so they're saying that the building ah so the big lockdown happened but it was a it was a
[03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:28.720]  murder suicide so much to do about nothing yeah that's what they're saying but it's still they're
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:33.760]  still an fbi command mobile center mobile command center here the atf i just saw a walk up the stair
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:39.520]  well right up here if you see that's hard to get the microphone to the atf when they're not busy
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:46.480]  doing Oklahoma city or they're keeping it safe yeah so they're here atf fbi local la pd terrorism
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:52.240]  task force all that stuff but uh apparently that's the word that it's a murder suicide didn't the atf
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:57.840]  some of their shipping more 50 cows they'll chop over rocket launchers oh i hope not i mean the atf's
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:02.720]  been caught so many false flags where you start joe i mean it's a corrupt organization it's a
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:07.120]  large organization without that any kind of oversight and people actually looking at what's
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:11.920]  going on and then you have a lot of these career politicians and basically people higher up in
[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:16.240]  the ranks inside of these agencies that are basically politicians just like in the army
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:20.400]  once you get up to sergeant major it's basically politics after that and you get these people to
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:24.800]  get turned change that money gets handed to them from here to there and it's easy for these people
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:28.320]  to get corrupted that's when you see this stuff and bill clinton says i need to demonize the
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:34.880]  patriot movement so they blow up on the city yeah i mean this is super intense i mean it sucks
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:38.880]  to something like this happens you know but at the end of the day guess what we don't blame guns
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:43.680]  for it because like i said well i mean my god 10 people die a day in la and car wrecks look it up i
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:48.800]  mean i'm not glad that happened either but you don't blame car drivers because there's some wrecks
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:54.320]  and deaths the world isn't perfect that's the way it is but the most insane thing alex is this whole
[03:02:54.320 --> 03:02:58.640]  gorilla thing now that people are talking about how everyone's flipping out over and some people say
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:03.760]  that the gorilla was black and that's why i got shot versus it was a white girl i saw that yeah
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:07.280]  it's complete and total and sandy but guess what no one even talked about the 10 people that were
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:11.920]  murdered in chicago over the weekend no one cared about that no one cared about the fact
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:16.960]  that there are criminals running around that's a good point chicago is basically in civil war
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:20.960]  because they had the highest crime rate in the world last year this year it's double and now
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:25.600]  they're saying it's like breaking down where's that go joe i don't know i mean there's just
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:28.720]  going to be more and more people get killed when when people are going to wake up and actually open
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:32.640]  their eyes and go you know what the democrats have not been doing a good job when you look at these
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:37.200]  states these cities that are run by these guys these areas that don't have guns this is where you see
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:42.080]  all this stuff happens sam bernadino i mean look overseas paris that's a gun freeze all it's completely
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:47.360]  and totally ridiculous absolutely let me ask you this what's the response you've gotten from the police
[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:53.680]  when they see got info war's flag on your mic um some people are giving me thumbs up or kind of like
[03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:58.000]  you kind of see them like oh hey look and then point or whatever but outside of that i usually
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:03.360]  don't get any kind of hostility even when i was saying we mainly get positive feedback which i'm
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:06.880]  not growling the police they got their own problem society's collapsing my god a lot of them are
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:11.920]  horrible i mean the public's horrible we're horrible i'm horrible but i we only get a lot
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:15.440]  i overall like you saw in furthest and other areas even though they were doing some bad stuff
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:19.360]  we get positive you know response don't we well yeah there was a there was a police officer i'll
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:24.400]  never forget it was one jacar and i were standing outside of the like the mayor's office and they
[03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:29.200]  had just burnt one of the police cars lit it on fire and jacar and i were getting footage one of
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:33.840]  the police officers goes oh hey joe biggs and i went yeah and he goes oh man i really liked your
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:37.760]  video last night where you called me a grumpy old fart and then he pulled out of baton and
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:42.080]  whacked me in the leg but he was laughing while he was doing it he didn't do it too hard did he
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:46.000]  no no no i mean he was just kind of like get out of here and just like screwing with me
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.760]  yeah but it was kind of funny but at the same time pretty sick and messed up
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:53.760]  yeah well you could have responded to that a lot of lawyer about breaking his job at whatever
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:59.120]  the feather of public folks now stay there you're gonna ride shotgun with david night coming in stay
[03:04:59.120 --> 03:05:06.480]  with us new research is warning about a possible link between common over-the-counter medications
[03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:12.560]  and dementia cbs2 reports an antihistamine known as diphenhydramine may increase the
[03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:18.160]  risk of dementia and even cause irreparable harm it's commonly sold as benadryl and it's included
[03:05:18.160 --> 03:05:23.600]  in many over-the-counter medications for cold and allergies it also causes drowsiness so it's popular
[03:05:23.600 --> 03:05:29.360]  in sleep aids such as Tylenol p.m. Advil p.m. and zequel recent research found that older adults
[03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:34.080]  who took these type of drugs continuously for years performed worse on tests that measured
[03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:39.120]  short-term memory verbal reasoning planning and problem solving and now experts are concerned
[03:05:39.120 --> 03:05:44.160]  that the cognitive functions lost might not come back even after stopping the medications
[03:05:44.160 --> 03:05:49.280]  now the studies are not conclusive but it does add more credence to the idea that in our overly
[03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:55.440]  medicated society we are the long-term test subjects leon mackett reporting for info wars.com

[03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:46.400]  able to have joe bigs who loves being on the road what a fighter what a tiger what a lion
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:52.480]  he is what a sheepdog he is just all over the country he was on the east coast they're trying
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:57.040]  to shut down free speech for veterans is two days ago now he's on the west coast being attacked by
[03:10:57.040 --> 03:11:03.120]  these people videos going viral i wanted to get him back up to briefly ask him about uh these
[03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:08.880]  new characters that tried to shut down by his free speech that are linked up on info wars dot
[03:11:08.880 --> 03:11:15.920]  com but as soon as he comes back we can talk about uh these uh these anti-free speech goons
[03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:25.440]  that are just simply amazing in their vitriol here it is threat to freedom feminist goons
[03:11:25.440 --> 03:11:30.160]  how are they feminist they don't act like women they don't look like women and that's fine they
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:34.960]  want to be men but they want to tell women what to do these women want to run women's lives
[03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:38.880]  in my view in my opinion they want to be the guy wearing the wife beater they want to be
[03:11:38.880 --> 03:11:46.720]  you know the the uh who's the guy married with children or the archie bunker feminist
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:52.720]  amendment first amendment now it's the new the feminist amendment only they can talk
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:59.360]  first amendment now attacked as much as the second alice the goon and her fellow feminist
[03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:05.040]  it's like a man want to eradicate the first amendment because free speech hurts their feelings
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:11.280]  let's now go ahead and turn i'm going to hand the baton uh to my compadre my friend
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:15.440]  david night watched it in the last three hours as you get ready for the show and doing research
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:19.600]  this whole thing really smells in ucla i mean let's say it's not a false flag
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:25.680]  a murder suicide two plus hours lockdown top story in the country this is how you really brainwash
[03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:30.640]  the public against guns david night the baton's yours yeah i like actually you know when we look
[03:12:30.640 --> 03:12:35.360]  at this alex this is what we're seeing every time there's an incident we see this overreaction and
[03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:40.320]  your as you're talking about these social justice warriors i gotta say i expect it from a lot of
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:46.560]  these people uh i really had a punch in my gut this last weekend when i watched the libertarian
[03:12:46.560 --> 03:12:54.160]  party select these statists for their uh for their presidential campaign i watched them betray
[03:12:54.160 --> 03:12:58.720]  the second amendment something i thought i would never see within the libertarian party let me read
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:03.760]  to you from the libertarian party platform and this is what has been there the entire time i've
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:09.600]  known about the libertarian party 25 years ago we oppose all laws at any level of government
[03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:15.280]  that would restrict register or monitor the ownership manufacture or transfer of firearms
[03:13:15.280 --> 03:13:20.480]  or ammunition that's about as inclusive as you can get saying we're not going to infringe
[03:13:20.480 --> 03:13:28.800]  your fundamental rights to keep and bear arms and yet they elected a guy bill weld who was a
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:35.760]  rhino governor from massachusetts and as part of being a governor he supported gun control measures
[03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:40.000]  pretty much every gun control measure that democrats want and he did it 20 25 years ago
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:46.640]  gary johnson said i've got to have this guy or i'm not going to run and they wanted two governors
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:53.040]  on their tickets so they could be taken very seriously this is what william weld said to
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:59.360]  jake tapper we got a clip of an interview jake tapper asking him about his opinion on guns let's
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:05.200]  roll that clip well i'm a lifelong hunter and gun owner and i don't think those proposals were
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:13.200]  out of the mainstream be my audio i distinguish between uh you know hunting hunting guns and
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:18.320]  uh guns that really don't seem to have any hunting purpose or potential purpose so that was the
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:24.240]  distinction i was drawing there but uh that that's uh that's an area where i think gary and i can
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:29.680]  find a common ground i'm not worried about that issue yeah okay so you know he's going to ban
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:33.840]  assault weapons whatever assault weapons are because you know there's not a really good definition
[03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:38.240]  of that it's just anything that looks scary to liberals that's an assault weapon it's an assault
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:42.720]  because it scares them presumably okay so they're going to ban that because they're not hunting
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:47.040]  rifles you know the word hunting is not in the second amendment governor weld i know you're the
[03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:52.640]  original libertarian according to gary johnson but it's it's not in there and of course he would do
[03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:58.480]  all the rest of the gun prohibition tactics that the left would like even including some things like
[03:14:58.480 --> 03:15:04.880]  banning ownership of guns for 21 year olds or younger okay but he says i'm sure that we can
[03:15:04.880 --> 03:15:09.360]  reach an agreement with governor johnson that was an interview with jake tapper cnn before the
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:14.400]  convention and then as these guys got the nomination and the number two and we covered this last night
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:18.000]  with leanne macadoo we played some of the clips i've got some additional clips that i want to play
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:23.600]  with you uh today some things that you won't believe in terms of trade and now we see that
[03:15:23.600 --> 03:15:29.680]  obama is in vietnam pushing the tpp doing it with people that have been touted as hillary clinton's
[03:15:29.680 --> 03:15:33.760]  vice presidential picks so we got some information coming up with that but before we leave the gun
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:37.280]  issue because we're talking about what's happening in la we're talking about the
[03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:43.200]  the massive overreaction of the police there for what appears to be a murder suicide they've got the
[03:15:43.200 --> 03:15:48.640]  whole place locked down under martial law course they don't declare martial law they just do it
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:54.320]  okay it's de facto martial law as william weld says this he says i'm sure we can reach common
[03:15:54.320 --> 03:15:58.160]  ground with gary johnson when he and gary johnson got the nomination this last weekend
[03:15:58.720 --> 03:16:04.320]  it's been reported that the guy who finished second austin peterson presented gary johnson
[03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:11.840]  with a replica of george washington's uh pistol a flintlock pistol okay made a very formal declaration
[03:16:11.840 --> 03:16:17.200]  you now have my support and my gun and so forth and so on uh when he left gary johnson just tossed
[03:16:17.200 --> 03:16:21.280]  it in the trash according to witnesses who are there it's been reported from a number of different
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:27.760]  sources uh it was reported by um uh representatives who are there was reported in liberty hangout as
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:35.600]  well as um other libertarian publications bloggers they took pictures of it they put it on the
[03:16:35.600 --> 03:16:41.120]  web they said they took it back showed it to austin peterson he uh now has that gun back
[03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:46.480]  but austin peterson doesn't want to make waves see this is about politics and isn't it pathetic
[03:16:46.480 --> 03:16:51.440]  that's something as small as the libertarian party and of course they do have 50 state ballot
[03:16:51.440 --> 03:16:57.200]  access that's something they have consistently done but people who really don't have a chance of
[03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:03.920]  winning would sell out their principles like this it really is sad to see people do this
[03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:09.280]  out of a political position of course what they want to do is they want to get on the government
[03:17:09.280 --> 03:17:15.120]  peat okay they can get government subsidies if they get to five percent nationally and so they
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:19.760]  put this ticket together and as gary johnson said william weld is a connected guy and he's
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:25.120]  connected to the northeast establishment he knows mit romney he knows all these uh northeastern
[03:17:25.120 --> 03:17:30.400]  liberals the establishment of the republican party as well as the establishment of the democrats
[03:17:30.400 --> 03:17:34.880]  so they believe they can get some money they can get five percent and they are willing the party
[03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:40.880]  who elected him is willing to sell out to these two guys because they're both former governors
[03:17:40.880 --> 03:17:45.040]  now real quickly before we go to some of the other news i wanted to give you some food recall
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:50.560]  information because i think this is very important you need to understand and protect yourself you
[03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:56.080]  need to understand how your food supply like everything else is very vulnerable look at this
[03:17:56.800 --> 03:18:03.120]  uh yesterday general mills recalls 10 million pounds of flour over a possible link to ecoli
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:08.800]  outbreaks in 20 different states and these are brand's gold medal signature kitchen
[03:18:08.800 --> 03:18:15.680]  wonder of flour they were sold at safeway alberson's jewel shaw's bonds united randles and acme
[03:18:15.680 --> 03:18:22.240]  across the country now they say they haven't found uh any uh ecoli in either flour products but they're
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:27.280]  recalling them out of quote an abundance of caution well i'd say that's a lot of caution
[03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:31.840]  if you're going to recall 10 million pounds of flour why would they do that well they've had 38
[03:18:31.840 --> 03:18:37.760]  people that have come down with ecoli between december and may half of those people became ill
[03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:42.880]  reported making something with general mills flour some of those people may have eaten raw dough or
[03:18:42.880 --> 03:18:46.880]  batter according to the company so important thing here first of all don't eat raw dough
[03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:53.120]  secondly your food supply is not as safe as you may think it is just because it comes in nice clean
[03:18:53.120 --> 03:18:58.320]  packaging doesn't mean that some really nasty stuff can't find its way in there by accident or
[03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:04.640]  deliberately look at this story out of taiwan we got the eco watch reporting on the 27th of may
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:11.040]  that taiwan has recalled quaker oats products imported from the u.s after detecting july fosate
[03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:15.280]  and the oatmeal i say a random inspection from taiwan's food and drug administration detected
[03:19:15.280 --> 03:19:20.960]  glyphosate in 10 out of 36 oatmeal products that tested they exceeded the country's legal limit
[03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:26.640]  well their legal limit is extremely low say they're not americans and americans and we don't have a
[03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:33.280]  problem with that because we have a nice cozy relationship between big agro lobbyists and
[03:19:33.280 --> 03:19:38.560]  the fda is called regulatory capture and so they say well because we have this nice relationship
[03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:43.920]  here we're going to tolerate glyphosate in the food they don't do that in taiwan they also don't
[03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:49.520]  allow the growing of gmo there and if they bring in food that is genetically modified they have to
[03:19:49.520 --> 03:19:55.360]  label it and of course that's the whole point of glyphosate it's been designed by monsanto to work
[03:19:55.360 --> 03:19:59.200]  with their roundup products they work hand in hand stay with us we'll be right back

[03:24:31.120 --> 03:24:36.800]  ucla with the shooting before i do we have a new product that you may have heard earlier alexa

[03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:18.080]  you got to have clean water and then you need to look at your food supply and be careful about
[03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:22.560]  your food supply but you have to have air and water you can't go very long without air and water

[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:38.720]  by you without even knowing it so that's why it's important to have a purification system
[03:25:38.720 --> 03:25:44.000]  in your home let's go back to joe bigs who's now at the site of the ucla shooting joe

[03:26:04.320 --> 03:26:09.360]  many different stories one was like there was it was suicide one was there's like two people killed
[03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:13.600]  two people they're not sure what happened and something about four shooters i'm not exactly
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:17.520]  sure that's a telephone game it always changes yeah exactly all right well thanks for your time
[03:26:17.520 --> 03:26:20.960]  so we've been given so far david night and once again if you're just joining us i'm at the ucla
[03:26:20.960 --> 03:26:26.000]  campus or earlier there were reports of an active shooter uh comes to find out that there was actually
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:31.360]  a murder suicide they actually found a note and a gun and i just spoke with police they've actually
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:35.200]  given the all clear and people are starting to move out now a lot of the police are uh
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:41.760]  moving some of these uh lines down letting people go out allowing them to cross over into the different
[03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:48.560]  areas and uh you can see students starting to come in and out of the buildings now okay so they're
[03:26:48.560 --> 03:26:54.400]  starting to uh take down the martial law there is that right yeah so were you on here wouldn't it
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:58.000]  would when the lockdown happened uh yeah i was actually taking the final i was i walked over at
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:02.720]  nine thirty this morning i saw like the first uh cop car pull up and like whipped out like an assault
[03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:07.600]  rifle and like started yelling at the construction guys um and then i went straight over it had like
[03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:12.640]  to take a final and then i went into lockdown like halfway through uh so it's pretty crazy but yeah
[03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:15.760]  were the police were they just telling people to get on the ground or anything like that no you
[03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:20.640]  know i like i saw like the first cop come up like very first one like before like everyone
[03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:24.560]  started swarming and like i i saw that i was like in nine thirty when i got my final i like
[03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:28.880]  walked over it was like across campus there's actually like pretty far from uh bolter the
[03:27:28.880 --> 03:27:33.680]  engineering building but uh i didn't see it during the height of everything i give you guys any kind
[03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:37.360]  of information as to what was going on why the cop went up do you have an idea yeah they actually had
[03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:43.520]  uh did some some of the administrators in the uh in the murphy hall building they were uh calling
[03:27:43.520 --> 03:27:46.880]  us and giving us updates and stuff and like helping to share people how are you feeling
[03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:51.360]  all when you heard all that what were you thinking it's crazy it makes it hard to think about final
[03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:56.000]  but see it's crazy you know i don't know like crazy people what are you gonna do but what do
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:28:01.280]  you think the answer is and stuff like this i'm i'm i'm for more gun control myself but i don't
[03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:07.840]  i don't know you know this this stuff's always gonna happen i feel like i don't know i think more
[03:28:07.840 --> 03:28:13.920]  gun control to be honest but whatever all right well there you have it this way there you have
[03:28:13.920 --> 03:28:19.600]  it a victim of a gun freeze zone thinks that more gun control is better yeah there we go yeah that'll
[03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:24.080]  stop the criminals from getting it on it just like uh just like drug control has worked doesn't hit
[03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:29.840]  joe we we don't have drugs anymore because for 45 years we've had the war on drugs that prohibited
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:35.840]  drugs so we don't have that problem anymore do we we have it in spades yeah we have it in spades
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:41.840]  whenever you make something illegal guess what criminals find a way to get it and it gets on the
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:46.640]  street i mean even our own government a criminal's fast and furious trying to take guns and what do
[03:28:46.640 --> 03:28:50.240]  they do on straw purses is all this stuff allowing other people to get it and we get our own agents
[03:28:50.240 --> 03:28:54.480]  pulled by it it's ridiculous precisely because what you wind up with is the corruption of government
[03:28:54.480 --> 03:28:59.600]  and the government gets involved in the illicit trade and you see the intensity of it go up just
[03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:05.440]  as we saw the intensity of alcohol and of drugs go up under alcohol prohibition under drug prohibition
[03:29:05.440 --> 03:29:11.760]  you're going to see a lot of very new novel weapons once the legal restrictions come off of that so
[03:29:11.760 --> 03:29:16.160]  it's going to get a lot more dangerous and we already have seen what happened with venezuela
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:22.240]  venezuela confiscated guns because their economy was crashing they're hunting police on the streets
[03:29:22.240 --> 03:29:26.720]  and killing them for their weapons that's what's going to happen to the police they don't realize
[03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:32.960]  that here in this country yes exactly all right that's a large group of students coming out i'm
[03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:37.200]  going to go over here well thanks joe that's uh joe biggs and ucla stay with us we're going to be

[03:33:26.800 --> 03:33:31.520]  this june 1st 2016 you know we've already gone through about half of the year we've put in
[03:33:31.520 --> 03:33:36.720]  horn another month off of the calendar here hard to believe it's already june but things are coming
[03:33:36.720 --> 03:33:40.800]  up on us pretty quickly we're gonna have the political conventions going to be coming up
[03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:46.320]  very shortly we've got the california primaries going to be coming up next tuesday that's basically
[03:33:46.320 --> 03:33:49.360]  the end of it and then we're going to have the conventions it's going to be very interesting
[03:33:49.360 --> 03:33:53.440]  to see what happens with those we've got some more political news we also have news about
[03:33:54.000 --> 03:34:00.720]  stealth attacks on our laws and our privacy we're going to talk about that coming up as well as
[03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:09.520]  la raza grooming the castros to work with hillary clinton at the same time we've got these guys from
[03:34:09.520 --> 03:34:16.720]  texas orork and castro one of the castro twins traveling with obama to sell the trans pacific
[03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:23.040]  partnership yeah you know hillary says she's against that she was for it before she was against it
[03:34:23.040 --> 03:34:27.520]  and you can bet that if she gets in she's going to run it through now of course trump isn't i
[03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:32.800]  believe trump is legitimate and authentic on this issue he's complained about nafta he's complained
[03:34:32.800 --> 03:34:41.120]  about our unfair trade you know free trade is simply that it's free trade when you have thousands
[03:34:41.120 --> 03:34:46.720]  of pages of regulations that are produced by people who are not accountable to you that is not free
[03:34:46.720 --> 03:34:51.600]  trade that is managed trade it's trade that's being managed by people that you have absolutely no
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:58.320]  control over people who are writing these trade agreements they're essentially going to manage
[03:34:58.320 --> 03:35:03.280]  our economy from afar and it will not be to our advantage we've already seen how that works with
[03:35:03.280 --> 03:35:08.640]  nafta and when we look at these secret laws this is a story from the drudge report secret laws
[03:35:08.640 --> 03:35:14.240]  passed in the us spike under obama and we're going to talk about the many different ways
[03:35:14.240 --> 03:35:21.040]  that secret laws are created you know we had the american revolution fought because of taxation
[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:27.120]  without representation we now have legislation without representation our congress is not writing
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:32.480]  most the laws most the laws are being written by bureaucracies that report directly to the president
[03:35:32.480 --> 03:35:35.840]  but this is a report about something that's a little bit different something i wasn't even
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:43.040]  aware of until this article came out congress itself is passing secret laws that work hand in
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:49.920]  glove with the secret rulings from the secret court that is part of faiza so we'll talk about
[03:35:49.920 --> 03:35:53.760]  all that before we do i want to go to some of our callers who have been holding for a very long

[03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:14.320]  they have infiltrated mausoleum moths with um with with people posing to be mausoleum they have
[03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:22.560]  uncovered a plot called extraordinary momentum random that is targeting the united states for
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:33.840]  downfall by the end of this year it has marked uh terrorist targets that will happen this summer
[03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:40.160]  well i'm not surprised and you know we have obama is in a rush to get at least 10 000
[03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:44.560]  immigrants and as as refugees and of course we have this story from cns news saying this
[03:37:44.560 --> 03:37:52.160]  1000 three 1037 syrian refugees admitted in the month of may only two of those were christians
[03:37:52.160 --> 03:38:00.000]  and what we're seeing here is nothing less than an attempt to replace the demographics in america
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:04.800]  they want people who are not just the muslim religion but they want people from other countries
[03:38:04.800 --> 03:38:09.280]  who are going to see the federal government as their benefactor who are going to be loyal
[03:38:09.280 --> 03:38:13.200]  to the federal government who are going to be malleable by the federal government and they
[03:38:13.200 --> 03:38:18.720]  want to replace the demographics they want to have people here that are going to be beholden to them
[03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:24.080]  and as part of that they're going to be bringing in people that they can't vet you know we look
[03:38:24.080 --> 03:38:29.520]  at this and we we look at these statistics here you got to say if this is something that is about
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:35.040]  protecting people who are refugees then wouldn't they be bringing in christians at a higher rate
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:41.200]  because they're the ones who are the most at risk from isis and why is it that we can't protect
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:45.520]  people in country why is it that so many of these immigrants that are coming in are young men who
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:51.520]  should be fighting isis in their own country men who should be going to war with the violent
[03:38:51.520 --> 03:38:54.960]  takeover these terrorists who are in their country why are they fleeing the country
[03:38:54.960 --> 03:38:58.800]  leaving the women and children largely behind and coming into this country young men
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:03.520]  of military age coming in there's so much that's wrong about this i'm not surprised at all
[03:39:03.520 --> 03:39:09.120]  michael that there's uh somebody believes that they found some plots i think this entire thing
[03:39:09.120 --> 03:39:14.000]  smells like a rat and we've been saying that from for a very long time we know precisely what this is
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:19.280]  we know that obama wants to replace the demographics of this country and it's not just muslims it's
[03:39:19.280 --> 03:39:25.840]  people from every part of the world who will come here and will be reliable dependents on the federal
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:29.440]  government that's precisely what they're doing i want to move on because we had these other
[03:39:29.440 --> 03:39:33.280]  callers who've been waiting a long time let's go to uh robert and alabama robert go ahead
[03:39:35.760 --> 03:39:42.320]  yeah how you doing doing good thanks for holding yeah i i i really appreciate you mr night and uh
[03:39:42.320 --> 03:39:49.040]  i want to thank uh a lot of shows for for letting me on the show you know and uh what i want to talk
[03:39:49.040 --> 03:39:58.160]  about is um i'm really upset with our current situation and everything with with the government
[03:39:58.160 --> 03:40:06.400]  and uh i'm a veteran man i i've been over there in iraq i served three times you know i i went
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:15.600]  through the deal over there and i paint did the pain and suffering and um it just dishears me
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:23.200]  you know uh what's happened with this country you know uh and what are you concerned about
[03:40:23.200 --> 03:40:28.080]  what are you concerned about what you see happening with the country well we've let all
[03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:33.760]  these immigrants come over there we've held the battlefield over there in iraq and then obama
[03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:41.760]  comes in and and he gives that battlefield um back to the enemy you know that's something we
[03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:45.520]  saw happening in vietnam isn't it they would go in they would clear an area they would win the area
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:50.160]  and then they would just walk out again and turn it back over to the enemy and and people started
[03:40:50.160 --> 03:40:56.000]  realize that after a few years they really did not care at all about winning that war they simply
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:00.960]  wanted to have a testing ground for their weapons and if you go back and you look at the history
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:06.560]  of darpa we had the author who wrote the book the pentagon's brain uh any i think her name is
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.520]  any jacobson if i can remember correctly but she had an excellent expose where you see the beginnings
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:17.680]  of darpa in the vietnam war it began as a test bed for weapons is really what it was about and we
[03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:23.680]  look at obama now touring vietnam with these people selling the trans-pacific partnership
[03:41:24.320 --> 03:41:29.200]  that's where this ultimately leads this is global governance they could care less about
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:34.800]  what happens to our soldiers they're not interested in the welfare or the economy of our country
[03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:40.240]  they're simply any jacobson that's the pentagon's brain it's a great book if you haven't read that
[03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:46.000]  filled with it's a very compelling history of uh not just the vietnam war because it goes way
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:51.120]  beyond that it begins before the vietnam war and it goes way beyond that but you see how
[03:41:51.120 --> 03:41:57.280]  they betrayed the soldiers who fought in vietnam and now you've got obama with uh texas representatives
[03:41:57.280 --> 03:42:04.080]  a couple of democrat congressman orork and uh castro who supported the trans-pacific the
[03:42:05.280 --> 03:42:11.440]  trade promotion authority the tpa so they could ram through the tpp and the ttip the transatlantic
[03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:16.720]  and trans-pacific treaties he's got them with him and of course they're being groomed for
[03:42:16.720 --> 03:42:20.720]  higher positions within the democrat party uh was there anything else you want to say robert
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:24.320]  before i go on to chris i need to move on to the other caller real quickly you want to wrap it
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:32.480]  in one thing because i'm really disturbed because i reflected on um memorial day and this goes to
[03:42:32.480 --> 03:42:42.160]  memorial day because my um i have relatives that um actually uh fought the nazis during world war
[03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:49.840]  two you know and and i want to get my hat off to joe biggs for what he's doing out there in california
[03:42:49.840 --> 03:42:56.080]  he's a true patriot and everything and uh he's boots on the ground yes but i want to say this
[03:42:56.080 --> 03:43:03.520]  about my family you know because my family served in world war two and you know they fought that
[03:43:03.520 --> 03:43:12.720]  the nazis a lot of people don't know this but um you know went to the utah beach the battle of the
[03:43:12.720 --> 03:43:24.320]  branch all that and then um you know man uh yeah it was a tough time and when we look at what happened
[03:43:24.320 --> 03:43:30.640]  we after we fought the nazis what did we wind up with we wound up with operation paperclip
[03:43:30.640 --> 03:43:35.840]  we bought some brought back some of the most heinous war criminals you could find scientists
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:42.320]  and made them heads of our bio weapons technology made them head of our rocket science and uh
[03:43:42.320 --> 03:43:48.400]  that's what we've wound up with and that's a key part of this story about darpa and eventually
[03:43:48.400 --> 03:43:52.000]  what they do is they wind up experimenting on americans one of the experiments on americans
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:56.480]  and you know we talk about tiskegi all the time but you know just talk about what they did to people
[03:43:56.480 --> 03:44:01.760]  in vietnam not just americans but people in vietnam the way they tested weapons on them
[03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:07.760]  uh thank you uh robert let's go to chris and georgia go ahead chris how are you doing good go
[03:44:07.760 --> 03:44:13.680]  ahead thanks for holding and um i just want to first state that i'm a 15 year old who it was an
[03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:19.040]  info warrior and um my question to you is since people like me are waking up um i do go to public
[03:44:19.040 --> 03:44:24.400]  school and i do ask many people questions and i mean many people like me are i um waking up
[03:44:24.400 --> 03:44:29.200]  so what um so my question to you is what can people like me do to make a change
[03:44:30.800 --> 03:44:36.320]  well it's really an educational issue and as you talk to people and they're going to hear you
[03:44:36.320 --> 03:44:39.520]  explaining things to them it's going to be very different from what they've heard now they're
[03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:45.360]  starting to hear this in the mainstream media for the longest time we didn't hear many of these
[03:44:45.360 --> 03:44:49.920]  different aspects we didn't hear things about the secret 28 pages remember when that was first
[03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:54.160]  came up in the debates and donald trump talked about that that was something that people had
[03:44:54.160 --> 03:44:58.880]  been talking about since the 9-11 commission for example the people who are on the 9-11 commission
[03:44:58.880 --> 03:45:04.400]  were talking about that we've been talking about that for 15 years yet when donald trump brought
[03:45:04.400 --> 03:45:09.440]  it up what did they do we had national review come out and say donald trump sounds like an alex
[03:45:09.440 --> 03:45:15.840]  jones caller they said he sounds like you chris and they made fun of him but then they started
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:20.160]  looking into it and there was a report from 60 minutes looking into this and they went back and
[03:45:20.160 --> 03:45:26.240]  they talked again to the senators who were head of the intelligence committee who were on the 9-11
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:30.800]  commission they talked to them about what was going on and these people who have been pushing this
[03:45:30.800 --> 03:45:36.800]  for 15 years democrats and republicans and you know what it's not a conspiracy theory it's a
[03:45:36.800 --> 03:45:43.440]  conspiracy fact they have worked to cover this up and as they start to uncover what was happening
[03:45:43.440 --> 03:45:48.080]  with the missing 28 pages how they redacted information that they put in there about the
[03:45:48.080 --> 03:45:52.560]  Saudis now the Saudis are saying well Saudi official press is coming back and saying we
[03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:58.000]  think the american government had something to do with 9-11 so this whole conspiracy starts to
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:03.440]  unravel so the point is chris as you talk to people at first there's going to be reaction like
[03:46:03.440 --> 03:46:08.720]  that can't be true i've had that same reaction myself when i see a lot of this stuff uh when i
[03:46:08.720 --> 03:46:15.360]  first found out that that uh lennon was uh vladimir lennon was sent into the soviet union
[03:46:16.160 --> 03:46:22.240]  in a sealed train with 10 million dollars in gold by german central bankers to start the
[03:46:22.240 --> 03:46:26.160]  communist revolution i thought wait a minute that's just too strange i heard that from alex
[03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:29.840]  and it's like i gotta look that up and it's like he's right again you know you'll hear stuff like
[03:46:29.840 --> 03:46:34.560]  that that is really crazy but it's true they actually made a movie about it they don't show it
[03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:38.800]  in america pretty much but it's ben kinsley i forget the name of the movie but it's in uh
[03:46:38.800 --> 03:46:42.560]  you can find it in europe on dvd i don't think you can even get it in america they don't want you
[03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:48.800]  to think about the fact that there's uh you know the the communism in russia marxism was started
[03:46:48.800 --> 03:46:55.120]  by central bankers the guys who give us most of our wars so the key thing is to educate yourself
[03:46:55.120 --> 03:47:01.520]  and then not to be offended or surprised when people say i find that hard to believe just be
[03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:06.160]  ready to show them the facts that's why we show you the articles when we talk about these things
[03:47:06.160 --> 03:47:10.800]  because we back up what we do we give you links and we give you references to what we have done
[03:47:10.800 --> 03:47:17.840]  to back up the facts the information is there most of the time these are mainstream media sources
[03:47:17.840 --> 03:47:24.160]  they bury it in the back of uh their websites or the back of their pages uh papers uh but it's there
[03:47:24.160 --> 03:47:30.560]  and so we show those sources so just uh be ready chris to um uh first of all educate yourself and
[03:47:30.560 --> 03:47:35.280]  then gradually educate other people and be patient with them understand that it's going to take them
[03:47:35.280 --> 03:47:40.560]  a while to understand what's going on uh thanks for holding i want to before we run out of time
[03:47:40.560 --> 03:47:44.880]  here and we're getting pretty close to running out of time i want to talk about these secret
[03:47:44.880 --> 03:47:48.720]  laws and this is a story that was uh i believe it's on the drudge report secret laws pass in the
[03:47:48.720 --> 03:47:54.480]  u.s spike under obama this is a story from vocative they say a new story a new survey rather
[03:47:55.120 --> 03:48:00.320]  shows that for the past 30 years congress has steadily passed an increasing number of secret
[03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:06.000]  laws provisions that are kept from the public eye how about that you're not allowed to know what
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:12.960]  these laws are see when you have a dark secret state where everything is hidden from you even
[03:48:12.960 --> 03:48:19.040]  their laws now are secret isn't that amazing can you believe that even the laws now are going to
[03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:24.800]  be secret now this is an ohio state professor of law dakota rudasil i believe is the way you um
[03:48:25.600 --> 03:48:29.840]  pronounce the name went through this and found that more and more bills passed by congress
[03:48:30.560 --> 03:48:35.680]  include provisions that allow for secret elements which become law without the american people
[03:48:35.680 --> 03:48:40.960]  knowing what they contain now i've talked a lot and they go on the next paragraph talking about
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:46.000]  the faiza court and i've talked for a long time about how uh the faiza act the foreign intelligence
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:53.760]  surveillance act created a court that is uh creating these rulings they're the ones who
[03:48:53.760 --> 03:48:58.560]  gave the quote unquote search warrant for mr mrs verizon as rand paul talks about it they're the
[03:48:58.560 --> 03:49:04.640]  ones who said the nsa can do dragnet spying on the american people they did this in secret
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:10.640]  there was nobody advocating for us this is not a true court this is a single judge and this is
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:16.320]  one person one lawyer who goes from the government to that single judge and says i would like to do
[03:49:16.320 --> 03:49:20.880]  such and such there's nobody arguing for the american people there's nobody arguing for the
[03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:26.000]  constitution and as i point out in this this study refers only to changes in us law that come
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:31.520]  through secret acts of congress a president's executive order can also shape us law well
[03:49:31.520 --> 03:49:37.440]  theoretically okay and practice yes not legally not constitutionally as can the classified uh
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:43.520]  faiza court which secretly approves among other things warrants for nsa spying they say faiza
[03:49:43.520 --> 03:49:49.280]  court rulings can set hidden legal precedents as with the post 9 11 raw take order which allowed
[03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:54.720]  agents at the nsa fbi cia to share raw intelligence on americans with fewer restrictions in other
[03:49:54.720 --> 03:50:00.720]  words what they have said is not only can they approve these warrantless searches on all americans
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:08.000]  dragnet searches and violation of the constitution but they pretend and maintain that the faiza court
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:16.480]  can actually amend our constitution and not let us know and so now we find out that in addition
[03:50:16.480 --> 03:50:21.360]  to that we've got congress doing secret laws they say congress has enacted fewer and fewer
[03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:27.360]  laws since 1978 so they're letting the bureaucracy who you have no control over who are there
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:32.560]  perpetually you can't even get removed remove these people they answer strictly to the president
[03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:39.040]  that's how obama is using the epa to uh destroy the coal industry among other things is with the
[03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:44.480]  legislation come coming out of these bureaucracies like the epa but they say even as total laws
[03:50:44.480 --> 03:50:49.120]  past have decreased provisions in them when they finally do pass these laws from congress
[03:50:49.120 --> 03:50:55.600]  can quote reasonably reread to make a classified change to the us law and they're doing it in
[03:50:55.600 --> 03:51:00.880]  secret and they say what do these secret laws say we don't know they keep them secret and they
[03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:06.400]  could keep that secret even though the other stuff comes out and at 42 years old i suffered a massive
[03:51:06.400 --> 03:51:13.360]  heart attack and was told i'd be on disability for the rest of my life what did i do i created

[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:21.280]  before we went to break i was talking about these secret laws that are being written by congress
[03:55:21.280 --> 03:55:26.800]  and of course we have faiza that is secretly violating the fourth amendment amending our
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:32.160]  constitution but we even have congress that is writing secret laws and as they say in this article
[03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:36.960]  as for that what the secret laws say we don't know because they're secret and the person who
[03:55:36.960 --> 03:55:42.720]  exposes says it's kind of remarkable in this age when everything leaks there's not one single one
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:49.200]  of these addenda that has surfaced in 36 years so we don't actually know what's in them see the
[03:55:49.200 --> 03:55:56.400]  only thing they keep secret is their hidden agenda and this is no longer folks jefferson's america
[03:55:57.280 --> 03:56:05.680]  this is now becoming kafka's america the stasi and as he goes on to point out we've had DARPA
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:09.200]  as a part of this you know the pentagon's brain that we're just talking about earlier
[03:56:09.200 --> 03:56:14.560]  and their total information awareness act think about what we told you last year we're talking
[03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:20.000]  about jade helm and of course the subtitle that was mastering the human domain that really refers
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:26.240]  folks to geospatial intelligence it's about mapping out and tracking your activity activity
[03:56:26.240 --> 03:56:34.080]  based intelligence taking a look at where you go who you meet what you do mapping that out on the
[03:56:34.080 --> 03:56:39.120]  human domain as they call it a human map it's geospatial intelligence we now have these
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:43.120]  latest articles here an appeals court this is from the intercept an appeals court delivers
[03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:48.640]  a devastating blow to cell phone privacy advocates what they're saying is is that the metadata
[03:56:48.640 --> 03:56:54.720]  is not protected but the metadata is the most valuable intelligence they can get from you it's
[03:56:54.720 --> 03:57:00.720]  more valuable than your conversations or your texts because they can use that for predictive
[03:57:00.720 --> 03:57:05.440]  programming that was what total information awareness was about it was about pre-crime
[03:57:05.440 --> 03:57:10.560]  it was about minority report types of surveillance that's why this is so serious they say when
[03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:15.280]  law enforcement asks the company for cell phone records to track location data in a new investigation
[03:57:15.280 --> 03:57:21.360]  is that a search under the fourth amendment oh of course it is but the courts say no so we have
[03:57:21.360 --> 03:57:26.560]  three politically appointed judges and they say well search isn't a search when we say it isn't
[03:57:26.560 --> 03:57:31.920]  a search then we see this coming out of Illinois someone is trying to put trying to gut America's
[03:57:31.920 --> 03:57:37.600]  strongest biometric privacy laws this is something that Illinois had it's the biometric information
[03:57:37.600 --> 03:57:44.960]  privacy act they put it in eight years ago and it prohibited companies from making biometric scans
[03:57:44.960 --> 03:57:50.320]  of your body and putting that in their database but now we've got corporations who see that they
[03:57:50.320 --> 03:57:56.240]  can make a profit from this so they're quietly going in the back door and introducing legislation
[03:57:56.240 --> 03:58:03.760]  to gut this they put it into a law that was called the unclaimed property procedures act okay
[03:58:03.760 --> 03:58:08.560]  because you know what it's your rights that are going unclaimed you're letting these people take
[03:58:08.560 --> 03:58:13.600]  your rights in Europe they're saying finally we're going to get self-driving cars because of new
[03:58:13.600 --> 03:58:19.760]  united nation laws that's the way they're taking it because you're not paying attention to where
[03:58:19.760 --> 03:58:24.480]  this is going join us tonight that's the end of our show we have no more time to go into this
