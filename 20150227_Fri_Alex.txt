[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:29.800]  boy I tell you Eric Holder makes me want to throw up the corrupt out of control
[00:29.800 --> 00:37.320]  Attorney General who works for the big law firm that certifies derivative
[00:37.320 --> 00:45.680]  sales has come out and urged young people to read Malcolm X and says that
[00:45.680 --> 00:52.000]  the reason he's been criticized is because he's black the reason Eric
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.280]  Holder has been criticized is because he's helped Obama and the globalist run
[00:56.280 --> 01:03.320]  completely and totally rough shot over the Constitution Bill of Rights worse
[01:03.320 --> 01:08.400]  than Bush and his crew of crooks could even imagine
[01:10.200 --> 01:20.700]  simply disgusting to see this and that's out of Politico read Malcolm X
[01:20.700 --> 01:27.560]  behaving like he's some type of outside radical trying to bring freedom and
[01:27.560 --> 01:33.840]  change trying to give people to stand up for themselves with the right of self
[01:33.840 --> 01:38.160]  defense which I totally agree with that Malcolm X promoted and then Malcolm X
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.960]  really transcended his base racism which I didn't blame him for growing up in a
[01:42.960 --> 01:48.540]  racist society to understanding the larger paradigm of race manipulation so
[01:48.540 --> 01:54.280]  when he called for racial unity he was murdered Eric Holder is the opposite of
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.640]  Malcolm X pushing racial division constantly and working with George
[01:58.640 --> 02:06.040]  Soros in a dialectic to federalize and militarize police and then blame the
[02:06.040 --> 02:11.040]  police when they're under federal regulations and training and then fund
[02:11.040 --> 02:19.880]  30 plus million dollars was it 33 34 million dollars 33 700,000 something
[02:19.880 --> 02:26.400]  just to get riots going black against the police so the police will then see
[02:26.400 --> 02:29.880]  blacks is even more of an enemy and blacks will see police as the enemy and
[02:29.880 --> 02:36.560]  get basically a mini micro localized civil war going in the inner cities of
[02:36.560 --> 02:43.680]  this country so I guess maybe he is talking about Malcolm X's early writings
[02:43.680 --> 02:47.680]  that said well there's gonna be a race war let's have one but that was back
[02:47.680 --> 02:52.440]  when you had really clear oppression in some areas and that was back when the
[02:52.440 --> 02:58.160]  Klan was burning and lynching and murdering blacks in the south I mean
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.200]  if I was black and people do that to me I'd sound like Malcolm X and say I got
[03:01.200 --> 03:06.240]  guns you try that I'm gonna kill you got a right to defend yourself Eric Holder
[03:06.240 --> 03:11.400]  is up there in the power position signing us on the derivatives protecting
[03:11.400 --> 03:14.520]  the big mega banks protecting the insurance companies robbing us with
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.120]  Obamacare running all these fat cat scams Obama's in Africa saying
[03:19.120 --> 03:24.840]  Africans can't have cars or air conditioning black unemployment's
[03:24.840 --> 03:30.040]  doubled under Obama the borders are wide open and then they've got the nerve
[03:30.040 --> 03:34.880]  to sit there and act like it's because of racism and that he's on the outside
[03:34.880 --> 03:40.400]  like some true outside radical like Malcolm X who really did go against the
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.080]  grain who really did have courage who really did originally stand for
[03:45.080 --> 03:48.800]  something even my disagree with some of his rhetoric it was the time and space
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.480]  he was in was different than the time and space we're in now it's easy with
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.960]  hindsight to look back and criticize Malcolm X but let me tell you I've read
[03:56.960 --> 04:00.760]  what Malcolm X had to write I've listened to some of his speeches and I agree
[04:00.760 --> 04:06.240]  with him a lot more than I agree with most people and I can tell you that Eric
[04:06.240 --> 04:13.400]  Holder is no Malcolm X he is an establishment fat cat trolling the
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.040]  public creating more vulcanization divide and conquer to manipulate each other
[04:18.040 --> 04:26.400]  at our throats to get us at each other's throats and it's unbelievable
[04:26.400 --> 04:34.960]  simply unbelievable we've also got the giant drama of Jeb Bush lecturing CPAC
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.480]  Republicans who don't like him that we better accept open borders and
[04:39.480 --> 04:44.400]  everything else and now there's talk of a CPAC attendee plan to walk out on Jeb
[04:44.400 --> 04:51.160]  Bush absolutely beautiful that is exactly what needs to happen I mean you
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.400]  might as well elect Hillary Clinton if you're gonna elect Jeb Bush two peas in

[08:52.000 --> 08:56.360]  site the Chicago PD says they know about but they're not doing anything about it
[08:56.360 --> 09:00.920]  this is a site that they are detaining and arresting American citizens off the
[09:00.920 --> 09:04.400]  record they're doing it off the record because what they're doing is wrong and
[09:04.400 --> 09:08.680]  anytime lawyers anyone goes up there and tries to find out who's in there they
[09:08.680 --> 09:12.320]  said that they are jeopardizing ongoing investigations this is out of control
[09:12.320 --> 09:15.440]  this is something that needs to stop and I encourage each and every one of you

[10:26.040 --> 10:31.520]  support the American way of life once again I'm Joe Biggs with info wars.com
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.320]  Joe shot that last night they flew out at about 6 a.m. this morning on Austin
[10:37.320 --> 10:42.360]  there in Chicago right now trying to get their rent car and get out there to the
[10:42.360 --> 10:46.360]  black site and I want to get them off of the third hour today even if they have
[10:46.360 --> 10:51.520]  to take a taxi cab out there when they need to get in place I'm I can tell you
[10:51.520 --> 10:57.640]  that we have breaking news on the secret torture center in Chicago that will
[10:57.640 --> 11:04.680]  break today or tomorrow if not Sunday with the Sunday broadcast 4 to 6 p.m. we
[11:04.680 --> 11:10.800]  will have the guys there on the ground but we have directly from inside city
[11:10.800 --> 11:18.920]  government intel on the black site that I could tell you James O'Keefe came out
[11:18.920 --> 11:22.520]  on Monday and said he fears for his life about to expose Al Sharpton and I
[11:22.520 --> 11:28.400]  understand why all sharpens a thug and a gangster who Obama just met with again
[11:28.400 --> 11:35.960]  at the White House he's kind of the Duke of Harlem but the stuff we know is
[11:35.960 --> 11:41.640]  quite frankly more dangerous than that and I want to be clear US media is not
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.000]  reporting on the black site London Guardian and others are there's some
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.720]  media but not any national media we are going to be reporting it as national
[11:50.720 --> 11:58.280]  media filling the vacuum where dinosaur media will basically drops the ball when
[11:58.280 --> 12:02.200]  it finally breaks I predict they're gonna make it like we're anti-police or
[12:02.200 --> 12:10.640]  anti-law in order imagine in America huge four and five story buildings
[12:10.640 --> 12:17.040]  complexes with chain link fences around them with barbed wire where suspects are
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.320]  taken in not booked not arraigned disappeared for days there's the
[12:21.320 --> 12:27.520]  headline Gestapo tactics at US police black site ring alarm from Chicago to
[12:27.520 --> 12:36.520]  Washington that's the London Guardian and our reporters are there on the ground
[12:36.520 --> 12:42.200]  we have intel inside Chicago government that's all I'm going to tell you and I'm
[12:42.200 --> 12:50.200]  gonna just say this it's much worse than even what the Guardian has to say when
[12:50.200 --> 12:57.760]  Joe Beggs was in Virginia last year he would deliver people in Afghanistan to
[12:57.760 --> 13:03.880]  the DEA and the CIA for torture he admits it people say how dare you well
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.800]  I mean he was under orders he says it's wrong he would just pick these people up
[13:08.800 --> 13:12.040]  be told where to go get him he pull up with armored vehicles grab them take
[13:12.040 --> 13:18.960]  them back and sometimes they didn't come out you need to understand we show the
[13:18.960 --> 13:21.680]  London Guardian articles in fact we print me all four of the articles they've
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.600]  done thank you where they would recruit out of this black site in Chicago we
[13:26.600 --> 13:31.000]  now learn it's been there for a decade and this is a training center where they
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.320]  then send them to Iraq and Afghanistan and put former police lieutenants over
[13:37.320 --> 13:45.600]  entire black sites in Afghanistan Iraq I mean this is in the London Guardian and
[13:45.600 --> 13:50.320]  it was first in alternative blogs that exposed it with lawyers in Chicago who
[13:50.320 --> 13:55.560]  got threatened and there's video the Guardian has and photos of cops in what
[13:55.560 --> 13:59.680]  looked like military uniforms with masks on coming over basically being
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.600]  somewhat threatening now the argument will be Chicago's collapsing we've got
[14:05.600 --> 14:09.360]  criminals you know they get lawyers and get away with stuff folks that's how
[14:09.360 --> 14:13.200]  tyranny always works oh we're secretly disappearing people into a black site
[14:13.200 --> 14:16.080]  because they're bad I'm sure most the people they're taken to these black
[14:16.080 --> 14:21.120]  sites are probably bad it doesn't matter you turn into Satan himself when you
[14:21.120 --> 14:25.040]  start disappearing people into secret centers people have died in this
[14:25.040 --> 14:32.000]  facility they are being tortured in this facility that's come out in court
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.840]  that people die and are tortured and they do stuff like shackle you for two
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.160]  days hanging from the wall try doing that for ten minutes it is horrible
[14:44.160 --> 14:48.920]  torture restraining chairs people beaten to death and they're always found in
[14:48.920 --> 14:58.160]  their cell dead so of course it's Chicago the big Democratic Party cess pit
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.480]  and as society degenerates you're only going to see more of this because the
[15:04.480 --> 15:09.600]  cops are watching Jack Bauer on shows like 24 where torture was so sexy and
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.080]  cool and so of course they created substations and you can believe it's
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.040]  in the only one in Chicago kind of letting the cat out of the bag they
[15:17.040 --> 15:20.280]  already know they're already tracking what we do yes we know about your other
[15:20.280 --> 15:24.160]  black sites we're going to them you won't stop us in fact I just made the
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.160]  decision that's why I went ahead and went with it I'm not gonna send them in
[15:27.160 --> 15:30.360]  there without the government knowing that we already know because then they
[15:30.360 --> 15:33.440]  might try to grab them we already know about two other black sites one of them
[15:33.440 --> 15:40.040]  is even bigger and more secretive in Chicago there I said it and that first
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.760]  they're going to the big facility that's known to just put on record they're in
[15:43.760 --> 15:49.640]  Chicago and I eat them on video live so it's on record they were there and go
[15:49.640 --> 15:52.880]  ahead and try to rough up my reporters or take them into the black site I'm
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.000]  gonna just tell the Chicago police something right now Joe Biggs hopes you
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.040]  do something like that because he wants to expose you he wants to go inside so
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.360]  watch your butts it's all I'm gonna tell you I just have a rule that I got to
[16:05.360 --> 16:08.640]  just tell people what I'm doing so it's all out in the open I have trouble
[16:08.640 --> 16:16.280]  sneaking around but there you go so pray for Josh Owens and Joe Biggs in the
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.960]  front lines of the battle for the Republic Joe Biggs getting a shot of
[16:20.960 --> 16:24.880]  rubber bullets and tear gas with Jacari with the Al Jazeera crew and the the
[16:24.880 --> 16:35.320]  vice crew my other reporters anchors David Knight again Josh Owens who just
[16:35.320 --> 16:38.280]  keeps being in the middle of it being there when the fed said we're gonna open
[16:38.280 --> 16:41.920]  fire on you if you cross the line to the Bundy Ranch they went over the line and
[16:41.920 --> 16:47.280]  the feds backed off huge victory you can watch that famous video fed surrender to
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.280]  armed citizens I mean this is not a game this is the real deal and quite
[16:52.280 --> 16:57.280]  frankly I should be in Chicago Joe Biggs ran for me two days ago and said I want
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.720]  to go I want to go and I went why didn't I think of that this is breaking black
[17:01.720 --> 17:07.560]  sites secret torture sites huge news absolutely Joe and take whoever wants to
[17:07.560 --> 17:14.760]  go with you and Owens volunteered yet again but quite frankly this is so big
[17:14.760 --> 17:23.000]  that I'm going to go to Chicago I just got so much work to do and so much to
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.440]  run here but I need to I need to go to Chicago sometime next week and go to
[17:30.440 --> 17:35.040]  these sites myself and I need to do stuff because I've got cameras that have
[17:35.040 --> 17:40.400]  got special shotgun microphones and things that can really get audio of
[17:40.400 --> 17:44.080]  things going on and I've got tactics that I know will end up getting the
[17:44.080 --> 17:48.840]  story that I've implemented many many years ago 15 16 17 years ago when I
[17:48.840 --> 17:52.560]  should get out in the field and cover and track all this type of stuff but I
[17:52.560 --> 18:00.600]  know Joe and Owens are highly motivated so there's a lot we know of two other
[18:00.600 --> 18:06.640]  sites secret substations secret facilities that they're totally illegal
[18:06.640 --> 18:10.560]  I mean I can't tell you in fact let's just get some constitutional lawyers on
[18:10.560 --> 18:14.400]  people want to hear it from a lawyer but I can tell you right now it is
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.200]  kidnapping when they arrest you and don't charge you or don't bring you
[18:18.200 --> 18:22.040]  before a magistrate and don't log you into the system I mean that is just
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.120]  felonies on top of felonies official oppression civil rights violations then
[18:27.120 --> 18:31.320]  when they actually do enhanced interrogation close quote and it turns
[18:31.320 --> 18:36.720]  out Rumsfeld was directing the Chicago facility and testing out police
[18:36.720 --> 18:41.640]  commanders to then go run operations in the Middle East I knew they recruited
[18:41.640 --> 18:47.120]  federal prison guards that had abuse records but this is creepy and it we
[18:47.120 --> 18:54.000]  have the names of the police lieutenants that did all this and and and have been
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.160]  involved in just incredible stuff in the Middle East and now we've learned from a
[19:00.160 --> 19:05.320]  very good source of two other even more secretive facilities one of them
[19:05.320 --> 19:09.200]  connected to the threat fusion center I'm just gonna leave it at that but man
[19:09.200 --> 19:13.560]  this is creepville and they're also using post offices as fronts they're
[19:13.560 --> 19:16.640]  gonna get really mad when they know we know about this some of this came out a
[19:16.640 --> 19:19.800]  few years ago about these upper floor quote surveillance centers where they
[19:19.800 --> 19:25.240]  watch the mail carriers below that's a cover story folks these secretive federal

[25:07.360 --> 25:12.560]  segment and they're gonna go up live on air and directly to the front gate that
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.240]  the media won't do and knock on it and if the cops flip out in America that we
[25:17.240 --> 25:24.080]  dare come to their CIA Pentagon run torture training substation facility
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.840]  where they then test and recruit people for operations in the Middle East and
[25:28.840 --> 25:33.680]  Central Asia it just shows how disconnected from reality they are the
[25:33.680 --> 25:37.800]  president's ruling that the borders wide open with no congressional authority
[25:37.800 --> 25:42.360]  he's banning 223 ammo basically and if he gets away with that it'll be
[25:42.360 --> 25:46.680]  everything he's not even doing an executive order he just says I order the
[25:46.680 --> 25:54.360]  ATF to make a rule the FCC just power grabbed the entire internet the name of
[25:54.360 --> 26:01.280]  protecting it and Ron Paul as the headline on info wars.com internet RIP a
[26:01.280 --> 26:06.960]  federal agency now claims the power to regulate the internet and they're gonna
[26:06.960 --> 26:11.640]  protect it by censoring people and they had a couple big corporations act like
[26:11.640 --> 26:15.320]  they were against this to fool the public into getting behind it meanwhile
[26:15.320 --> 26:25.400]  the usual suspect George Soros and the Ford Foundation gave $196 million this
[26:25.400 --> 26:32.120]  year and last year to pass this monstrosity do you see how all this ties
[26:32.120 --> 26:39.160]  in together here are five different London Guardian articles held for hours
[26:39.160 --> 26:44.120]  at secret Chicago black site you are a hostage it's kidnapping they hold people
[26:44.120 --> 26:47.560]  for as much as two days without putting on the database so illegal it is just
[26:47.560 --> 26:56.800]  mind-blowing Chicago black site former u.s. justice officials calls for home and
[26:56.800 --> 27:01.120]  square inquiry that's where our crew is right now the stopo tactics at u.s.
[27:01.120 --> 27:06.800]  police black site ring alarms from Chicago to Washington shocked politicians
[27:06.800 --> 27:12.040]  and rights groups call for inquiries into home square I mean the state police
[27:12.040 --> 27:16.320]  should be rating it right now it's the state that's over the counties and
[27:16.320 --> 27:19.400]  cities when they break the law I mean you you should have the equivalent of the
[27:19.400 --> 27:24.560]  Texas Rangers kicking down the door but no it's oh we'll investigate I mean it's
[27:24.560 --> 27:29.960]  amazing ramen annual faces questions as top supporters examine outrageous
[27:29.960 --> 27:32.360]  abuse
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.760]  Chicago's home square black site surveillance military-style vehicles
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.720]  and a metal cage the building looks innocent enough but those familiar with
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.160]  secret of interrogation holding facilities described a shocking display
[27:46.160 --> 27:52.400]  of police abuses as you get the TV division to pull up the Joe Biggs I
[27:52.400 --> 27:59.240]  think night was there to Virginia report from AP Hill and the others where
[27:59.240 --> 28:04.200]  they found the torture training facility and Joe says no these are these are like
[28:04.200 --> 28:08.280]  the medical torture chambers I brought people to I mean you understand Joe
[28:08.280 --> 28:13.040]  Biggs has been in Rolling Stone and Esquire in three different tours with
[28:13.040 --> 28:18.520]  Michael Hastings embedded with him all those battles and there was video and
[28:18.520 --> 28:23.400]  photos that you know Hastings wanted to be put in a frontline combat unit an
[28:23.400 --> 28:29.240]  army unit that you know wanted combat so he was in those missions and a lot of
[28:29.240 --> 28:33.480]  this stuff's on record so I'm just saying when Joe says all this I mean he's on
[28:33.480 --> 28:38.320]  record with his medals and purple hearts all the rest of it and it's been in the
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.800]  news except the torture part it did say that he ran you know operations
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.800]  scooping up militants and nighttime raids and all the rest of but the rest of
[28:46.800 --> 28:51.520]  story is he would take them to be tortured to death in some cases to death
[28:51.520 --> 28:55.280]  it's not like we're just sitting here going oh black side oh they might be
[28:55.280 --> 29:01.680]  torturing oh do they do this Joe Biggs basically was like a dog that would
[29:01.680 --> 29:09.600]  bring the duck to daddy or a cat that brings a rat to your doorstep he has
[29:09.600 --> 29:14.960]  seen it it's going on I mean rumsfeld in the guardian and then this has been
[29:14.960 --> 29:20.280]  declassified rumsfeld himself was in communication with the police lieutenants
[29:20.280 --> 29:25.200]  at this facility now what do you think he was in the secretary defense was on
[29:25.200 --> 29:32.000]  the telephone and signing secret memos of these people it's being done because
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.040]  they're training ladies and gentlemen for operations here in the United States
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.080]  and you know who the Justice Department's enemy is gun owners veterans libertarians
[29:40.080 --> 29:47.040]  conservatives active duty and police that aren't traders I mean we're living in

[33:06.960 --> 33:11.840]  even impose martial law without a warrant. We have to keep geoengineering on
[33:11.840 --> 33:15.360]  the table we have to look at it very carefully because we might get desperate
[33:15.360 --> 33:19.800]  enough to want to use it. I really feel like running around the street jumping
[33:19.800 --> 33:24.320]  in front of cars trying to warn people. Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids.
[33:24.320 --> 33:31.320]  Vaccines good. It's like the 1950s body snatcher where at the end he's running out
[33:31.320 --> 33:34.200]  of the town and he gets out on the highway and runs up the back of the army
[33:34.200 --> 33:37.840]  truck and there's more of the pods and he's like oh my gosh they're everywhere
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.440]  you've got to warn everyone I mean that's how I feel. He can authorize non
[33:42.440 --> 33:47.840]  health care licensed personnel read that to mean police to vaccinate people
[33:47.840 --> 33:51.720]  against their will. Why on earth would so-called conservative talk show host
[33:51.720 --> 33:56.480]  cover up the FEMA camps and do hit pieces on us saying it is true. Why on
[33:56.480 --> 33:59.720]  earth would Brian Williams be for Obamacare when he knows full well it's
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.840]  got death panels was written by insurance companies as a giant screw job. Why on
[34:04.840 --> 34:10.840]  God's green earth would we be starting a war with Russia right now and be the
[34:10.840 --> 34:16.520]  bad guys. Why I mean somebody's got to get hysterical here. I really am freaked
[34:16.520 --> 34:20.240]  out. I really have seen the tyranny. I really have learned to not trust the
[34:20.240 --> 34:24.880]  system and I know it's getting worse because I've grown up seeing and so I
[34:24.880 --> 34:29.880]  am running around freaking out trying to warn people as best I can. They say
[34:29.880 --> 34:33.520]  they're in other species they're super sapien they're gonna get rid of us
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.360]  they've already decided they're taking over okay this is like a war we've
[34:37.360 --> 34:42.920]  never seen. It's a cultural scientific rewrite takeover and so we got to warn
[34:42.920 --> 34:50.240]  people. Live from the InfoWars.com Studios it's Alex Jones.
[34:50.240 --> 34:57.040]  Our guys are getting set up right now we're about to test Skype with them in
[34:57.040 --> 35:02.600]  Chicago at the home square black site where people have died and where they
[35:02.600 --> 35:08.880]  admittedly trained police lieutenants to then be sent to Iraq and Afghanistan to
[35:08.880 --> 35:16.840]  run dungeons. I mean you just cannot make this stuff up because everybody wants
[35:16.840 --> 35:20.600]  to be a member of the secret police. Everybody wants to be Jack Bauer. Meanwhile
[35:20.600 --> 35:24.760]  our own government just helped fund Al Qaeda and ISIS to take over much of the
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.080]  Middle East. We even tried to overthrow our ally Egypt and put these people in
[35:29.080 --> 35:34.240]  charge. So see it's a double game. They create the threat protect the threat and
[35:34.240 --> 35:39.480]  then say we have to erode the Bill of Rights and Constitution to fight the
[35:39.480 --> 35:45.440]  threat. The FBI yesterday said we've got ISIS in all 50 states they're about to
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.240]  hit. We need more funding. We need to be able to integrate all our surveillance
[35:50.240 --> 35:53.800]  with local police. We need to be able to basically spy on everybody to keep you
[35:53.800 --> 36:02.000]  safe from ISIS. When our government nurtured and and and fed and funded this
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.200]  entire thing unbelievable while our guys are getting set and getting ready
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.420]  I get butterflies thinking about it about to go to the black site. I got
[36:15.420 --> 36:22.200]  I can hardly stand the oh what's the word the suspense but it's not suspense
[36:22.200 --> 36:28.560]  it's beyond that. Anticipation Buckley thank you. The anticipation of suspense
[36:28.560 --> 36:34.480]  the edge of your seat Leonard Nimoy just died. They just announced it on Fox News
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.560]  while I was out there running around in circles talking to the crew. My big fan
[36:38.560 --> 36:45.040]  of Leonard Nimoy on some of the TV shows he narrated. I'm not really a big
[36:45.040 --> 36:48.520]  Star Trek fan in the modern since I like the originals pretty much for their
[36:48.520 --> 36:54.960]  comedy value is just unbelievable. A life is like a garden perfect moments can be
[36:54.960 --> 37:00.900]  had but not preserved except in memory and that is I guess a quote from Leonard
[37:00.900 --> 37:08.960]  Nimoy but Leonard Nimoy is dead. Do we have that clip from Fox News? Let's go
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.360]  ahead and play this clip from Fox with the word coming in that Leonard Nimoy
[37:13.360 --> 37:17.560]  is dead. Now I don't tell me Captain Kirk's gonna die next cuz my goodness
[37:17.560 --> 37:20.840]  William Shatner is one of the greatest comics of all time and of course he
[37:20.840 --> 37:23.920]  doesn't know it but I don't mean that meanly he does know it he actually does
[37:23.920 --> 37:34.160]  comedy theater I've actually heard him do it but when my dad was younger he
[37:34.160 --> 37:38.600]  would get mistaken for for William Shatner I'm not kidding my dad before he
[37:38.600 --> 37:42.200]  grew a beard looks just like William Shatner. Let's go ahead and play the
[37:42.200 --> 37:48.800]  clip here it is. Actor Leonard Nimoy has died he was 83. Wow that picture says it
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.800]  all he has been part of really iconic Hollywood for so many years his years on
[37:54.800 --> 38:00.720]  Star Trek then on the movies as well such a superstar in that role. 83 years
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.520]  old he died at his home in Los Angeles the area of Bel Air his wife Susan
[38:05.520 --> 38:10.320]  confirming that a short time ago. We did know from reporting that he was at end
[38:10.320 --> 38:15.840]  stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that's COPD you often hear of
[38:15.840 --> 38:19.280]  prescriptive drugs that people are learning about now with this disease
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.400]  about a year ago he said he had it and by then he was fully fully had developed
[38:24.400 --> 38:30.720]  symptoms of that. Of course he announced that last year and everybody was very
[38:30.720 --> 38:33.640]  hopeful anyway let's talk about this just for a minute on the couch because I
[38:33.640 --> 38:39.120]  know we all have our own memories of Leonard Nimoy. Yeah well first of all
[38:39.120 --> 38:42.600]  the show itself is one of the most amazing shows it was a groundbreaking
[38:42.600 --> 38:46.320]  shows and it was integrated people were intelligent it was smart you don't want
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.960]  to be the one incident who went down to the planet with Captain Kirk. Man that
[38:52.960 --> 38:58.480]  is a real bummer right there but but now our crew is ready to go from the death
[38:58.480 --> 39:04.120]  of Leonard Nimoy. Remember narrating the crystal skulls and all that what was
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.560]  that show where they would go out and look at like fantastic stuff or strange
[39:08.560 --> 39:12.320]  things in the world but strange things that were real unexplained mystery
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.960]  something like that I love that show when I was a kid and look I try to be
[39:16.960 --> 39:24.520]  serious all the time but it's gallows humors. I said rough shot it's rough
[39:24.520 --> 39:30.040]  shot earlier the system is running rough shot over us all. It was Leonard Nimoy in
[39:30.040 --> 39:34.280]  search of was Leonard Nimoy in search of thank you CJ there you go that was a
[39:34.280 --> 39:40.320]  good show. Great narrator but now I need to shift gears into the serious news.
[39:40.320 --> 39:46.240]  CPAC attendees plan to walk out on Jeb Bush that's the Washington Times. Jeb
[39:46.240 --> 39:50.080]  Bush intends to lecture everyone that we need to have totally open borders for
[39:50.080 --> 39:54.640]  the North American Union that his daddy New World Order chieftain George Herbert
[39:54.640 --> 39:59.680]  Walker Bush tried to get started successfully. Sorry Jeb the race is
[39:59.680 --> 40:02.640]  wide opens as the Wall Street Journal. Yeah that's right they try to just tell
[40:02.640 --> 40:05.720]  us the last few months that Jeb Bush is the nominee and that's the end of it
[40:05.720 --> 40:11.040]  just accept it but Jeb Bush says he's not backing down from immigration stance
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.880]  we're going to get into that. Venezuela's military can now legally use
[40:14.880 --> 40:19.920]  firearms against demonstrators the communist state is degenerating quickly.
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.800]  We're also going to get into emergency responders investigate possible
[40:24.800 --> 40:32.040]  Virginia Ebola case Reuters AP reported two weeks ago in New Jersey that local
[40:32.040 --> 40:36.040]  officials said there's an emergency Ebola center they're disappearing people
[40:36.040 --> 40:41.160]  and won't tell us what's happening Forbes reported three months ago that they
[40:41.160 --> 40:44.400]  were in a meeting with the CDC chief and we're told we're all going to cover
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.360]  this up and not talk about Ebola cases and people being disappeared and there's
[40:48.360 --> 40:53.600]  been a bunch of other the famous CBS reporter that works for Fox now what's
[40:53.600 --> 40:58.200]  her name that blew the whistle and fast and furious and got canned she was on
[40:58.200 --> 41:02.000]  Fox who played the clip and said no they're they're covering up and say they
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.560]  will not discuss the Ebola cases but see I'm discredited though because we broke
[41:06.560 --> 41:11.000]  and had doctors on by name and other doctors that wouldn't come on that we
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.600]  know that said there are Ebola cases we've been ordered to cover them up and
[41:14.600 --> 41:17.820]  we're worried about liability they're being disappeared. Cheryl Atkinson
[41:17.820 --> 41:21.600]  Cheryl Atkinson that's right Cheryl Atkinson thank you it's great
[41:21.600 --> 41:25.120]  teleprompter free but when I can't remember something I got a lot of smart
[41:25.120 --> 41:29.040]  guys in there that that can come up with the answers so you have Cheryl
[41:29.040 --> 41:35.320]  Atkinson you have the Forbes reporter you have AP Reuters you have all this
[41:35.320 --> 41:41.080]  stuff going on we broke it and I'm not proud of that it's just that we get
[41:41.080 --> 41:47.120]  demonized and attacked going where's the Ebola just like we broke they're
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.080]  giving vouchers and shipping the illegals in and two months later the New York
[41:51.080 --> 41:56.400]  Times had to admit it and I mean I get it people don't want to admit this is
[41:56.400 --> 41:59.440]  happening and I always liken the borders being open and people not knowing
[41:59.440 --> 42:04.240]  about it to Ebola being here yeah you don't know about it because they cover
[42:04.240 --> 42:09.080]  it up but it keeps getting out here getting out there so I guess there's
[42:09.080 --> 42:15.520]  like six seven mainstream sources now highly respected confirming what we told
[42:15.520 --> 42:23.080]  you I mean we had medical doctors on by name saying they're disappearing people
[42:23.080 --> 42:27.280]  that look like they have Ebola but if they don't have Ebola the issue is why
[42:27.280 --> 42:33.720]  are they disappearing them the precedent of disappearing people is the big
[42:33.720 --> 42:40.800]  kahuna in Venezuela they disappear people in Cuba they disappear people in
[42:40.800 --> 42:45.120]  Soviet Russia they disappeared people in communist China today they disappear
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.520]  people and in ISIS controlled areas they disappear people I'm getting chills and I
[42:50.520 --> 42:56.160]  ran they disappear people only in a few free countries do they not disappear you
[42:56.160 --> 43:02.320]  into black sites and we can go ahead and put a feed up of our reporters for TV
[43:02.320 --> 43:06.400]  viewers ready listeners go to info wars dot com four slash show in the subzero
[43:06.400 --> 43:11.080]  temperatures staff sergeant Joe bags back in the army but this time the army of
[43:11.080 --> 43:15.400]  the republic in the info war out there in the freezing cold in front of
[43:15.400 --> 43:20.240]  Chicago's home square black site surveillance military style vehicles
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.400]  and a metal cage where they train torturers this is an alun and guardian
[43:24.400 --> 43:28.720]  and local Chicago papers to send them to Iraq and Afghanistan so they practice
[43:28.720 --> 43:34.080]  on Americans just like drones or tasers and L rads remember a general decade
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.320]  ago so we've got to use L rads we we've got to use the sound and the
[43:38.320 --> 43:43.160]  microwave cannons on Americans because then we can legally use them on
[43:43.160 --> 43:48.960]  foreigners getting around rules against it in the Geneva Convention so the
[43:48.960 --> 43:53.720]  disappeared Chicago police detain Americans and abuse laden black site
[43:53.720 --> 43:58.720]  Chicago's home and square black site surveillance people died there people
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.840]  disappeared there here's another headline Gestapo tactics at US police
[44:02.840 --> 44:08.280]  black sites ring alarms from Chicago to Washington Chicago black site former
[44:08.280 --> 44:12.640]  U.S. Justice official calls for home and square inquiry well there's not a lot of
[44:12.640 --> 44:15.720]  media coverage domestically on this because there's so much media control
[44:15.720 --> 44:20.760]  it's starting to get the few Chicago papers and of course the Democrats and
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.400]  Roman manual are running this whole operation the worst abuses are always in
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.720]  areas they control this should frighten everyone because homeland security says
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.880]  their main focus is returning veterans gun owners Christians conservatives
[44:32.880 --> 44:37.640]  libertarians and now they're saying local police departments we knew this was
[44:37.640 --> 44:42.400]  coming that aren't you know that are being radicalized oh yes you mean
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.360]  they're finding out the truth so this is a big deal this is about
[44:46.360 --> 44:50.720]  federalization it's about secrecy we were just talking about people being
[44:50.720 --> 44:58.720]  disappeared who they think have Ebola and now it's in Reuters today and now
[44:58.720 --> 45:02.920]  we're at another place where people are being disappeared staff sergeant Joe
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.440]  Biggs and I don't usually use his military title but the our reporters are in a
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.560]  war zone folks they're about to go up to the gate and knock on the door that no
[45:11.560 --> 45:14.600]  one else dares do I didn't order him to do this I said if you choose to do it do
[45:14.600 --> 45:18.400]  it and let me tell you Chicago police are the most vicious in the country no
[45:18.400 --> 45:22.840]  one denies that I mean they've been run by Capone the whole you know since the
[45:22.840 --> 45:27.760]  days of the Tommy gun and so our reporters are gonna go up there Joe
[45:27.760 --> 45:31.600]  Biggs I gotta tell you you're fighting for America here in this Republic a lot
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.040]  more than you are in Afghanistan Iraq do you agree with that statement Roger that
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.280]  Alex Jones I do well give us your takes that you got there this morning and what
[45:40.280 --> 45:44.600]  you're about to do and fill people in on this black site well Joe Biggs info
[45:44.600 --> 45:47.440]  wars.com we're standing outside of Hammond Square as you can see it's right
[45:47.440 --> 45:51.160]  behind us it's a pretty well-gated area it looks like during the day this is a
[45:51.160 --> 45:56.240]  type of spot where they have normal office hours in the bottom floor where
[45:56.240 --> 46:00.040]  it looks just like a regular place and I guess that's one of the best ways to
[46:00.040 --> 46:03.360]  help keep what's going on upstairs a secret it seems like some of the people
[46:03.360 --> 46:07.040]  we've talked to they've come in here to pay fines things of that nature but it
[46:07.040 --> 46:12.400]  is very well-fenced off it's hard to get into that area in general there's a
[46:12.400 --> 46:15.760]  bunch of the cop vehicles all the police officers I've seen thus far coming
[46:15.760 --> 46:20.320]  through here have been in civilian attire so they're definitely you know
[46:20.320 --> 46:25.960]  like undercover kind of a police type people out here but you know it feels
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.720]  like zero degrees out here so coldest weather I've ever been in so I guess we
[46:30.720 --> 46:33.440]  can go up there and find out what's gonna happen but I don't know how much
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.680]  we're gonna be able to get into well we've got a lot of plans we're gonna
[46:36.680 --> 46:39.960]  talk about on air when you're gonna be there for four or five days we know
[46:39.960 --> 46:42.960]  about some other black sites you're gonna go to we can also show the one in
[46:42.960 --> 46:47.400]  Guardians photos of guys in military gear wearing mask so go ahead let's go up
[46:47.400 --> 46:50.640]  there with you live and I'll be narrating while you're walking for
[46:50.640 --> 46:54.720]  radio listeners Joe Biggs and Josh Owens I should have gotten even colder
[46:54.720 --> 46:58.640]  weather gear you guys want to take the company credit card and go and get some
[46:58.640 --> 47:02.560]  even bigger coats the coats on me because you're wearing a leather jacket
[47:02.560 --> 47:08.200]  and sweater bro my hands are numb and they said after 15 minutes
[47:08.200 --> 47:12.120]  hypothermia and frostbite start to set in so yeah so we're gonna have to put
[47:12.120 --> 47:15.280]  you back in the car in about 10 15 minutes to warm you back up toast you
[47:15.280 --> 47:17.920]  back up we'll talk to you back at the bottom of the air but I want you guys
[47:17.920 --> 47:21.880]  to go buy some better cold weather gear because that that leather jacket's not
[47:21.880 --> 47:25.960]  gonna cut it up there I mean I was reading in Chicago and areas in Michigan
[47:25.960 --> 47:30.440]  not just Illinois it's been like below zero at night oh it's 16 degrees well
[47:30.440 --> 47:35.720]  that's not too bad I heard the windshields really bad here feels like two
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.920]  or zero well you've got that cold cold air coming off that lake that's why
[47:41.920 --> 47:45.360]  Mark Twain said the coldest winter I ever spent was the summer in San Francisco
[47:45.360 --> 47:51.600]  just that cold damp damp air makes makes it they say it's like 10 degrees it's
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.560]  more like 20 below all right he's coming up barbed wire fence barbed wire on the
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.760]  top you got the police vehicles in there and I guess to somebody open the gate
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.200]  to let people enter can you go knock on the front door and try to get in because
[48:05.200 --> 48:09.960]  we know they've got restraints shackles it's a huge facility but like most CIA
[48:09.960 --> 48:16.760]  cutouts it like most CIA cutouts which we know is involved in this it's a very
[48:16.760 --> 48:22.680]  secretive you guys take your time I know it's icy out there Joe this lady on the
[48:22.680 --> 48:25.700]  sidewalk she said there's no way to get in all you can do is go up this guard
[48:25.700 --> 48:29.280]  shack and talk to somebody there that's as close as you can get well they don't
[48:29.280 --> 48:35.960]  want this identified that's why it's covert which I get our offices like
[48:35.960 --> 48:41.000]  that but we're not torturing people in here is the difference you know before
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.760]  you walk in here I want to show you something Alex is extremely hilarious
[48:43.760 --> 48:47.960]  because across the street there's a bank that says Liberty Bank freedom is here
[48:47.960 --> 48:51.600]  but just across this little small street freedom is not here this is where they
[48:51.600 --> 48:55.600]  detain American citizens without reading them the rights allowing them to
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.280]  contact their lawyers just like we're supposed to be afforded as American
[48:59.280 --> 49:02.560]  citizens but here I just think it's hilarious to have a place that says
[49:02.560 --> 49:05.760]  freedom is here across the street but right here this is going on you're right
[49:05.760 --> 49:09.160]  the Guardian has reported they hold people up to two days and people have
[49:09.160 --> 49:13.920]  died in there I mean imagine just being taken to a secret facility and
[49:13.920 --> 49:20.240]  disappeared all right Joe is now coming up we're showing some footage of a
[49:20.240 --> 49:23.560]  secret torture training camp we found in Virginia but let's cut back before we go
[49:23.560 --> 49:28.200]  to that let's cut back here we are it says attention no trespassing any
[49:28.200 --> 49:32.960]  unauthorized persons found in home square property are subject to arrest Joe
[49:32.960 --> 49:38.200]  let's talk to the cop and that in that so we've heard based off many articles
[49:38.200 --> 49:43.640]  that have been out in the Guardian and all this that this place is what the
[49:43.640 --> 49:50.440]  mic up to the what can you have them up to the hole so why you guys acting so
[49:50.440 --> 49:58.200]  secretive about this place why can't you just just answer a few questions but
[49:58.200 --> 50:03.080]  why not though there's nothing going on so but you can you guys at least admit
[50:03.080 --> 50:05.280]  though that you guys illegally detain people here and hold them without
[50:05.280 --> 50:12.400]  reading them the rights so he's refusing to talk to us and he says that we have
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.640]  to go to a public affairs office which is not even around oh look people are
[50:16.640 --> 50:23.000]  coming out of the red hole right there yeah go talk to them and you guys know
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.960]  what's going on in here they just hope to sweep everything under the rug yep the
[50:27.960 --> 50:33.240]  answers wait till these people drive out they don't want to be seen oh there's a
[50:33.240 --> 50:39.600]  cop right there where no that's a postman well you had a badge on his shirt
[50:39.600 --> 50:46.320]  maybe everything looks like that these days well we're gonna have Joe and our
[50:46.320 --> 50:50.520]  crew there filing reports on all of this and obviously we'll just tell them
[50:50.520 --> 50:52.360]  because we're not doing anything wrong they like everything we're doing wrong
[50:52.360 --> 50:56.440]  you guys are gonna be out there surveilling them from the car because
[50:56.440 --> 51:00.160]  we're the press that's what we do and I'm sorry the Guardian the lawyers it's
[51:00.160 --> 51:04.000]  all come out people've died in there they're torturing people Joe what do you
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.600]  make he's on his phone right now he's just called in and I'm sure he's gonna
[51:07.600 --> 51:13.320]  have people coming out any second now good Joe what do you make of the fact
[51:13.320 --> 51:17.520]  that police lieutenants by name are you guys doing can I talk to you real quick
[51:17.520 --> 51:23.840]  excuse me follow them what's going on here good yeah follow those police
[51:23.840 --> 51:28.480]  they're not as arrogant as the Chicago police usually are well they're not even
[51:28.480 --> 51:33.560]  talking to us now they're going in that area yeah don't go on the property they're
[51:33.560 --> 51:36.240]  all looking at us now they're all jumping in the vehicles and starting to
[51:36.240 --> 51:42.640]  scurry off yeah yeah they're like piling out and leaving now huh a bunch of
[51:42.640 --> 51:46.920]  cockroaches well most of them think they're Jack Bauer they probably bring
[51:46.920 --> 51:50.200]  some really bad guys in there it doesn't matter you can't have secret
[51:50.200 --> 51:53.960]  interrogation facilities I mean it's one thing of the cops interrogates playing
[51:53.960 --> 51:57.160]  a car for like 30 minutes when they're driving to the police station but I mean
[51:57.160 --> 52:00.560]  you don't sit there and take them to a black site and then hide it from the
[52:00.560 --> 52:05.200]  public and then people die in there and then Joe in fact guys I've got five six
[52:05.200 --> 52:08.360]  articles these aren't the ones I had highlighted we highlight me than the cops
[52:08.360 --> 52:14.560]  the police attendance go ahead there was a lady that was held here back in 2012
[52:14.560 --> 52:18.720]  she was protesting the NATO summit that was happening here and they said they
[52:18.720 --> 52:24.320]  held her here for 18 hours she was shackled to a bench and the officer came
[52:24.320 --> 52:31.280]  up and said I hope you guys are welcome to tour do it now what's going on here
[52:31.280 --> 52:36.480]  the talk to her wait wait stick to my interface can I ask what's going on you
[52:36.480 --> 52:41.000]  have to go back to home and where okay you're okay public street though she
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.240]  can't make you leave that well no we are on their property right now we'll walk
[52:44.240 --> 52:47.080]  up to the we'll walk right after her name though ask her name ask for
[52:47.080 --> 52:52.760]  identification what's your name ask her name sorry's in between the lines back
[52:52.760 --> 52:57.480]  to home it okay right now okay we will right now ask her if she likes the
[52:57.480 --> 53:00.680]  torturing what's going on I agree with torturing people and holding them
[53:00.680 --> 53:07.760]  without a due process okay ask her to show you where it is can you show us
[53:07.760 --> 53:11.440]  where the sites are where you guys hold people illegally
[53:18.480 --> 53:21.560]  believe me normally they'd be coming after you guys big time but they don't
[53:21.560 --> 53:26.560]  want any attention on this so you can push it pretty far
[53:26.560 --> 53:34.360]  had a problem see anyway she baskin her questions I don't understand did you
[53:34.360 --> 53:39.000]  drive through a gate to get in there we walked we just walked over Joe I believe
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.720]  that is a city sidewalk I don't the fence those fences sidewalk isn't this a
[53:45.720 --> 53:51.200]  city sidewalk though there's a bank right here though yeah she's wrong Joe I
[53:51.200 --> 53:55.400]  think you should go back over to her and I think you should because because
[53:55.400 --> 53:58.960]  this is an attempt to violate your civil rights right now telling you can't be
[53:58.960 --> 54:05.920]  on a sidewalk be right here then right because that's this is what they did at
[54:05.920 --> 54:11.640]  the bunny ranch on people they couldn't be on sidewalks in the town yeah no
[54:11.640 --> 54:14.960]  what she's telling you is an illegal order see people say you must follow
[54:14.960 --> 54:19.760]  police order not of their illegal but this is a bank sidewalk this is a bank
[54:19.760 --> 54:25.240]  do you work for this bank do you work for this bank this is a bank though that's
[54:25.240 --> 54:27.840]  their point they're gonna just keep telling you go until you're back to
[54:27.840 --> 54:32.560]  Austin okay but I'm about to hey Joe what you need to do now is do a report
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.240]  with Google Maps showing that it's city city you know right away city sidewalks
[54:38.240 --> 54:44.360]  and the headline is Gestapo tactics secret site police say you can't be on
[54:44.360 --> 54:51.200]  the sidewalk I'm trying to walk through all the snow I can't here we are come
[54:51.200 --> 54:59.200]  here property yeah but those those city sidewalks are right a ways they can't
[54:59.200 --> 55:02.080]  stop you from being on the city sidewalks we just we just stirred doing this
[55:02.080 --> 55:05.480]  up it'll be funny now we'll see how many people they send out now all right Joe
[55:05.480 --> 55:07.960]  let me go back to the point and they're highlighting for me I covered it
[55:07.960 --> 55:11.640]  yesterday the names of these police lieutenants that rumsfeld was in control
[55:11.640 --> 55:15.920]  of that they would send them to Afghanistan Iraq how creepy is that Joe
[55:15.920 --> 55:19.200]  and describe for folks what it was like when you would deliver people for
[55:19.200 --> 55:24.120]  torture oh it's horrible I mean it was funny because what they would do is they
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.840]  would actually let release the people that we knew were in placing IEDs and
[55:28.840 --> 55:32.000]  things like that and then the interrogators they would pick up like a
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.720]  farmer or something like it out there in Afghanistan they would actually bring
[55:35.720 --> 55:38.360]  them back and interrogate them for no reason they just seemed like they would
[55:38.360 --> 55:41.320]  do that to practice and hone their skills and now we have that happening
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.640]  here you know on the homeland at our home turf here what was the reason that
[55:45.640 --> 55:48.400]  that as best you could tell they wouldn't go after real terrorists because
[55:48.400 --> 55:52.840]  that's what Pat Tillman said and got so angry about so they killed him I mean if
[55:52.840 --> 55:55.920]  there's no terrorists we capture them all then there's no need for them to be
[55:55.920 --> 55:59.160]  over there making all their money in the war as long as we legitimize it there's
[55:59.160 --> 56:03.000]  monsters over there then they can continue to run the heroin that's coming in
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  and out of that country the opium and make all the money that they're after
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.680]  at the end of the day that's all they care about just like Vietnam we weren't
[56:08.680 --> 56:13.520]  allowed to bomb Hanoi because the French and the Germans and the Chinese and
[56:13.520 --> 56:18.600]  everybody else were selling weapons and goods in there including US cargo what
[56:18.600 --> 56:21.880]  happens though when you do something wrong you start to feel paranoid you
[56:21.880 --> 56:24.200]  start to feel like the people around you you're going to start doing the same
[56:24.200 --> 56:27.240]  kind of bad things that you're doing because you have a sense of paranoia
[56:27.240 --> 56:31.840]  because you're always doing bad stuff and then
[56:31.840 --> 56:40.840]  What's up? It's an undercover car with a minor racism. It's the part where I drove through just so I don't get killed when they hand off.
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.400]  Tony's in a public commons and there's no perception of there's no perception of
[56:45.400 --> 56:51.400]  privacy. Is that another cop? The cover's coming out of here. Okay.
[56:51.400 --> 57:01.040]  It's a live feed. What does he think? I don't know. I don't think they understand
[57:01.040 --> 57:05.280]  technology. My god. So this is the thing though like I was saying whatever you do
[57:05.280 --> 57:20.480]  something wrong like that you start thinking that everybody around you. No one would have even paid attention to him. He wasn't on tape till he pulled up and got in our camera and announced himself as an undercover. Yeah he just pulled in and pulled out and left now so all he was driving here to do that to say that but it's like yeah to say we put an
[57:20.480 --> 57:30.680]  undercover on TV that's exactly so he could come get on camera and say we did that. Yeah. So they can all feel sorry for themselves. All he did was pull and pull back. There's a guy on
[57:30.680 --> 57:35.040]  the telephone like there's people riding up on bicycles now staring at us in all black. It's
[57:35.040 --> 57:39.760]  starting to get pretty creepy. But like I was saying though whenever people start doing
[57:39.760 --> 57:42.920]  something wrong eventually they think that people are going to find out so what has our
[57:42.920 --> 57:47.200]  government been doing buying up the ammo trying to make the guns illegal. They start militarizing
[57:47.200 --> 57:50.680]  the police and that's what's happening now because they know eventually Americans are
[57:50.680 --> 57:53.760]  going to wake up like this story breaking is huge. People in America starting to see
[57:53.760 --> 57:57.960]  that everything we've been talking about for years and years and info wars is coming true.
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.440]  That's right and there's a huge there's a huge creepy infrastructure right under the
[58:02.440 --> 58:07.480]  surface and we're just peeling the scab off. Go ahead Joe sorry. Yeah but they're starting
[58:07.480 --> 58:10.720]  that that's why they're buying all this gear because they know an awakening is going to
[58:10.720 --> 58:14.280]  happen when they do they want to be like they're going to be all right we're going to have
[58:14.280 --> 58:18.200]  all this gear will be prepared whenever finally everyone starts to wake up and that's what
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.000]  they're scared about. That's why they're doing all this wrong stuff and they know they're
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  doing wrong stuff and that's why they're buying all these MRAPs and these tanks and all the
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.720]  guns up and trying to make it illegal by hand. That's right and notice Joe stay we're back
[58:29.720 --> 58:34.920]  in 60 70 seconds we need to keep you live for your safety. Notice that even the Guardian
[58:34.920 --> 58:39.200]  won't get as close as you have that's how timid everybody is so kudos to you everybody pray
[58:39.200 --> 58:44.160]  for our crew right now they're being surrounded and the cops probably aren't even that bad
[58:44.160 --> 58:52.320]  it's just their brain. Stay with us. The month of February is all about Valentine's Day

[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:14.680]  mainstream media government cover ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:22.600]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones. We got some kind
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.800]  of equipment problem. They're switching out equipment right now switching on mics right
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:32.560]  now Joe bags and Josh Owens are on the ground in Chicago at the secret secret black side
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:38.440]  not on city records. We went to Google Street View. It's got listings of what's owned what's
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:43.120]  public. It's public sidewalks running up and down the street. We'll put that on screen
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:49.560]  for TV viewers. CJ can narrate and I can narrate for listeners but it's West. What's
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.600]  that street called West Fillmore. It's West Fillmore Street according to the maps. Okay
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:59.400]  you can see a bank right there. Yeah there's a public sidewalk around the bank and it doesn't
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.960]  appear to be a private credit union appears to be a public bank and then there's a site
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.480]  but it doesn't matter it's listed as a sidewalk. They do have the street barricaded once you
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.040]  get to that checkpoint. So I guess the city has the power to do that but but not to tell
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.920]  our people to get off even the sidewalk by the bank they just cannot do that. Well this
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.480]  right here Josh was doing research about just this general area where this is where the
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.960]  Hammond Square location is and this is one of the most dangerous places one in 12 people
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:34.720]  out here gets shot. That's right that area is the most dangerous place in America. Chicago
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.640]  is the most dangerous and then that's the most dangerous or the most dangerous. Yes
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.800]  this is the most dangerous little neighborhood right here in all of America. And see how
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.520]  they use the fact that it's so dangerous to go well we got a secretly interrogate people
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.520]  yeah but it's not fixing it is it. Nope it's still happening. The answer is on everybody
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:59.640]  in Chicago and these thugs will all be dead in about a week. The war on drugs made drugs
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:06.160]  worse. The war on this right here is making it worse. Absolutely well Joe I don't want
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.320]  you to freeze to death I want you to get back in the car and warm yourself up. Did the folks
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.440]  the police start to circle you did they back off for now? It's hard to tell because so
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.840]  many people out here like I said I mean that's what I heard too before I got there's a lot
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.880]  of undercover operations that happened through here and you see regular cars with people
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.680]  in regular clothes so it's hard to tell like at this point you kind of can't trust anyone
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.440]  you have to assume that almost everyone coming up to you right now is an undercover cop. Well
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.000]  I just don't get why the undercover guy pulled up to you and said don't show my face I don't
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.360]  know. But you know it's weird though he drove down this road came in and stopped and said
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.800]  don't show me and said I just hope you guys are safe just make sure you're safe. And he
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.640]  kept saying oh I just hope you're safe it kind of seems like a threat to me like you're
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.440]  trying to be like oh hey watch out you shouldn't be out here. Are you scared Joe? Hell no.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.400]  In fact I can tell you're all excited now aren't you? Oh I'm always excited I love doing
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.320]  this. Well listen I know you guys have a great plan you're just wonderful reporters let's
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:04.640]  go cover the other black sites document those and I know I kind of announced it but I want
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.840]  you to be safe it would probably have been better to send you in but then that would
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.840]  really freak them out so I kind of want them to know we're coming so they don't do the
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.200]  wrong thing and really hurt you guys. Well there's definitely a target on us now. Well
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.040]  that would well tell me if you disagree or agree because we have total transparency here.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.720]  I went ahead and announced that you were going to go to the other black sites because I think
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.560]  if you went there and they didn't know you were coming it could really get nasty because
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.240]  they're well known for being very brutal and statistically one of the most criminal police
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.880]  departments out there so I think the fact that having sunshine on you going into Mordor
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.400]  is the best way to do it instead of having you sneak up on them and surprise them. Yeah
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.120]  I'm still waiting on some intel from a local around here that has known of a few other
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.080]  spots so once we get that we're definitely going to go out there and document that and
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.840]  try to get that information out to you guys as soon as possible. But do you agree because
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.600]  I want to hear your opinion on this I mean isn't it best just to announce what we're
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.880]  doing so so they don't have the excuse to claim they didn't know we were coming and
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.080]  do something really bad. That doesn't bother me either way I mean they can all come out
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.680]  here and and like they didn't Ferguson run out here in a line and try to act all hard
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.800]  I don't care I'm still gonna stay in here. That's what we do we don't hide. Well and
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.640]  we're not against the police we're against a secret center where people have died where
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:21.640]  they train people for torture overseas that is admitted. I mean Rumsfeld was commanding
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.560]  this facility. I mean I mean who knows what's going on in there. Well the thing is though
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.200]  is if there's a place like this in Chicago I wonder how many other cities across America
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.640]  have sites like this operating right now that no one's ever known about. You know every
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.480]  since I'm we announced the story and we've been talking about it people just been coming
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.280]  out of the woodwork sending stuff to me saying you know my father was held at that place
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.600]  back in the 70s for a certain amount of time at different places like this. I tell you
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.040]  what if you can handle the cold come back and finish up points you want to make then

[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:04.480]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day. Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.920]  candy. What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.160]  and individual empowerment? I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.840]  being empowered. The establishment is the opposite. That's why they spike our water
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.400]  with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage. Infowars is striking

[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:08.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:17.560]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:30.160]  Leonard Nimoy, Spock of Star Trek is dead at 83, ladies and gentlemen. Obviously, that's
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.400]  not really important news compared to all the incredible things that are happening,
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.000]  but I do want to spend a few minutes on it because we can tie it into something important.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.880]  Then coming up, proposal. Banning armor-piercing bullets for the public. That's how the mainstream
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:51.120]  media and the ATF are spinning it. If they can ban bullets that they say can kill cops,
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:09:00.680]  well, you can ban all bullets. The 223 higher-grain bullet is meant to go further. It is not designed
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:07.480]  to pierce armor, but I'm going to give you a newsflash. Most 223 up close will pierce
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:13.680]  armor because it's moving so fast, and it doesn't matter. You hit a blast plate, it
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:20.080]  sprays up pieces of the shards into your neck. They're shrapnel. It's a dangerous job being
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.960]  a cop. This idea of, oh, let us ban the Bushmaster or let us ban this ammo because it's going
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:39.920]  to kill cops. The 223 assault rifles, period. I'm talking 7, 2, 6, 9, all of them. All quote
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.280]  semi-automatic rifles are used in 2% of the crimes. Last time I saw just department numbers.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.320]  But it doesn't matter. If thugs are using handguns in something like 70% of the crimes,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.400]  we look up the numbers. They vary each year. You don't ban handguns because criminals are
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.760]  using them. A criminal uses a handgun because they can hide them. They can sneak them in
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.960]  places. They can pull them out. They can put them back in their shirt. So what? All over
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.640]  the country, crime rates have gone down upwards of 25% or more within a year of concealed
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.760]  carry going into place because the good guys have handguns. The cops have handguns. We
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:22.520]  don't say take cops handguns because criminals use them the majority of the time. So it's
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:29.320]  a red herring. But if they can ban the scary looking M4, the Bushmaster, if they can ban
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:36.080]  the stag arms, if they can do that, they can get everybody's guns. And now the headline
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:42.320]  is out. Chicago crime rate drops as concealed carry applications surge like antibiotics
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:49.840]  going into an infected tooth. The bacteria are literally fleeing in fear. What publication
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.480]  is that out of? I knew I'd seen that a few weeks ago, but I want to go over those numbers.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:11:03.560]  That's the Washington Times. August 24th. So I knew I'd seen that last year. So there
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.640]  you go. We don't need black sites and torture to stop the crime. We need guns in the hands
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:14.040]  of the people. We need our bill of rights and constitution. We need prosperity. We don't
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.960]  need crony capitalism. We need free market. We don't need socialism and collectivism and
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:27.640]  that's into 21. Mark Cuban says FCC net regs will spill over and take over television.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:33.400]  He's talking about cable TV. Of course, the FCC has always been licking its degenerate
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.960]  chops to get after cable and things that didn't control. And now they've been announcing
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.920]  they want to regulate cable for years. I'm a media person. I follow this. So let me just
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:49.240]  give everybody a newsflash. Okay. Anybody in media at an executive level knows about
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:54.240]  this stuff. And that's why basically every executive out there is horrified because the
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:02.040]  FCC wants to tax and regulate and get its fangs and its claws and its snout into everything.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.680]  Ron Paul says it's the end of the web as we know it if this goes through because it's
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:12.120]  just the FCC. Speaking of fangs, it's toothless unless we let them go ahead with it. It's a
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.840]  board that did this. Congress could stand up and stop them. Like Obama just saying the
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:22.400]  ATF can ban your bullets. Really? I didn't see a law pass do that. You see it's all just
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:30.000]  lawless garbage. Like Obama uses UN trees as a thinly veiled excuse to do all this.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.200]  Save the internet. FCC net neutrality rules. Worst example of government intervention ever.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.400]  FCC votes in favor of rules aimed at enforcing net neutrality. Last time I checked they still
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.440]  haven't released the 330 something pages, have they? No, they haven't released it. I've
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.520]  had my crew looking all day. I'm going to say that again. They promised to release them
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.120]  right away, but why? Normally you'd release them beforehand. Now they won't do it afterwards
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:06.720]  because it's so horrible. Just wait. I'm going to get into that. Coming up. Reuters. Reuters.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:15.400]  Reuters. Emergency responders investigate possible Virginia Ebola case. You heard that
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.720]  right. I'm going to break down what's going on there. Here's one of the articles I mentioned
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:26.080]  earlier. Bad Lieutenant American police brutality explored and exported from Chicago to Guantanamo.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:32.360]  Chicago Detective Richard Zuley arrived at Guantanamo Bay late in 2002. And that's just
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.680]  somebody sent there. Others were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq. That's what's going on is training
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:45.680]  for this behavior at that giant secret substation. That's some of the news we've got coming up.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:53.280]  Why your smartphone records everything you say to it? Oh, since info wars last year showed
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:59.000]  the Samsung and other television set rules, contract rules, when you buy it, you think
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.040]  you just buy a TV and plug it in. No, no, now it says C terms and conditions. Everything
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.600]  you say is being recorded, video and audio and being sent back to quote third parties.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.640]  And the Samsung went further and said, watch what you say. Well, guess what? Why your smartphone
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:22.360]  records everything you say to it? This is the London Telegraph, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:30.600]  Not Alex Jones. But the London Telegraph happened to go read the smartphone terms and conditions
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:37.720]  of droids and apples of Samsung's of Google's phone. And it tells you everything you say
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:47.920]  to the phone is recorded and sent back to quote executives. Oh, that's such a free society.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.760]  If you use your voice recognition system like Apple Siri, Google's now or Microsoft's Cortani,
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.200]  I don't know how you say that. There is a good chance that the company has Cortana. Cortana
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.160]  is a good chance the company has been recording your commands and you agreed to it via the
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.640]  terms and conditions. Boom. And the cops are worried about their faces being shown. Give
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.800]  me a break. The globalists set this up as a total military takeover operation when they
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.880]  roll out the robots and the droids and the smart apps and the smart meters. Everything
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:26.680]  is a scientific takeover. Okay. I mean, the globalists say that they say when they launch
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:33.000]  their technological takeover very soon. 2025 is the number most of them say you won't know.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  I won't know. We won't know what hit us. Everything coming out now in the last five years worldwide
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.600]  has kill boxes, tracker boxes, taxing systems, tracking total control. And I would tell you
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.480]  this 20 years ago because they were already beta testing and now it's in everything. Your
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:59.000]  washer, your dryer, the smart meters dialing in like a literal imperial probe droid. But
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.480]  it doesn't look like the probe droid. All scary. It's just a little box on the side
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:10.000]  of your house scanning everything. You think Google cars are bad? You think Google cars
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.880]  are bad when they got caught nationwide driving around with those antennas, grabbing your pass
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.040]  codes, breaking into your computers. Oh yeah. And did Google get in trouble? Google did
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:25.240]  not get in trouble because Google is a giant globalist front company founded by the central
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:31.200]  intelligence agency and Incutel's money on record. I want to get the CIA guy steel back
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:38.520]  on. I remember when he first exposed all that, he got threatened over it. That was like,
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:48.520]  how many years ago on my show? 15. So just know what we're getting hit by. Might as well
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.720]  be aliens. It's so advanced. It's so evil. It's so well thought out. It's so over the
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:58.920]  top, but it's also so criminal and so un-American and so anti-human. We shouldn't have to live
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:05.360]  under this. We shouldn't have to go along with this. And yes, I get excited about this.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:12.000]  All right. Before I go to break, because I got to go to break and settle down and come
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.320]  back and give the number out and take calls and cover a bunch of other news I haven't
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.080]  gotten to yet. I didn't plug any last hour and that's how we fund ourselves, but that
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.800]  doesn't matter. What you need to know is that I said that we were going to have super male
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.200]  vitality, super female vitality, 20% off. And the special goes for about another day
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.720]  and a half. We may have to end it tonight. It looks like at current rates, super male
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:38.320]  vitality. At current sales rates will sell out within about eight hours. We're selling
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.080]  nemosis we ever have as word spreads of how good it works. It's just a whole bunch of
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.680]  known concentrated herbs and other fruit extracts and things that just supercharge your glands
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:53.960]  and yeah, I'm not going to sit here and make claims. Biobottle, your support in the broadcast
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.520]  is 20% off right now. It is the best we could come up with the strongest, the most expensive
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.960]  ingredients at a low price compared to major competitors. About half of what major competitors
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.120]  sell something similar that isn't even, it's from dry herbs, not wet herbs. See ours are
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:16.040]  wet, very expensive, very hard to do. It's virgin basically. It's the first press. It's
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:23.160]  organic. It's never heated. That's why you want to, it's like fresh garlic is a lot stronger
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.280]  than cooked garlic. I mean, this stuff is not, there's not garlic in it, but I'm saying
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:33.480]  it's an example. It hasn't been cooked. It hasn't been pasteurized and it's concentrated
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.880]  and quite frankly found like wine, it gets stronger with time. So I had some bottles
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.640]  we saved back from a few years ago when it came out and they're even better now. It has
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.560]  a vintage. We're trying to figure out how to market that fact that we've discovered.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.520]  Well, group always knew it, but I mean, this stuff's got a vintage to it. Super male vitality
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:56.000]  will sell out today. Here's the big news and I'm just going to tell you, I take super
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:04.800]  female vitality and it has more of a aphrodisiac angle to it. It has two things in it that
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.720]  the male one doesn't have and not because it's feminine in design. It hits men and women
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:18.560]  in the same way. It's just the male one is a little bit more for working out. The woman
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:24.520]  version does that too, but it has more of the aphrodisiac. It has more of the, well,
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.440]  you know what, I'm not going to even say the name of it. It's got a colloquial name, something
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.960]  goatweed and then something else. The point is, is that we're going to have super female
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.320]  vitality left. We've got a little bit of that that should be able to run through into
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:42.320]  early next week, but the super male will run out. We'll continue to offer 20% off on the
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:48.680]  super female vitality when it sells out info wars life.com info wars life.com to secure
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:55.600]  yours or 888-253-3139. And I appreciate everybody buying the info wars health.com products. You

[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:10.400]  candy. What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.600]  and individual empowerment? I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.280]  being empowered. The establishment is the opposite. That's why they spike our water

[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.960]  Only the older one gets the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.560]  able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body. As a result you'll have less energy
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.600]  your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled. An older person will typically injure
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.960]  more easily and heal more slowly. Not fun. However if you could consume a protein powder
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:22.040]  that is easier to absorb then you may be able to gain back some strength muscle and speed
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:27.080]  of recovery. One world way is a highly digestible weight protein powder that may be the perfect

[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.680]  amazing. I play pickleball and since taking one world way in your trace mineral supplement
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.560]  I have more energy and recover faster from my working out. I used to take another grass
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.080]  fed weight protein powder but now I'm getting much better results using one world way. Call

[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:41.960]  Dragon Ball Z mixed in with Star Wars. Episode 4, I don't think you can beat that. Or maybe, maybe you can.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.960]  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.960]  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan. You are part of the Rebel
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:25:01.960]  Alliance and a traitor. Take her away! Holy, her is dangerous. Word of this gets out. It could
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:07.960]  generate sympathy for the rebellion in the Senate. I have traced the Rebel's spies to her. Now she is my
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:13.960]  only link to finding their secret base. She'll die before she'll tell you anything. Leave that to me.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:22.960]  Leave that to me. And of course, Darth Vader's secretly disappearing people. America's secretly
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.960]  disappearing people and then you get the Homeland Security training manuals. They're not worried about
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:33.960]  radical Islamists. It's all about the guy with the John Deere hat that isn't going to let the
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.960]  government take over his land. I've been to the Urban Warfare Drills, I've shot video, but it's in
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:44.960]  mainstream news. The military is training to take on rural communities when they take their land under
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:52.960]  all these new regulations. And why do you think the military is so awake right now? Because for at
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:57.960]  least six, seven years, they've been openly training for gun confiscation and they're just sitting there.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.960]  I mean, I'm talking pretty high level commanders are telling them when they actually give the order,
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.960]  really do this. We're not doing this. There were much people in Katrina, by the way, that refused.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:13.960]  I was always criticizing the military. I guess believing ABC News and NBC showing the gun
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:19.960]  confiscation. The truth was that most of the military we later learned from Oath Keepers by name, the
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:26.960]  units said no. And then bunch of them got in trouble. But all that was kept quiet. See, they wanted to
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.960]  show there's the military out confiscating the guns, but they had to show the police chief saying all
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:38.960]  the guns will be taken. No one will be allowed to have arms. When in truth, the police refused to
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:45.960]  confiscate guns. And then they FEMA cut their radios and cut down their tower. This came out on CBS News
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:53.960]  show that they can then say all the cops just walked off the job. And at first I bought into it.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.960]  I've gotten more sophisticated. I was like those lazy corrupt police in New Orleans where they are
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.960]  famously corrupt there, but the truth was most of them weren't robbing. Most of them were trying to help
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.960]  people. They went and showed some of the cops, you know, in Walmart and stuff, taken stuff, where
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.960]  they'd been basically told by Walmart, get what you need. And I'm not even saying it was good they were
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.960]  in there getting it. They obviously didn't need play stations. But, you know, if you need food and
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.960]  water, go get it. It was obviously wrong. It was disgusting. It was big, fat, lazy cops that were
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:29.960]  doing it. But at the same time, it was projected onto all the police as a si-op so the feds can play the
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.960]  good cop and come in and say, see, everybody hates you. When their controlled media was projecting
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:42.960]  that image. It's sophisticated, folks. Now, some of this stuff is not sophisticated. It's just designed
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:48.960]  to ridicule. This is out of the Washington Post. There's already a conspiracy theory brewing over net
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.960]  neutrality. That's the Washington Post. And I, during the break, Michele Failin walked up onto the
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.960]  writers and said, can you believe this? Look at this, boss. And these were his words. We won't give you
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.960]  the secret 300-plus page FCC document, even though we promised we would. And so it's a conspiracy
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:12.960]  that you want to see it. It's weird to want to see what you promised you'd release earlier than you
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:20.960]  said you wouldn't. Then the FCC chairman appointed by Obama wouldn't testify to Congress. And now he
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:27.960]  won't release it, even though he said he would. Well, all we know is the FCC has declared regulatory
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:35.960]  power outside of Congress over the internet and over all telecommunications, including cable. Did you
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:41.960]  just hear what I said? And Mark Cuban's outwarning people about it. They'll probably indict him again
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:50.960]  for being a loose cannon. And I told the stories of my dealings with Mark Cuban, folks. He was going
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.960]  to produce a film. He was going to distribute a film I was producing. And the White House called him
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.960]  up and said, we're going to put you in jail. And then they sent him emails. And then a year later, it was
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:08.960]  in the New York Times. After I told you that happened, go ask Mark Cuban. Mark Cuban's a great guy.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:19.960]  And he's warning you this is a giant screw job. So I just don't know what to say anymore. I mean, look at
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:30.960]  this. Oh, Chicago. If the levee breaks have no place to stay going down, going down, going down to
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:35.960]  Chicago. Let's come in with this if we can. When we come back, I'm going to get into the article. There's
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:41.960]  already a conspiracy theory brewing over net neutrality. Oh, really? And even the liberal Vox site says the
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:46.960]  net neutrality rules might not be available for weeks. That's ridiculous. What's ridiculous is what
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:53.960]  are they doing taking over the web? The empires on the run. Destroy it to save it. Our reporters are at the
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:30:06.960]  black site. They're coming up and your calls. The month of February is all about Valentine's Day. Big heart shaped

[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:02.960]  secret black sites. That is the one in Guardian Others have. Our reporters are there. And if it
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:12.960]  keeps on raining, the Republic is going to break. Think about that. How much more will we, as
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.960]  a people, put up with? I don't know. That's a question that we're all going to have to ask
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:24.960]  ourselves because, believe me, the reason they're doing this is because they're going to take the
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.960]  pension funds and they're going to economically bankrupt the people to control us. That's the
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:41.960]  model. And when the levee breaks, you have no place to stay. You live in Venezuela. You live in
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:51.960]  Cuba. You live in Communist China. You'll live as a slave. Going down. Going down now.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:59.960]  All right. It's now just in mainstream news. Oh, yeah. Your Siri app is recording you and
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:04.960]  listening to you and saving all your commands and sending it back. I've been sitting there
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.960]  before when my friends are making jokes saying outrageous stuff to Siri. And I go, I just hope
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:15.960]  you know all that's being recorded. They're like, oh, yeah, right. That's Alex a little crazy. Yeah,
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:20.960]  I'm crazy. All right. I wonder, though, what does it mean for this show now that almost
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:31.960]  everything we talk about is now admitted? I don't know. Rand Paul at CPAC says not one
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:35.960]  penny more to these haters of America talking about these radical Islamic states. Senate
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:41.960]  drops objections to Obama amnesty clears clean homeland bill. So Homeland Security Spong and
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:50.960]  everybody illegally is now saying yes, we agree with the amnesty. It's very safe. Absolutely
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:56.960]  amazing. IRS Watchdog reveals lowest learner missing emails now subject to criminal probe.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.960]  The emails are saved on a backup database. It's all ball face lies that a five year old can
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:12.960]  figure out. John Boehner seeks extension leverage with Homeland Security funding bill. That's
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:20.960]  just some of the news up on the Washington Times up on info wars.com. We've got a whole
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:27.960]  bunch of important news. Obama thinks Obama thinks Americans having trouble talking today
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.960]  because I've never had a root canal in my life. Hardly ever had any fillings at a few developmental
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.960]  pits in my wisdom teeth that I kept that had to be filled. They kind of came in with holes
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:45.960]  on the sides. But I have been clenching my teeth under stress for years. And my dad who's
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.960]  a dentist warned me. He said, you need to start wearing this splint in your teeth at night.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:55.960]  You're going to grind your teeth off or clench them. I don't really grind a clinch. And I guess
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:00.960]  I hit the carrying capacity of my teeth. They're now starting to just crunch in. And so he
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:06.960]  saved this tooth that was split. I had waited months. So when he drilled the top of the tooth
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.960]  off, it stunk. And it was all rotten and dead. And he said, I can't believe you're walking
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.960]  around with this. This must have been incredibly painful. It was only painful that chewed on
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:20.960]  it. And he was able to hollow it out and fix it with a root canal. But that was two days
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.960]  ago. And I guess my jaw cranked open for an hour and a half. It's all swollen. I'm just
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:30.960]  having trouble speaking. And my tongue is flopping around in my mouth. I fell asleep
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.960]  while he was doing it. I wasn't on gas or anything. He says, you've never seen anybody fall asleep
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.960]  in a root canal. That's what I do under stress. I just fall asleep. If I'm getting a really
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:43.960]  hard massage or getting rolled through something, I always just pass out. A lot of people do
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:48.960]  that. But I passed out during it. And then my tongue flopped over and his drill went in
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:55.960]  my tongue in the back. So not a happy camper. But I missed some time last week with family
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.960]  issues. So I'm here. And I tend to be here Sunday, four to six p.m. live as well. But
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:08.960]  if I do sound a little more lispy and if I have trouble pronunciating words, it is because
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.960]  I have a fat tongue basically in a fat jaw. Side issue. Just wanted you to know why I
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  sound a little bit different. I'm not drinking vodka or something. It sounds a little bit
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:21.960]  drunk. I heard the show yesterday and it just sounds kind of like a slurred speech. And
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.960]  it's because I do have slurred speech right now because of my mouth. You can even see
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:33.960]  it on camera. And my jaw is a little bit swollen back there. Root canals are a bummer, man.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:40.960]  Ah. And I'm not on antibiotics because I hate to take them. He said I should take them.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.960]  Because I had like, he says the longest roots he's probably ever seen because my jaw is
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:53.960]  so thick. And so he had to go, he didn't have burns long enough. So he had to push and one
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:57.960]  of the roots opened up on the end and can get infected. But I just, I'm going to wait
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.960]  and see if it gets infected before I take antibiotics. I really talk about myself here. It's more
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.960]  just an interesting story about antibiotics and medical care and the human body and stress.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.960]  Because I feel really good, but I do have nightmares about the new world order sometimes.
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:16.960]  And that's my mind working through the crisis, working through the problems, working through
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.960]  subconscious fears I have. I mean, I have dreams where the government's got me and is
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.960]  torturing me or bad things are happening to my children and I clench my teeth to the point
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.960]  of I have to wear a splint. He just made me a new one. I couldn't find the one he made
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  me last year. And I'm just going to have to wear a splint now every night or I'm going
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:40.960]  to crush my teeth off because I'm just having these dreams. I'm not whining. I'm not complaining.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.960]  It's just a lot of people have this problem. I know.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:55.960]  So side note that people ask how I deal with the stress. Well, I clench my teeth at night.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.960]  In fact, I clench them so bad. Look at photos. I mean, like 15 years ago, I don't, it's not
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:03.960]  even weight these jowls. It's muscles. My muscles in the side of my jaw are three times,
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.960]  going to another doctor as well, three times the size they're supposed to be from clenching
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:17.960]  my teeth. Absolutely painful. But that's just the way the cookie crumbles. Enough whining
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:24.960]  about that, ladies and gentlemen. I want to get into what I was just starting to mention
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:31.960]  the denial that it's a conspiracy theory to even say that we would dare want to know
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:37.960]  what the FCC regulations are over the Internet. Again, for me, it's that the FCC, its past
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.960]  behaviors are what are important. I want to talk about those in a moment. Then I want to
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:47.960]  open the phones up, also have a Star Trek report that we have posted at infowars.com
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:56.960]  tying into the death of Leonard Nimoy at 83 from heart trouble. When you go to the article
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:05.960]  you can find the video, 9-11 Lessons from Star Trek that is extremely powerful and basically
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:12.960]  breaks down how false flags, how divide and conquer really works. That's up on infowars.com.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:20.960]  9-11 Lessons from Star Trek. Of course, Leonard Nimoy is in there. This video has about 300,000
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.960]  views. This version has 100,000 we link to, but I saw a couple others with 100,000 or so
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.960]  as well. About 300,000 people have seen this. This deserves to be seen by about 50 million
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:36.960]  people because it shatters the entire paradigm. I probably played this video once a year since
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.960]  it came out six, seven years ago. A listener put it together. It really deserves to be
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:48.960]  seen. Maybe we should tweet it out as 9-11 Lessons from Leonard Nimoy because he's in
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.960]  the piece. Maybe that will create some interest. Piggybacking on his sad demise, but to get
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:59.960]  some good out of it, get some 9-11 truths. Let's tweet that out with 9-11 Lessons from
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.960]  Leonard Nimoy video. Call it that. Tweet it out at Real Alex Jones. I hope everybody
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:11.960]  else then helps us get this out to their friends and family. Because being an activist for
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.960]  truth, every mind we unlock, every person we teach about the globalist paradigm is one
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.960]  less person that's going to be caught up in this new older system. And we can stop this
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:25.960]  globalist system together if we simply expose it and promote the alternative of liberty.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.960]  And don't just mindlessly all fight with each other. What does George Soros want? George
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.960]  Soros wants the FCC to take over the Internet. He also says he wants to shut down talk radio
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  in the show, basically. His organs do. Media matters and others. So we know whatever this
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.960]  is the FCC is doing is bad. But I'm going to cover that in a moment. He wants to fund
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.960]  $37 million to get us fired when the police. Does that mean the police aren't doing some
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.960]  horrible things? No. But it's the same globalists that are pushing the training that did it.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.960]  See? And that's what the Star Trek piece gets into, understanding how we're being played
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.960]  off against each other and not being chumps. Briefly, I've got some good news and some
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:14.960]  bad news about M4slife.com, these groundbreaking incredible hardcore super supplements. Most
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:19.960]  supplement companies in the industry, and I'm not attacking them, it's just a fact, try
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.960]  to get the cheapest ingredients they can that still can do amazing things, because herbs
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:29.960]  and vitamins and things are amazing. And they put most of their money into celebrity endorsements
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:36.960]  and glitzy advertising and the rest of it. The average, you know, say $30 bottle of mail,
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.960]  you know, boosting concoctions, may have $2, $3 a product and if it's a high end one
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:47.960]  and they sell it for $50, you know, on sales at $30 and then most of the money goes into
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.960]  marketing and profit. No, we don't mark stuff up seven times. We mark it up 100%, which
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.960]  is a good markup, but it's how we fund our operation. If we could sell more of it, we
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.960]  lower prices, which is actually part of our plan. You'll notice the prices of M4slife
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:05.960]  products have been steadily going down. As we expand the market, I intend to lower prices.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:09.960]  I am a capitalist 110%, ladies and gentlemen, but these really are the very best products
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:14.960]  out there. That's why Supermail Vitality will be sold out today. But let me give you the
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:19.960]  new good news. For some reason, women wanted something that said for women, which I get,
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.960]  we didn't just make the bottle pink though, as a lot of companies do and change the flavor.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:30.960]  There is no flavoring, but the real taste of the herbs and concentrates. We simply added
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:39.960]  two things that quite frankly just supercharged the libido end of it. It's got all the same
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:47.960]  stuff that's in the Supermail. Quite frankly, it's just got more in it. And I guess it's
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.960]  men designing this that shows how our brains worked that we would put the aphrodisiac in
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:56.960]  the female version. I'm just being honest, I apologize. You know what? I was psychoanalyzing
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.960]  this just here in the break earlier and realized that. I'm asking Dr. Grip, I'm like, well,
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.960]  what is the difference of the female? And he's like, I take the female, I think it's better.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:11.960]  And I'm like, okay, well then I'm going to start taking it, which I started doing. And
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:16.960]  then he just explained it has the libido end on it. The Supermail has some of that as well,
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.960]  but libido, you're going to have a better libido when you're supercharged overall, when
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.960]  your glands are producing properly, you're going to have more stamina. We didn't set
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:29.960]  out to make a libido product. We set out to make something that will get your body
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:33.960]  firing better, get you cleaned out, get you more energy in a healthy, good way. None of
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:38.960]  the crud stuff out there. None of the things that get results, but have side effects basically.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.960]  That's why you've heard nothing but rave reviews. It will sell out today. It will probably be
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:46.960]  two weeks that we're making more now. We finally got more of this particular herb.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:54.960]  Ours is wet. It's not dried. We have to get fresh and then it's cold pressed. It's not put
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  through a boiling process. It's not homogenized. It's not, what's the thing to do with milk
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.960]  where they boil it? It's the same thing with supplements.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.960]  Pasteurization.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.960]  Yeah, pasteurization. That's the word. We don't do pasteurization. It's cold pressed.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:14.960]  So we finally got more of this particular herb, one of the herbs in, that's fresh and it's
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.960]  being prepared right now. And so we will have more of it in a couple of weeks, maybe three
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.960]  weeks. Might be four weeks. They're telling me two weeks, but it'll probably be four weeks.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:29.960]  No more super mail after today for about four weeks. Two weeks, who knows. But super female
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:33.960]  is not as good a seller as super male. We have a mainly male audience.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:39.960]  I'll give you the big secret. I started taking the female the last few weeks and it has an
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:46.960]  even better effect than the male. Now it varies for different people. So just like we told
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:51.960]  women, the male's good for you too. We don't need to have a female version, but they wanted
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:56.960]  one. So we made the female version and it turns out it's better and it works just as
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.960]  good for men and it doesn't have estrogen in it. When you hear the word female, it's
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.960]  just a different formula because women wanted their own thing and I get it. But it turns
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.960]  out for me personally and Dr. Group and a lot of others, they like the super female better.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:15.960]  So I'm just letting you know we'll have that for four or five days, maybe, and then it'll
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:22.960]  be sold out. And then we're going to get more of it in, in maybe six weeks. Because again,
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.960]  we're going to have to reformulate it because the shillage, which is just a detoxifier that
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.960]  isn't really needed, is so hard to get organic that we're removing it and adding two more
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:36.960]  things. I'm kind of announcing things that haven't been announced yet, but it will be
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:41.960]  a different formulation when it comes back in just because we just can't get enough of
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:46.960]  it. And plus we were like, well, why are we worried about organic shillage? We've got that
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.960]  already in the fluoride shield. We've got plenty of that. And I'm tired of, you know,
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:55.960]  having to go through this. I said, what, what's just as good, but supercharging. And so we
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:58.960]  said two more things. I'll have group in to talk about it. And I'm not going to belabor
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:05.960]  this anymore. The point is we have the super female when the super male sells out, and
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:09.960]  we'll keep it at 20% off. Most companies, when something's selling out real fast, they
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.960]  jack up the prices. We lower the prices. In fact, I'm going to throw the guys a curveball.
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:18.960]  When the super male sells out, I thought of this earlier, but I didn't tell them because
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:27.960]  when it sells out, I want to lower the female by not 20% but 30%. Even though it's going
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.960]  to sell out, I'm going to be obnoxious in free market behavior, super capitalist behavior,
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.960]  and I'm going to lower it 30% till it sells out. And then it'll be sold out for a while,
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:41.960]  which is even better in marketing because nobody can get it. And it's all the truth.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:46.960]  It really is high quality organic cold press. It really does knock your socks off. It really
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.960]  does fund our operation. And it's just awesome to tell the truth and be honorable. And God
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:49:00.960]  just keeps blessing me. And I'm super obnoxious. I'm a crazy, freedom loving, piratical Texan,
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:11.960]  ladies and gentlemen. And I say piratical in the jolly, long, long silvers way. I just
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:17.960]  hate tyrants. And I will be piratical against them using the weapons of truth every single
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:21.960]  day because it takes a pirate to beat a pirate. And I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.960]  I want you to win. I want to win. I want freedom. I want star bases. I want to build a future
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.960]  for humanity that's about humanity. Not, oh, humanity's ugly and bad and the elite are
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:37.960]  going to kill us and merge with machines because we're crap. Only crud, only, you know what,
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:45.960]  our brains would sit there and say that about humanity. Humanity is amazing. And they spend
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:51.960]  all day with the fluoride and the GMOs trying to suppress us. Again, London Telegraph, BBC,
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:57.960]  Reuters this week. The crew was like, it isn't just the London Telegraph, the Daily Telegraph
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:01.960]  that came out and admitted fluorides, brain damaging people, lowering IQ, making them
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  less fat and frying their thyroids. You didn't know it was in BBC and AP as well. I mean,
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:11.960]  devastating government studies, baby. Well, see, I'm the opposite of the New World Order.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:15.960]  I don't want you on stuff that suppresses you. I want you on stuff that sends you to
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:21.960]  the next level. That's what it's all about. And I was always like this without Super
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:28.960]  Mill Vitality. But I tell you what, give me some right now. In fact, I need a glass of
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:34.960]  water so I can mix in my secret 12 and I'm going to take my organic oil of oregano from
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:39.960]  inforwarslife.com. I'm just going to take it all because I'm telling you, man, these vitamins
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:46.960]  and minerals and the iodine and all of it together, it's like I'm higher than a kite on life
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.960]  because it's what I'm supposed to feel like. People used to fear Americans all over the
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.960]  world because Americans were just like me, crazed, loving freedom, ready to fight, ready
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:58.960]  to build, and I want that American spirit back. I want it rising.

[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:01.960]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here with some important information. I want to tell you about Matt
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.960]  Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply. Several years ago, Matt was sitting
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:10.960]  in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:15.960]  the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck, deciding to take action. A company
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:21.960]  run by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:26.960]  funding. They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.960]  American men and women. It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach, and
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:37.960]  that's why I stock MyPantry with high-quality, storeable foods from MyPatriotSupply. Go to

[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:03.960]  I am a 47-year-old female and had a heart attack in 2005. This is Alice from New Jersey.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:09.960]  I still get angina, even with four stints. I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:15.960]  The very first day after taking heart and body extract, the chest pain was gone. Now I don't
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.960]  wear a nitro patch. Learn the secrets of an effective, natural, 100% organic nutritional

[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:57.960]  To be part of your security solution, be vigilant but not fearful.
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:28.960]  Nico Acosta was saying that his favorite plug one time was I was ranting about young
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:33.960]  Gemini products. I was talking about Beyond Tangy Tangerine, I think that doesn't have
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:37.960]  any fillers either. Our products don't have fillers. Almost everybody else does. I mean,
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:44.960]  it's just a fact. Why wouldn't you just put the product in there? It's just crazy. And
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:48.960]  I was going, this is high-quality products. There's no fillers. And I was like, there's
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.960]  no fillers. But it's really true. So I'm done plugging the products. I probably won't
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:57.960]  even plug next hour because I plugged twice this hour and I apologize for that. I just
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:04.960]  get really excited about all this and I've got just this flotilla of new InfoWarsLife.com
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.960]  products we've come out with in the last three years and I'm so proud of. And I'm so proud
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:12.960]  it's so successful and I'm so proud that it's helping us build this operation and I'm
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:16.960]  so proud of you and I want to thank you all. And I'm just blessed. I just love God. My
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:20.960]  whole life has been so good. There's been a lot of trials and tribulations but all of
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:24.960]  it's made me stronger. And I just want to experience this journey with you. I want
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.960]  our children to grow up together and their children and their children to have a future
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:35.960]  that goes to the stars and beyond. And we can do this. I just want to win. I want humanity
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:42.960]  to succeed. And I'm so sick of people that don't like humanity. The John P. Holdrens
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.960]  and the Barack Obama's of the world who then sit around talking about how much they love
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:53.960]  humanity when I know for a fact in their own writings they disdain the general public.
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.960]  I get mad at the general public for letting the establishment of a bunch of pointy head
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:02.960]  bureaucrats on MSNBC and the Washington Post to go. Obamacare doesn't have death panels.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:08.960]  Obamacare doesn't raise your prices. You get to keep your doctor. Don't listen to conspiracy
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.960]  theorists and senators and congressmen and women in this show and the Drudge Report and
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:18.960]  WorldNet Daily and everybody else is like, here's the subsections of the bill for two
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:24.960]  years. Here's where they raise your taxes. Here's the penalties. Here's where the IRS
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:31.960]  will garnish your wages or take your tax refund and they would go, they're just racist
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:37.960]  that say that a lot about our black president. And then the attorney general gets up their
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.960]  head and goes, I like Malcolm X. That's where we have to go in this country. What? Again,
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:45.960]  just like George Soros trying to start a war with the cops. These people want to start
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:51.960]  a civil war, man, and they're going to false flag and blame the patriots. Any idiot can
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:56.960]  see that's their next move. And it makes me so angry. People say, man, why do you get
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.960]  so upset? It's just the freedom. Well, it might be that I'm pretty much at the top of the
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.960]  pyramid when it comes to fighting these people. I'm kind of like not the head of the dog,
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.960]  but I mean, I'm kind of like an eyeball or maybe a tooth. I mean, I'm up at the front.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.960]  I'm walking point here and let me tell you, it ain't fun having these criminals and these
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:20.960]  jackals circling around. And so I want to beat them. I want to politically fight them. I
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.960]  want to get them out of the way. It's like walking out of an alleyway when you're walking
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.960]  home from school and three bullies are there four or five years older than you collectively.
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:30.960]  You know, they're all a couple of years older than you and they're about to beat the
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.960]  daylights out of you. You just go, you know what? I'm not running. And I'm not looking
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:37.960]  for this fight, but you want one? You know, I'm just going to pick up a brick and break
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:41.960]  it over your head. How does that sound politically? Huh? You want to get me with me? I'm going
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:45.960]  to slam your head up against the wall. I'm going to gouge your eyeballs out. You want to get
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.960]  the fight? Huh? You knew what order people want to push it? You want to talk about Malcolm X stuff?
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:55.960]  Like you're trying to stir people up into a revolution? What is your major problem? You've
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.960]  been picking on the Iraqis and people. You've been picking on the Russians and picking on
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:04.960]  the Ukrainians and playing games so long. You think you can really start a fight with
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:09.960]  what's left of America? Even though America is brainwashed, brain damaged, toxified and
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:17.960]  stunned, the stunned spirit of America that's still there will annihilate you and you know it.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:22.960]  So I get wound up because it's fight and flight and there's nowhere to run. So I'm like a
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:26.960]  raccoon in the garage and somebody's about to kill, man. I don't have a choice. I'm a fight.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.960]  I'm a fight in the info workers. They don't want me to. That's a more effective form of warfare.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:37.960]  Well, you know what you're seeing? Organic, primitive, resistance. And that's what can save us. The will.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:55.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.960]  Alex Jones.
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:12.960]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:15.960]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.960]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.960]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:21.960]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:28.960]  They're never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:42.960]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:59.960]  Get electorally. It's for God you can fail it.
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:16.960]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:20.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:29.960]  Alright, I mean, I had a little too much to remember about Tally the last few days. Excuse me. Oh, those rants felt pretty good, though.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:38.960]  You know why I'm doing it. I'm being honest. I know you're mad, too, at a primitive level. You're just gutting this country right in front of us.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:45.960]  So I don't know whether to laugh, cry, or move to the Bahamas, man, but, you know.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.960]  I just can't believe we're run by such scum.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:56.960]  We're going to have a reporter's pop in at the bottom of the hour. They're out investigating other secretive police substations that our intel tells us.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:02.960]  They're also interrogating people for days, in some cases, without putting them in the database. That is so illegal.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.960]  I just, you know, it's over the top.
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:16.960]  And then you've got weird Defense Department contacts and police lieutenants being trained there to be sent to Guantanamo Bay and Cuba and Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:24.960]  I mean, it's just really nasty. And Joe Biggs, and who went on that trip? It was Joe Biggs, David Knight, and Josh Owens again.
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.960]  Who went to Virginia and Camp A.P. Hill?
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:28.960]  It was Joe Biggs.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:31.960]  That's the training camp A.P. Hill, right? I only went to a couple of them.
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:38.960]  Yeah, he goes, yeah, that's like the torture facilities I brought people to. You know, that's it right there. It looks like that.
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:41.960]  I mean, that's what they're training for.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.960]  You know, we're showing footage of this of your TV viewer.
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:47.960]  That was last year. That's why I was asking the crew who went.
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  I frankly see Jay's younger than I. It's a better memory than I.
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:58.960]  This stuff all just starts going together. It's a big giant sandwich of evil.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:01.960]  And I just don't even know what to say anymore. You know what? I want to take your calls.
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:06.960]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:09.960]  I want to take first time callers here today and I'm going to settle down.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:16.960]  Are you upset about Obama saying he's going to ban heavy grain is what they're saying.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:24.960]  Full metal jacket, two to three rounds. That's just amazing. Claiming their cop killer.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.960]  Proposal banning armor piercing bullets from the public.
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:35.960]  But even if you like the proposal, which is horrible enough, you got to understand.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:38.960]  It's just like the FCC won't release what's in its plan.
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.960]  But the thing is the FCC is declaring regulatory power over the Internet that they never had.
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.960]  That's the issue. It's this bait and switching. The bigger the line, the more they believe it.
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:55.960]  It's the same thing. What's the ATF doing under Obama? He's not even signing an executive order.
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.960]  That would be bad. That would be unconstitutional.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:05.960]  But he just says, I'm ordering the ATF to ban these. And then next they'll say you can't have them.
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:10.960]  This veteran was raided and had a thousand rounds of cop kill around.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:16.960]  Oh, you can hear the headlines now. You know, that's what's so sick about this job is I know what they're going to say before they say it.
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:22.960]  I have watched these sacks of traitorous crud for 23 years, 20 years on air.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.960]  I know them inside and out.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:32.960]  The only time I'm confounded or wrong is when I underestimate how bad they are.
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:37.960]  I mean, people think I exaggerate and I'm here to tell you nine times out of 10.
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.960]  People keep catching me in this because my brain dials down the numbers.
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:52.960]  And most of the time I'm downplaying things because even I can't believe Samsung says in their owner's manual, even though we showed it to you,
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.960]  we're watching and listening to you and now it's in mainstream news today that your smart phone's listening to you and it's in the terms of service.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:03.960]  And I tell my reporters, go to the terms of service of all these devices, do articles on this.
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:06.960]  They're like, yeah, but you already did that a year ago on another smart phone.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.960]  I go, I don't care. It's on each different type.
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:17.960]  People only care about the one they have. We should have reports every day about every device we can reviewing how this spies on you, that spies on you.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:28.960]  Let's see, back before, back before anybody knew about this, I got death-threaded and physically stalked and physically attacked over covering the Blaco trial.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:37.960]  But separately, when I came out and said that they had a microphone in the Scientific Atlantic cable box and showed it on access television and talked about on radio,
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:41.960]  I mean, all hell broke loose. Death threats, you name it, serious stuff.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:48.960]  They called me to the radio station, I got fired right after that and they said, they said, you will shut up about this and this and that and this.
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:51.960]  And I said, you got calls and they went, damn right we did.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:05:08.960]  And we're about to get a major funding from a major state agency in advertising.
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:32.960]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.

[02:07:55.960 --> 02:08:17.960]  Silver bullet.
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:28.960]  Leading up frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.960]  You know, I love Chuck Berry, the father of Rock and Roll. I love his music, he's a maniac.
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:38.960]  But I'll tell you, this Rob Halford version is pretty powerful. Crank it up!
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:09:05.960]  Go Johnny, go go go!
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:11.960]  Monday through Friday, we're here at 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. We'll be back live this Sunday.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:17.960]  4 to 6 p.m. Central. Standard time.
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:23.960]  Logan, Ronnie, John, Nancy, Alan and others, we're going to go to your calls.
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:31.960]  We are identifying other black sites, but I just got a call from Joe Beggs and he's not scared of getting hurt and either is Josh,
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:39.960]  but Chicago police are really a rough bunch. No one denies that. It's about as close as mafia police are going to get anywhere in the world.
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:46.960]  They have suburban blocking them in, guys following them, doing aggressive maneuvers.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:51.960]  And when they start to get out of the car, they drive off, so they're definitely messing with our guys.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:58.960]  And I don't know, I mean, if they do it too much, I'm going to come up there and make a big deal out of this and get a big demonstration going.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:05.960]  And maybe they don't care. Maybe they club our heads in. Okay, fine. That will expose your gulag and you're going to end up losing down the road.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:13.960]  Don't run secret camps. Don't not put people in the arrest database. We are not North Korea.
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:21.960]  And we're not anti-police. We're anti-Rama manual and the globalists and all this crud. We're sick of it.
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:28.960]  Obama expanded the Patriot Act, made it even more inconstitutional, NDAA, to secretly arrest Americans.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:36.960]  And now they're disappearing people that have Ebola. I've talked to one medical doctor on air, and let's not exaggerate.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:47.960]  Fifteen or more. I myself talked to five or six medical doctors. A couple of them I know well, you know, like go out on boats with them.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:57.960]  Go out water skiing and weight boarding. And they are telling me everything that the doctor out of Missouri told me.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:02.960]  People are like, really? Well, where's the Ebola? Well, no one knew the borders were open for six months after we told you.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:09.960]  The border patrol called us. We met and blurred out their faces. They said, go to McAllen. They come over on buses. We give them vouchers.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:18.960]  We go. There it is happening. Border patrol is hiding. The emergency manager head comes out and says, yeah.
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:25.960]  Yeah, Feds paid to ship them in and ship them in the country. And the reason I raise that, every time I mention the Ebola,
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:29.960]  is because no one knew that the border patrol is paying to bring them in.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:36.960]  And then after we aired that, one of the high-level border patrol union people went public on Fox and said, listen, this is all true.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:40.960]  Because they asked him about it, not our report, but they said, is it true the border patrol brings them in and then ships them in?
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:46.960]  And he goes, yes, we're not supposed to talk about it or we'll be sanctioned, but we complete the smuggling process is the quote.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.960]  In fact, people won't believe me. You Google border patrol agent says we complete the smuggling process.
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:58.960]  I mean, you understand the epicness, the magnitude, the off the charts level of that.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:05.960]  And now Reuters is reporting what looks like more Ebola people. And they're being disappeared.
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:08.960]  I'll cover that after I take some phone calls, but I've mentioned this.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.960]  I'm going to go to Nancy and Alan and John and Ronnie and Logan, everybody.
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.960]  And in fact, to do that, I'm going to do it again and then I'm going to stop.
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:20.960]  No, I'm not going to skip the break. It's just, it's hurting the network. I got to stop.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:24.960]  But I'm going to go to your calls after the break, I promise, or you can punch me in the nose.
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:26.960]  You can have CJ come in and do it.
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:33.960]  Let's play this Lessons of 9-11 from Star Trek. The video is up on infowars.com.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:38.960]  We just tweeted it out on Real Alex Jones. Please retweet this to everybody you know.
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:43.960]  Because it's not just about 9-11. It's how the globalists create the crisis
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:47.960]  and then offer the solution and then feed off of us fighting with each other.
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.960]  This is an allegory of an alien on board the ship that has the Klingons and the humans
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:57.960]  basically fighting and killing each other, manipulating their emotions.
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:03.960]  This is what the globalists do to get our resources in control, just like the James Bond allegory
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:06.960]  from Russia with Love where they have the two simies fighting fish.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:10.960]  One kills the other, the other is exhausted, then the third comes in and finishes the kill.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.960]  That's what's happening. Our enemies are not the police or the military or the government even.
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:19.960]  But the globalists that have gained control and hijacked it.
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:21.960]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:29.960]  Captain's log, Star Date. Armageddon.
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:32.960]  The Klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.960]  What proof do we need?
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:39.960]  We know what a Klingon is.
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:48.960]  Helm did. The Poles have gone crazy. The Poles have taken over.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.960]  Most interesting. The bulk of your crew trapped.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.960]  Your ship racing from this galaxy at wild speeds.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.960]  How did I perform this sabotage, Kirk? All my men are here.
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:08.960]  Do you think some people in a cave? Do you think some people in a cave were able to have no rad stand down?
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:13.960]  Do you think that people in a cave were able to have all of this happen?
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:33.960]  The alien gives weapons to both sides, Rothschilds, the globalists, Rockefellers, and Dutch royalty.
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.960]  They create ISIS and our troops gotta go find them.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:43.960]  The imaginary distress calls the creation of these weapons.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.960]  We will in fact find weapons.
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:49.960]  Do you sense a pattern, Mr. Spock?
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:55.960]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:58.960]  There is an alien on board which may have created this situation.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.960]  Who cares what started it, Mr. Spock?
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:05.960]  It is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind.
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:08.960]  I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:09.960]  This is war!
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.960]  There isn't any war!
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:15.960]  You serious? I've got men in sick bay. Some of them dying.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.960]  Crossities committed on their persons.
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:20.960]  You talk about making peace with these fiends.
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:25.960]  The alien is the real threat. That's the enemy we have to wipe out.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:40.960]  Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating?
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:44.960]  He used gas? But where did he get the gas from us?
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:48.960]  Recent events would seem to be directed to a magnification of the basic hostilities.
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.960]  And here is that agenda. The project for the new American Century.
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:55.960]  Much of what these men wanted is coming true.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:59.960]  They urged that the U.S. abandon the anti-ballistic missile treaty.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:05.960]  It has. They wanted establishment of more permanent U.S. military bases abroad.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:10.960]  That is happening in the Philippines and in Georgia and will likely happen in Iraq.
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:16.960]  They urged regime change as a goal of foreign wars, not just in Iraq.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:20.960]  They wanted the U.S. as a global constabulary.
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:29.960]  Their word. Such aspirations are unlikely to be realized without a catastrophic and catalyzing event like in U. Pearl Harbor.
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:36.960]  Apparently, it is by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns.
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:38.960]  What's the game?
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.960]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.960]  We must push outward if we are to survive.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:51.960]  The Constitution has not given permission for us to so-called police the world.
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:53.960]  We have always fought.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:57.960]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:59.960]  As you've been listening to propaganda.
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:00.960]  Shut up!
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:03.960]  There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:11.960]  We ought to stay at home, mine our own business, trade with people and be friends with people, and we all would be a lot better off.
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:17.960]  There's an alien entity aboard the ship. It's forcing us to fight. We don't want to.
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:21.960]  We don't know what its motive is. We're trying to find out. You must help us.
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:26.960]  It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:39.960]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:43.960]  Now do you believe?
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:46.960]  What did you want?
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:48.960]  What are you doing here?
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:51.960]  Kill the Klayans! It's never us, isn't it?
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  Don't!
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.960]  When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy.
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:03.960]  It subsists on the emotions of others.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:12.960]  This one appears to be strengthened by mental radiations of hostility, violent intentions.
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:18.960]  It exists on the hate of others.
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:24.960]  To put it simply, and it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation.
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:32.960]  In order to satisfy that need, it has brought together opposing forces in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict.
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:34.960]  We've got to get rid of it.
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:40.960]  Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The fighting must end. And soon.
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:44.960]  Oh, we're a doom ship. We've got to pull our knowledge.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:53.960]  We must find a way to defeat the alien force of hate, stop the war now, or spend eternity in futile, bloody violence.
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.960]  It has to stop!
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:04.960]  Look, gang, for the rest of our lives, a thousand lifetimes, senseless violence, fighting,
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:09.960]  while an alien has total control over us.
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:16.960]  And it goes on and on, the good old game of war, pawn against pawn, stopping the bad guys.
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:24.960]  While somewhere some thing sits back and laughs, and starts it all over again.
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:26.960]  He is telling the truth.
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.960]  Be a pawn. Be a toy. Be a good soldier that never questions orders.
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:45.960]  This is Captain Kirk. A truce is ordered. The fighting is over. Lay down your weapons.
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:50.960]  This is Kang. Seize hostilities.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:57.960]  The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain. I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:03.960]  Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you.
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:08.960]  And we don't want to play.
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:18.960]  Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over.
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:22.960]  We'll be on guard now. We'll be ready for you. So, ship out.
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.960]  Only a full fight's in a burning house.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:38.960]  Thought crime seven, put that together. I think about eight years ago.
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.960]  We can pull up the actual YouTube channel and show you when it came out.
[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:45.960]  I'll just do that right now. I've got it right here in front of me on infowars.com.
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:51.960]  That was put out in 2009. At least this version was.
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:57.960]  On Chewbacca 2000. That's the name of the YouTube channel.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:01.960]  2009. So that's five, six, six, seven years ago.
[02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:05.960]  I don't even know if that's the actual maker of it because a bunch of people have it.
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:08.960]  Nope. Yeah, they didn't post it. That's a repost. That's what I said.
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:14.960]  It's only got like 300,000 views total on the three channels I saw it on. He's like 50 million views.
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:20.960]  But there's an inverse to this because then the UN and the globalists who create the
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:24.960]  Balkanization and the divide and conquer and the war say, yes, global government peace.
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:29.960]  Individuals turn your guns in and then other nation states turn your guns in.
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:34.960]  Only the UN will be armed for peace. So they create all this war.
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:38.960]  Start World War One. Fun Hitler. Start that.
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:42.960]  The globalists wrote books saying they bring in a UN, League of Nations, world government out of the wars.
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:45.960]  I'm not just saying this. They say it.
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:49.960]  And out of new conflict, they'll bring in even greater tyranny and control.
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:57.960]  So I'm not saying get rid of our military. I'm not saying turn our guns because the extreme that is then, oh, yeah, we're against war.
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:01.960]  We see what a fraud it is. So then we become defenseless.
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:09.960]  So there's a balance there because not everybody thinks like those of us that don't want a bunch of conflict.
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:13.960]  But that's how the globalists are getting the nation states into debt.
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:17.960]  It's how the Rothschilds in 1918 financed both Napoleon.
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:19.960]  They had families in five different countries.
[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:24.960]  And in England, they then got the word across the channel.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:31.960]  They had the fastest ship and they used carrier pigeons to get to the coast about eight, nine hours before the word got across.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:40.960]  They said Napoleon had won in the stock market plummeted and then he was able to buy it up for pennies on the pound.
[02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:47.960]  And then dominated the British Empire that had just defeated Napoleon and controlled much of the world.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:52.960]  And that's why we've been under a Rothschild style system pretty much ever since.
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:56.960]  Then the British financed the Civil War, set in British intelligence.
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:08.960]  This is all public mainline history, just not pop history. It's not on PBS, but it is in mainline history books that British intelligence came and foam into the south.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:15.960]  And by the way, I had family across the board that were Confederate colonels and generals the whole nine yards.
[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:17.960]  So people listening in the south hear me saying this.
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:20.960]  They go, how dare you, you Yankee scum.
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:29.960]  You don't like the sound that will rise again against all the evils of the industrial north was cheating the south on tariffs.
[02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:35.960]  It was doing a lot of bad things. It was almost a civil war when President Johnson, who was a Southerner, was president.
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:42.960]  He stopped it. The south almost rebelled against Johnson, not Johnson Andrew Jackson.
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:49.960]  I've got again this had this root canal and it hurts on having trouble enunciating properly today.
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:55.960]  And so the north was doing bad stuff. The war was not about slavery. That's true. It was a war of Northern aggression.
[02:23:55.960 --> 02:24:08.960]  It was wrong. But British intelligence wanted to split the country into an ally with the south and then basically end up controlling western expansion instead of the US taking over the rest of North America.
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:12.960]  They were going to have British do it. And they had a British fleet up off New York.
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:24.960]  They had a British fleet up off the coast of the US and Canada in Maine and they had tens of thousands of British troops stationed in Toronto threatening to invade.
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:34.960]  And the Tsar of Russia sent a whole fleet into New York Harbor to support Lincoln and said, if you do this, we're going to go to war with you.
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:40.960]  And it's the only reason I didn't happen. The British were going to reinvade the United States and they fooled Southerners, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:49.960]  suckered them into that war. And then the cause celeb was, oh, slavery.
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:25:01.960]  The abolitionists since 1800 in the north and the south, slavery was already going out. In fact, it was white people that started ending slavery worldwide.
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:07.960]  It was white Christians in Europe and in England and the United States that started ending it. It was going on in Africa. It was going on in Asia.
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:14.960]  It was going on. They called it serfdom and inter-servitude. They were white slaves, basically. And I'm not endorsing any of it. It was terrible.
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:25.960]  It's just that we haven't been given the real history. The real racism and the really hard core stuff started after slavery with Jim Crow and all of that.
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:34.960]  But it was the West that began to end slavery. We should be proud of that. But instead, oh, the West gets no credit.
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:45.960]  The West is behind slavery. Arab countries still have slavery in North Africa and stuff. And it's not even, it's like, oh, that's cute. That's liberal because you're an Arab.
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:57.960]  You're a Muslim, so it's okay. I'm just sick of the ignorance. Okay, I said I'd go to your calls. I apologize, Nancy, Alan, Johnny, Ronnie, Logan.
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:02.960]  We're going to go to your calls right now. Let's talk to Nancy in Tennessee. Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:05.960]  Hi, Alex. How are you today?
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:07.960]  I'm doing pretty darn good.
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:30.960]  That's terrific. I would like to see us create some kind of penalty for politicians lying. You have shown videos, okay, where Obama promised one thing and then you jump ahead to the future and he says exactly the opposite thing.
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:35.960]  Because I never said you could keep your doctor and you have 50 videos or more of him saying you can keep your doctor, I promise.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:42.960]  I'm not coming after your guns, not your handgun, not your rival, not your shotgun. Then he comes after him. Absolutely. Total liar.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:51.960]  I mean, the people should be hopping mad that we've been so conditioned to accept lies.
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:27:01.960]  We've been so hippy from the 60s. I don't understand what's going on here. I mean, we've protested more when I was in high school than they're doing now.
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:18.960]  Well, a lot of it is people just are so selfish that they think it's weird to go out and protest. The controlled left has put out so many, what I'd call kind of dirty leg, you know, dirty hippie, there's a lot of nice hippies.
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:27.960]  They've got so many hippie images and they've had provocateurs, you know, throw stuff through the local store windows. That's an old trick to demonize legitimate protests.
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:38.960]  They've done a good job of siopping it. The biggest way to protest is with your dollars. Don't support globalist operations. Spread the word. Reach out to people across the board with the good news of freedom.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:41.960]  I think that's how you bring them down.
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:52.960]  You know, I had a nephew in his history book. It said that it portrayed the protests of the 60s like we were a bunch of spoiled brat.
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:28:01.960]  And never once did they say that we were out there protesting because the 18-year-olds were being drafted and you had to be 21 before you could vote.
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:11.960]  Sure. No, they hired Ford Foundation people to spit on the troops and to do it on camera and they would go back and they worked for the government. It's all been declassified. They ran a siop.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:21.960]  They would have protests where people, you know, would urinate on businesses and things and then show it on the news. It was a siop to demonize and then they gave LSD to the hippies.
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:30.960]  They had Timothy Leary who was FBI come and lead the revolution to make it about drugs so they could then get young kids on drugs like it was stylish so they could then put them in prison.
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:34.960]  It's all been perfectly planned.
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:46.960]  We need some kind of recourse against that. I want to see, I want to challenge every hippie from the 60s that I've protested with. I want them to get out there now and get and start complaining about what some of these things are not doing.
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:53.960]  But wouldn't that be racist? I mean, if they expose Obamacare, it's because they hate black people. That's what the Attorney General just said today.
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:29:02.960]  I mean, if you don't like holdership in Guns of Mexico to demonize the Second Amendment and the false flag, just admit it. Nancy, it's because you don't like him because he's black.
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:04.960]  Oh, come on.
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:11.960]  Oh, I know. I know. It's sick. It's sick. I mean, if he was a black guy promoting the Second Amendment, I would literally, you know, wash his feet.
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:18.960]  There was a black guy like Ron Paul. I'd be giving him money and trying to get him to run for Congress. I could care less what color they are.
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:23.960]  That is the biggest stinking red herring I've ever heard of in my life. I want freedom. That's what I want.
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:30.960]  And I'm sick of these race baiters injecting race on every issue. I appreciate your call.
[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:37.960]  Hillary Clinton's taking heat from Democrats right now as Libya chaos creates terrorist safe haven. They act like it's a screw up, though, in the conservative press.
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:47.960]  It wasn't a screw up. It was a bipartisan battle plan that the neocons supported as well. We'll be right back with more calls going to Allen and others.
[02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:54.960]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:34.960]  You won't hear me, but you'll hear me.
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:43.960]  Without warning, you can bet your bottom dollar they're planting massive false flags. That's the next move.
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:59.960]  To then grandstand its saviors, sell the final police state takeover as they prepare to start looting the pension funds, collapsing the economy, and bringing in open world government as the solution to the engineered crisis they authored.
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:15.960]  I know we've got Alan, Logan, Ronnie, John, Lord Rothschild, others holding. I was going right to your calls, but I forgot I got Joe Biggs and the crew popping in with any new info from the secret black site in Chicago where people have died, where torturers have been trained and sent overseas.
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:26.960]  Amazing information. They've got a lot of intel coming out over the weekend and this Sunday, 4-6pm, we'll have the big data dump for you here live on air. They'll still be in Chicago.
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:38.960]  But it's wind show below zero, about 13 degrees out there right now, so I'm not going to keep them long. Joe Biggs, you've been harassed a little bit since you've been out there with Josh. What's happened since we talked to you an hour ago?
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:56.960]  Roger that. Right after the show, Alex, and as we were saying, we're standing right outside of the Hammond Square location still, west of Chicago. We pulled down the road a little bit just to kind of get away so we could shoot a couple reports and just sit back and look at what's going on. We had two police Tahos come in, do U-turns, and kind of block us off at the road.
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:08.960]  They watched us all the way home and as soon as we got back to the car, they drove up beside us, one pulled up behind us, and the guys said, oh, you know, where are you guys from? And you know, what are you doing? And they just kind of laughed and waved at us and then drove off.
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:21.960]  Then we walked up the street a little bit and people kept driving by looking at us, shaking their heads. A guy came out of the parking lot over here and goes, oh, Guantanamo, huh? That's funny. Yeah. And then just walked back inside. So clearly they're watching us right now.
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:30.960]  But, you know, we're out here to uncover what's going on, the illegal activities that are happening up there. Understand there is a need for undercover work and all that. But I just find it's weird, though.
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:42.960]  Don't you, Alex, that a man, for no reason, pulls into the bank parking lot to tell us he's undercover and then tell us to be safe and watch our backs, basically, and then just drives off.
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:47.960]  Like, why would you, if you're undercover and you're worried about getting killed, why would you pull up there where we're filming?
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:58.960]  Joe, it's obviously a threat. In fact, I heard some of it, but I was too busy talking over you when he pulled up. I mean, I heard him say, you better erase that. You better, you know, you better be safe.
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:02.960]  Yeah, he says, you better erase it. I don't want to get killed.
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:05.960]  So repeat everything he said to you because it sounds like a threat.
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:17.960]  Yeah, he drove up and he goes, hey, can you not record me? You know, I don't want to get killed out here. Can you not have any footage of this? And I said, well, this is live. And he's like, well, then you just need to be safe. You just need to be safe.
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:20.960]  And then he kept saying erase that tape.
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:26.960]  Yeah. Well, you can't erase live footage, sir. You know, that's just, that's how it happens.
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:38.960]  Well, Joe, all I can say is, you know, we have six or seven, you know, seven different London Guardian reports that I've seen. I'm told more are coming out. This was broken by local lawyers.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:47.960]  People have died in here. They've held people for up to two days secretly. Peaceful protesters, 18 hours shackled to the wall.
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:57.960]  Yeah. And what the police officer said to that lady when she was shackled there, right before they shackled, they said, welcome. Welcome to a Harmon Square. We're going to give you a tour of hell.
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:07.960]  Yeah. And then you've got Rumsfeld involved in the Defense Department right through to today with people trained there, then sent to Guantanamo Bay.
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:18.960]  So, you know, I remember years ago, they had a federally funded checkpoint on IH 35. It was so insane. They at like eight at nine, I forget the calls. I 35 is shut down.
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:26.960]  I mean, I 35 has traffic sometimes at midnight on it through Austin. I mean, it's the busiest thoroughfare in the country from Canada, right down to Mexico.
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:34.960]  You live here, Joe. It's a nightmare. You can't even use it from like seven in the morning till about 10 in the morning for about four up to about seven.
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:48.960]  I mean, it's horrible. It's horrible. And it's in my film, Police 60,000. They had it shut down from Kyle, south of Austin to Round Rock, like 20 miles with cars rolling three miles an hour, randomly searching people.
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:54.960]  And I get out there and the cops come over and go, Oh, Jones, what are we doing?
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:09.960]  I mean, I have video of this black helicopters or the Serbians going to get me. So here you are. Total tyranny. It's an admitted secret black site. All this stuff's going on and they're laughing, making jokes.
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:22.960]  They told the Guardian, Oh, what are we CIA? Obviously, there's probably legitimate police work going on. It's a giant facility, but we know multiple floors of that baby are blacked out and people are quote enhanced interrogation.
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:25.960]  Well, just because they changed the name, Joe, doesn't mean it's not torture.
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:34.960]  Exactly. When I talked to the defense attorney, the one who broke the sword of the garden the other day on the phone, he said that he had spoken with some other journalists in the area that were kind of downplaying the whole thing.
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:40.960]  And the journalists were going, Well, we've been in there. They had, they hold press conferences at Hammond Square all the time. I've never seen anything.
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:51.960]  And the defense attorney, Anthony Hill, he goes, Well, have you ever been up on the second, third floors at all? And they're like, No, it's like, Yeah, they don't allow anybody up there because that's where they're beating and torturing people.
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:39:00.960]  Well, they sell this in Hollywood movies where the good cops have got the child killer or they've, you know, they catch the guy. They don't know where the child's being held. So they start beating them.
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:14.960]  If you really knew you had some child molester who'd been convicted before and you found him with photos of a child tied up and you had intel that the kid, you know, was going to be killed or only had so much oxygen.
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:27.960]  There is a time probably to get rough with somebody. Okay, but, but you don't codify it in law. You don't push it. You don't industrialize it. The truth is, back in 2004, then I'm going to calls.
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:35.960]  We'll get back to reporting and they, they arrested a bunch of people in New York. They arrested me for free speech. I got put in a substation. Thank God.
[02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:50.960]  They took 2000 people at the RNC in 2004 to a giant old bus terminal over the river, ran the buses, made jokes about it, held them for days, no lawyers, didn't enroll their names, know nothing as a giant test of tyranny.
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:40:01.960]  So I've experienced this and we know this is going on and it's very dangerous to set this precedent and it's not a joke.
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:11.960]  Okay, this is something we keep seeing popping up. I mean, they keep going after the protesters, people out there exercising their freedom of speech, you know, and just then being on the sidewalk, it's still not good enough.
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:23.960]  You know, they want you to get further back. You know, we were in California, Marietta, they kept pushing us in smaller zones. You know, we're in Ferguson, they were pushing us and they would push people into the streets and then arrest them for impeding the flow of traffic.
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:33.960]  I mean, it's complete total tyranny. It's out of control and America needs to wake up to this and that's what we're going to keep doing. We're going to keep coming out here, exposing all this stuff and it's good that there's going to be a protest tomorrow.
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:39.960]  It's good that people are going to come out. I think everyone in America should be pissed off that something like this is happening right here on our home turf.
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:46.960]  And again, this facility wasn't even known about. I mean, this is about starting to pay attention, starting to become aware.
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:55.960]  I want you to get a list of the civilian inmate labor camp program. There were 18 of them. Now it's classified, the latest stuff's classified, but I'm told it's over 100.
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:41:02.960]  But it's their bases in Texas, you guys can go to where they have the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:11.960]  And they're primed with state and federal prisoners doing the basically slave labor, but it's prepared in the documents for civil unrest to put us in forced labor camps.
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.960]  So if folks want to see the real FEMA camps, they're there. They're just not called FEMA camps.
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:23.960]  I want you guys to go cover the civilian inmate labor camp program after you get back from Austin. Thank you so much, Joe.
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:30.960]  Tell folks what time the demonstration for free speech and not having secret prisons and secret torture centers. What time that is tomorrow?
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:43.960]  It's supposed to start tomorrow at 3pm. I'm assuming this is the only access road. So right here across from Hammond Square, we'll be out here. We're going to be talking to individuals, trying to find out if anybody's been detained here in this area that's going to show up.
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:53.960]  Even maybe try to get that lawyer out here. I think tomorrow's going to be really great. There's going to be a lot of people that I've heard of driving from Wisconsin from other surrounding areas who are going to come out here and support this.
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:56.960]  So this is good to see people pissed off and want to come out and support it.
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:04.960]  Well, we'll put a live feed box up on infowars.com, and I'm sure somebody will come up and coordinate with you guys to put your live feed box.
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:14.960]  And I'm not going to handle it, guys. Just handle it. Whoever wants to get it done with the guys. So on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, there's a live feed, not even so much through our system, but through...
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:25.960]  What are we using? We're using Ustream right now. We'll have a Ustream box up tomorrow at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com so that everybody can actually be there in spirit at least,
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:32.960]  who can't make it up to the Chicago. But that's very important. Joe Biggs and Josh Owens. Great job.
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:33.960]  Thank you, sir.
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:38.960]  Thank you, sir. Okay, now I'm going to shut up and go to your phone calls. I want to get to everybody here.
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:43.960]  Alan in Chicago, you're on the air talking about black sites. Go ahead.
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:55.960]  Yeah, Alex, born and raised in Chicago, 50 years old, you know, the whole gangster mentality, the out-component, everything. I know Chicago's no worse than any other big city.
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:07.960]  But if this does not open the eyes of the American people, when we went crazy over Abu Ghraib, if we don't as Americans, and this is an Obama's backyard,
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:18.960]  Rama Manuel's backyard, we just had a mayoral election that's going to go to a runoff, if these people didn't know about it or there should be an investigation,
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:24.960]  and all of America ought to be down with Joe Biggs tomorrow for this, because this is the watershed moment.
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:32.960]  If we have black sites in America, in the president's hometown, and his chief of staff now mayor's hometown, it's over, Alex.
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:38.960]  If you can start taking people, citizens off the street and putting them into this, all are civil rights.
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:46.960]  I know the guns, that neutrality, force vaccines is an issue. If you can start just taking people off and dumping them in and they disappear,
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:55.960]  this is now a vindication of what you mentioned about all the NDA action. This is an NDA site, period.
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:03.960]  The London Guardians proven it, the lawyers have, and the department now admits they kept it secret. Let me quantify this.
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:10.960]  Bloomberg lost in federal and state court that the police were frisking upwards of 300, 400,000 people a year.
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:17.960]  It varied without probable cause, without a warrant, without even detaining them. They would just randomly search folks.
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:25.960]  And I get there's a lot of scum and a lot of criminals in New York City, but still, you start doing that, you're living in North Korea,
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:34.960]  it always goes bad, it's unconstitutional. How about the prisons actually hold the violent offenders instead of releasing them?
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:42.960]  That's the answer, and release the nonviolent. But no, they have actuaries where they release, the statistics are there, you can look them up,
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:48.960]  they release the violence quicker than the nonviolence, because the nonviolence are easier, they work in prison industries,
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:56.960]  they want the violence. The social engineers, not the cops. The social engineers want the violence out on the street,
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:03.960]  and they don't want us to have guns to blow them away. But all the major cop unions, that's why I support the police at many levels,
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.960]  97% of police, 98% national polls, and you can look them up, support the Second Amendment.
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:15.960]  Cops know good citizens having guns, lowers crime, criminals are going to have them anyways. But again, they don't want citizens armed,
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:22.960]  they don't want citizens to have rights, this is what they want. That's why places like Chicago, as you said, have high crime rates,
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:27.960]  but they're localized to certain high crime areas. I know Chicago has moderate crime rates in many areas,
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:35.960]  but it's off the charts because of South Chicago and other areas. But looking at this, New York was up in arms,
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:43.960]  and rightfully so, over stop and frisk without warrants or probable cause, this is where they grab you, disappear you for up to two days,
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:52.960]  people have died in there, and then they take you in, bring you in and charge you, or bring you before a magistrate days later.
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:58.960]  I mean, this is total tyranny, and if they get away with this, you better believe it's going on all over the country.
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:08.960]  I bet money New York's got these because they had them before. I bet money L.A.'s got them. I bet money that places like Detroit have this.
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:19.960]  I bet money, Miami has this. I bet money, and I bet money, Houston has this. I mean, I'm naming departments that are really, really dangerous.
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:24.960]  And again, I'm not saying all the police at Houston are bad, but I mean, those are scary cops too.
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:30.960]  I mean, they got like CIA squads in there, everything. They execute people on the street. I've seen it on helicopter feed.
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:37.960]  They pull over CIA section chief. The guy gets out, the cop kills him. I mean, that was under orders. I mean, it is creepy.
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:44.960]  And this thing is out of control. We got to get control of this right now. God bless you, Alan. Appreciate your points.
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:50.960]  Hope you're out to protest tomorrow. John in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:51.960]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:52.960]  Hey, brother.
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:47:06.960]  You know, those, according to the NRA website, the ATF not only trying to abandon the AR-15 ammo, but you know, those armed races that he could attack with an AR-15 pistol or an AK pistol,
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:08.960]  but not been for sale for a couple years now.
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:09.960]  Yes.
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:13.960]  Well, the ATF has reclassified those as an NFA weapon.
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:14.960]  Not in a word.
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:22.960]  And now anybody has one of those braces, and if they don't register it, they're going to be, they're going to be a convict felony go to prison for saying that.
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:30.960]  Yeah, they're now saying they're class three, like a silencer, a suppressor or a full auto, which are all basically pointless.
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:35.960]  But yes, this is how they did it in California, passes gun laws.
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.960]  And then people don't know about the regulations and they swat team, like old men and stuff.
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:44.960]  In fact, that was the Bloomberg headline last year was gun confiscation begins in California.
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:51.960]  And yes, and Obama says he's planning, quote, scores of regulatory things he can do.
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:53.960]  So first it'll be 223.
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:54.960]  High grain.
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:56.960]  Then it'll be the braces.
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:47:59.960]  Then it'll be, I mean, they're coming for us, folks.
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:00.960]  They are coming.
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:01.960]  They are coming.
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:07.960]  And then the average person won't read all these retroactive regulations that aren't even laws.
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:13.960]  And then you will get an ATF or local ATF police, because they have sheriff's departments going under ATF.
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:18.960]  You'll get a SWAT team raid with guys stacked up in your house at 3am.
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:20.960]  And undoubtedly it'll be some old insurance salesman.
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.960]  This has happened a bunch who thinks criminals are breaking in because why would he have people breaking in?
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:25.960]  He didn't do anything wrong.
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:28.960]  And they'll gun him down in this house and say he went for a gun.
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:30.960]  I mean, this is going to be a nightmare.
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:32.960]  What do you say?
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:36.960]  Alex, I predict the next thing they're going to go after is the slight fire stock.
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:37.960]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:39.960]  They'll see the quick pump fire with machine gun fire.
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:43.960]  They're going to restrict all semi-automatics in the country.
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:46.960]  That's why we need to roll back the laws on everybody have full auto.
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:48.960]  And folks, full auto is nothing.
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:50.960]  Full auto is almost worthless.
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:57.960]  The military, unless it's a heavy gun on a helicopter or a tank or a machine gun nest, nobody uses full auto.
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:48:59.960]  It's hard to control the fire.
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:02.960]  I mean, I hope if somebody comes to rob me, they're shooting at me with full auto.
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:05.960]  I mean, it is just pointless to have full auto.
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:13.960]  Full auto is when you're in a World War II situation and floods of troops or World War I or Korea are flooding your position.
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:19.960]  Then you're just firing at the level of their chest to take them out.
[02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:22.960]  No one commits crimes with full auto.
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:30.960]  The people that go get the ATF stamp to get it, you literally never hear about crimes with people that have registered guns.
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.960]  It's because criminals aren't going to do it anyways.
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:40.960]  And so this claim of restricting ammo and stuff is meant to set the precedent that outside of law, the ATF can ban whatever they want.
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:42.960]  Go ahead.
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:44.960]  I just think they need to get rid of the ATF, Alex.
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:46.960]  They keep saying, yeah, you can put this on a market.
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:47.960]  They wait two years.
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:49.960]  Oh, well, we changed our mind.
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:52.960]  People put thousands of dollars into putting this stuff on a market.
[02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:54.960]  And then all of a sudden, everybody's criminals now.
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:56.960]  It's designed to catch law abiding citizens.
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:49:58.960]  It's like the IRS.
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:49:59.960]  Money magazine forms.
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:00.960]  They've all done it.
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:03.960]  I think forms had 50 CPAs do it and money.
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:05.960]  It was 30 CPAs or vice versa.
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.960]  And all 30 CPAs came with a different answer on a tax return.
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:12.960]  It's no, you can call the IRS now.
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:17.960]  They said this last year and they will not give you advice on Obamacare or filing your taxes.
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:23.960]  They will not tell you how to file it correctly because they want to throw you in jail selectively.
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:32.960]  There's no way to comply and it's unconstitutional and it's a collection agency for the private, stinking enemy, the Federal Reserve.
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:34.960]  Thanks for the call.
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:35.960]  Rodney in Illinois.
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:36.960]  You're up next.
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:37.960]  Then Logan.

[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:46.960]  I'm Alex Jones, broadcasting from the Infowars.com studios in Austin, Texas.
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:51.960]  Is it actually easier to talk with that big broadcaster voice right now than to talk normal about normal talk?
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:53.960]  Because my, and I had that wisdom tooth worked on.
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:55.960]  It's kind of swollen in my gums and my cheeks.
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:57.960]  So, having a little bit of fun here.

[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:22.960]  We're not going to have probably any super-female vitality for six weeks.

[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:58.960]  Yeah, I just, you keep saying they're going to force us to take vaccines, but they've already defeated themselves on that because of Roe V. Wade.
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:03.960]  Roe V. Wade says that a woman has the right to decide what goes in her body or stays in her body.
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:09.960]  I agree. We can actually use that argument against them that we have the power of choice, plus they admit the liability of it.
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:17.960]  So what they're doing is trying to bully us into it saying we can't fly or my kids can't be in an exercise camp in Austin because they haven't been vaccinated.
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:23.960]  Now I have to threaten to sue the place, show them the law. Absolutely, go ahead.
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:31.960]  The 62-grain green tip is designed to be a penetrator, but there's a whole lot of stuff out there penetrating a lot better than that stuff does.
[02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:36.960]  Exactly, and then they'll say ban that. It's all about a power grab.
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.960]  Yeah, your 50 BMG is going to help penetrate anything else.
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:53.960]  And the last thing I want to disagree with you about is that I've been listening to you for about 17 or 18 years, and I've heard you play everything from underdog to megadeth.
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:57:00.960]  But I've never heard you play the one song that you should be playing all the time, and that's God and Guns by Leonard Skinner.
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:07.960]  I love Leonard Skinner. I love Smashing Pumpkins and never play any of it because I only put, every few months go here, put this song or that song.
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:13.960]  I'm going to get Smashing Pumpkins. I'm going to get Leonard Skinner. I love Leonard Skinner.
[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:17.960]  We should have Free Bird on here. I mean, what are we thinking?
[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:20.960]  Brother, I hear you. What else do you want?
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:22.960]  God and Guns, especially.
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:36.960]  And one last thing, I've tried to call three or four times to order the super male vitality, but every time I have to listen to the disclaimer and I hear a female recording come on to tell me that they're going to put me through to make my order.
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:40.960]  And then it shuts off and hangs up on me.
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:45.960]  When you call 888-253-3139, that happens?
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:58:01.960]  Right. It transferred me to the, you know, I pushed the wand to the order line and all that, and then I hear a male voice give him the disclaimer, and then I hear a female recording say, you know, we're going to put you through to place your order or whatever, and then just almost immediately after that.
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:06.960]  Well, sir, give us your name and number. I'm going to call you right after the show. We're going to, we're going to figure that out.
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:12.960]  Really appreciate that information, sir. Who knows? I'm going to stay there. Don't hang up.
[02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:25.960]  And boy, you were listed 17 years ago. When I was playing underdog, that was when I was doing the syndicated show out of 989 FM, and I was doing it over a phone line to the satellite and the station didn't believe I was syndicated.
[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:35.960]  They said, oh yeah, you can be syndicated and laughed at me. And I was on like 20 stations on a phone line. And then all of a sudden Jay Leno talked about me and they're like, you really are syndicated?
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:43.960]  Hold on, we're going to come back and take more calls. Ronnie, I'm going to get your info right now. I'm going to find out what's going on.
[02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:56.960]  This is the communications radio network.
[02:59:13.960 --> 02:59:18.960]  Call 188-253-3139.
[02:59:43.960 --> 02:59:49.960]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[02:59:49.960 --> 02:59:59.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:20.960]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:30.960]  Sorry about sounding like I have marbles in my mouth today after getting that wisdom tooth done.
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:35.960]  And it wasn't my body going out on me. It was me grinding my teeth at night or clenching them. Let's go now to Logan.
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:39.960]  Logan in Kansas. Logan, you're on the air.
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:41.960]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:52.960]  I'm an independent journalist and a veteran. And from Rebecca in 2013, there were reports about veterans receiving letters in the mail from the VA, declaring them mentally incompetent for the purposes of owning or purchasing firearms.
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:55.960]  Yeah, there wasn't rumors. It was going on.
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:01.960]  Right. Well, I conducted an interview with Michael Connolly, who's the civil rights attorney handling these cases.
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:12.960]  And he's made some progress since then with his FOIA request. But the reason I wanted to get a story out there is because he's been experiencing Gary Webstyl attacks since he's filed these requests.
[03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:20.960]  Oh, yeah. I mean, Clinton announced when he left office that they'd banned 87,000 vets from owning guns, eschewed initially. So this is going on.
[03:01:20.960 --> 03:01:26.960]  And they're trying to cover it up. I would love to get this guy on. What's the lawyer's name again?
[03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:31.960]  Michael Connolly and his foundation is at USJF.net.
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:34.960]  I've heard of that. Has he been on the show before?
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:41.960]  He may have been. I don't know. But what he told me was that his office was after he filed these requests, his office was broken into.
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:46.960]  And the return receipts from the certified letters were selectively stolen out of his office.
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:50.960]  And all the letters pertaining to the FOIA request were deleted off of his hard drive.
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:59.960]  And he called the police. But the creepy thing is that there were no signs of a forced break in. It was as if somebody unlocked the door and locked it on their way out.
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:08.960]  But the good news is some of the VA FOIA requests he did discover they produced a memorandum between the VA and the FBI,
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:15.960]  specifically stating how they are going to avoid due process when they declare these veterans incompetent.
[03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:20.960]  Huge news. Give me a favor. Give me the website. I know who he is. Say his name in the website one more time.
[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:23.960]  I'm going to get him on tomorrow or get him on Sunday.
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:32.960]  Read the interview LibertyChange.wordpress.com and all of the links to his website and all of this information that he's given me is in the interview.
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:35.960]  It's pretty lengthy. Transcribe the whole thing.
[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:40.960]  Great job. But what's his organization again?
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:43.960]  The website is USJF.net.
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:47.960]  Right. The United States Justice Foundation.
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:52.960]  Alright. We're going to look into it. That's a huge story and something I need to cover more. Thank you so much.
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:56.960]  We're almost out of time. But Lord Rothschild with the last caller. Sorry to Bill.
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:03:02.960]  Wow. I want to talk to Bill in Chicago. Maybe I'll keep going into overdrive. Don't hang up Bill. Andrew.
[03:03:02.960 --> 03:03:06.960]  We're going to go into more overdrive. Just stay there. Lord Rothschild. Go ahead.
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:08.960]  Hey Alex. Can you hear me alright brother?
[03:03:08.960 --> 03:03:09.960]  Yes sir.
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.960]  Alright. Good deal. I got a question and a comment. I wanted to ask you.
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:25.960]  What does it mean for the New World Order that being the fact that there's only three countries left, Iran, Cuba and North Korea that do not have a Rothschild central bank in them?
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:29.960]  Well it means we've almost got world government don't we?
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:31.960]  Yeah. Exactly.
[03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:42.960]  Why wouldn't you? I mean if the global central bank cartel that the Rothschilds are at the center of, but it's bigger than them, if they control the issues of currency and credit, of course they own the world.
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:49.960]  Yeah. Exactly. I mean that is just mind blowing. I didn't even realize there was only three countries left. Anywhere.
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:53.960]  Yeah. They call them rogue nations.
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:55.960]  Yeah. That's ridiculous.
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:00.960]  You don't want to bow to the global banking cartel?
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:05.960]  I tell you right now, I won't and I know a whole lot of people around here that won't bow to the global.
[03:04:05.960 --> 03:04:13.960]  Well they're spending billions to set a precedent to force inject you because they love you. That's not creepy. Just trust them. They've got shots.
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:19.960]  They'll be no more pain soon, Rothschild, when you've taken your injection, okay?
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:24.960]  You know what? You're right. They mean well for us. Hey I got a quick comment before you jump.
[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:25.960]  Sure.
[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:34.960]  I want to tell everyone out there, everyone that's listening right now, we know we're awake. Go get the book, read Nundare College in Fierce.
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:44.960]  It's very eye-opening. All we can do is make the little changes we can in our own lives. Go out, tell everyone, educate your family first, then your friends.
[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:51.960]  And Alex, just like you said the other day on the show, you need to push this info-worse train up to 200 miles an hour.
[03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:55.960]  Drop the hammer on these globalists because I think we can take this country back.
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:05:21.960]  We can. You know, I don't think that was Lord Rothschild that just called.
[03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:32.960]  Hey, we can help you by creating an effective radio advertising campaign for your company from script writing to producing your commercial just like the one you're listening to right now.

[03:05:58.960 --> 03:06:04.960]  Aging starts at the cellular level. When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:04.960 --> 03:06:16.960]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries. During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[03:06:16.960 --> 03:06:25.960]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:25.960 --> 03:06:38.960]  We now have the synergistic solution. DNA Force, just one of the key compounds. BiopQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.

[03:07:58.960 --> 03:08:06.960]  I'll stand in line for this. There's always room in life for this.
[03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:16.960]  Oh, oh baby, oh baby, then it fell apart, fell apart.
[03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:21.960]  Look at this headline in fallwars.com. One of your calls, final segment in Overdrive Live.
[03:08:21.960 --> 03:08:28.960]  Obama brags about power grab while Americans debate color of a dress.
[03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:34.960]  Americans more concerned about the color of a dress which went viral than they are about internet takeover.
[03:08:34.960 --> 03:08:41.960]  While the Obama administration celebrates its latest power grab, the federal takeover of the internet, the ATF's unlawful ammo ban,
[03:08:41.960 --> 03:08:45.960]  Americans are debating the color of a woman's dress which went viral on social media.
[03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:51.960]  On Thursday, the federal communications commissions voted to declare the internet a public utility which they control.
[03:08:51.960 --> 03:08:56.960]  The government just took it over, folks. That means the corporations that control it did.
[03:08:56.960 --> 03:09:01.960]  Opening the door for the feds to regulate online speech in the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco and Firearms,
[03:09:01.960 --> 03:09:07.960]  outside of law, announced its plan to illegally ban M855 AR-15 ammunition,
[03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:14.960]  and Americans are outraged because they couldn't decide if a dress posted on Tumblr was black and blue
[03:09:14.960 --> 03:09:18.960]  or white and gold. You cannot make this up, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:24.960]  Well, let's just be honest. That's women that are doing that. Not all women, but it's like guys that are obsessed with the NFL.
[03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:28.960]  There's women that are obsessed with the color of a dress.
[03:09:28.960 --> 03:09:33.960]  This is very important, guys. Allison Lynch from Metro wrote,
[03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:38.960]  and you, team blue, black and white team and gold, you need to pick a side.
[03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:48.960]  Kimmy, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift already have, and it became this big viral top story of arguing about a dress color.
[03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:53.960]  Meanwhile, they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and fluoride in the water to brain damage you and your family,
[03:09:53.960 --> 03:09:59.960]  and they write 800-page books called Eco Science Bragging About It.
[03:09:59.960 --> 03:10:04.960]  And then when I warn you and show you the London Independent with a new brand of study saying it's brain damaging you
[03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:10.960]  and causing depression and cancer, their answer yesterday was in one of these globalist websites,
[03:10:10.960 --> 03:10:15.960]  one of these globalists, to attack me.
[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:19.960]  And then, meanwhile, I was just thinking about this during the break, and I'm going to your calls,
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:25.960]  Washington Post, there's already a conspiracy theory brewing over net neutrality.
[03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:29.960]  Why won't they release the rules?
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:35.960]  It's been less than 24 hours, well, not now, since the federal communications voted to approve strict new regulations
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:40.960]  and internet providers, but that's the leading question coming from its critics.
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:45.960]  Conservatives are demanding the FCC release a full copy of the regulations that's planning to impose on companies.
[03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:49.960]  Oh my gosh, how horrible. First, he wouldn't testify to Congress.
[03:10:49.960 --> 03:10:54.960]  Then he said he wouldn't release the rules. It's already printed up in a book. They've had it for months.
[03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:59.960]  They've waved it around on TV with red tape around it, and now they won't release it and still haven't.
[03:10:59.960 --> 03:11:03.960]  As of now, they were just checking. And what did I say yesterday?
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:08.960]  Before they made the announcement, I said watch, they won't release it.
[03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:13.960]  And I got comments in the thing, Alex, this is what people don't like you, you're making stuff.
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:23.960]  I know how the enemy operates, and if there's not a big enough outcry, they'll release it in three weeks, on a Friday night.
[03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:29.960]  You better believe it's bad. You better believe they want all to say how they saved you,
[03:11:29.960 --> 03:11:37.960]  and how it's bipartisan, and how it's great, and how it's wonderful, and how they love you,
[03:11:37.960 --> 03:11:42.960]  and how you're going to get free health care, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:49.960]  I just know how the enemy operates. But as one of the commissioners said, there was never a problem,
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:57.960]  none of this is going on, and now you've passed something to solve a problem that didn't exist and create a problem.
[03:11:57.960 --> 03:12:02.960]  I'm paraphrasing this quote. What was the commissioners' quote? It was better than what I just said.
[03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:07.960]  I'm trying to say it right. Let's try to look that up while I take some calls.
[03:12:07.960 --> 03:12:15.960]  But, oh, but meanwhile, one of the big Obama-supporting sites, Vox says, who are, you know, big supporters of this,
[03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:19.960]  the net neutrality rules might not be available for weeks. That's ridiculous.
[03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:23.960]  But yesterday, it's like conspiracy theorists, we're going to release it.
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:28.960]  Sure, we wouldn't go to Congress. Sure, we kept it secret, which is horrible, but we're going to release it.
[03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:32.960]  And then, oh, come on, it's been less than 24 hours, we're going to release it.
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:39.960]  Now, oh, we're not. And I said it would be weeks, and now they're telling us weeks.
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:45.960]  I have figured this scum out, man. I know I'm too good. And what's frustrating is I'm not that smart, folks.
[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:52.960]  Everybody can figure this out. You're talking about a pack of lying scum.
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:12:56.960]  And again, we know what the FCC is going to do because we know they already tried in the last few years
[03:12:56.960 --> 03:13:01.960]  to say they can regulate cable and speech on cable, and they said they want to regulate speech on the internet
[03:13:01.960 --> 03:13:05.960]  and want to, quote, shut down hate speech. They're coming. They're coming. They're coming for it.
[03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:12.960]  They're coming for it. Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Michael Moore, they've all called for a return to the fairness doctrine.
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:16.960]  And let me explain something. One of my lines of the sand is forced inoculation.
[03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:19.960]  Another's taken me to some kind of secret prison for no reason.
[03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:25.960]  And another one is I'm not going to follow your fairness doctrine on the internet or anywhere else.
[03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:31.960]  It's a load of bull. I got free speech. I don't even need a First Amendment, even though it's there.
[03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:35.960]  I got free speech. Period. God gave it to me. You understand?
[03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:40.960]  And if I say something that isn't true, you consume me. Or if I call for violence, that's illegal.
[03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:45.960]  But my free speech is wide open. And I'm going to use that. Do you understand?
[03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:50.960]  So you go ahead and try to bottle us up, try to kick us off radio stations, try to shut us down.
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:56.960]  It ain't working. People are freaking out right now. They understand it's all happening.
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:04.960]  It's all real. The veil of denial is falling. Praise Jesus and pass the Info Wars ammunition.
[03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:08.960]  Let's talk to Andrew in Canada. You're on the air.
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:10.960]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:12.960]  Hey, go ahead, brother.
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:16.960]  I wanted to talk to you about a few things, but I'll try not to take up all your time here.
[03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:18.960]  You have done well. Just go ahead.
[03:14:18.960 --> 03:14:26.960]  One of them is I have trouble refining my searches to find some of the stuff that you talk about.
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:28.960]  Okay, what do you want to find? I'll tell you how to find it.
[03:14:28.960 --> 03:14:32.960]  The main thing is Oprah Winfrey being involved in eugenics.
[03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:36.960]  My mother is a huge Oprah Winfrey supporter and she doesn't believe it.
[03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:41.960]  I tell you what, I'm going to ask Rob next week to do a special report. That's a great idea.
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:45.960]  He just is so prolific now as the news director. He just reports himself every day now.
[03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:49.960]  Oprah Winfrey involved in eugenics or Oprah Winfrey is in the death cult.
[03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:55.960]  And we will do a whole report for you. Let me give you a prime projection of information.
[03:14:55.960 --> 03:15:03.960]  London Guardian, headline, billionaires meet in secret in New York to discuss overpopulation.
[03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:07.960]  Then you learn the leaked documents of the meeting, a few other statements that they're building,
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:10.960]  an alternative world government to promote world population reduction.
[03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:17.960]  Oprah Winfrey then gives money to a whole bunch of different trusts that are involved in basically sterilization programs in Africa.
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:21.960]  She set up some weird brainwashing New Age church to suck the Africans in.
[03:15:21.960 --> 03:15:25.960]  Oprah Winfrey was also, not just the London Guardian, but ABC News.
[03:15:25.960 --> 03:15:30.960]  Also an ABC News report about how she's a superhero with David Rockefeller.
[03:15:30.960 --> 03:15:36.960]  There it is, billionaires plan to put the world to rights following secret supper.
[03:15:36.960 --> 03:15:40.960]  I guess they changed the headline. There it is, Oprah Winfrey, Ted Turner, Michael Bloomberg,
[03:15:40.960 --> 03:15:44.960]  and all the billionaires. At the end it says to create an alternative world government.
[03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:45.960]  Let's go to the bottom.
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:50.960]  London Guardian, boom. Anything else you'd like to ask about?
[03:15:50.960 --> 03:15:56.960]  Yes, I'd also like to ask, because you talk a lot about spy tech and technology.
[03:15:56.960 --> 03:16:02.960]  Are there any brands of TVs these days that don't have a hidden camera and microphone?
[03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:09.960]  I have not done a review of all of them, but all the new high-end smart TVs and stuff in the new hotels,
[03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:12.960]  everything has cameras and microphones.
[03:16:12.960 --> 03:16:17.960]  A lot of them don't even have it as a function to do video, you know, now they're computer screens.
[03:16:17.960 --> 03:16:20.960]  They're just in there.
[03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:25.960]  Even the cheaper new phones or smart phones and do it,
[03:16:25.960 --> 03:16:28.960]  and basically record everything you do and send it back to the company,
[03:16:28.960 --> 03:16:32.960]  who then sells it to the NSA, because they found the data collection is better,
[03:16:32.960 --> 03:16:35.960]  and then they share the money with them.
[03:16:35.960 --> 03:16:37.960]  But government's about to cut them out of that.
[03:16:37.960 --> 03:16:42.960]  They're setting up their own internet with their own cell towers that they claim is for COG redundancy,
[03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:44.960]  but really it's for a takeover grid.
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:46.960]  We're going to skip this break and go all the way to the bottom of the hour.
[03:16:46.960 --> 03:16:48.960]  Other questions?
[03:16:48.960 --> 03:16:53.960]  I was wondering, can I make a couple of points to you?
[03:16:53.960 --> 03:16:55.960]  Of course you can, my friend.
[03:16:55.960 --> 03:17:02.960]  One would be when you have callers or guests, is there any way to record the volume a little higher?
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:08.960]  Because normally I listen to your show from the podcast because I work shift work,
[03:17:08.960 --> 03:17:10.960]  so I can't always listen to the whole show.
[03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:14.960]  So at least I can pause it when I'm doing something and go back to it.
[03:17:14.960 --> 03:17:17.960]  But a lot of times, because I'm listening through the podcast,
[03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:22.960]  I can't always hear everything the callers or the guests are saying.
[03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:25.960]  What do you mean, the podcast doesn't have good audio?
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:27.960]  It has good audio.
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:34.960]  It's just for some reason the volume level of the callers doesn't seem to be as good as your own.
[03:17:34.960 --> 03:17:38.960]  Yeah, we probably have something to do with some multi-band or some setting.
[03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:42.960]  We need to constantly go through and quality control and check things,
[03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:45.960]  like sometimes with YouTube, because we have multiple layers of audio.
[03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:47.960]  My audio will be lower or higher.
[03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:49.960]  We're trying to get all that tuned up.
[03:17:49.960 --> 03:17:53.960]  If you folks hear problems, hit us with emails, call us like you're doing right now,
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:55.960]  and we'll try to get it fixed, brother.
[03:17:55.960 --> 03:18:00.960]  And I also tried your SuperMail Vitality last year,
[03:18:00.960 --> 03:18:05.960]  and I know you don't have any negative reviews, and I can't really say it's a negative review.
[03:18:05.960 --> 03:18:09.960]  Hey, we want it! If it's a real negative review, you're going to be the first one we've heard.
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:11.960]  Please give us the review.
[03:18:11.960 --> 03:18:15.960]  I didn't take it religiously like I probably should have,
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:19.960]  so I can't say for sure if the results are accurate or not,
[03:18:19.960 --> 03:18:25.960]  but I really didn't notice a change in energy level or anything, so I might have to try it again.
[03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:30.960]  Well, you're the first person we've heard, and some people's physiology is different.
[03:18:30.960 --> 03:18:34.960]  Normal anesthesia doesn't work on me when I've had surgery.
[03:18:34.960 --> 03:18:37.960]  So they have to have specialists come in, and it's the same deal.
[03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:45.960]  I mean, these are known certified, like my lawyer was like, hey, I was checking into your products,
[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:49.960]  and one of my people that works for me, you know, it has a degree in herbs, and they looked at it.
[03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:51.960]  They said, man, these are really good ones.
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:54.960]  I mean, we just go with the top best stuff, because we know we're a target.
[03:18:54.960 --> 03:18:57.960]  We know people are going to test our stuff separately, which they've done.
[03:18:57.960 --> 03:19:01.960]  There's been haters that go, we did a test, and it wasn't perfectly clean,
[03:19:01.960 --> 03:19:04.960]  according to California standards, and they don't even show their test.
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:08.960]  Well, California standards are higher than what there is in the air.
[03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:10.960]  It doesn't exist in some products.
[03:19:10.960 --> 03:19:17.960]  But all of our products, but one, exceed California standards that are the highest,
[03:19:17.960 --> 03:19:22.960]  and because of that, we just removed an ingredient and said, fine, we follow California standards.
[03:19:22.960 --> 03:19:26.960]  But that was just something written and passed by lawyers so they could sue everybody under the sun.
[03:19:26.960 --> 03:19:33.960]  But it's the very best we can bring you, and I'm sad to hear it really didn't do anything for you.
[03:19:33.960 --> 03:19:37.960]  Have you taken the iodine? Did that do anything for you?
[03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:41.960]  I haven't tried the iodine yet, so I don't have a lot of money, and my wife doesn't like me.
[03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:42.960]  No, I understand.
[03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:46.960]  She says your show is making me paranoid.
[03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:51.960]  Well, I mean, they're in the news saying that your smartphone records what you say and sends it to the government.
[03:19:51.960 --> 03:19:52.960]  I mean, does that sound fine?
[03:19:52.960 --> 03:19:56.960]  I mean, who needs Snowden when it's all hiding in plain view?
[03:19:56.960 --> 03:19:57.960]  I hear you.
[03:19:57.960 --> 03:19:59.960]  God bless, you appreciate the call.
[03:19:59.960 --> 03:20:03.960]  I probably have to end this though in about nine minutes, my voice is going off for some reason today.
[03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:07.960]  Bill in Chicago, you say you were watching Joe Biggs and the cops everywhere.
[03:20:07.960 --> 03:20:12.960]  Were you there physically, or were you watching them on Ustream after they were off with me?
[03:20:12.960 --> 03:20:15.960]  No, I rode my bike over there to Homie Square.
[03:20:15.960 --> 03:20:17.960]  I was kind of biased.
[03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:21.960]  Well, great job, brother. What'd you see? What'd you hear?
[03:20:21.960 --> 03:20:27.960]  Well, I went by, I came right up when the lady was harassing them and telling them to walk across the street.
[03:20:27.960 --> 03:20:31.960]  And then all the cops would pull up, roll their windows and point and laugh.
[03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:37.960]  And they all looked like, especially like goons more than the usual Chicago cops.
[03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:41.960]  Well, that's who's involved in this block side of some very goonish fellows.
[03:20:41.960 --> 03:20:44.960]  I've seen some of the write-ups on their commanders and their lieutenants.
[03:20:44.960 --> 03:20:50.960]  And it is a very unsavory group from what I've seen.
[03:20:50.960 --> 03:20:52.960]  Oh, yeah. And I also brought up to Joe.
[03:20:52.960 --> 03:20:59.960]  I wondered if there's any connection to that being the same area where all the open-air heroin markets are in Chicago.
[03:20:59.960 --> 03:21:04.960]  And I know Chicago is where the globalists bring all the heroin into the Midwest.
[03:21:04.960 --> 03:21:08.960]  That is true. That's why those police are so corrupt.
[03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:13.960]  The late great Aaron Russo brought Led Zeppelin to Chicago as he called it the Electric Theater.
[03:21:13.960 --> 03:21:17.960]  And he had it about six months. It was one of the top theaters in the country.
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:22.960]  It was sold out and the police came and basically wanted to be paid off.
[03:21:22.960 --> 03:21:25.960]  And he kind of went along with that.
[03:21:25.960 --> 03:21:28.960]  And then they decided some other big week, we want to just open a theater down the street.
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:32.960]  So they came in, the cops dumped trash on the floor right in front of them,
[03:21:32.960 --> 03:21:36.960]  had the health department come in, and then they were throwing people in a paddy wagon,
[03:21:36.960 --> 03:21:42.960]  beating them, and he walked over to them and he said, come on, man, I'm just an American businessman.
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:48.960]  And the cops threw him in the back and crushed his genitals and said, you know, basically your rights can go straight to, you know, what?
[03:21:48.960 --> 03:21:53.960]  And that's what made him political and start the Constitution Party and do everything he did.
[03:21:53.960 --> 03:21:56.960]  And so that's how Chicago operates.
[03:21:56.960 --> 03:22:03.960]  And, you know, beat him with a billy club and then handcuffed him and then a cop grabbed his genitals and just crushed him and just laughed at him.
[03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:06.960]  You're nobody. This is our country.
[03:22:06.960 --> 03:22:09.960]  Well, you know what? No, it didn't North Korea.
[03:22:09.960 --> 03:22:12.960]  And you guys always go the same way in history.
[03:22:12.960 --> 03:22:16.960]  So they're a disgrace to police officers when they act like this.
[03:22:16.960 --> 03:22:18.960]  But I have a lot of Chicago cops send me good stuff.
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:23.960]  So it's a mix of things, but definitely they want to put scum at the top like Roman manual.
[03:22:23.960 --> 03:22:30.960]  And when you put a big, fat piece of trash like that up at the top, what do you expect?
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:32.960]  It's the mafia city.
[03:22:32.960 --> 03:22:34.960]  Oh, man, you're right, though. You know your stuff.
[03:22:34.960 --> 03:22:38.960]  They bring the schmack right in there, right out of Afghanistan.
[03:22:38.960 --> 03:22:41.960]  In fact, a lot of times they fly in right over the pole.
[03:22:41.960 --> 03:22:45.960]  And that's a quicker route. They just fly right into Chicago. Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:22:45.960 --> 03:22:51.960]  And had, you know, the gangsters lobbied through fake Christian groups to make heroin illegal back in the 30s.
[03:22:51.960 --> 03:22:53.960]  Right after alcohol was made legal, they had to have something else.
[03:22:53.960 --> 03:22:59.960]  They made cocaine and heroin illegal so they could go from, you know, making a small profit on it to just making a huge profits.
[03:22:59.960 --> 03:23:02.960]  They did a great job. Appreciate your call.
[03:23:02.960 --> 03:23:05.960]  And here's the thing. Everybody knows the big banks want the money.
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:07.960]  Everybody knows the government flies in most of the drugs.
[03:23:07.960 --> 03:23:13.960]  Everybody knows this. So why do we put up with any of it?
[03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:17.960]  Kim in Missouri, you're on the air. Go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[03:23:17.960 --> 03:23:25.960]  Yeah, hi. I just wanted to point out a few facts real quick and also my opinion on where our government's going.
[03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:27.960]  Sure. You're on the air. We don't screen your calls.
[03:23:27.960 --> 03:23:31.960]  Yeah. One, I'm a disabled veteran. My husband's active duty.
[03:23:31.960 --> 03:23:34.960]  So you're both terrorists, according to Obama. Okay.
[03:23:34.960 --> 03:23:35.960]  Yeah.
[03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:38.960]  This is terrorist, the number one threat. Okay, we're talking about the number one threat right now. Go ahead. Sorry.
[03:23:38.960 --> 03:23:41.960]  Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
[03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:46.960]  They forced my husband to get these vaccines. He came home, got the whole family sick.
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:48.960]  The whole family.
[03:23:48.960 --> 03:23:53.960]  Yep. They just had a Navy report come out finding that they don't want to vaccinate because it makes the whole ship sick.
[03:23:53.960 --> 03:23:57.960]  But, you know, who cares about the Navy, you know, saying that the vaccines don't work?
[03:23:57.960 --> 03:24:00.960]  Well, they do work. They make everybody sick.
[03:24:00.960 --> 03:24:02.960]  Yeah. They make everybody sick. Exactly.
[03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:08.960]  Another point I wanted to bring across is that our constitutional rights are being trampled all over.
[03:24:08.960 --> 03:24:21.960]  I mean, there's almost no reason for us as American citizens, we the people, individuals, to hold up our flag because the president's nice enough to smash on everything we've got.
[03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:26.960]  And honestly, I think that he's purposely doing it so that our whole country can come down.
[03:24:26.960 --> 03:24:31.960]  That's right. And the Republicans, this just out from AP,
[03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:34.960]  the Republicans leave Obamacare untouched.
[03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:41.960]  Obama will get exactly what he wants, total legalization, bring in their families, give them all the freebies to drive down wages and bankrupt the country.
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:45.960]  And again, we don't blame the poor immigrants, but it doesn't matter. No one else does this.
[03:24:45.960 --> 03:24:47.960]  This has been to bring the country down.
[03:24:47.960 --> 03:24:55.960]  Congress closed in Friday on approving a short-term spending bill for the Homeland Security Department that would avert a partial agency shutdown hours before it was to begin.
[03:24:55.960 --> 03:25:01.960]  The legislation also leaves intact Obama administration's executive action on immigration that Republicans have vowed to overturn.
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:08.960]  But Republicans instead, that passing a short-term bill, preserve their ability to keep fighting them.
[03:25:08.960 --> 03:25:13.960]  This man that's not even a U.S. citizen should be impeached.
[03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:20.960]  We should run the hell out. And if his congressmen don't like it, they should get the hell out still. We need our country.
[03:25:20.960 --> 03:25:28.960]  Now, I hear you, ma'am, just keep angry, call and talk radio, call Congress, wake friends and family up, print off news articles from infowars.com.
[03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:33.960]  Just get aggressive, speak out, expose the tyranny, expose what's happening. God bless you.
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:37.960]  And pray for God to protect this nation and bring these people to justice.
[03:25:37.960 --> 03:25:41.960]  But first, we've got to repent and say, God, we're sorry for the abortions.
[03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:45.960]  And if you've had an abortion, I'm not saying you're a bad person. You didn't know you were lied to.
[03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:52.960]  Just repent and God's ready to forgive you. But if you won't admit it was wrong, we don't have a snowball chances in hell.
[03:25:52.960 --> 03:25:58.960]  And we don't protect the babies, folks. None of us are safe. Just like we don't protect due process, none of us are safe.
[03:25:58.960 --> 03:26:10.960]  I mean, America was different because we had the due process. Everywhere else goes to hell in a handbasket because they get rid of it.
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:18.960]  Venezuela's military can now legally use firearms against demonstrators. That's a communist country collapsing.
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:23.960]  In the Patriot Act, they've got stuff about disrupting political organizations and taking them over.
[03:26:23.960 --> 03:26:30.960]  And Canada's about to pass something similar. I mean, we're going down a rat hole here because something big and bad is going to happen.
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:37.960]  They want us clamped down when they implode the economy, folks. Well, don't let them clamp down. They won't implode the economy.
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:42.960]  Joel in Georgia. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:46.960]  I'll take off speakerphone. Sure. Yes. This is Joel. Can you hear me now?
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:55.960]  Loud and clear. Over. This is Houston talking to NORAD Command Base Delta from Mars Base Lunar. You're on the air.
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:27:05.960]  Excellent. My name is Joel. I'm from Atlanta, Georgia. And I'd like to challenge all of the listeners to do what I do.
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:11.960]  I create my own website and I make a hobby out of exposing government corruption.
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:16.960]  I get out every day, post flyers on bathrooms, stalls, urinals.
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:22.960]  That's what I do. Isn't it fun? Isn't it fun? Isn't it fun to fight the enemy?
[03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:34.960]  It is so fun. And I have a website that I publish, AmericanPatriotNews.info, in which I dedicate 100% to InfoWars.com.
[03:27:34.960 --> 03:27:38.960]  Well, you're awesome, brother. But I mean, tell us your website again.
[03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:42.960]  AmericanPatriotNews.info. God bless you.
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:47.960]  And check out. This is my website. I made my flyer that I put on mailboxes.
[03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:52.960]  And I cover about 200 to 500 a week in weather permitting.
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:28:00.960]  It says Obama's real father exposed gun control equals democide murder by government.
[03:28:00.960 --> 03:28:04.960]  The fluids of hoax are all vaccines or poison.
[03:28:04.960 --> 03:28:07.960]  Is America in danger of God's judgment?
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:12.960]  Help us fight the new world order. Become a patriot and join the resistance.
[03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:19.960]  Visit us at AmericanPatriotNews.info, where you get real news, not big media propaganda.
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:26.960]  All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent, Thomas Jefferson.
[03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:34.960]  And I get at least about 70 to 80% hit rate of all the flyers I put out.
[03:28:34.960 --> 03:28:38.960]  By the way, let me stop you right there. The enemy acts like it's bad for us to make money.
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:42.960]  That's energy. The global is printed up out of nothing. We've got to fight to get it.
[03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:47.960]  That's why it's good for patriots to make money. Let me guess, I bet you've got some advertising.
[03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:52.960]  And so you get a little bit of money back at the same time for doing all this hard work waking people up.
[03:28:52.960 --> 03:28:55.960]  That's a win-win. Do you have advertising on your site?
[03:28:55.960 --> 03:28:57.960]  Mostly for you.
[03:28:57.960 --> 03:29:03.960]  Well, listen, I suggest you use the enemy's own system and put Google Ads on there or something
[03:29:03.960 --> 03:29:06.960]  and make some money because you deserve to make money to pay for your paper
[03:29:06.960 --> 03:29:11.960]  and to be able to get some goods and services. So that's great. God bless you. So exciting, man.
[03:29:11.960 --> 03:29:14.960]  That is so wonderful, Joel. Thank you for calling and getting through.
[03:29:14.960 --> 03:29:20.960]  I'm sorry to slim and sandy. I'm out of time. I throat shot. Had a root canal, so I got to punch out.
[03:29:20.960 --> 03:29:25.960]  Lord willing, nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:29:25.960 --> 03:29:28.960]  And then Lord willing, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:29:28.960 --> 03:29:32.960]  Just bit my tongue again. Sorry. My tongue's swollen. My mouth's swollen.
[03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:38.960]  I'll be back this Sunday. Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:29:38.960 --> 03:29:43.960]  I love freedom. I want freedom. I know you do as well. These slave masters aren't going to win.
[03:29:43.960 --> 03:29:50.960]  We're going to prevail with God's help. God bless you all.
