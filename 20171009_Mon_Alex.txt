[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  Better turn me loose. Better set me free.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide here for the next four hours as we are every week.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  At 11am to 3pm central, then the war room is coming up.
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  No one's trodder when this transmission ends for another three hours of live television slash radio broadcast.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  Okay, let's get right into it.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  I'd love to get into Weinstein and the ongoing collapse of Hollywood and the mainstream media combine, and I will.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  And I'd like to get into the NFL, having to back down from Trump and Pence and how this is another big defeat for them, and I will get into that.
[01:08.000 --> 01:17.000]  But I've just got a really serious gut feeling every day and it's beginning stronger and stronger.
[01:17.000 --> 01:27.000]  And that's because North Korea is threatening to test an above-ground hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean and is threatening to fire missiles at Guam again.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  And Trump has said that if they do that, we're going to strike North Korea.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  Now, a lot of people say, well, that's warmongering.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  CNN spends it and goes, Trump wants to have war with North Korea, which isn't really true.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  And he claims he was against the Iraq war, but that's not true.
[01:43.000 --> 01:54.000]  Now, we found the clips on Fox and on CNN during the campaign of two weeks before the invasion got launched saying it's a bad idea.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  I've played those.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  I'm not even going to dig them back up and play them again.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  It's just everything's a lie, but that's a little side factoid.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  Excuse me.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  The issue here is it's bad for us to go to war preemptively, and I don't want to.
[02:08.000 --> 02:09.000]  And I have four children.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  On the other side of the equation, North Korea is out of control.
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  So I see where Ron Paul and others say, hey, we don't want to escalate this with North Korea.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  I agree with Rex Tillerson as well.
[02:23.000 --> 02:33.000]  The problem is we've been appeasing, appeasing, appeasing, and North Korea is completely out of control, threatening to nuke South Korea, Japan, you name it, preemptively, and the U.S.
[02:33.000 --> 02:43.000]  You can't say we'll nuke you preemptively and we've got missiles aimed at you and we may just go ahead and blow you up and have the spokesperson at the U.N.
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.000]  Two weeks ago say we will preemptively destroy you with missiles prepared to die.
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  That's like if I take a gun pointed at you and say I'm going to pull this trigger any minute, then it's not preemptive.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  If we strike them and I don't want that to happen.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  I'm simply saying we're not in control of the entire equation.
[03:04.000 --> 03:13.000]  Kim Jong-un and his cohorts are a bunch of megalomaniacs on insane power trips.
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  Donald Trump would struggle not to fire back at North Korea is the headlines we've got today.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  And I'm going to be going over some of those.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Will North Korea test an H-bomb today?
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  Experts fear Kim Jong-un's shitty-busting nuclear weapon could be detonated within hours.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  Senator Corker, who's now resigning, says Trump is steering U.S. towards World War III.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  He concerns me.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  Well, Corker, if you can read exclusively at infowars.com, is set to be indicted.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  And it's under criminal investigation. It's been going on for four years.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  Previous to even Trump getting in, Corker's begged to be in the administration to get protection.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  He's begged. Now, he knows he's about to be indicted.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  That's why he is a Mueller mouth.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  Whatever you hear out of Corker is written by Mueller.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  He is now, just like they admit, Chuck E. Schumer is the mouth daily of Jimmy Kimmel.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  So when you hear Jimmy Kimmel, that's Chuck Schumer.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  Instead of a teleprompter, it's a puppet prompter.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  It's a meat puppet marionette.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  And that's what Corker is.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  When you hear Corker, that's the mouth of Mueller.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  The mouth of Mueller.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  He's a avatar of Mueller, I guess, who's our president.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  The Democrats should say he's God. He's the president.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  And he's getting imminent indictments ready as well.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  But if Corker behaves himself, the indictment might not come.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  So behave yourself, Corker.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  We'll be back with all the news.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  This is the Info War.
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America,
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  You're a white man! You're a white man!
[05:09.000 --> 05:18.000]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Info War's live broadcasting.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m. central at infowars.com.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  And this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on,
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  Will he be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls?
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[05:49.000 --> 06:09.000]  This is The War Room.
[06:09.000 --> 06:26.000]  The rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  Monday, October 9th, 2017.
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday worldwide transmission.
[06:38.000 --> 06:46.000]  The websites are newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, and infowars.com.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  And more and more, it's vital that everyone remember that those are still our sites
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  and where you go to get the news and information,
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  because Facebook, YouTube, Twitter are just massively, nakedly,
[07:02.000 --> 07:10.000]  in super hardcore, brazen fashion, censoring mainline YouTube, Facebook,
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  and Twitter videos that are viral.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  And that's because YouTube and Facebook admit they're coming out with their own
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  video production like Netflix.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  There's going to be no more you in YouTube.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  That's official. They've told shareholders.
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  But they don't want to, you know, just let all the fans know that's the case.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  So they're doing it on the back of fighting racism, fighting extremism, you name it.
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  The mainline sites that aren't even political, but that are popular on YouTube
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  and other channels are being demonetized and now blocked.
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  And the reason I'm leading the broadcast with this today is because it's so naked.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  Mark Dice has millions of viewers a week on his YouTube channel.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  Good friend of ours, friend of the show, Smartfella, follows all their rules.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  He showed all the black on white crime just to expose how the media is covering it up
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  and the different attacks on churches and things.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  And now it's directly connected to Antifa and CNN and others that are promoting violence.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  And it was done to expose violence.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  The video was deleted and they said he does another one like it.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  He'll be kicked off YouTube permanently, which they've done twice before,
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  deleting his channels back when they had hundreds of thousands of subscribers.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  His main channel has over a million subscribers now.
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  So he put out a video very calmly, very professionally.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  That's why they did it because it is professional, it's effective.
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  He's got a degree in media, RTF.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  He's been around for a decade plus.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  He's a best-selling author and he doesn't have standing though.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  So they said, we're deleting your video.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  One more, you are disappeared.
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  And people will argue, well, it's their channel.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  They said that they are a utility.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  They said they're there for the public.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.000]  They're a digital soapbox.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  The you and YouTube built them.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  They set up a monetary system to get the audience.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  And now they're cheating it.
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  And now they're manipulating it to basically turn it into nothing but a cable network
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  like Time Warner was, now Spectrum.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  So you go ahead and go the direction of Time Warner at YouTube, Google.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  You will destroy yourself.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  But Facebook's doing the same thing.
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  Twitter's doing the same thing.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  When a video is calm and professional and unifying, they take it down.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  In fact, in the video we're going to play coming up later in the hour.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  Mark Dice points out that the main videos they're deleting are eloquent,
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  well-spoken, loving black people who are speaking out against the degradation
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  of big city liberal corruption like Chicago.
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  If you are a well-spoken, friendly, nice black person
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  and you go on video and you talk about what's really hurting your community
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  and our communities, you are gone.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  That is the number one voice they don't want heard
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  because the Democrats and Google have all given the black lives matter
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  because they want to keep the black community radicalized,
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  divided from everybody else, vengeful, chips on their shoulders, dependent
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  in Section 8 housing.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  They think they own you as a voting block
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  and they know you're struggling to get free and they are PO'd big time.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  They're a great society since the 60s has had you in a stranglehold
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  and it's destroyed your community and they don't want that information out.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  They don't want the crime statistics out.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  I'm going to go over.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  Seven statistics you need to know about black on white crime.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  On average, it's 7 to 10.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  In some areas, it's 40 to 1 like Chicago, black against white.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  That's still a minority of black folks doing that, but it makes up a large part of the crime
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  and, of course, they kill each other as well in those communities.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  It's horrible.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  And it's a gangster culture sold by MTV, pushed out there.
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  It is a militarized situation and the very people now censoring the information coming out
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  are the very ones that control and feed off these populations.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  And it's totally cold-blooded.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  It's organized, it's focused, and it is completely arrogant and transparent.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  So that's all coming up later in the hour.
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  Now, that said, we've got some really big developments on the Vegas front.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  We're going to be getting into clearly a cover-up.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  We just don't know the exact specifics,
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  but we know it's cover-ups of Islamic connections, Islamic trips, anti-for-material.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  We now know he did go to the Middle East, not just his common-law wife.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  We know he bragged about it to other girlfriends.
[11:43.000 --> 11:51.000]  Exactly what the hostage rescue team member told me last Monday was that there's anti-for-material paraphernalia,
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  trips to the Middle East, photos of the Middle East, and that the media is covering that up,
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  and that he had more than, obviously, one accomplice.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  The sheriff's departments now come out and said that, more than one accomplice,
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.000]  but they've been going along in other respects with the cover-up.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  Now, continuing, we're going to be getting into all of that.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  The Democratic Party is really, really upset right now.
[12:16.000 --> 12:24.000]  They're hopping mad because the Dow Jones industrial average just keeps going up and up and up
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  as Trump pushes to cut taxes and has already cut regulations.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  That's why the Fed is announcing what a fifth rate increase at the end of the month to try to stymie the bullish economy,
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  try to bring the bear in.
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  The public understands one of the few ways they can vote now is supporting Trump and the economy financially,
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  and so this is a true money war.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  Bigger than an information war, it's folks putting their money where their mouths are,
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  and the globalists have been pulling their money out, Warren Buffett and others,
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  trying to actually plunge it so they can buy it a bit more, but that's not been happening,
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  and the new jobs are coming in and the growth rates are coming in and the factory orders are going up,
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  and it's just really, really upset in the globalists right now.
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  Trump's insane Dow Jones rally just keeps going.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  Oh, my gosh.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  Federal government jobs are down 13,000.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Trump's fired 13,000 federal employees.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  It needs to be a lot more than that.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  We've also got reports here about private sector jobs being way up,
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  and then when we come back from break, I'm going to get into shock poll, NFL,
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  now least like sport, core fans down 31%,
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  they're down an additional 20% in the three years previous to that.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  We're talking about a 51% drop in viewership and support.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  That is gorgeous.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  We're going to teach you Hollywood scum how we're going to break your political neck.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  You like it because it already happened.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  So crawl over and you're rat hole and die, and only your uncool fans will keep watching,
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  and everybody will know those are the nerds, those are the schmucks, those are the suckers.
[14:05.000 --> 14:13.000]  To watch the NFL's broken back, and to watch what's left of the NFL trying to crawl into a wood chipper is beautiful.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  You just keep doing it.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  You narcissistic evil scum.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  You anti-American Hollywood filth.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  You just keep feeding yourself right into that meat grinder.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  You're so stupid, and you never interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[14:28.000 --> 14:35.000]  That bread and circus is whorehouse, where men sit around and leave their families while their kids smoke crack and party,
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  you know, become vegetables and play video games all day while daddy was buddies,
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  whereas a jersey of another man's number, and they all slap each other on the rear ends,
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  and an arrest development exercise of idiocy.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  It's a gorgeous thing to watch it circle the abyss.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  So good, so enjoyable.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  Owen Weinstein, to watch them fire him, and the rats leave the sinking ship,
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.000]  and Meryl Streep, that talks about how she loves Roman Polanski,
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.000]  the convicted pedophile that grabbed the 13-year-old girl, brutally raped her, anally.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  She stood for him as a standing ovation a few years ago, during the Oscars,
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  and said he should be brought back and everything, and how much she loves him.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  Well, now she said she hates Weinstein.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  See, they were so arrogant before that she would stand up and support a pedophile,
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  but now she called Weinstein a god.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  Now she's deserting.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  It's just so good.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  This all heralds.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  If you look at all the different, the money plunging in the NFL, mainstream media,
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  newspapers dying, Hollywood dying, it's gorgeous.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  It's beautiful.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  Our enemies are absolutely imploding.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  We're presiding over their political, cultural, and spiritual death.
[15:52.000 --> 16:21.000]  Praise our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

[16:58.280 --> 17:00.240]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[17:00.240 --> 17:01.520]  It took you over a year to do it.
[17:01.520 --> 17:02.720]  Why is this so good?
[17:02.720 --> 17:05.620]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[17:05.620 --> 17:08.040]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[17:08.040 --> 17:11.620]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food
[17:11.620 --> 17:13.280]  and water and beverages in my system,
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.200]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[17:17.200 --> 17:19.800]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[17:19.800 --> 17:21.540]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[17:21.540 --> 17:25.360]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[17:25.360 --> 17:27.920]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[17:27.920 --> 17:29.240]  These are all parasites.
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.360]  Tell us about all the stuff I said.
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.680]  There's so many things that are in it.
[17:31.680 --> 17:32.920]  You have the neem in there.
[17:32.920 --> 17:36.120]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[17:36.120 --> 17:38.280]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
[17:38.280 --> 17:39.440]  at least twice a year.
[17:39.440 --> 17:41.120]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[17:41.120 --> 17:42.520]  because I'm going back on it today.
[17:42.520 --> 17:43.520]  I just came back in yesterday,
[17:43.520 --> 17:45.440]  Living Defense, infowarslives.com.
[17:45.440 --> 17:47.240]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff
[17:47.240 --> 17:49.040]  that's great for your body, period.
[17:49.040 --> 17:52.400]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslives.com.
[17:52.400 --> 17:54.680]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[17:54.680 --> 17:55.880]  Thank you so much for all your work,
[17:55.880 --> 17:57.280]  sir, on this great product.
[17:59.040 --> 18:02.440]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food
[18:02.440 --> 18:05.760]  for up to 25 years and still maintain
[18:05.760 --> 18:07.760]  its nutrition and flavor?
[18:07.760 --> 18:08.600]  That's right.
[18:08.600 --> 18:11.280]  Now's the time to build your own food storage
[18:11.280 --> 18:13.560]  with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.

[18:15.840 --> 18:18.880]  and check out this innovative and smart technology
[18:18.880 --> 18:20.240]  that's easy to use.
[18:20.240 --> 18:21.080]  And let me tell you something,
[18:21.080 --> 18:24.080]  it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables,
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.880]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[18:27.880 --> 18:29.080]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[18:29.080 --> 18:32.280]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation,
[18:32.280 --> 18:34.080]  like canning or dehydrating,
[18:34.080 --> 18:35.920]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[18:35.920 --> 18:37.800]  there is no comparison.
[18:37.800 --> 18:41.040]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97%
[18:41.040 --> 18:44.080]  of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[18:44.080 --> 18:47.440]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:47.440 --> 18:50.880]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[18:50.880 --> 18:53.080]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best,
[18:53.080 --> 18:54.960]  most affordable freeze dryer.
[18:54.960 --> 18:56.040]  So what are you waiting for?
[18:56.040 --> 18:58.880]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[19:00.240 --> 19:01.800]  Thousands of years ago,
[19:01.800 --> 19:03.960]  there was a basic form of chivalry.
[19:03.960 --> 19:06.760]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[19:06.760 --> 19:09.000]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.720]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[19:11.720 --> 19:14.760]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces
[19:14.760 --> 19:17.240]  were approaching filled with bombs,
[19:17.240 --> 19:20.360]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[19:20.360 --> 19:22.200]  But in the 21st century,
[19:22.200 --> 19:24.720]  there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[19:24.720 --> 19:27.240]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[19:27.240 --> 19:30.360]  to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[19:30.360 --> 19:31.840]  turn off our hormones,
[19:31.840 --> 19:34.520]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[19:34.520 --> 19:36.680]  I personally counter this onslaught
[19:36.680 --> 19:40.000]  with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.240]  with known organic concentrated herbs
[19:43.240 --> 19:46.000]  to create the basic foundation
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.200]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[19:49.200 --> 19:52.040]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[19:52.040 --> 19:55.160]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[19:55.160 --> 19:58.520]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[19:58.520 --> 20:04.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:04.520 --> 20:09.520]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[20:09.520 --> 20:12.520]  Live from the infowars.com studios,
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.520]  you can find more information about him
[20:14.520 --> 20:17.520]  on our website at infowarslife.com.
[20:17.520 --> 20:37.520]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[20:37.520 --> 20:41.520]  So, Hollywood is like a person that wants to commit suicide
[20:41.520 --> 20:45.520]  because they're so measurable, decadent, and unhappy.
[20:45.520 --> 20:47.520]  The pedophilia isn't enough for them.
[20:47.520 --> 20:49.520]  The devil worship isn't enough for them.
[20:49.520 --> 20:54.520]  The two or three women a day isn't enough for them.
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.520]  No, they want to screw over middle America.
[20:56.520 --> 20:58.520]  They want to go after Christians.
[20:58.520 --> 21:03.520]  They want to sow racial discord and discord between the sexes.
[21:03.520 --> 21:05.520]  That's what they do.
[21:05.520 --> 21:08.520]  Mr. Weinstein was the main funder.
[21:08.520 --> 21:10.520]  We're going to get into that in a moment
[21:10.520 --> 21:13.520]  of creatures like Michael Moore.
[21:13.520 --> 21:16.520]  Let's just look at what Hollywood, the controls California,
[21:16.520 --> 21:24.520]  and Sacramento is also raining down on everyone.
[21:24.520 --> 21:26.520]  This is from the LA Times.
[21:26.520 --> 21:28.520]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday
[21:28.520 --> 21:31.520]  that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor
[21:31.520 --> 21:34.520]  the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner
[21:34.520 --> 21:38.520]  to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[21:38.520 --> 21:41.520]  It's the equivalent of a $50 parking ticket.
[21:41.520 --> 21:44.520]  The measure also applies to those who give blood
[21:44.520 --> 21:51.520]  without telling the blood bank that they are HIV positive.
[21:51.520 --> 21:54.520]  Isn't that just cute?
[21:54.520 --> 21:57.520]  And they said, this disease is not a stigma.
[21:57.520 --> 22:02.520]  Yes, someone isn't bad because they have HIV or AIDS,
[22:02.520 --> 22:06.520]  but it's bad to go donate blood and not tell them
[22:06.520 --> 22:07.520]  or to give it to someone.
[22:07.520 --> 22:11.520]  It's flat out attempted murder,
[22:11.520 --> 22:17.520]  and it is murder if you're successful.
[22:17.520 --> 22:20.520]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen,
[22:20.520 --> 22:23.520]  to give somebody an autoimmune disease that can kill you
[22:23.520 --> 22:25.520]  and has killed millions of people in this country,
[22:25.520 --> 22:28.520]  and the numbers have finally gone down with it,
[22:28.520 --> 22:35.520]  and you're going to watch HIV infections explode in California.
[22:35.520 --> 22:37.520]  There's a lot of other diseases now,
[22:37.520 --> 22:39.520]  our venereal diseases are off the charts,
[22:39.520 --> 22:41.520]  and they'll be, oh, we need free healthcare.
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.520]  That's why we have this.
[22:43.520 --> 22:46.520]  And then I've got all these stacks of articles of gays
[22:46.520 --> 22:49.520]  cutting holes in condoms to give it to somebody.
[22:49.520 --> 22:54.520]  It's called gift giving, and then gift receiving,
[22:54.520 --> 22:57.520]  and the practice is called bug chasing.
[22:57.520 --> 23:03.520]  But what this is is bug murder, bug forcing, bug raping.
[23:03.520 --> 23:05.520]  I mean, it's bad enough to rape somebody.
[23:05.520 --> 23:08.520]  Now you're going to rape them with a virus.
[23:08.520 --> 23:12.520]  This is HIV rape.
[23:12.520 --> 23:14.520]  And I guess in the precedent of this,
[23:14.520 --> 23:17.520]  I guess it's okay to give somebody hepatitis and not tell them.
[23:17.520 --> 23:20.520]  Meanwhile, there were a couple cases in Florida,
[23:20.520 --> 23:22.520]  another one in Texas, another one in New York.
[23:22.520 --> 23:25.520]  I saw just this year where gays were cutting holes in condoms
[23:25.520 --> 23:28.520]  to give it to people, a form of attempted serial killing,
[23:28.520 --> 23:30.520]  and they were able to give it to people.
[23:30.520 --> 23:32.520]  So once they die, down the road if they die,
[23:32.520 --> 23:37.520]  it's serial murder.
[23:37.520 --> 23:43.520]  But see, some of these folks are so unhappy, so worldly,
[23:43.520 --> 23:49.520]  so lost that they want to then go out and spread the misery.
[23:49.520 --> 23:51.520]  Just like mass shooters don't want to just die.
[23:51.520 --> 23:56.520]  They want suicide by cop, and maybe take a few cops out with them.
[23:56.520 --> 23:59.520]  So when you're hearing about little Weinstein and all the corruption,
[23:59.520 --> 24:04.520]  what about the Clintons and the Factor 8 scandal where over a decade they knew
[24:04.520 --> 24:09.520]  that all the blood coming out of the prisons had HIV and hepatitis in it
[24:09.520 --> 24:15.520]  and were certifying it as good and having it put in to the Factor 8 drug of Bayer,
[24:15.520 --> 24:21.520]  knowing that the virus and all the rest of it was transmittable
[24:21.520 --> 24:28.520]  and that it killed, conservatively, over 100,000 hemophiliacs alone.
[24:28.520 --> 24:33.520]  And it came out Bayer knew that's who these monsters are.
[24:33.520 --> 24:36.520]  Hillary liked to represent pedophiles.
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.520]  Look it up.
[24:37.520 --> 24:45.520]  Hillary liked to represent monsters, serial killers, horrible people.
[24:45.520 --> 24:46.520]  You understand?
[24:46.520 --> 24:49.520]  I put CBS News up there bare admitting that they did that.
[24:49.520 --> 24:55.520]  So you want to know who these folks are, ladies and gentlemen, they're murderers.
[24:55.520 --> 24:58.520]  And if they can pass a law and couch it in political correctness,
[24:58.520 --> 25:05.520]  that you can go give blood when you've got diseases or give it to people unknowing.
[25:05.520 --> 25:08.520]  I mean, why can't you just walk up to your boyfriend and shoot him in the head
[25:08.520 --> 25:15.520]  or your girlfriend if you've got HIV?
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.520]  I mean, can you just unknowingly shoot somebody in the head too
[25:19.520 --> 25:21.520]  or unknowingly hit him in the head with a hammer?
[25:21.520 --> 25:22.520]  Because that's where we're at.
[25:22.520 --> 25:26.520]  But see, oh, we let teachers teach your five-year-olds about masturbation
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.520]  and teach your five-year-olds about sex even when parents don't do that.
[25:30.520 --> 25:31.520]  It's not pedophilia.
[25:31.520 --> 25:34.520]  It's not sexualization of children.
[25:34.520 --> 25:37.520]  It's the state teaching tolerance.
[25:37.520 --> 25:39.520]  And you know, we're going to be tolerant.
[25:39.520 --> 25:42.520]  We don't like the stigma of HIV age.
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.520]  So we're just going to let people spread it.
[25:45.520 --> 25:46.520]  Okay?
[25:46.520 --> 25:47.520]  It's no big deal.
[25:47.520 --> 25:49.520]  Not a problem.
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.520]  And if you just tuned in and think this is the onion or something, it's not.
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.520]  I just read to you from the Los Angeles Times.
[25:57.520 --> 26:04.520]  I first read about bug chasing in the San Francisco Chronicle
[26:04.520 --> 26:07.520]  and other publications more than, it should have been like 20 years ago.
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.520]  And when I read it on air then, people didn't believe that I was reading real articles.
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.520]  Now it's well known and there's even news articles defending it going,
[26:17.520 --> 26:19.520]  oh, you should understand how chic it is.
[26:19.520 --> 26:22.520]  Just like the practice in the U.K. and the U.S. in some liberal cities
[26:22.520 --> 26:27.520]  where you can pay for someone to be blinded by psychologist or psychiatrist
[26:27.520 --> 26:30.520]  because they feel they identify as a blind person.
[26:30.520 --> 26:35.520]  And then the city and the county pays for taking care of them now that they're blind.
[26:35.520 --> 26:44.520]  And then there's video of them pouring the bleach, the drain-o, on their eyes, doctors.
[26:44.520 --> 26:46.520]  And then you're blind.
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.520]  And they just go on the TV shows, they go, oh, it's so gorgeous, she has such courage.
[26:50.520 --> 26:55.520]  And she's a completely mentally ill person, the type that would stick her hand in a garbage disposal.
[26:55.520 --> 26:59.520]  You know, when you want to gouge your eyeballs out, you're a lunatic.
[26:59.520 --> 27:02.520]  They used to put you in padded rooms so you wouldn't do it.
[27:02.520 --> 27:04.520]  But now it's so brave.
[27:04.520 --> 27:08.520]  Oh, look, she's so brave, she's blind.
[27:08.520 --> 27:10.520]  And we pay for it.
[27:10.520 --> 27:14.520]  Oh, let's teach the five-year-olds, you're not really a girl, you're a boy.
[27:14.520 --> 27:16.520]  Let's go get you an artificial.
[27:16.520 --> 27:24.520]  Oh, and radio stations are like, Alex, don't say it, violates FCC, but you can teach five-year-olds.
[27:24.520 --> 27:27.520]  So I won't say it, but we know what they do.
[27:27.520 --> 27:34.520]  Teach five-year-olds that you need to have your body parts cut off and don't criticize it or you're abusing children.
[27:34.520 --> 27:40.520]  No, teaching kids they want to cut their genitals off and prepare them to the Tavistock Institute
[27:40.520 --> 27:46.520]  to line them up by age seven to have the genitals removed even before the age of consent is beyond abuse.
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.520]  It's like something out of a satanic nightmare, but it's all done with the state.
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.520]  And it's all done lovingly.
[27:53.520 --> 27:55.520]  Just we're doing this.
[27:55.520 --> 27:59.520]  They even admit every time we give the premies their vaccines, a lot of them die.
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.520]  Should we get the respirators ready and try to keep them alive?
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.520]  But it's policy to protect them from these diseases.
[28:07.520 --> 28:14.520]  And you're just like, wow, if a lone nurse was killing people in the hospital, it'd be a huge national scandal.
[28:14.520 --> 28:20.520]  But if it's done with the bioethics board, now ladies, gentlemen, get the respirators ready.
[28:20.520 --> 28:24.520]  Prepare injections.
[28:24.520 --> 28:27.520]  And they enjoy it.
[28:27.520 --> 28:33.520]  And they enjoy watching the nurses who don't like it follow the death cult orders.
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.520]  Let's see if we can let them put HIV in the blood.
[28:37.520 --> 28:41.520]  It worked so well and we got away with what we did in Arkansas.
[28:41.520 --> 28:43.520]  We only killed 100,000 or so there.
[28:43.520 --> 28:51.520]  Let's just have everyone go give blood so we can ship the blood all over the country and all over the world and kill millions.
[28:51.520 --> 28:57.520]  And if you don't like it, you're not liberal.

[32:01.520 --> 32:03.520]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[32:03.520 --> 32:06.520]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[32:06.520 --> 32:12.520]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[32:12.520 --> 32:21.520]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.

[32:38.520 --> 32:42.520]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[32:42.520 --> 32:46.520]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[32:46.520 --> 32:52.520]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[32:52.520 --> 32:58.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[33:22.520 --> 33:26.520]  And it's Alex Jones.
[33:46.520 --> 33:48.520]  We are back live.
[33:48.520 --> 33:51.520]  Let me finish up with what I was covering earlier.
[33:51.520 --> 34:00.520]  California is announcing that it's going to tank the blood supply and let people knowingly give HIV hepatitis infected blood.
[34:00.520 --> 34:05.520]  And then it can then be shipped all over the country to other blood banks.
[34:05.520 --> 34:08.520]  And again, the LA Times reports point blank.
[34:08.520 --> 34:18.520]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor parking ticket, the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[34:18.520 --> 34:25.520]  The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling the blood bank they are HIV positive.
[34:25.520 --> 34:32.520]  And what happened is you had all this unhealthy, multiple sexual partner, no condom stuff going on.
[34:32.520 --> 34:36.520]  It spread, people got really sick, heterosexual, homosexual, you name it.
[34:36.520 --> 34:41.520]  But to defend all those lifestyles, the media made it like, oh, it's a crime to have it.
[34:41.520 --> 34:47.520]  Well, when somebody's got drug resistant TB that'll kill you, it's a crime to have it and expose people.
[34:47.520 --> 34:50.520]  Yeah, it's not a crime that you're, quote, gay.
[34:50.520 --> 34:56.520]  It's a crime that if you spread this knowingly to someone, you've just killed them.
[34:56.520 --> 34:58.520]  Understand?
[34:58.520 --> 35:01.520]  But that's how they spin this whole thing.
[35:01.520 --> 35:12.520]  And it really goes to show us how crazy Hollywood and the California elite have gotten because they're in the news saying this will help get rid of the stigma.
[35:12.520 --> 35:20.520]  Well, if the stigma of having an autoimmune disease and getting a bunch of cancers and then shriveling up and dying,
[35:20.520 --> 35:24.520]  it'll get rid of the stigma to have a huge new outbreak.
[35:24.520 --> 35:33.520]  It'll be loving to the people that aren't told and given something that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and will probably kill them.
[35:33.520 --> 35:40.520]  And shorten their life by 20, 30 years, that's a nice thing.
[35:40.520 --> 35:49.520]  You're basically saying people have a right to go around and spread disease and then you spin it like there's some moral high ground to that.
[35:49.520 --> 35:59.520]  You see, there's no end because the most radical of the left is always going to be in charge and they're always going to be mining downward, searching for the hell they want.
[35:59.520 --> 36:07.520]  And then everybody else just follows them down this rat hole and they promise everybody they're leading them to some Valhalla and they're not.
[36:07.520 --> 36:18.520]  So you heard me right, folks. That's the LA Times all glowing. Oh, great. You can give blood now and you can you can give it to people and I'll tell them wonderful, wonderful.
[36:18.520 --> 36:26.520]  It's so liberal.
[36:26.520 --> 36:33.520]  Hollywood, the NFL, mainstream media, all these people are in their own little insane asylum bubbles.
[36:33.520 --> 36:57.520]  They're always from very latchkey, kept secluded, permanent like lifestyles where they just go from their tiny apartment to their little job on the subways like rats or on the highways and then back again to go be entombed in their living rooms watching mainstream television.
[36:57.520 --> 37:03.520]  And they really believe that's reality.
[37:03.520 --> 37:11.520]  But the people inside the structure that are doing the programming are the most insane.
[37:11.520 --> 37:18.520]  The inmates are running the asylum ladies and gentlemen.
[37:18.520 --> 37:27.520]  And then somebody like President Trump comes along and just brings back common sense.
[37:27.520 --> 37:37.520]  That was the most progressive thing ever when we found out the country, not that we ever lived up to it, but we were trying to. He does an America reboot.
[37:37.520 --> 37:49.520]  And they act like they're dying because folks, these globalists are so miserable that they want to kill, steal and destroy.
[37:49.520 --> 37:51.520]  They want to hurt other people.
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.520]  They enjoy the deviance of pulling other people down with them.
[37:56.520 --> 38:05.520]  Ever gone crab fishing, you can pull them up to the piece of meat on a string and you can throw the crabs in the bucket and they won't fight with each other until one tries to get out.
[38:05.520 --> 38:11.520]  And as soon as one tries to climb out, they'll go over and stop them.
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.520]  Now, I don't know why those crustaceans do that.
[38:17.520 --> 38:23.520]  But that's what the little cancers are up to, pun intended.
[38:23.520 --> 38:28.520]  His first victim received a text saying, maybe you have the fever.
[38:28.520 --> 38:34.520]  I have HIV, LOV, oops.
[38:34.520 --> 38:35.520]  And that's what he does.
[38:35.520 --> 38:42.520]  That's a guy, that was the guy that just arrested in New York, cutting holes and condoms and then letting people know, hey, got the fever?
[38:42.520 --> 38:46.520]  That's your T-lamp besides your white blood cells getting eaten.
[38:46.520 --> 38:53.520]  And then when they're gone, you'll have no more immune system and you'll have a long, slow death and have to pay out all your money for drugs.
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.520]  But it's okay because I'm liberal.
[38:57.520 --> 39:01.520]  I kill you.
[39:01.520 --> 39:05.520]  But see, that's in New York. Hell.
[39:05.520 --> 39:10.520]  New York's backwards, man. You can't just go around giving people a disease. It'll kill them.
[39:10.520 --> 39:13.520]  That's a homophobic, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:13.520 --> 39:19.520]  And I strongly suggest New York get their laws in line with California.
[39:19.520 --> 39:27.520]  Now, does Weinstein sound as bad now that you've heard that?
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.520]  I smell a hit job in this, cutting him out of his company to sell it to the Chinese.
[39:31.520 --> 39:33.520]  And that is what the word is from Miramax.
[39:33.520 --> 39:36.520]  And that's how they're going to take down the old Hollywood elite. They're totally done.
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.520]  They're weak. All the pedophilia is known. They don't want to embarrass the other pedophiles with that.
[39:41.520 --> 39:44.520]  So they're going to bring out the other things.
[39:44.520 --> 39:48.520]  And that's the word. And that's the rest of the story.
[39:48.520 --> 39:55.520]  Oh, and look, Ted Heath, former Prime Minister of England, we've had guests on that reported he liked to slit little girls' throats.
[39:55.520 --> 40:00.520]  Oh, yeah, the raping them is just low level.
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.520]  Ted Heath, police chief, calls for Westminster child sex ring inquiry.
[40:04.520 --> 40:09.520]  They've already caught a bunch of people that the kids told them about with sex dungeons, with dead kids.
[40:09.520 --> 40:14.520]  But it's okay.
[40:14.520 --> 40:16.520]  They all, excuse me, it's liberal.
[40:16.520 --> 40:23.520]  They had programs where they would really work hard to get coroners and people in the hospitals
[40:23.520 --> 40:28.520]  so that right when a child died in a car wreck,
[40:28.520 --> 40:33.520]  they would all just rush in sometimes up to 20 men and just take turns with the dead body.
[40:33.520 --> 40:38.520]  Because, you know, not all of them could be as elite as the royalty to actually have fresh living children,
[40:38.520 --> 40:42.520]  so they would just go have sex with the dead ones.
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.520]  Sorry to tell you about all this, but that's what the police have discovered.
[40:47.520 --> 40:49.520]  That's sewer fighting.
[40:49.520 --> 40:58.520]  When you look at Chelsea Clinton or Hillary or Bill, understand raping women is just the opening salvo.
[40:58.520 --> 41:04.520]  When they're flying around on Jerry Epstein's Alita Express with the 10-year-old girls on board.
[41:04.520 --> 41:09.520]  Of course, a lot of those little girls reportedly they got flown to secluded private islands.
[41:09.520 --> 41:12.520]  You know what happens to them there, right?
[41:12.520 --> 41:19.520]  Because you can rape little girls all day on the mainland, but you go off to the far away little islands
[41:19.520 --> 41:27.520]  and then the little girls can go sleep with the fishies after they've been all used up by a pack of potbellied pedophiles.
[41:27.520 --> 41:38.520]  The same type of people who like to legalize, put an HIV in the blood supply, and giving it to people.
[41:38.520 --> 41:46.520]  You go, why would you do that? Because you like to kill people because you're a devil worshiper.
[41:46.520 --> 41:54.520]  And mostly people don't go to devil worshippers meetings, they're just devil worshippers.
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.520]  And you know, for your lunch, just bring in a four-year-old, five-year-old girl, have them beg for mommy,
[41:59.520 --> 42:05.520]  lay out the plastic, slit their throat.
[42:05.520 --> 42:13.520]  Because after all, you just want to have sex with a dead body.
[42:13.520 --> 42:19.520]  Now, that's who wants your guns, and that's who wants your kids, and that's who wants you to take vaccines.
[42:19.520 --> 42:26.520]  Hell, they'll probably start saying, everyone must have HIV for solidarity, or you're a racist and we're going to arrest you.
[42:26.520 --> 42:31.520]  Because they already say, we're going to make you take these hundreds of deadly vaccines that they admit to until you're on the insert.
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.520]  We're going to make you take those. Even if we have this huge history of secret experimentation, even black folks syphilis,
[42:36.520 --> 42:44.520]  and appellations, and everybody else, we don't care, we're going to make you do it.
[42:44.520 --> 42:49.520]  Because it's their cult, and there's a lot of them, and they mean business.
[42:49.520 --> 42:54.520]  And they're not going to be defeated until we wake up and admit just how serious the situation is.
[42:54.520 --> 42:57.520]  North Korea News straight ahead.
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.520]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[43:02.520 --> 43:12.520]  Why we have them, why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them, and why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[43:12.520 --> 43:19.520]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[43:19.520 --> 43:30.520]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Red Coast.
[43:30.520 --> 43:35.520]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[43:35.520 --> 43:42.520]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[43:42.520 --> 43:45.520]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[43:45.520 --> 43:54.520]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth. It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[43:54.520 --> 44:16.520]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[44:24.520 --> 44:31.520]  These plant extracts are concentrated, containing antibacterial properties that work well to help tone gums and freshen your breath.

[44:43.520 --> 44:48.520]  It is effective, yet gentle enough for the most sensitive gums and canker sores.

[47:20.520 --> 47:31.520]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, or your mind.
[47:31.520 --> 47:37.520]  I'm going to hit the huge North Korean news at the start of the next hour, or perhaps test an H-bomb today.
[47:37.520 --> 47:39.520]  What is Trump's call before the storm?
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.520]  We've got more info on that as well, and I'll open the phones up and take your calls.
[47:44.520 --> 47:55.520]  But flooding in from all of our sources, everyone we know is having their YouTube videos taken down that expose Islamic terror attacks, Islamic raping, black-on-white crime.
[47:55.520 --> 48:00.520]  It's all being censored. If you just dryly report on something, you're being shut down.
[48:00.520 --> 48:06.520]  This is amazing censorship, all being triggered, and they're attempting to suppress everybody, so I'm going to talk about that in a moment.
[48:06.520 --> 48:14.520]  Before we go any further, you absolutely are the heart, and the soul, and the strength, and the blood supply of this operation.
[48:14.520 --> 48:20.520]  When you spread articles, when you spread videos, when you show them to your neighbors, when you speak out, when you share links with people,
[48:20.520 --> 48:31.520]  when you're at lunch, and when you're off at night, that is changing the world and getting around their algorithms and defeating them, regardless.
[48:31.520 --> 48:41.520]  And it's also about financial support. That's why when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you make this whole operation, this whole engine turn.
[48:41.520 --> 48:50.520]  You are vital. You are the oxygen, and we have great products, great nutraceuticals, great water filtration, great air filtration.
[48:50.520 --> 49:03.520]  Infowarslife.com, or triple A 2533139. We've got high quality essential oils at discounted prices. We've got Secret 12. That is going to end the day at 40% off.
[49:03.520 --> 49:10.520]  We have Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Formula, 50% off, because I want you to try and see how great it is.
[49:10.520 --> 49:23.520]  And we have the new big special, Brain Force Plus, now 20% more, 50% off. I put in a giant order and got a discount on it, so I passed on those discounts to you.
[49:23.520 --> 49:33.520]  It helps fund our operation. It's an amazing, new tropic. If you haven't tried it, tried today, if you have purchased it in the past and enjoyed it, please purchase some for your friends, your families, your neighbors,
[49:33.520 --> 49:41.520]  and help them while you help the broadcast. 50% off. That's the new special. I thought I could run it for three or four weeks.
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.520]  We've got to probably stop it this week as it's selling so fast, so thank you again for the support. It's 1996 right now.
[49:46.520 --> 49:53.520]  Similar stuff, $67 out there on the market. It really is the highest quality and organic. You've seen even our enemies test our products and say,
[49:53.520 --> 50:03.520]  they're California clean and have what they say in them. So, infowarslife.com by California clean. Sounds like an oxymoron. They have the highest standards on nutraceuticals and things.
[50:03.520 --> 50:08.520]  What can be in them and we can pass those standards. We're not going to let them sit there and then sue us over it. We're not stupid.
[50:08.520 --> 50:14.520]  Plus, I want to sell the best stuff out there, even though it's hard to meet those standards, because they set them where they're almost impossible to meet.
[50:14.520 --> 50:23.520]  But again, 50% off, Rainforest Plus or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine at the Molan Labe T-shirts.
[50:23.520 --> 50:29.520]  Got the new info wars ball caps in that are really awesome. They've got infowars.com on them and so much more.
[50:29.520 --> 50:45.520]  Now, Mike started on Twitter right now. They put out a documentary that I've seen on the Sweden rape epidemic, showing that it is the rape capital of the world according to the EU and
[50:45.520 --> 50:54.520]  UN's own crime heat maps that has violated community guidelines where they say that the communists going and voting on it don't like it.
[50:54.520 --> 51:07.520]  And so he's banned. And if it happens anymore, he'll be erased. Same thing happened to Mark Dice, putting out a video exposing the Islamic man from Africa that said he wanted to kill white people.
[51:07.520 --> 51:13.520]  And folks go into a church. He went and did it and they covered up the motive in the media, even though it was mentioned.
[51:13.520 --> 51:22.520]  And then YouTube is deleting videos about it because you don't have rights as a white person. You're supposed to be victimized and sit there and take it.
[51:22.520 --> 51:31.520]  Now, the leftists sell it that, oh, we're stopping racial division. No, we have to admit when a bunch of whites are doing something wrong, like when the idiot went and killed the black folks in the church.
[51:31.520 --> 51:39.520]  He's a piece of scum. You have a right to say that's bad and to talk about it. You should. I have a right to talk about the same thing or vice versa.
[51:39.520 --> 51:47.520]  It's important to be able to communicate and they can't compete with us. So they want to shut us all down. It's never going to work, but they're making their move.
[51:47.520 --> 51:57.520]  The battle is now. It's never been this intense. So don't just take these shows for granted because they are already demonetized Mark Dice a year ago.
[51:57.520 --> 52:03.520]  He didn't bring any money down from YouTube. We're down 90 plus percent of the money we bring in. That's why we had to open up other ways to fund ourselves.
[52:03.520 --> 52:11.520]  So first they go, okay, your money's gone. Well, that didn't work. You're about to be off here completely. You tow the line. You don't show crime statistics.
[52:11.520 --> 52:17.520]  You don't talk about nothing. You understand or will shut you down. Here is Mark Dice reporting.
[52:42.520 --> 52:50.520]  I'm sure many of you saw the video before it got deleted, but for those of you who didn't, it was about this black guy who went into a white church in Tennessee.
[52:50.520 --> 53:03.520]  It just started opening fire, killing one person, injuring six others, including the pastor to get revenge for Dylan Roof, that white supremacist who did the same thing to a black church in Charleston, South Carolina two years ago.
[53:03.520 --> 53:15.520]  The video is about how the mainstream media is ignoring this story for three basic reasons. One, the perpetrator is a black man who committed an anti-white hate crime, which doesn't fit with the liberal agenda that only white people commit anti-black hate crimes.
[53:15.520 --> 53:24.520]  Two, he is an immigrant from the Sudan. And three, he was stopped by a law-abiding gun owner who had a concealed carry permit who was carrying at the church.
[53:24.520 --> 53:35.520]  So now, not only is the mainstream media covering up this hate crime and lying by omission, by pretending that such crimes don't happen, but now YouTube is actively censoring the story.
[53:35.520 --> 53:47.520]  After deleting the video for violating their terms of service, they sent me this notification. I, Mark Dice, as you may know, our community guidelines describe which content we allow and don't allow on YouTube.
[53:47.520 --> 53:58.520]  Your video, Black Man Shoots Up White Church Media Ignores Anti-White Hate Crime, was flagged for review. Upon review, we've determined that it violates our guidelines.
[53:58.520 --> 54:05.520]  We've removed it from YouTube and assigned a community guideline strike or temporary penalty to your account.
[54:05.520 --> 54:14.520]  It didn't show any graphic photos or video. It didn't use harsh language. It simply was talking about the fact that this crime has been ignored by the mainstream media.
[54:14.520 --> 54:18.520]  And now YouTube is trying to actively censor the story.
[54:18.520 --> 54:28.520]  I did file an appeal against this false and orwellianly creepy community guidelines strike, so it is possible that in the next couple days, perhaps the video may be restored.
[54:28.520 --> 54:43.520]  But this is disturbing on so many different levels. The fact that somebody or some panel of thought police at YouTube reviewed the video after the trolls flagged it, which they flag everything, and they determined that it was a violation of YouTube's policies.
[54:43.520 --> 54:54.520]  They did a similar thing to this woman, whose channel is Red Pill Black, a black conservative, after she posted this video criticizing some of the insane demands of Black Lives Matter.
[54:54.520 --> 55:04.520]  Hope can't have a black woman criticizing Black Lives Matter community guidelines strike. She appealed the strike, and a lot of people started tweeting to YouTube and the Team YouTube account.
[55:04.520 --> 55:12.520]  That's kind of like the customer service Twitter account at YouTube, and they did restore the video. But just the fact that they took it down in the first place.
[55:12.520 --> 55:29.520]  This full video is up on infowars.com. I'm going to retweet it in full right now during the break at Real Alex Jones, because he shows the other black commentators who are good-looking, smart, patriots, libertarians, or not even conservatives, that are taking YouTube by storm.
[55:29.520 --> 55:37.520]  I mean, a lot of these folks have 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70 million views per video.
[55:37.520 --> 55:43.520]  Yes, some of the videos have 70 million views. We had Brandon Tatum in here just Friday. Amazing.
[55:43.520 --> 55:52.520]  And they're like, no, no, no. You talk about discrimination, because it's all selectively enforced. In fact, I'm not even going to show what Dye shows, because YouTube left this up, but they'll use it against me.
[55:52.520 --> 56:00.520]  It's a black guy with butcher knives saying, I'm going to murder white people, and I'm going to murder Trump. They've left that up for a year.
[56:00.520 --> 56:16.520]  You're allowed to say you're going to kill Trump, kill me, kill everybody. But if you are a black person and you eloquently talk about free market in America, and how it's a great country to live in compared to others, you will be deleted just for being articulate.
[56:16.520 --> 56:29.520]  While YouTube lets everybody else do what they want, this is real discrimination, folks, against patriots, against common sense people, against libertarians, against people that just want to live in peace.
[56:29.520 --> 56:36.520]  I don't hate black people. I don't hate white people. I hate idiots. And I'm sick of them trying to cause a race war.
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.520]  The numbers show the NFL's getting their ass handed to them. The numbers show Hollywood's collapsing. It's all a bellwether of this.
[56:42.520 --> 56:52.520]  So I'm here to tell you, folks, now I don't put a good face on things unless it's good. And North Korea is a bad situation, but other than that, the globalists are trying to overturn the economy.
[56:52.520 --> 57:02.520]  It's upsetting them. They're trying to cause a race war, and none of it's working. It's not working. But they're arrogant. They're narcissistic. They're crazy. Like Hillary, they won't go away.
[57:02.520 --> 57:15.520]  They won't give up. But I guess that's good because they are completely extincting their operations. They are completely discrediting themselves to the ends of the earth, and they're driving themselves to the ground.
[57:15.520 --> 57:22.520]  The only question is, will they take us with them?
[57:22.520 --> 57:33.520]  Ratings are down 31% on the year for the NFL. Now they're down again. They're plunging. Now it's over 31 points. New numbers in. It's 50-plus points last three, four years.
[57:33.520 --> 57:47.520]  I mean, understand that those are bellwethers. Hollywood is imploding. The NFL's imploding. Mainstream TV is imploding. And they are in their death rows trying to bully us into submission. It's not going to work.
[57:47.520 --> 57:54.520]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium.

[1:00:04.520 --> 1:00:07.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:13.520]  The wall was lost. The treaty signed. It was not cut.
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:21.520]  All right. I didn't want to get in the middle of Corker stuff, but I've known for a year from Roger Stone that he was under criminal investigation.
[1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:36.520]  He was going to probably be indicted. That's in the news now. I mean, I've heard all these back-channel Corker stories, but now they're using him as a set piece against Trump. He's now the mouth of the FBI, of the Clinton crime machine FBI.
[1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:39.520]  They still basically control it through Mueller, the crime boss.
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:52.520]  And the kingpins think they can use all these folks that are getting ready to burn to destroy Trump. And it's just pathetic kamikaze attacks. So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour. Briefly, Roger Stone's going to pop in.
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:57.520]  I want to open the phones up on the North Korea issue. They say they may test an H bomb to dare tomorrow.
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:06.520]  Trump says he may respond. Is that Trump's call before the storm comment? We should really be discussing that.
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:17.520]  The NFL's ratings slipped even more. It was 31% from last year. Now, Sunday, the numbers slipped even more. And he added up to over 55% now. It was 51%.
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:26.520]  So it is just absolutely imploding right now. Amazing to watch all of this unfold.
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:38.520]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789 Alex. That's 877-789-2539 on any of those issues and we'll get you up and on the air.
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:45.520]  Again, 877-789-2539. But give us a minute, first time callers. I'm going to get first time callers on again.
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:50.520]  We got to turn the phone system on. That's a computerized system. We can take up to 50 calls at once.
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:02:00.520]  Technically, there can be 50 on the screen. They can see how many calls come in. What was the record once? 24,000 calls in two hours?
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:07.520]  Yeah, 24,000 calls during a two-hour show. I mean, even national talk shows beg for calls.
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:13.520]  The issue is that we have a lot of regulars who are wonderful folks who sit there speed dialing and then they get in first.
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:20.520]  And we don't screen call, so you end up getting on. So that's why most of the time I say first time callers, just 24,000 calls.
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:24.520]  And some folks would call back 20 times, but that was thousands of callers calling in.
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:32.520]  So the toll free number to join us is 877-789 Alex. 877-789-ALEX.
[1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:36.520]  Let me just briefly, in the short segment we have, get into Meryl Streep.
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:45.520]  She's come out and attacked Mr. Weinstein. She's come out and gone after him.
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:54.520]  And there's a whole backstory on this, how the SNL covered it up, the New York Times covered it up, and Matt Damon covered it up, and all the usual suspects.
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:59.520]  But now she's calling him disgraceful once called him a God.
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:05.520]  Imagine being around people where somebody wants to be called God. That's just the most uncool group of people.
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:08.520]  I've been around folks before, they're like groveling, tell me how great I am.
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:12.520]  I'm like, listen, don't do that anymore. And they get really upset.
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:21.520]  And of course they always hate you to begin with. They always can't wait to stab you in the back as soon as possible.
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:23.520]  What a disgraceful group of slime.
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:34.520]  But Meryl Streep is a few years ago in multiple interviews with standing ovations to a man that kidnapped a 13-year-old girl, Roman Polanski.
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:39.520]  And she is proud of the whole situation.
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:45.520]  And so that's how much power she thought she had just a few years ago.
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:53.520]  But now from a guy hitting on a bunch of girls and having two or three dates a day, sounds exhausting.
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:59.520]  He's a sleazy guy. And let me tell you something, there's a lot more beneath the water than just that.
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:06.520]  Why are they all ganging up now? Because it's just a group of scum circling the toilet bowl.
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:12.520]  And all the photos of Hillary put their hands all over Weinstein.
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:19.520]  They all love the glitz and the Oscars and they get to go peacock around and look at each other and take selfies.
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:23.520]  I mean, what a group of just disgusting filth.
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:28.520]  Here, we got about 30 seconds, but let's go out with the Meryl Streep video of her defending Charles Rapist.
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:34.520]  Um, yes, Roman Polanski. I'm very sorry that he's in jail.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:42.520]  It goes to Roman Polanski, the pianist.
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:49.520]  He'll stand up for a guy like the whole of the girls down in the rape until they bleed everywhere.
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:55.520]  The fall of Babylon is here.
[1:04:55.520 --> 1:05:02.520]  You deserve a deep rest while sleep with Knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:39.520]  Even though they were alerted in March of this year by Homeland Security Equifax,
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:44.520]  one of the big three credit monitoring companies failed to patch a security threat
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:54.520]  that led to hackers obtaining personal information of 143 million Americans which included social security numbers for as long as three months.
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:07:06.520]  The CEO of Equifax, Richard Smith, who oversaw the breach of the data, will comfortably glide down on a golden parachute to the tune of $90 million when he retires guilt-free.
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:19.520]  Your own information technology system did not tell the Equifax security division that the Apache Strut software which contained the vulnerability that led to this breach was running on the Equifax system.
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:21.520]  How did that happen?
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:34.520]  Congressman, the day after the notification came out from certs, the security team notified a wide range of people in the technology team.
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:45.520]  If, as a sophisticated company as you headed is, with so much at risk, how does this happen?
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:48.520]  I can't fix stupid, as a colleague of mine used to say.
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:59.520]  With so much at risk, I've talked to other software companies and people in this space who say some companies have an automated system that when a patch comes out, it automatically gets installed.
[1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:02.520]  That's not what you had necessarily, right?
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:04.520]  I'm unaware of an automatic patch.
[1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  I'm told by my staff that this current, this latest data breach was about 143 million people. Is that right?
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:19.520]  There was some slight movement and the numbers adjusted. Press release came out from the company last night. It's 145.5.
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:33.520]  Okay, I appreciate your accuracy there. But under current law, you're basically required to alert each of those that their account has been hacked.
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:49.520]  But there's really no penalty unless there is some sort of a lawsuit filed and the Federal Trade Commission or a state attorney general files a class action lawsuit against your company.
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:56.520]  So you're really only notified. You're just required to notify everybody and say, so sorry, so sad.
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:09:08.520]  There's an article in WGNTV that talks about Equifax doing their own investigation into the three executives that sold their stock and profited.
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:18.520]  And I just, I guess they must have a pretty good investigative team there because between the press release that happened on Friday or whatever it came out and then a story on Sunday.
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:24.520]  And today we have a revelation that those folks didn't know that this breach took place.
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:34.520]  Mr. Chairman, according to your testimony in the House yesterday, over the last three years you spent $250 million on cybersecurity, that's about $85 million a year, correct?
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:38.520]  Yes, that was an estimate that over the last three years it's approaching a quarter billion dollars.
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:45.520]  And since 2016 you have made personally about $69 million. Is that correct?
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.520]  I'm not trying to track that number to be honest.
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:56.520]  But hindsight, do you think Equifax should have spent more money protecting people's data rather than compensating you so well?
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:04.520]  Smith was paid the big bucks for one singular reason, to keep our data safe, which he failed to do.
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:13.520]  While Yahoo originally said that one billion accounts had been hacked, it took years to find out that all three billion accounts had been hacked.
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:18.520]  That was discovered in 2013 and not disclosed until three years later.
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:27.520]  Meanwhile, Wells Fargo is facing a lawsuit claiming that the top brass knew that millions of fake accounts had been created in an unprecedented scam.
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:36.520]  Bloomberg reports as of April, the bank had spent at least $445 million on fines, remediation, consultants, and civil litigation.
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:45.520]  The company still faces a raft of investors' security suits seeking to recoup the losses from a $30 billion decline in market capitalization
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:50.520]  after the scandal broke and wrongful termination cases filed by fired bankers.
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:11:01.520]  The company said in August its review found employees may have created 3.5 million bogus accounts, more than 60% higher than its initial estimate.
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:06.520]  These are the companies locked in with Congress, lobbying laws and making deals.
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:12.520]  A crony capitalist swamp of crooks putting their personal fortunes before America's safety and security.
[1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:16.520]  The very thing that made them rich in the first place.
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:19.520]  John Bown reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:36.520]  And they've turned D.C. and much of this country into a stagnant swamp of individuals that endanger not just our country but our entire civilization.
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:39.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're now well into the second hour.
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:42.520]  I'm going to take calls this hour starting in the next segment.
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:43.520]  We've got a lot of big news.
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:50.520]  You've got the Hollywood scandals and their hypocrisy. You've got the NFL continuing its ratings nose dive as they show America,
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:53.520]  as Hollywood has done how much they hate this country.
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:55.520]  We have a huge awakening happening.
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:58.520]  We have Catalonia under basically martial law.
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:01.520]  How do they voted to secede?
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  They're threatening to march in Spanish troops tomorrow if the secession leader doesn't throw in the towel.
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:15.520]  We've got Dow Jones industrial average going to another all time high and the Federal Reserve saying they're trying to block it to stop the Trump recovery.
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:19.520]  You've got Senator Corker resigning amid criminal probe.
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:23.520]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us briefly to talk about that.
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:30.520]  You've got police investigations of giant child sex rings, not just torturing and raping children but killing them.
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:32.520]  That's in the Daily Mail.
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:37.520]  It's all coming up and more on the Vegas shooting as it emerges that that was completely staged.
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:43.520]  But here is, and by completely staged, I mean we're being lied to. It really happened.
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:48.520]  But the official story we're getting is not accurate.
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:53.520]  We've got multiple shooters. We've got top forensics experts being clear on that.
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.520]  You've got sources on the ground talking about the Islamic connections,
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:03.520]  talking about the trips to the Middle East that we told you about first on Monday.
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:07.520]  That broke in the news yesterday that indeed he did go to the Middle East multiple times.
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:09.520]  I mean we were told this.
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:14.520]  I'm on record Monday telling what my sources said that the police think there's more than one shooter.
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:16.520]  They didn't act alone.
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:20.520]  All that stuff and that they believe he was radicalized.
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:24.520]  We've got Colonel Schaefer, former high level Army, CIA, huge connections today.
[1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:27.520]  We've got that broke much of Benghazi agreeing with me.
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:30.520]  Now you've got top federal forensic psychiatrist saying the same thing.
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:36.520]  You've got Craig Sawyer, a leader of SEAL Team 6, a top federal forensics officer,
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:39.520]  and somebody who testifies in federal court about ballistics.
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:44.520]  On yesterday saying 99% chance there's more than one shooter.
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:47.520]  But a ballistics study needs to be done.
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:53.520]  We have a ballistics study being done by one of the top ballistics personnel in the country.
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:59.520]  And so that ballistics test is being done right now and the findings should be out tomorrow or Wednesday.
[1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:03.520]  And they already had some basic research on it.
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.520]  But we've paid to have them be able to go out in the field and actually conduct the test,
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:11.520]  not just simulate them in a laboratory or on a computer.
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:13.520]  I'm going to leave it right there.
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.520]  But people ask why wasn't Info Wars in Vegas after this happened?
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:19.520]  We've been in Vegas.
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.520]  Okay.
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:22.520]  Now we're not in Vegas.
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:24.520]  Now we're doing the research.
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:25.520]  So we're on this.
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:27.520]  You better believe it.
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:31.520]  Now, I haven't gotten to this yet, but here's the big news.
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:37.520]  We have Trump last week at a meeting with the generals and their wives at the White House,
[1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:40.520]  saying this is the call before the storm up here having dinner together.
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:42.520]  People said, well, what did you mean by that?
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:44.520]  And he wouldn't say, well, now we're being clear.
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:49.520]  They're talking about North Korea threatening to test a hydrogen bomb above ground.
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:53.520]  And Dershowitz is saying that Trump's call before the storm is a message to North Korea and Iran.
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:58.520]  Iran's responded by saying they're ready for war, may launch it preemptively.
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:00.520]  So very serious time to be alive.
[1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:05.520]  Senator Corker is saying Trump is steering America towards World War III.
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:10.520]  So that means Mueller is saying that because they've got him with a sealed indictment already reportedly.
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:11.520]  Corker.
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:17.520]  And so anything you hear him say now is whatever deep state, the Clinton crime mafia, the pedophile mafia,
[1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:20.520]  wants their slaves to say.
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:24.520]  But when we come back, I will play that call before the storm clip and then give you the rest of the story.
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:28.520]  And they go right to your phone calls on that situation.
[1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:30.520]  877-789-2539.
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:32.520]  877-789 Alex.
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:38.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, infowars.com is the main news site.
[1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:42.520]  We have the news site, newswars.com has a lot of original content videos and articles on it as well.
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:46.520]  And if you'll spread that link and save that link and spread those articles and videos,
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:50.520]  you'll help us get around the censors and the globalists that are working around the clock,
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:52.520]  try to stop our transmissions from getting out.
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:56.520]  You are the info war, you are the hope, you are the resistance.
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:02.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:06.520]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:08.520]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:11.520]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:13.520]  It's made in the USA.
[1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:18.520]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:20.520]  and it supports the info war.
[1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:22.520]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:25.520]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:31.520]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:36.520]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:41.520]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:46.520]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires the next level
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:48.520]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:52.520]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:17:15.520]  It's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:27.520]  The ZShield private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it.
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:32.520]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:36.520]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:39.520]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:44.520]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:48.520]  Join the info wars, spread the information, educate yourself and others.
[1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:50.520]  The truth shall set you free.
[1:17:50.520 --> 1:17:52.520]  For infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:26.520]  This is a list of blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:30.520]  that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:37.520]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:43.520]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:46.520]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[1:18:46.520 --> 1:18:50.520]  We've been testing this formula for years but this is the limited first run to the public
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:19:17.520]  so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:25.520]  We've been trying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts and entire meals.
[1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:27.520]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:31.520]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating,
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:35.520]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:41.520]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:44.520]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:48.520]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:52.520]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[1:19:52.520 --> 1:19:59.520]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:07.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:29.520]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder, another world, another time,
[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:47.520]  is when you scream and wait until the Christmas night.
[1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:53.520]  You know I usually give the phone number out and people call in on a whole bunch of other subjects
[1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:55.520]  and the one I've kind of mentioned but that's fine.
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:59.520]  I like to grab bag and I like how college bring up topics I wouldn't have forgotten to cover.
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:01.520]  But I want to get into World War III issues.
[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:03.520]  I want to get into North Korea.
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:06.520]  I want to get into what does Trump need to do because I'm supporting domestically.
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:08.520]  I think he's a good guy.
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:13.520]  He knows North Korea is threatening everybody and it's very, very belligerent
[1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:17.520]  and that maybe standing up to him might be the right thing to do
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:20.520]  because nobody's tried that and things just get progressively worse
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:23.520]  and have now come to a very dangerous head.
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:28.520]  With him firing missiles every week over Japan threatening to New South Korea,
[1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:32.520]  threatening to imminently, preemptively attack us.
[1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:38.520]  At the UN, their spokesperson said, it's imminent.
[1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:41.520]  We're going to attack the mainland with nuclear fire.
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:45.520]  Trump just said if you attack us, we'll hit you with fire and fury.
[1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:48.520]  One thing to say, if you hit me, I'll kick your butt.
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:54.520]  But to say, we will hit you first, that's under international law, you name it.
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:57.520]  Somebody starts talking like that, you've got a right to hit them.
[1:21:57.520 --> 1:22:02.520]  And the North started the war back in 1949, 1950.
[1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:04.520]  It's never been stopped.
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:06.520]  It was just a ceasefire.
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:08.520]  So I'm not selling a war.
[1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:10.520]  I've got four children.
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:13.520]  But my gut tells me if we keep letting this guy push and push and push,
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:17.520]  it's going to be a war and he's going to have better weapons then.
[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:19.520]  Now, right now, he can hit the U.S.
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:23.520]  They don't know if the warhead will stay intact and won't detonate up in space
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:26.520]  or something or fizzle out.
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:28.520]  Those are complex warheads.
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:33.520]  Jacketed in the plastic explosive to drive in the uranium and plutonium together.
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:37.520]  But depending on the type of system they've got, this isn't a game.
[1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:41.520]  And I love how Corker is saying it's Trump's fault and he's pushing it to World War III.
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:42.520]  It's the Clintons.
[1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:46.520]  They gave them the reactors and the missiles hoping that would appease him.
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:49.520]  And then it didn't.
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:52.520]  And we've got this evil chipmunk up there.
[1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:55.520]  It looks like he's been feeding off the bodies of his dead people.
[1:22:55.520 --> 1:23:00.520]  Britain preparing for war with North Korea, the UK's new aircraft carrier, the HMS.
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:02.520]  Let me go back at the top. I want to read it. Thanks.
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:05.520]  The HMS Queen Elizabeth could be brought into service early.
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:08.520]  Yes, it's a big gear up.
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:11.520]  And U.S. aircraft carriers are converging.
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:15.520]  And Trump's talking about ominous stuff getting ready to go down.
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:18.520]  So I'm glad some collars want to talk about that.
[1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:22.520]  But also, let's talk about something that will kill a lot more folks
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:25.520]  than got killed at the tragic events in Vegas.
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:32.520]  That's California legalizing going and giving blood if you have HIV or hepatitis.
[1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:36.520]  And giving it your sexual partner and not telling them.
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:40.520]  Now, that's manslaughter, attempted murder in other states.
[1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:41.520]  And it should be.
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:44.520]  How would they pass something like that, making it a misdemeanor, basically?
[1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:46.520]  It's a slap on the wrist.
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:48.520]  For all intents and purposes, it'd be like saying,
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:50.520]  you know, we're going to give you a parking ticket for murder.
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:53.520]  Well, that, in all intents and purposes, that's legalizing murder.
[1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:59.520]  So if you scroll down on the article, right there, it's got the LA Times quotes
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:09.520]  that are just unbelievable where they just talk about how they're doing it.
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:11.520]  And talking about how you can give blood and to no big deal.
[1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:13.520]  Well, it'll kill you.
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:17.520]  But they say, oh, you're being mean to the gay people by making it a stigma.
[1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:19.520]  Okay, so I can give somebody drug resistant TB and know it.
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:20.520]  Or I can give them cholera.
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:21.520]  Is it okay?
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:22.520]  No, I'd go to prison too.
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:26.520]  But because it's a liberal disease, they're defining it as that.
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:29.520]  Just like it's okay to sexualize your children as long as it's for tolerance.
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:30.520]  Well, then it's okay.
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:31.520]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:32.520]  Governor, this is LA Times.
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:36.520]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to misdemeanor
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:41.520]  the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:47.520]  The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling the blood bank they're HIV positive.
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  Oh, there you go.
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:56.520]  So as the disease explodes again, just remember that this happened.
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:59.520]  This is true mental illness, ladies and gentlemen, next level.
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:03.520]  So we got Dan, and we got Mary Lou, and we got Murdoch, and we got David, and we got Bill,
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:06.520]  and we got Sean, and many, many others.
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:11.520]  Let's go to Dan in Indiana on North Korea.
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:14.520]  Dan, you're on the air.
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:21.520]  I'm concerned if we go to World War with North Korea, this is another sign of Jacob's
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:22.520]  troubles.
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:28.520]  And Mr. Jones, can you explain why you sure had to come at the beginning of Jacob's
[1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:33.520]  troubles and at the end of Jacob's troubles and are willing to give back your money, your
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:38.520]  $500 from the Bill Clinton rape contest, is you can answer that?
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:40.520]  All right, sir, I appreciate your call.
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:43.520]  I said first-time callers, and he likes to get through.
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:47.520]  A nice fella, I guess, that won one of the awards for saying Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:48.520]  He did a great job.
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:53.520]  I remember the video, I recognize his voice, and we got to an argument about post-trib and
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:55.520]  pre-trib, and I'm not going to argue about it.
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:58.520]  There's the devil's real, God's real, and I'm going to fight corruption.
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:02.520]  So all I know is a lot of the pre-trib folks don't want to get involved.
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:04.520]  They go, praise the Lord, the end of the world's coming.
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:05.520]  Jesus will be back.
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:07.520]  I'm not going to fight the evil, and I just think that's a cop-out.
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:09.520]  I'm not saying you're doing that, sir.
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:13.520]  You're out there saying Bill Clinton's a rapist to his ugly face.
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:15.520]  You've got a lot of courage, so I appreciate you.
[1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:19.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mary Lou in Pennsylvania.
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:20.520]  You're on the air.
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.520]  Welcome, Mary Lou.
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:23.520]  Hello, Alex.
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:25.520]  Now, I have a real quick.
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:27.520]  I'd like to get in here.
[1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:35.520]  Number one, Owen stood a show, and he was talking about the American Horror Story series.
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:42.520]  Now, my husband and I watched the one particular show, and it had Lady Gaga, and how they kidnapped
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:50.520]  the child, and how they had the children in the basement doing the ID where they were
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:51.520]  taking out their blood.
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:56.520]  Now, the thing that's really kind of getting me is, then we turn around, we jump into the
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:01.520]  NFL football, which I'm from Pennsylvania, and they're not saying anything more about
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:06.520]  Gary Sandusky Jr., which he's still being held.
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:12.520]  Nobody wants to break the big, breaking news about the pedophilia when it comes to the
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:16.520]  NFL, which is also involved in Hollywood.
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.520]  Hollywood, per se.
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:22.520]  But then, my question to you is, okay, here we go.
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:28.520]  We jump into China, which China is actually buying and taking over Hollywood.
[1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:32.520]  I mean, how do they come into play with that?
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:37.520]  Well, I mean, ma'am, that's the same reason they want to put HIV blood in the blood supply
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:38.520]  and all the rest of it.
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:41.520]  They've got to do incredible things to break our will and let us know.
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:42.520]  We're going to murder you.
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:43.520]  We're going to poison you.
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:44.520]  We're going to sexualize your kids.
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:49.520]  We're going to put most of the public on LuVox and other serotonin-ray uptake inhibitors that
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:52.520]  quote, increase death by 33%.
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:54.520]  I mean, they're just killing us.
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:58.520]  This is a death cult of people turned over to pure evil.
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:00.520]  And now they're saying, give your partner HIV.
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:01.520]  Give them hepatitis.
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:02.520]  Give them something that'll kill them.
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:03.520]  It's okay.
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:04.520]  You're not going to get in trouble.
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:05.520]  They're just lawless.
[1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:06.520]  They know what they're doing.
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:09.520]  Lady Gaga admits she's a devil worshiper.
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:13.520]  She says she has someone sleeping in the room with her because demons come attack her.
[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:16.520]  I mean, she says she gave her soul to the devil like Kesha.
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:19.520]  These people are gone.
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:22.520]  And the brain is like a radio transmitter receiver.
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.520]  And there's all this spiritual stuff going on.
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:27.520]  And these people turn themselves over to pure wickedness.
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:29.520]  And it's going to get worse and worse.
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:32.520]  And people are just going to be doing crazy things like running off cliffs.
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:35.520]  Like a bunch of, you know, pigs saying, I'm Legion.
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:38.520]  And then the demon jumps in the pigs and they run off a cliff.
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:41.520]  I mean, they're just screaming, we want to get you blood and kill you.
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:43.520]  Your kids belong to us.
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:46.520]  I mean, MSNBC is like your kids belong to us.
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:47.520]  We rule.
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:48.520]  God is bad.
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:49.520]  Families are bad.
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:51.520]  We're going to inject AIDS in you.
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:52.520]  Death.
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:53.520]  Blood.
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:54.520]  Blood.
[1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:55.520]  Let us murder you.
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:56.520]  It's just pure Satanism.
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:28:57.520]  It's just...
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:28:59.520]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote,
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:03.520]  where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:08.520]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:12.520]  Is there any question that we have in excess of power in Washington?
[1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:14.520]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:19.520]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:21.520]  That is the ultimate concern.
[1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:27.520]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:30.520]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:34.520]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:39.520]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:44.520]  But people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:47.520]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:50.520]  of what the real constraints upon them are.
[1:29:50.520 --> 1:29:53.520]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[1:29:53.520 --> 1:30:20.520]  FriendForWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:38.520]  I'm David Knight.
[1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:58.520]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:00.520]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[1:31:00.520 --> 1:31:03.520]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:31:03.520 --> 1:31:09.520]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:15.520]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:18.520]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:23.520]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:26.520]  It's the best job you can to purify your air.
[1:31:26.520 --> 1:31:31.520]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:31:31.520 --> 1:31:34.520]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:34.520 --> 1:31:36.520]  The general public doesn't.
[1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:40.520]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:40.520 --> 1:31:44.520]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:49.520]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:51.520]  that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:57.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in FullWarStore.com.
[1:31:57.520 --> 1:32:02.520]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[1:32:02.520 --> 1:32:05.520]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:10.520]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:15.520]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:21.520]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:27.520]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[1:32:27.520 --> 1:32:35.520]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[1:32:35.520 --> 1:32:41.520]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face
[1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:45.520]  of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:48.520]  Caveman is back in stock. People absolutely love it.
[1:32:48.520 --> 1:32:53.520]  So please secure your Caveman today at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free,
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:33:07.520]  AAA-253-3139.
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:50.520]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, I'm going right back to your calls, Murdoch, David, Bill, Sean,
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:59.520]  and many others that are patiently holding. We're doing first-time callers today, 877-789-2539.
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:02.520]  That's the new number, the number we've been using for years with The Sunday Show.
[1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:05.520]  We're now producing the show completely here in-house.
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:10.520]  I love GCN, but why have I had my own giant studios? Have I been still producing it with GCN over these years?
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:16.520]  It's just a vestigial kind of pleasantry that I've been involved in, and it's good to have them as a backup,
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:22.520]  but infowars is syndicated by yours truly, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:30.520]  Now, continuing here, we're seeing a complete and total route of the Democratic Party elite structure,
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:38.520]  and the Daughtering Blue Blood Country Club racist Republicans, if anybody's racist is the Democrats and them,
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:45.520]  they haven't figured out as want to be elitist yet that the world has moved on many, many times,
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:54.520]  and that the only thing more uncool than a Daughtering Democrat is a traitorous, larsenous, arrogant rhino.
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:35:01.520]  And you saw Judge Roy Moore, you see Eric Prince getting ready to run out west against another one of these guys.
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:05.520]  They're in full panic mode, but then comes in Corker suddenly.
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:10.520]  He's the new champion that hates Trump and is saying he's going to start World War III as an idiot.
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:18.520]  Well, I've known from back channels in my own research as well that Corker is dirty as a septic tank, basically,
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:23.520]  and that he's about to be indicted, so anything you hear him saying is groveling to Mueller.
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:28.520]  So he basically, when you hear Corker, you're hearing Mueller, just like when you hear Jimmy Kimmel,
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:33.520]  as if anybody still watches him, he admits he gets his every word talking points from Chuck Schumer.
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:37.520]  So when we talk about Corker, we're talking about Mueller.
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:43.520]  So why is Mueller saying all these things right now? Joining us is Roger Stone because it's bigger than just Corker.
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:51.520]  It's understanding the anatomy of a puppet and what they're doing as Hollywood collapses, both financially, ethically, culturally,
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:55.520]  as the NFL has now lost 35% of their viewers this year.
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:58.520]  It was 31%. It's like four or five points every week now.
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:02.520]  20 points before that in the last three years. A 50-plus point drop.
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:08.520]  They're in freefall. This is gorgeous. Pence walks out. They go, oh, how dare you? Just make him a bigger hero.
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:11.520]  They don't understand the public has broken with them.
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:14.520]  It's like a woman that leaves a man. She ain't been back for 10 years.
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:22.520]  He's still like, Martha's coming back soon. No, she's not. She'd rather die than live with you, you jerk.
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:28.520]  And it's the same story. It's like anybody that's out of a relationship and glad, it ain't ever coming back.
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:32.520]  It's never going to come back. It's over. It's bye-bye time.
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:37.520]  A lot of us in our relationship have spent many years later trying to get you back and you're like, are you joking?
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:43.520]  Never over my dead body. So joining us, Roger Stone, what do you make of this historic point?
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:48.520]  I mean, we're still in a serious fight and they could kill the president and they're trying to censor and it's bad.
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:51.520]  But at the same time, it's because they're getting their clocks cleaned.
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:54.520]  I mean, everything they do, in fact, we don't even need to be here.
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:59.520]  If they just talk, the public does the opposite. They are that anathema.
[1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:06.520]  Well, Alex, if I may steal a line from the late great Jackie Gleason, how sweet it is.
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:15.520]  I love to see this liberal gnashing of teeth. They thrash around because they understand the American people have caught on to 30 years of failure.
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:25.520]  The two-party duopoly is totally exposed by Trump, has been routed by Trump despite their best high-tech internet shenanigans.
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:35.520]  Despite being spent, outspent massively, despite having the mainstream media pimping for him, both in the old media and the new,
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:42.520]  he still pulled off the miracle of the political miracle of the century and they can't get over it.
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:50.520]  Since Election Day, they have tried to, first there was the recount, then there was the appeal to the Electoral College.
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:59.520]  They've been trying to destabilize him, to delegitimize him, but as America gains jobs, as America gains confidence,
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:07.520]  as America has a leader who stands tall around the world and no longer callers, the American people, the folks in flyover country,
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:13.520]  the folks who watch Infowars, we know what's really going on in the country. These folks are routed. They're beat.
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:19.520]  They can't win an election. They continue to thrash and smear the president.
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:32.520]  You have a former Defense Secretary or Defense Information Director steps forward two days ago and says that the president will resign.
[1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:40.520]  Mr. Clapper, James Clapper, says the president will resign if Manafort testifies. No, he won't. That's false. That's a lie.
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:48.520]  That's disinformation. There's nothing Paul Manafort could say about the president that would be embarrassing because there was no...
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:53.520]  They're just creating the idea, say, where's the resignation when it doesn't happen like Trump did something wrong.
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:58.520]  Everything they do is a lie. I mean, just take seeing another saying that Trump begged Corker.
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:03.520]  You told me behind the scenes a year ago that he was over there groveling and begging before he was even president-elect,
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:05.520]  and Trump just threw him out of there.
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:12.520]  The whole purpose of Corker visiting Trump at Trump Tower, which he told reporters Trump had invited him,
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:19.520]  in fact, he engendered his own invitation, was to stave off prosecution because he might be Vice President.
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:24.520]  That was supposed to be a signal to the FBI that who's breathing down his neck, let's be clear,
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:31.520]  he's making his massive foreign investments in hedge funds where he's clearly made millions profiting from information
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:40.520]  he learned as a U.S. senator to the Rita Chattanooga or the shorting of housing stocks and a dozen other financial schemes.
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:47.520]  This guy has lined his pockets. The FBI and the SEC were hot on his trail. We presume they still are.
[1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:51.520]  He didn't quit because he was tired. He didn't quit because he was disgusted.
[1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  He quit two steps ahead of the posse. That's the truth, Alex.
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:40:01.520]  Well, we've got your article up on infowars.com that Corker, the real reason he is resigning and not running again,
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:07.520]  isn't just because he saw Judge Roy Moore big victory and the other populist swings in every runoff race being lost
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:10.520]  by Republican-established candidates and Democrats.
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:14.520]  A total signal that the realignment is just now accelerating.
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:21.520]  You break down the huge investigation bullet point by bullet point that it looks like indictments could be imminent of Herr Corker
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:29.520]  and all of this attacking Trump flip-flopping as him supine on his back or, I guess, on his belly like a baby goblin
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:34.520]  dragging his little belly up to mommy begging Lord Mueller not to smash him.
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:39.520]  No, I think you put your finger right on it, Alex. He now believes it by trashing Trump.
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:45.520]  We can curry favor with the prosecutors and void time in the pokey. That's exactly what this is about.
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:48.520]  They got him by the shorthairs.
[1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:56.520]  And citizen journalists contacted me today about a whole new scandal in which the senator pressured a major car manufacturer
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:41:03.520]  to move and locate in his native Tennessee, and then he and his administrative assistant formed a partnership
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:10.520]  and quietly brought up all the land around the new but yet unannounced location.
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:17.520]  Citizen journalists, folks who are plugged in right here at InfoWars, brought us this stunning report and it all checks out.
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:20.520]  Wow, that is just classic corruption.
[1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:26.520]  It's very old-timey. I mean, this guy makes Lyndon Johnson look like Mother Teresa.
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:31.520]  He's looking more and more to me like Senator Corker would steal a hot stove.
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:34.520]  This is stealing in the Clinton genre.
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:40.520]  It's of that caliber where he comes to the Senate relatively modest in his finances.
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:45.520]  He's forced to amend and re-amend and re-amend his financial disclosures
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:51.520]  because he gets caught hiding millions of income that he never publicly reported.
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:54.520]  This is all at the InfoWars.com site.
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:42:04.520]  I mean, it is their chapter in verse and the FBI and the SEC under Obama and under Trump have been breathing down the good senator's neck.
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:09.520]  I see articles every day from CNN and others where it's total inversion of reality
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:16.520]  and then these weird videos that are just comical to watch, as you said, flailing pundits with almost no viewers.
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.520]  How long can this charade go on watching them flapping the wind like this?
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:27.520]  Well, sadly, unfortunately, as you know, Alex, there's a lot of stupid or I should say gullible people in America.
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:34.520]  But that really started to break up with the rise of an alternative media that is both vibrant and robust.
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:41.520]  As long as you have the InfoWars.com that does another fine alternative mainstream and conservative sites
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:46.520]  that will report the truth, then you have an alternative narrative
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:51.520]  and more and more people realize the plausibility of what they're being told by alternative media.
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:43:17.520]  All right, Roger Stone, thank you for joining us. Thank you so much. Call straight ahead. We'll be back.

[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:32.520]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:39.520]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:43.520]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
