[01:38.200 --> 01:43.120]  stations from on top buildings where they weren't just filling the mall they were filling other
[01:43.120 --> 01:50.920]  major side roads for miles well over 2 million people if you fill the mall and then the area of
[01:50.920 --> 01:58.840]  the capital that's about 800,000 it was well over 2 million CNN the New York Times the Austin
[01:58.840 --> 02:08.480]  American statesman where I live they all reported that it was thousands thousands a couple thousand
[02:08.480 --> 02:14.160]  well there you can see on your screen the time-lapse photography just of one area off the
[02:14.160 --> 02:18.480]  mall and then watch it fill up that street as you look back over two miles down that major
[02:18.480 --> 02:27.200]  thoroughfare completely totally jam-packed and filled for over two miles and that's just one
[02:27.200 --> 02:37.400]  shot from a camera on top of a building that is just one shot as people march down towards the
[02:37.400 --> 02:43.200]  mall one road and the foreign news took photos there's videos of it we haven't posted up on
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.680]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com scores of videos where it's just every major road in and
[02:48.680 --> 02:55.400]  around the central area of DC around the monuments and the mall and the capital just solid people
[02:55.400 --> 03:03.800]  everywhere foreign press estimates two million or more French news is reporting upwards of three
[03:03.800 --> 03:12.200]  million we don't know millions millions and you know when I saw info wars.com signs Ron Paul
[03:12.200 --> 03:17.720]  signs Rand Paul signs the media is trying to vulcanize this to make it a left right issue and
[03:17.720 --> 03:22.920]  say oh it was all Glenn Beck and I would say probably a third of it or so probably was Fox News
[03:22.920 --> 03:29.080]  people that don't want big government they didn't mind bush tripling the size of government and
[03:29.080 --> 03:33.360]  lying to them about WMD's but they don't like it that Obama's doing it with the gun control the
[03:33.360 --> 03:39.160]  open borders the government health care the national compulsory service the cap and trade taxes
[03:39.160 --> 03:47.640]  they're mad and but the bigger issue here is the media keeps lying earlier in the week with
[03:47.640 --> 03:53.680]  Obama's address to Congress on health care CNN admitted they double sample Democrats in their
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.560]  polls so two-thirds were Democrats one third were Republicans they announced it was a fair
[03:57.560 --> 04:03.320]  poll and said oh look his poll numbers went up after the speech before the speech they sample
[04:03.320 --> 04:11.200]  people against the health care 50% those for it 50% roughly Republicans Democrats then they did
[04:11.200 --> 04:16.960]  two-thirds Democrats and put out that fake poll there's all sorts of chicanery going on I want
[04:16.960 --> 04:22.600]  to hear from you on it there's also other demonstrations around the country 888-201-2244

[07:36.160 --> 07:43.760]  on top buildings foreign newscast two million or more conservatively filling the mall filling

[07:50.960 --> 07:58.480]  two miles back solid jam-packed people two miles in fact we're going to be playing that clip in a
[07:58.480 --> 08:04.720]  moment but the media spun this in national news said a couple thousand the Austin American
[08:04.720 --> 08:11.480]  statesman has the headline today thousands come out no ladies and gentlemen it was a lot more than
[08:11.480 --> 08:17.920]  thousands a lot more than thousands here's the awesome record statesman headline thousands rally
[08:17.920 --> 08:26.080]  with or against Obama they even spun it and this is the voice of the local statesman it's really
[08:26.080 --> 08:29.640]  the New York Times they they published a new York Times story but I got this from the statesman
[08:29.640 --> 08:34.280]  thousands rally with or against so they they number one distort and say it's thousands when
[08:34.280 --> 08:39.920]  it's millions and then they say oh and a lot were for Obama reading foreign news reports
[08:39.920 --> 08:45.960]  they're saying that maybe one out of 20 was an Obama supporter and I've watched scores of videos
[08:45.960 --> 08:51.880]  last night today and you do occasionally see a preprinted out by the White House official
[08:51.880 --> 09:00.040]  blue Obamacare sign but then you see all the hand-drawn grassroots signs by the people and look
[09:00.040 --> 09:06.560]  at that time lapse on screen as they just boils in and fills up the major roads marching towards
[09:06.560 --> 09:14.080]  them all that's just a building cam of one road leading to the mall that's easily a million people
[09:14.080 --> 09:21.440]  right there but again up to 2 million march to us capital to protest against Obama's spending
[09:21.440 --> 09:25.920]  and tea party demonstration mail online one of the big papers in England up to 2 million people
[09:25.920 --> 09:31.520]  march to the US capital today carrying signs with slogans such as Obamacare makes me sick and they
[09:31.520 --> 09:37.200]  protested the president's health care plan and what they say is out of control spending the line of
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.840]  protesters across Pennsylvania Avenue for blocks all the way up to the capital according to the
[09:41.840 --> 09:47.120]  Washington Homeland Security and emergency management agency that's right homeland security admits
[09:47.120 --> 09:51.200]  it was 2 million but that won't be in our news you have to go to foreign news to see these photos
[09:51.200 --> 09:59.120]  and videos notice CNN and others would show up close groups of people people were chanting enough
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.720]  enough and we the people others yelled you lie you lie and Pelosi has to go referring to California
[10:04.720 --> 10:11.280]  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi demonstrators wave us flags and held signs reading go green recycle
[10:11.280 --> 10:17.440]  congress and i'm not your ATM men wore colonial costumes and they listen to speakers who warned
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.760]  of judgment day election year 2010 yeah but then then republicans will stop posing like their
[10:23.760 --> 10:28.880]  opposition to big government and then they'll go in and sell us out until we realize that both parties
[10:28.880 --> 10:33.040]  are bought and paid for by offshore banks and make the issues about abolishing the federal
[10:33.040 --> 10:37.200]  reserve and arresting the criminal cartel that's carrying the sound and i will say looking at the
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.640]  videos and photos and talking to people that were there most of them were alex jones listeners
[10:42.640 --> 10:49.200]  ron paul supporters libertarians that is being hijacked by kind of the mainline roger ailes run
[10:49.200 --> 10:57.280]  rush limbaugh glenbeck arm of things but doesn't matter as soon as republicans get in a year and
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.400]  a half and lie and sell everybody out you will have a complete wake up happen at that point
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.640]  you've already got congressman 11 percent approval rating again both parties are hated
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.120]  the people will give the republicans one more chance to abolish the fed one more chance to get
[11:11.120 --> 11:15.920]  us out of these wars that's like when ron paul went to c pack the big republican meeting this year
[11:15.920 --> 11:22.080]  he got a standing ovation when he said republicans aren't for these corrupt preemptive wars and
[11:22.080 --> 11:27.040]  almost everyone we played the video here you can go watch it just go watch ron paul's speech at c pack
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.000]  with limbaugh in attendance standing up just more than 8 000 people in attendance clapping
[11:34.000 --> 11:40.160]  see it's an illusion that conservatives and libertarians want war it's a fraud but see they
[11:40.160 --> 11:45.040]  made it a left right issue so a lot of republicans got behind the war but but you look at obama he
[11:45.040 --> 11:51.200]  took 50 000 troops out of iraq sent those to afghanistan and put another 50 000 contractors
[11:51.200 --> 11:58.000]  into iraq another 40 000 contractors into afghanistan that's a 90 000 troop increase
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.080]  how is 90 000 more troops in central asia in the middle east downsizing the war i mean i want to
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.040]  ask all you phony liberals this but again zoom in for me guys on the document cam here on the mail
[12:09.040 --> 12:14.800]  online up to two million march to us capital to protest against obama spending and tea party
[12:14.800 --> 12:25.840]  demonstration and then i ask everyone out there watching how can all the foreign media get it right
[12:25.840 --> 12:31.520]  but the new york times thousands rally with or against obama they're not even saying this was
[12:31.520 --> 12:38.080]  a rally against obama they're not even saying this is the american people speaking out and saying we
[12:38.080 --> 12:44.960]  don't want big government we don't want 120th excuse me 20 percent not 120th i wish it was 120th
[12:44.960 --> 12:51.040]  they were trying to take over 20 percent of the economy that's left that isn't government controlled
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.520]  health care insurance corrupt and got problems and insurance companies are out of control that's why
[12:55.520 --> 13:00.640]  if you really study things you'll learn that actually big insurance companies are funding
[13:00.640 --> 13:05.200]  obama and the takeover over of health care because they're going to get liability protection
[13:05.200 --> 13:11.120]  they're going to get to water down the care this is totally sick so i want to talk about that with
[13:11.120 --> 13:20.480]  listeners when we get back at 8882012244 now we are also in the next hour after i take a bunch of
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.960]  calls on this subject and a couple other economic issues we need to go over that are very serious
[13:24.960 --> 13:33.760]  and russia saying yeah we did meet with israel israel is planning to hit iran last week secret
[13:33.760 --> 13:40.080]  mission by benjamin yet and yahoo to israel from israel to moscow to meet with putin
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.920]  and medmi evyev their president and the media tried to spend and said oh no it was just an
[13:45.920 --> 13:52.000]  economic secret visit no israeli prime ministers don't make secret visits to russia unless they're
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.360]  planning something military is that lebanon probably not lebanon doesn't border russia
[13:57.360 --> 14:03.600]  iran does for more than a thousand miles and russia has built those nuclear reactors the basher
[14:03.600 --> 14:11.840]  reactor and others and russia has said do not attack them they have said do not go after them
[14:12.960 --> 14:17.760]  and they've said that over and over again and now putin who's the real president of russia
[14:17.760 --> 14:21.360]  he's saying he may run again for president but the prime minister of latimer putin
[14:21.360 --> 14:29.600]  and his minion the president are saying don't attack this is a bad idea in a speech so that's
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.440]  clearly what netanyahu's visit was about and we should discuss what's going to happen if there is
[14:35.440 --> 14:44.160]  a preeminent strike on different facilities and infrastructures all over iran iran and its capital
[14:44.160 --> 14:50.080]  city of tehran so i want to get your take on that as well and then in the second hour the final
[14:50.080 --> 14:56.080]  hour today i've never had something i've done on air that was this big we've been all over
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.840]  international national news hundreds of times but i told you last weekend i said what i'm going to

[20:33.200 --> 20:39.440]  world order and we are now going to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast with
[20:39.440 --> 20:44.000]  some key news interspersed i know callers will probably call in on a thousand subjects and
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.880]  that's fine i love the random wheel of fortune different issues being brought up but i'd like
[20:48.880 --> 20:58.880]  to hear from you what what do you think of the us media the lying corporate horror media
[20:59.600 --> 21:04.320]  telling you that a couple thousand people demonstrated in dc and hardly giving it any
[21:04.320 --> 21:08.880]  coverage and then spending it and saying and of the couple thousand that did demonstrate it was
[21:08.880 --> 21:13.520]  some of more obama supporters and want the health care and the others were these crazy
[21:13.520 --> 21:19.520]  racist tea party people are not allowed to say socialism it's racism trying to silence free
[21:19.520 --> 21:25.760]  speech what do you think of the new york times headline carried in papers all over the country
[21:25.760 --> 21:32.400]  thousands rally with or against obama as president leads a health care rally in minneapolis
[21:33.120 --> 21:38.640]  protesters in washington denounce his policies meanwhile the foreign press is reporting
[21:38.640 --> 21:45.120]  two million and you look at the video easily two million let's go ahead and go to your phone
[21:45.120 --> 21:51.600]  calls steven houston you're on the air steve yeah good afternoon out um i want to comment
[21:51.600 --> 21:56.160]  on what you're asking about i want to use that to lead into about this past friday with nine
[21:56.160 --> 22:02.720]  eleven um it's pretty obvious to me why the u.s media is reporting this this way uh they're
[22:02.720 --> 22:07.600]  controlled by the same people as you pointed out that invented tv and that's the pentagon
[22:07.600 --> 22:12.480]  you know you've got the black propaganda machine they always put their spin on everything and
[22:12.480 --> 22:17.760]  they're going to make it go towards what the new world order's agenda and by black propaganda for
[22:17.760 --> 22:23.600]  the people are so programmed to political correctness to not be able to speak in england they're banning
[22:23.600 --> 22:28.560]  saying it's a black day it's a dark day it's everything's racism when you say black propaganda
[22:28.560 --> 22:34.960]  you mean black ops or deceptive political information that's the dictionary definition
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.880]  of it you mean black ops disinfo yeah i used that term because i heard on your show a couple
[22:40.880 --> 22:45.760]  weeks ago where you pointed out it's not just propaganda you have two kinds you put out what's
[22:45.760 --> 22:51.280]  called white propaganda which is the good kind it's information to inform people and empower them
[22:51.280 --> 22:55.520]  yes here's the definition for those that don't know people think of propaganda itself is bad
[22:55.520 --> 23:02.480]  propaganda if i say hey i got great hamburgers and great enchiladas and great uh root beer floats
[23:02.480 --> 23:08.480]  i sell at my diner and i think they're great hamburgers and enchiladas then it's it's propaganda
[23:08.480 --> 23:15.200]  but it's it's white propaganda uh you know if if if i happen to like some type of tennis racket
[23:15.200 --> 23:20.640]  and i say i think this is a great tennis racket or i think my my car is great that's white propaganda
[23:20.640 --> 23:27.040]  if i believe it's true and it is true it's black propaganda if you lie it's black propaganda when
[23:27.040 --> 23:32.800]  the media says it's racist to disagree with the president they know that's a lie they're putting
[23:32.800 --> 23:38.640]  it out there to silence debate go ahead right exactly and uh this leads into the main reason
[23:38.640 --> 23:45.120]  i called uh you know about 9 11 this past friday i uh you know throughout the days i was able to i
[23:45.120 --> 23:50.240]  listened to various talk shows both local and nationally and of course you have all these
[23:50.240 --> 23:55.760]  neocons these fake conservatives out there all talking about how you know we need to continue
[23:55.760 --> 24:01.120]  this war on terror defend our country blah blah blah and i called into a comfortable album and i
[24:01.120 --> 24:07.200]  heard other people calling as well uh you know saying that 9 11 was an inside job and the first
[24:07.200 --> 24:14.320]  guy i called i said to him can i have a conversation with you about 9 11 that is disagrees with the
[24:14.320 --> 24:20.720]  general you know spin that's been put out there without being labeled a conspiracy theorist or
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.800]  a not job he said okay and i said i have several points i'd like to go through and then ask you
[24:24.800 --> 24:29.760]  some questions okay can we take these one at a time i said sure i didn't even get to my first
[24:29.760 --> 24:34.480]  point he started asking me well do you believe planes hit the tower sure well do you believe
[24:34.480 --> 24:39.920]  that terrorists you know these Muslim fundamentalist flip people's throats with box cutters i said no
[24:39.920 --> 24:45.360]  okay well have a nice day and you know i was so infuriated alex because the thing is and it
[24:45.360 --> 24:50.800]  doesn't surprise me because that's the way these media whores are but it's just the thing that you
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.760]  know these people say they're fair and balanced you know like foxes but yet it's just like and
[24:55.760 --> 25:01.280]  this is the main thing with charlie sheen what he's done this guy has so much guts and fortitude and
[25:01.280 --> 25:06.640]  has done done such a service to the american people in the world as well as you but he's his
[25:06.640 --> 25:12.880]  point that here i put all these valid points out with all the uh you know all the links to the
[25:12.880 --> 25:19.760]  documentation and rather than even address those all they want to do is engage in i appreciate your
[25:19.760 --> 25:26.080]  call we're going to cover that next hour but what charlie sheen has done is tens of millions of
[25:26.080 --> 25:31.840]  people have read his letter to the president that has the 20 points major british newspapers like
[25:31.840 --> 25:38.240]  the telegraph their biggest paper next to the guardian printed the entire 20 points in the
[25:38.240 --> 25:45.360]  newspaper i'm going to go to that story later and people are going wow this has links to the
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.880]  washington post in 2007 with six of the ten commission members admitting there was a cover
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.080]  up and that they wanted a criminal investigation of the pentagon and white house wow this has
[25:56.080 --> 26:01.680]  links to fbi translators saying that al-qaeda was taking orders from the cia up until the day
[26:01.680 --> 26:08.720]  of 9 11 wow and just these 20 points that are irrefutable why we're saying investigate 9 11
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.040]  i mean the government staged gulf atonkin to get us into vietnam attacked our ships and made it up
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.880]  that the vietnamese did they staged all these other attacks northwoods is an abc news us government
[26:18.880 --> 26:23.840]  plan to bomb cities hijacked jets by remote control i mean you start going to the evidence
[26:23.840 --> 26:27.600]  but they never want to address that that's coming up i want to get everybody else's call though
[26:27.600 --> 26:34.240]  mike and florida you're on the air go ahead hey alex how you doing today good uh one of the
[26:34.240 --> 26:39.440]  things about the health care that i'm really so afraid of is uh things that have happened in
[26:39.440 --> 26:47.600]  the last couple of months i mean very very chipped has partnered with receptors to develop
[26:47.600 --> 26:54.000]  capabilities in their chip to detect swine flu for those that don't know the very chip
[26:54.800 --> 27:00.880]  there is a section in the bill we've gone over it that talks about the feds funding radio frequency
[27:00.880 --> 27:06.480]  id chips implanted in people and the mexican government's made the just department people
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.040]  take them other governments are having people take them they really are pushing this to the school
[27:11.040 --> 27:17.920]  kids to the u.s. military it really is happening and then just recently on september 8th uh
[27:17.920 --> 27:24.880]  their chip acquired steel vault which is an id stuff company and now the new company will
[27:24.880 --> 27:34.400]  be called positive id that was just announced on september 8th so i mean what i'm afraid of

[27:40.320 --> 27:45.120]  think they're that far along now but i appreciate your call they're using the the fear and the
[27:45.120 --> 27:51.440]  fear mongering over this you know hysteria over the swine flu when regular flu kills 36,000 plus
[27:51.440 --> 27:55.360]  people a year this has only killed a few thousand in the u.s. it's not even up to that yet seem to
[27:55.360 --> 28:01.280]  up to a thousand yet it's like 4,000 worldwide 500 and something a week ago i think the numbers are

[28:06.240 --> 28:11.840]  startpage.com another good search engine and they're just using it to put their federal forces in

[33:39.280 --> 33:45.600]  governments into little secret police arms now remember over a month ago i got on air and i said
[33:46.240 --> 33:50.800]  republicans and democrats if they're for nafta if they're for gat if they're for the wars if
[33:50.800 --> 33:56.240]  they're for higher taxes if they're for the police state governor rick perry senator cornyn right here
[33:56.240 --> 34:01.280]  in austin getting booed at every event they go to that was on the news locally democrats all over
[34:01.280 --> 34:06.000]  the country i was seeing the youtube videos four five six months ago being booed off the stage
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.280]  and i said there's a revolution starting a peaceful resistance and then a month ago the media
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.160]  started saying starting with with uh... Lloyd dogged here in austin oh those were paid lobbyists
[34:16.160 --> 34:21.280]  that came to a local randall's grocery store was all staged but my neighbor happened to just be
[34:21.280 --> 34:26.400]  their grocery shopping and saw it and said no it wasn't staged they all said including his
[34:26.400 --> 34:31.040]  constituents he'd mail letters to that they didn't want government run health care and so he said
[34:31.040 --> 34:36.800]  i'm gonna leave and then they booting so the media has gone from saying it's all staged
[34:36.800 --> 34:43.680]  just to using sexually derogatory terms against these diverse crowds black people hispanics white
[34:43.680 --> 34:50.080]  people conservatives libertarians democrats that no obama's a liar but the media is trying to
[34:50.080 --> 34:54.400]  balkanize people and then lying and saying there was a few thousand people in dc when there were
[34:54.400 --> 35:00.000]  at least two million according to the foreign press in the video so does this anger you and is this
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.400]  going to discredit the mainstream media even further can you believe anything they write and say

[35:37.520 --> 35:41.920]  read the thing but i thought i found out went through it and i think the fine print at the bottom

[36:02.800 --> 36:07.840]  not just sheen and his big nine eleven story breaking on this show uh... but also the latest
[36:07.840 --> 36:15.040]  flu developments anything else uh... revo godspeed to you and your family sir sure thank you you too
[36:15.040 --> 36:20.480]  look going back to monday and my special announcement that youtube video that went viral i said in the
[36:20.480 --> 36:28.160]  video the big announcement starts tuesday and runs through the next several weeks
[36:28.160 --> 36:35.120]  his letter to the president in the form of a discussion he wanted to have with him was only
[36:35.120 --> 36:40.640]  the kickoff of the ballgame we're only at halftime right now next week sheen's back on there'll be
[36:40.640 --> 36:47.360]  more big announcements i'm just going to leave it at that i'll recap the chronological order of
[36:47.360 --> 36:54.080]  what happened and more of our battle plan in the next hour but it's obvious every caller's
[36:54.080 --> 36:59.680]  bringing this up so i'll just mention it now the big announcement was that sheen was going to ask
[36:59.680 --> 37:04.640]  for the president to meet with him and the victims family members that sheen his friends with
[37:05.600 --> 37:12.240]  like bob macklevin and others who lost his son joey uh... bobby uh... bill doy lost his son joey
[37:12.240 --> 37:19.120]  in the towers that's what the big issue was and that he's calling out the debunkers to a debate live
[37:19.120 --> 37:26.080]  on tv larry king live or whatever i mean roiders picked that up his call for a debate and then
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.640]  and that video is also viral right now he's challenging them that we should go to the
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.680]  alex jones channel on youtube later and cue that video up for next hour where charlie uh
[37:35.680 --> 37:43.920]  hartman shoot uh... issues the challenge so that's coming up so that's what this was about
[37:43.920 --> 37:47.280]  was not just letting the control corporate press the military industrial complex
[37:47.280 --> 37:52.480]  that clearly stage nine eleven being able to fear monger use nine eleven to expand more wars
[37:52.480 --> 37:58.560]  first they say iraq did it now pakistan and it's it's just an excuse to for this militaristic
[37:58.560 --> 38:05.040]  imperialism simple that we pay for and that demonizes america's name and so that's the larger
[38:05.040 --> 38:10.160]  program and and the some of the media and people that are jealous and stuff and the alternative
[38:10.160 --> 38:16.560]  media tried to spin it that my big announcement was just the sheen letter that's classic straw
[38:16.560 --> 38:22.320]  man in my video in my announcements on the radio i said it starts tuesday and it goes for several
[38:22.320 --> 38:29.520]  weeks you've only seen the first phase and and look at it hundreds of newspapers fox news msnbc
[38:29.520 --> 38:35.760]  abc news limbaugh hundreds of news publications roiders houston chronicle times of london
[38:35.760 --> 38:43.360]  london telegraph french news japanese news german tv latin american tv that was the whole point

[50:05.200 --> 50:13.360]  you tommy andrew in new york you're on the air go ahead mr jones good afternoon welcome good thank you
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.800]  uh in our local newspaper yes they showed the closest this person must have climbed as close as
[50:18.800 --> 50:24.400]  they could to the very front to deliberately obscure the fact that there were literally you
[50:24.400 --> 50:31.760]  know an absurd number of people yeah no no almost all us newspapers i searched for hours today
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.880]  hours getting ready for this show i mean i'm addicted to news and not singing in
[50:37.440 --> 50:44.240]  not uh hardly even fox could you find video from on top the buildings just every major
[50:44.240 --> 50:49.040]  roads street filled the mall filled from the mall all the way to the capital jammed with
[50:49.040 --> 50:56.320]  upwards of two million people and homeland security estimated that's the source for the daily mail
[50:56.320 --> 51:01.920]  the british paper homeland security said two million the government says two million and the
[51:01.920 --> 51:08.160]  new york time says a few thousand i mean this this photographer must have clogged the eyes
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.360]  out of old ladies and old men with kings just to get as close as they possibly could to the front
[51:13.360 --> 51:19.280]  because it was just literally yeah they went down to the stage they went down to the stage and showed
[51:19.280 --> 51:25.360]  the front of the crowd and then said look a couple thousand people i've had local austin media at pro
[51:25.360 --> 51:30.480]  gun events pro second amendment events we've had and and pro sovereignty pro border events
[51:30.480 --> 51:34.640]  anti open border events and we might have two thousand people there in the news we'll go get a
[51:34.640 --> 51:40.640]  camera take a shot of the end of a line of people out on the edge and say a few dozen people were at
[51:40.640 --> 51:45.920]  the austin capital today the texas capital or buddy yet they take the picture after everybody's left
[51:45.920 --> 51:49.520]  and they're packing everything out making it look like oh nobody showed up when the history
[51:49.520 --> 51:55.680]  channel came to show me for a 911 hit piece 911 truth hit piece a few years ago i was about 600
[51:55.680 --> 52:00.720]  people at an event i was speaking to at ut i was another one in the main ballroom you know 1200
[52:00.720 --> 52:06.720]  people standing room only they turned back over a thousand that's what ut said but history channel
[52:06.720 --> 52:12.160]  came and showed during a recess five people in the bleachers and said that was who was there to see
[52:12.160 --> 52:20.800]  me total deception well just on a good note though in the same newspaper today in the same section
[52:21.920 --> 52:27.920]  those posters of mr obama with the joker face over it made it to our local newspaper it seems
[52:27.920 --> 52:33.360]  somebody put up and uh it seems you've been lighting a lot of little players as it were under
[52:33.360 --> 52:38.560]  a lot of people's backsides well they decided to put up their own posters calling the local mayor
[52:38.560 --> 52:45.600]  mayoral like uh on mr do little now get this the city spends over $2,000 overnight to remove all
[52:45.600 --> 52:50.640]  these posters but and the newspaper reporter made certain they were mentioning this they left all
[52:50.640 --> 52:58.000]  the info wars posters alone and one democratically controlled city probably because a lot of them
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.600]  were probably figuring it out for themselves and they're worried about their pension too and they
[53:01.600 --> 53:08.880]  see it all going down the you know what well well the reason i had the contest to worldwide put up
[53:08.880 --> 53:18.480]  obama joker info wars dot com posters and yes that was us folks was because i wanted to show people

[55:12.880 --> 55:21.280]  of people showing up it just shows how disconnected we are or they are from us um in in the sense that
[55:21.280 --> 55:28.320]  even i mean congress you know everything's just disconnected from the people and uh i hear your
[55:28.320 --> 55:33.200]  brother good points jt glad you chimed in with that tom in florida you're on the air worldwide
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.880]  hey great work alex uh like i was just thinking today we're like you know how with all the efforts
[55:38.880 --> 55:45.600]  that we've made since 9 11 and we were with the films the town hall meetings the uh you know that
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.400]  the groundswell of uh you know people talking to one another the blogs uh you know the internet
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.280]  sites the whole thing it has been great although it's been building slowly yet with this charlie
[55:55.280 --> 56:01.200]  sheen thing this week it seems entirely possible that on a worldwide basis or this perhaps whoever
[56:01.200 --> 56:06.640]  is a dancer for the cause of 9 11 truth uh more than anything that's happened in the last eight
[56:06.640 --> 56:12.960]  years perhaps and if that is indeed true would you not feel that uh this certainly would be
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.080]  indicative of early as a time to be using even more sophisticated psyops on the new world order
[56:18.080 --> 56:24.480]  well look i'm a limited person i can't do everything i ran this operation against the
[56:24.480 --> 56:29.920]  globalist it's in full swing now more announcements coming up probably tuesday or wednesday with sheen
[56:29.920 --> 56:36.160]  we're we're looking at which day to have him on this is only phase one and uh sheen was the bait
[56:36.160 --> 56:41.440]  he knows he's the bait that was his plan so this is called self-sacrifice uh he's not who the media
[56:41.440 --> 56:46.240]  says he is just to get the attack dogs to come in after him but then to read his 20 points
[56:46.240 --> 56:52.160]  because the average person doesn't know six of the 10 commissioners said it's a cover-up a lie
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.560]  the pentagon lied there should be a criminal investigation of what really happened they're

[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:05.840]  critical of mayor he said that the city left up the info wars.com posters that were put up a few
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:12.560]  weeks ago but when posters critical the mayor went up they were all taken down it says uh
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:17.600]  what happens in syracuse when you paste up a sign about the new world order nothing it stays there
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:22.000]  what happens when you paste up a sign questioning the mayor's performance it comes down immediately
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.720]  even if it takes 10 city workers the downtown committee scrapers glue remover and paint
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:34.240]  and it says 200 signs popped up with bright orange uh criticizing the mayor as a do little
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:40.400]  and they sure removed them see we had one contest about showing you your power with
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:45.520]  the obama posters no one the media would cover now we've got a new contest that closed last week

[1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:04.960]  at a lot of great entries we have them listed up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:10.560]  again about the people realizing they can stand up they can get involved that it's so shocking now
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:16.000]  for an american to exercise their free speech that it gets big attention when you do whatever
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.800]  your issue is just get involved it's exciting it's your birthright it's what will bring down the
[1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:26.080]  globalist they've been able to set up this whole system as we've been standing down
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:29.440]  sharing in texas you're on the air go ahead
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:40.160]  okay mom i just um had um a question for you i think we need to use the mainstream media's
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:47.440]  weapons against them i think um they've become so dependent on advertising money and that we can
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:54.720]  literally vote with our remote but what we need to choose to watch is is you know what we need to
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:03:01.040]  watch you know and and just completely boycott everything else so that we make them focus on
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:07.200]  the real issues force them to um using our using our dollars you know they're becoming
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:12.640]  more and more worthless but well well that works to a certain extent and spend time with your
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:18.080]  family don't waste your time just watching mindless sports and things they use to control you and these
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:25.680]  left right you know paradigm w w f events that they have on the media but one cluster bomb might
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:30.160]  cost a million dollars one cruise missile might cost a million one jet may cost a half billion
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:38.960]  nbcs owned by a big defense contractor at a certain point they don't care if you stop watching uh
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:46.560]  uh because the media is just just their propaganda arm i mean they do care but we have to also start
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:52.000]  our own media not just tune them out but everybody start your own media that means putting up posters
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:56.080]  or starting a neighborhood newsletter or starting a website or starting a radio show
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:04.240]  everybody needs to be heard go ahead oh absolutely um you know i i my i have you know
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:09.760]  a youtube account and i've been you know uploading videos about um different you know things uh

[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:23.840]  i get a lot of criticism you know about the vaccine you know exposing garter cell especially um and
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:28.160]  you know i don't understand the criticism specifically because they've already admitted
[1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:32.080]  that well that's probably paid bloggers yeah they've already admitted it's killing people and naming
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:39.600]  them exactly so it and you know um they're trying to turn it now into an illegal illegal immigration
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:46.000]  issue um i don't i really i don't know if i agree with that but turn what into an illegal alien issue
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:53.920]  um well there was a recent um article about a young immigrant woman who uh was denied citizenship
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:58.320]  because she refused to take the shot oh yeah stay there let's talk more about garter cell

[1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:51.520]  new york times trying to say a few thousand people were out at the tea party in dc when
[1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:57.520]  mainstream news in england and homeland security is told the british news we had two million people
[1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:03.440]  here and that's what it looks like to me from the camera shots on top buildings just every street
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:08.720]  road feeding into the mall from the mall to the capital jam packed everywhere
[1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:16.320]  but i wanted to go back to sherry melanie victoria zack and others sherry called in
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:20.720]  her in the last little short segment that some stations don't carry she was bringing up how she
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.800]  has a youtube channel and speaks out against the garden still shot and she gets attacked on there
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:30.640]  by some people and she says why is that when they admit mainstream news in fact we can google it
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:36.000]  right now garden cell deaths let's just do that in a few minutes show it to people that garden
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:42.160]  cell is causing people to die and and become paralyzed go ahead and make your point on the
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:48.640]  garden cell human papilloma virus injections well apparently um they included it in a list of
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:54.400]  vaccinations um required for immigrants seeking from u.s citizens um and there was a 17-year-old
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:09:00.800]  girl in uh colchester england who tried to trying to move to the united states and she is accusing
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:05.520]  the government of blackmailing immigrant girls and women by forcing them to receive a vaccine
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:11.440]  from adverse effects and questionable long-term efficacy um all women between the ages of 11 to
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:17.120]  26 must receive the vaccine as part of a mandatory immigration health exam and that's also happening
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:23.280]  in the u.s and perry tried to say it was the law the governor texas all perry really did was say
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:28.480]  i'm putting on the list of recommended shots to attend school but that's a recommendation they
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:34.880]  have a waiver form in the trials three years ago it was admitted people were dying and having
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:40.080]  autoimmune responses and becoming paralyzed and in england when they forcibly inject your daughters
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:44.560]  and they die or become paralyzed they threaten to arrest you this is in the times of london
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:50.400]  i remember a parliament on thursday about this if you were listening threatening you not to speak
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:55.360]  out when it kills your daughter or maims them oh yeah oh yeah and and not only that but it really
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:02.720]  wreaks of um it wreaks of kissinger and rumsel put together it really does because you know uh

[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:03.360]  so if the republicans don't immediately start auditing the fed and abolishing it and
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:07.600]  getting us out of the wars it's over for them and they'll put democrats back in in two years
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:11.520]  and then we're going to be in a full bore revolution that's why they want to use the flu

[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:14.160]  liking the health care proposal that the president has been pitching so just to forewarn our audience
[1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:19.440]  that there just might be some yelling about that kind of a statement while we're talking about
[1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:24.640]  congressman joe wilson all right so lisa you actually have some experience covering joe wilson
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:30.800]  went in south carolina he is not new to south carolina however he might be new to the national
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:38.800]  spotlight did this um i guess display this week seeing kind of in concert with the joe wilson
[1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:46.160]  that they know in south carolina well i'll tell you first of all if you can hear me this crowd is
[1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:49.680]  not just here about health care but they're here about a lot of issues that they're obviously

[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:10.160]  covered it for a long time and i'm telling you he's a man who does care about health care during the life of him he's also a man who i've seen display
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:16.480]  all right now remember last year at the dnc we're going to play this clip later when we get into the
[1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:24.080]  9-11 segment when we come back after the news i went with a bullhorn and people and chanted 9-11's
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:29.520]  an inside job that crowd was smart if you try to give a long speech yelling at a reporter from
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:36.160]  behind it doesn't go out over air it just sounds like noise but if you say tell the truth tell the truth
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:42.240]  or don't tax me or simple things it gets across the news all the armchair quarterbacks told me
[1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:49.040]  i should have given a long eloquent speech on the bullhorn no we said 9-11 was an inside job and
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:55.120]  google info wars dot com and it would have a massive effect but good job of the folks at the tea party
[1:22:55.120 --> 1:23:03.040]  but i'll play for the video audience people watching right now the time lapse video from
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:10.240]  just one major street two miles long leading to the capital for the demonstration and the foreign
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:14.880]  news reported all the major streets leading to the mall filled up this is a half a million people at
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:22.640]  least that you see congregate right there on your screen as they go to the mall this is a time lapse
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:28.400]  from on top of roof you can go up to prisonplanet.com and check it out for yourself how big was the
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:34.640]  crowd time lapse video shows magnitude of the rally and there it is for you but that's the title
[1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:38.400]  of the story for those that aren't prison planet on tv members just want to go to prison planet
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:44.960]  and watch that video clip for yourselves how long can the mainstream media get away with this you
[1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:54.080]  know on the jogging on the treadmill this morning i was i watched real time with bill marr that's
[1:23:54.080 --> 1:24:01.520]  the name of this stupid hbo show and i watched a lot of it and the whole thing was lies it was
[1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:07.040]  your racist if you criticize obama and all of his little pet guest would clap and agree oh you're
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:12.320]  such a genius reading off a teleprompter and then he would say things uh you know that we're just
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:17.200]  amazing no we don't want open borders we don't want to turn our guns in we don't like obama
[1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:22.640]  and the foreign banks along with the republicans stealing 23.7 trillion in the last 11 months and
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:32.640]  growing double the gdp uh we don't like all this corruption and we're sick of it and that's why but
[1:24:32.640 --> 1:24:37.680]  when you come in i mean they look bill marr cold bloodedly knows that the people that don't like
[1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:43.280]  obama aren't racist he knows that the majority of white people voted for obama he knows that people
[1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:49.600]  wanted to be magnanimous and friendly and try to put racial division behind but obama was put in
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:55.840]  power to create racial division and that's why cnn and msnbc and all of them get up there and say
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:25:02.160]  it is racist to show him as the joker it is racist to be against his health care they even on bill
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:06.400]  marr was i wish i would have been taping this but it was this week september 11th live show he did
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:12.720]  friday but i saw it this morning they showed fake drudge report headlines and said they were real
[1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:15.920]  because i know the bill marr showing up to know that he does that segment with fake headlines
[1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:22.560]  and the last time i watched it three weeks ago he showed fake he did a fake ronald reagan tape
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:28.160]  and said it was ronald reagan but just joked enough to where you know it's not real if you're smart
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:33.280]  but the average person he doesn't tell you it's fake he plays a fake ronald reagan tape three
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:41.840]  weeks ago and i watch today i watched and he showed fake drudge report headlines making fun of black
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:49.840]  people and i check drudge every day you are a race baiting race pimp racial dividing divide and
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:56.640]  conquer piece of trash bill marr and every show i notice he bashes families and people's kids and
[1:25:56.640 --> 1:26:00.800]  people having their kids at public events and keep your kids at home and don't have babies
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:08.720]  he's another eugenicist he's another elitist piece of trash and see folks george bush is in power
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:13.520]  tripling the size of government butchering the bill of rights launching wars lying about wmd's
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:20.720]  we exposing and when his daddy had a eugenicist who co-wrote this book paul ehrlich with john p
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:25.680]  holder into the white house science are we criticized him we criticized both parties
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:32.400]  because they're both on the same payroll it is that simple figure it out the minute you figure
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.800]  i don't most of you already know this but for new listeners the minute you get outside the left
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:40.880]  right paradigm the minute you figure out both parties are controlled and they fight over petty
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:45.920]  issues and the party out of power will criticize what's bad that's happening but as soon as they
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:49.920]  get in power they change their tune just like obama said he was gonna end the war immediately
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:54.240]  then he said 18 months then two years then now never he said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists he's
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:58.000]  hired more lobbyist than bush ever did he said he would get rid of the patriot act and warrantless
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:03.840]  wiretapping against the american people he expanded it and the list goes on and on indefinite
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:11.520]  detention secret arrest secret visits to the white house all of this obama has expanded what
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:18.000]  bush did because obama is a puppet now when obama was built up as this messianic savior
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:23.280]  who was going to save the world and they called him president of the world and superman and the
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:28.320]  one i had to come out and make the obama deception and point out he was a very dangerous puppet
[1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.520]  because if we would have allowed him as as a people to become this hitler malice stalling
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:38.720]  like julius caesar if we would have allowed that he could have been very dangerous right now
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:47.200]  he has the lowest approval rating in every rasmussen gallup you name it between 45 and 40
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:51.760]  depending on the poll but every one of those numbers anyway you cut it dice it slice it
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:57.520]  the lowest approval rating of any president in the hundred years of scientific polling
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:01.680]  if you don't believe me just google the term obama has the lowest approval rating of any president
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:09.360]  at this point in the presidency of anyone ever and i'm telling you he will stage a terror attack
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:12.800]  and i'm not the only one saying that i've heard glenn becky even say oh he may stage something
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:18.480]  michael savages said he'll stage a terror attack right stag event limbaugh said he'll use a crises
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:24.160]  and to hear glenn becky and limbaugh and savage talking about the new world order admitting a lot
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:30.160]  of its real now and getting top ratings is a good thing but i guarantee you when republicans get
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:35.280]  control of the house in a year and a half you are not going to hear this out of them anymore
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:39.120]  and i want you to hold them accountable at that time because all i want is a free country for
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:43.840]  my children i want this corporate takeover to end i mean go back we played the clips of glenn
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:49.200]  becky was for the banker bailout bill he was for the patreon act that's why i'm against these guys
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:55.040]  but as long as they're telling the truth somewhat that's why they're being demonized by media matters

[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:38.000]  about a month and a half ago and i'm gonna have him back on this week and we'll cover more of why
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:42.560]  we did this the way we did it and some other big announcements either tuesday or wednesday he's
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:46.960]  going to be on with us we're not sure which day we want to do it yet he's challenged fellow riley
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:52.320]  he's challenged john mccain's daughter that attacked him on the view to a debate on live tv
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:56.080]  we're seeing how that's going he's been in contact with the white house about having a meeting with
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:34:00.240]  them with nine eleven survivors including first responders that are questioning the official
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  story six of the ten nine eleven commission members that sixty percent say the official
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:11.120]  story was a fraud a cover up a lie there should be a criminal investigation not just a congressional
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:15.760]  investigation that's why charlie wrote his letter to the president that's why i went public in a
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:21.440]  video interview a taped interview and two live interviews on my weekday radio show last week
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:26.240]  and all those interviews and video interviews are up in the 20 minutes with the president section

[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:43.840]  that and there were quite a few even positive stories in the news including one in the first
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:48.880]  or second they debate which one's the biggest paper in the uk the uk paper the telegraph
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:53.680]  actually published his 20 bullet points and said what do you think of what charlie sheen has to say
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.400]  and they've written six articles i know of two of them were fair and balance the other four were
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:03.360]  hit pieces this was the most balance charlie sheen urges barack obama to reopen nine eleven
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:08.720]  investigation in video message and then it goes through his points the nine eleven commission
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:12.800]  six of the ten said there was a cover up should be a criminal investigation they linked to the
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:18.240]  washington post that charlie linked to that's exactly what charlie intended and then charlie
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:23.840]  sheen's video message you see there on the screen that one's over four hundred and twenty thousand
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:29.840]  views right now and there's thousands of versions of it people have grabbed clearly several million
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:36.160]  views number one video on youtube right now i shot the video at his home with him when that
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:40.320]  debuted thursday and became the most viral video on the internet by friday evening and still one
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:46.960]  of the most viral videos out there so i challenge people to go over all of these articles in the
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:50.960]  different pieces that have been covered he also linked to twenty minutes with the president but
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:57.440]  i commend the author of this particular story in london's paper that is also published in every
[1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:04.800]  major city of the uk this is the big paper in the uk uh it's again they argue the first or
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:10.480]  second between it and the guardian london telegraph with a fair story you just can't beat that but i
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:15.760]  wanted to show you the power of nine eleven true this is msnbc they attack me they attack me with
[1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:21.840]  a knife it's on video cut the cord in my bullhorn punch me in the stomach we had guys show up 15
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:26.240]  minutes later lucradowski and others with other bullhorn took it over again for two hours here's
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:32.640]  a clip live from msnbc when that happened of course here we are the second night of the democratic
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:37.520]  national convention out here in denver we've got some demonstrators out here this is a free country
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:42.800]  as you can tell they've got bullhorns and everything we're gonna try to uh ignore some of the crazier
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:47.440]  elements and hear from the people that are here to cover the convention and paying attention to it
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.320]  right now we've got jennifer palm we are former edwards of john edwards advisor and one of the
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:58.480]  most powerful men in california las angeles mayor and antonia via regosa how are you thank you sir
[1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:05.440]  we just have some time together uh you know uh i guess it's the old question of harridor's stick
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:12.640]  last night i never saw so much carry uh the charm of michelle obama she was downright
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:18.880]  fetching as a family member as a mother the children were divine the father was fatherly
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:24.720]  it was father knows best and rather it was the huckstables uh also there was a great sentimental
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:30.720]  moment with senator kennedy who's now sort of post-political tonight is it time to throw the
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:36.800]  red meat to this crowd and remind them why they're democrats mayor i think it's time for us uh to
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:43.760]  remind okay it goes on for two hours and then keith oberman came up said please stop he sent his
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:48.800]  producer out oberman had just exposed that shaney wanted to blow up us ships and blame it on iran
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.440]  so i said i'm tired we've been here two hours i've been beat up several times it's in the extras of
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:59.040]  the obama deception actually all the raw video of that and so we left but the point is that's the power
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:04.720]  of going out to these live events we're not playing mr nice guy anymore with the new world order and
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:11.520]  these corporate whores it's over now here's a hit piece from fox news here's a hit piece they play
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:17.520]  some clips from my charlie sheen video i put out and her all dough goes over every trick in the book
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:24.000]  it's about peer pressure charlie won't believe his eyes charlie's hurting the families uh charlie is
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:32.160]  crazy charlie you know decades ago used drugs uh when or or ily you know with the women has
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:38.160]  his own issues but the point is both of them do but the point is is that it's all peer pressure
[1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:42.240]  saying we're crazy when a new york times poll showed 84 percent don't believe the official
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:48.640]  story a cnn poll 83 percent the media always uses a script tower news service uh 36 percent
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:52.720]  believing it's a total inside job folks it's much higher than that you can just google
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:39:02.160]  84 percent believe 9 11 uh cover up you can see it but i wanted to play this as a textbook example
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:08.400]  of a hit piece this is one of three or ily's done and it's just absolutely pathetic but they're
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:12.400]  being forced to respond they're not just going to put 9 11 out there as a pretext to take our
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:17.360]  liberties anymore we're going to respond to demand a real investigation they also say charlie's just
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:23.360]  making stuff up charlie listed that the commission says it's a fraud six of the ten members he listed
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:28.000]  that fbi translators have come out and said been lied and worked for the u.s government till 9 11
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:33.920]  charlie brings up all these other key points let's go to that club the friday with her all those
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:38.880]  segments and i would continue our look at the far left visa v 9 11 listen to actor charlie shean

[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:36.880]  believes it's a total inside job they all went to the commission said the same thing i can go on and

[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:24.240]  because they continue to raise this preposterous notion that the united states government would
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:30.960]  be so hideously manipulative that we would kill almost three thousand of our own citizens
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:38.800]  as a pretext to going to war in afghanistan it is false on its face it is uh extremely insensitive
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:43.120]  and if it weren't for the fact that they are sincere but misguided i really would feel
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:50.080]  even more emotional about it but i think it is very very uh a negative vibe that uh it's it's
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:57.440]  one of these things like area 51 with the aliens in new mexico no matter how do you think she is
