[00:00:06.732 --> 00:00:13.677]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:17.980]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.844]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:41.527]  It's Monday, June 29th, 2021.
[00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:45.933]  The wheels have completely come off the COVID-19 fraud.
[00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.417]  Why did they never have a vaccine for just the basic common cold?
[00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.114]  The coronavirus is the main cause of the common cold.
[00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:58.337]  If you're debilitated on the right amount of vitamins and minerals, it will go in, it will replicate, and you will get sick.
[00:00:58.337 --> 00:00:59.597]  That's known science.
[00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:02.839]  Well, because there's too many variants of it.
[00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.140]  There's hundreds of thousands a year.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.840]  There's millions.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.881]  I mean, they're always finding more and more and more.
[00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.481]  There's just like fish in the sea.
[00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:14.043]  Influenza is a specific type of infection caused by a specific virus.
[00:01:14.043 --> 00:01:17.285]  So that's usually influenza A or influenza B virus.
[00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:22.307]  The cold, on the other hand, is caused by hundreds of different types of viruses.
[00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:27.090]  And it's our body's defenses that defeat that 99.999% of the time.
[00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:43.037]  Not taking a vaccine that is specifically for one variant, when viruses are constantly changing and their own medical science admits, when you take a vaccine like this, it causes your body to slough off things that basically are other variants of the virus.
[00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:44.138]  That's even Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:46.876]  Well, here it is out of the VAERS reporting system.
[00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:51.497]  Reported deaths, COVID vaccines, more than the last 10 years combined.
[00:01:51.497 --> 00:01:53.778]  And I think about 1 in 40 is the real number.
[00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:55.278]  Not 1 in 10, not 1 in 100.
[00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:58.678]  About 1 in 40 of these things get put down as COVID.
[00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:00.259]  So it's 40 times worse than that.
[00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.040]  40 times 5,888 dead.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.500]  Oh, and now the FDA adds warning to COVID vaccine about risk of heart inflammation.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.881]  No longer just saying, oh, it's rare.
[00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.721]  It's very common.
[00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:21.796]  And estimates are now out that you're 500 times more likely to die from a COVID vaccine than from COVID if you are young.
[00:02:21.796 --> 00:02:28.599]  Who urges fully vaccinated people to continue to wear masks as Delta COVID variant spreads?
[00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.161]  Oh, a variant of the cold virus.
[00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.602]  My goodness, we can't ever leave our houses again.
[00:02:33.602 --> 00:02:35.042]  People better wake up now, folks.
[00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:39.965]  BBC, Andrew Marr says he caught COVID after getting the vaccine.
[00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.586]  Because I got coronavirus last week.
[00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:50.128]  I'd been double-jabbed earlier in the spring and felt, if not king of the world, at least almost entirely immune.
[00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.429]  And yet I got it.
[00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.630]  Bill Maher, finally waking up.
[00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.631]  He's totally, absolutely getting it now.
[00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.752]  And saying, wait a minute.
[00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:03.753]  We've got Google and Facebook invested at the Wuhan lab.
[00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:06.774]  We've got them invested billions in these vaccines.
[00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:09.115]  And then they're involved covering up?
[00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:10.947]  That's criminal!
[00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:18.372]  Facebook banned any post for four months about COVID coming from a lab.
[00:03:18.372 --> 00:03:29.980]  A Wall Street Journal reporter asked the head of Google's health division, notice that they don't do autofill searches for coronavirus lab leak the way they do it for any other question.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.586]  And the guy said, well, we want to make sure the search isn't leading people down pathways that we would find to be not authoritative information.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.763]  Well, you were wrong, Google and Facebook.
[00:03:42.763 --> 00:03:44.405]  We don't know.
[00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:48.328]  The reason why we want you is because we're checking on this s***.
[00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:53.774]  He said, we want to ensure the first thing users see is information from the CDC, the WHO.
[00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:55.175]  That's who I'm checking on.
[00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:58.598]  The WHO has been very corrupt about a lot of s***.
[00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:00.420]  The CDC has been wrong about a lot of s***.
[00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:07.150]  This is outrageous that I can't look this information up and now they're doing it with this drug Ivermectin.
[00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.533]  They threw Brett Weinstein off YouTube or almost.
[00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:12.094]  He's one strike away.
[00:04:12.094 --> 00:04:15.738]  YouTube should not be telling me what I can see about Ivermectin.
[00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:18.220]  Ivermectin isn't a registered Republican.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.721]  It's a drug.
[00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:21.903]  They're obsessed with depopulation.
[00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:23.204]  It's their cult.
[00:04:23.204 --> 00:04:25.807]  So they paid to have the viruses found in the wild.
[00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.068]  They paid to have them spliced.
[00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:28.489]  Facebook and Google.
[00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.371]  Facebook and Google aren't just big tech companies.
[00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:35.093]  They are the tip of the New World Order attack system.
[00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:39.735]  They are the trillion pound gorilla on our back.
[00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:41.776]  Flawless victory.
[00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:05.323]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at emplowarestore.com.

[00:08:02.483 --> 00:08:09.788]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:16.592]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[00:08:16.592 --> 00:08:23.617]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[00:08:23.617 --> 00:08:28.180]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.382]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[00:08:30.382 --> 00:08:32.983]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[00:08:32.983 --> 00:08:34.825]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:37.366]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:41.649]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:48.894]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times better.
[00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:52.056]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:09:17.888 --> 00:09:19.990]  I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.613]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[00:09:25.613 --> 00:09:32.058]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:39.263]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah, I was out of touch.
[00:09:39.263 --> 00:09:40.944]  But it wasn't because I didn't know when
[00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:48.666]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:52.570]  Okay, I've got some unbelievably important news.
[00:09:52.570 --> 00:10:05.981]  Just over-the-top admission by the UN Global Government Takeover System concerning their COVID-19 power grab here in just a moment in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada.
[00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:15.369]  And that ties into these so-called behavioral vaccines and superhero vaccines and things they were talking about decades ago.
[00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:23.100]  That they'd already developed as gene therapies that killed a large percentage of people that did the gene therapy.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.621]  It'll work for some people, but others, it kills them.
[00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.122]  Usually liver failure.
[00:10:29.122 --> 00:10:33.563]  So we've got that information coming up here in just a moment.
[00:10:33.563 --> 00:10:37.404]  Let me just get this out of the way.
[00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:40.705]  Because I'm 47, my mind's still pretty sharp.
[00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:43.846]  But 10 years ago, my brain wouldn't have done this.
[00:10:43.846 --> 00:10:45.386]  And I caught it after I went to break.
[00:10:47.407 --> 00:11:00.711]  And when I got a lot of things on my mind and I was already thinking about other stories and just not really fixating on Joe Biden, I guess channeling Joe Biden, I said something that was incorrect last segment.
[00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:06.533]  Most of what I said about pulling out of Afghanistan and saying it's unwinnable, that was true.
[00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:16.936]  And following some of the Trump policies of trying to get the different warring factions to stop killing each other in Syria, at least on paper, Biden's been saying he'd do that.
[00:11:18.007 --> 00:11:25.493]  But when I said that he was saying normalize relations with Assad or there'll be sanctions, that was completely wrong.
[00:11:25.493 --> 00:11:26.854]  And I knew it once I went off air.
[00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.676]  I went, wait a minute, pull that up.
[00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:30.757]  And I was, you know, I was incorrect.
[00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.118]  And I don't know why I said that.
[00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:32.959]  I'm fixing it.
[00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.501]  Just five minutes after I messed up.
[00:11:35.501 --> 00:11:38.624]  And it says, citing sanctions, U.S.
[00:11:38.624 --> 00:11:42.587]  cautions Arab states against normalizing ties with Syria's Assad.
[00:11:43.446 --> 00:11:49.068]  So they keep trying to keep sanctions on it and kick him out, though they don't want a water war, at least on the surface.
[00:11:49.068 --> 00:11:52.789]  So I guess that's my brain hoping for peace, being too optimistic, basically.
[00:11:52.789 --> 00:11:53.009]  U.S.
[00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:57.211]  warns allies of sanctions for those who engage with Syria's Assad regime.
[00:11:57.211 --> 00:11:58.091]  There it all is there.
[00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:00.812]  So that is corrected in real time.
[00:12:00.812 --> 00:12:05.934]  We are not like Brian Stelter, that speaketh with forketh tongue on purpose.
[00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.455]  But we do occasionally make mistakes to our
[00:12:09.984 --> 00:12:10.965]  Extreme anger.
[00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:11.925]  I'm very mad at myself.
[00:12:11.925 --> 00:12:14.646]  I'm going to slap myself in the face right now, but whatever.
[00:12:14.646 --> 00:12:16.728]  That's just part of life, isn't it?
[00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:18.949]  Okay.
[00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:29.334]  You know, I'm not trying to build up suspense on this, but if I just cover this, if I went and shot a special report on this after the show today,
[00:12:30.385 --> 00:12:40.467]  And put it up on Bandot Video, it'd probably get a million views, and then Tucker Carlson would pick it up, and everybody would be talking about it, and we could do something about it, and really hurt the globalists, and help ourselves.
[00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:47.589]  But if I just release this information now, like it's no big deal, this will go nowhere.
[00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:48.449]  And I don't know why that is.
[00:12:48.449 --> 00:12:55.691]  We have this giant audience, our biggest show is the weekday show, millions, over 2 million people an hour, conservatively.
[00:12:57.023 --> 00:12:57.383]  Tune in.
[00:12:57.383 --> 00:13:02.805]  That's not like, oh, our radio stations have a reach of, you know, 200 million people, but that doesn't mean they're tuning in.
[00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:03.365]  No.
[00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:06.686]  On our radio stations, 2 million people tune in every hour.
[00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:09.887]  Over a million end up tuning in one way or another online, we know.
[00:13:09.887 --> 00:13:13.688]  Later, tens of millions listen to the bootleg podcast every day.
[00:13:13.688 --> 00:13:18.669]  I mean, we reach, conservatively, 10 million people a day.
[00:13:18.669 --> 00:13:22.010]  The big question is, how do we get those amazing men and women all over the world
[00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:31.826]  To go to Band.Video or InfoWars.com and find an article or a video every day that they think is most important and to share that little devil.
[00:13:31.826 --> 00:13:34.888]  That's how we win the war against the globalists.
[00:13:34.888 --> 00:13:40.872]  So, this report is just really, really, really big.
[00:13:40.872 --> 00:13:46.616]  But in the interest of time, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit it right now.
[00:13:46.616 --> 00:13:48.838]  And I just hope this goes viral because it needs to.
[00:13:48.838 --> 00:13:49.759]  This is such a big deal.
[00:13:52.537 --> 00:13:55.800]  Swab's five books.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.942]  And yes, I've read all five of them.
[00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:11.393]  And the reason I don't like reading them is it makes me get so angry that I don't know what to do because he doesn't even hide that they did the lockdown on purpose.
[00:14:11.972 --> 00:14:14.393]  He doesn't hide that they cooked the viruses up.
[00:14:14.393 --> 00:14:17.375]  He doesn't hide they're going to take over our bodies in his own words.
[00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:21.877]  He doesn't hide that it's about shutting down free speech and having big tech censoring the opposition.
[00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:24.779]  He doesn't hide it's about big pharma making all the money.
[00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:26.019]  He doesn't hide any of it.
[00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:35.144]  That arrogant monster that looks like Nosferatu, looks like the most evil Bond villain, is freaking Dr. Evil.
[00:14:35.144 --> 00:14:39.366]  He arrogantly sits there and does this to us.
[00:14:39.366 --> 00:14:41.367]  And the UN that he used to head up,
[00:14:43.143 --> 00:15:00.768]  He's actually run the policy at the U.N., then develops the plan, they put it forward, and when you get a city like Austin, or a city like New York, or a city like Toronto, or a city like L.A., they follow the exact orders of the U.N.
[00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:02.969]  Just like Big Tech will tell you, oh, the U.N.
[00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:07.570]  doesn't allow you to talk about Ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine, or Inesivir.
[00:15:08.422 --> 00:15:10.764]  We don't care if you're a congressional hearing with U.S.
[00:15:10.764 --> 00:15:12.785]  Senators with top scientists.
[00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:24.152]  We do not let you talk because we are in charge.
[00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:27.194]  It's incredible.
[00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:32.277]  And so remember over a year ago documents came out from the Canadian provincial governments
[00:15:33.343 --> 00:15:45.009]  Saying, we're going to have unending lockdowns, we're going to train folks to live like this, it's to cut carbon footprint, and to bring in a national world medical ID card, which Klaus Schwab said on national television.
[00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:46.310]  And then finally, microchips.
[00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.991]  People go, oh, this isn't real.
[00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:51.273]  You could search engine the document and find it all over the world.
[00:15:51.273 --> 00:15:57.836]  Yes, it was real, and then you saw it happen exactly like they said.
[00:15:57.836 --> 00:16:01.779]  Just like you go to a play, and it's got the program, and it tells you, oh,
[00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:11.581]  At this part, at the end, Dorothy clicks her red slippers and goes back to Kansas.
[00:16:11.581 --> 00:16:15.784]  Or it's like on a DVD, you go to the menu and it tells you what each chapter is about.
[00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:17.726]  We know the next chapter.
[00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:19.707]  We know what's going to happen.
[00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:22.749]  So I'm going to cover this more next hour when Barnes is on with this as well.
[00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:25.792]  She's involved in lawsuits trying to stop it.
[00:16:25.792 --> 00:16:30.375]  But from Canada, the same country in lockstep with the New World Order and the UN and China,
[00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:42.925]  They now have a major state, a province of Canada, on TV.
[00:16:42.925 --> 00:16:50.391]  Health Canada says, will prevent groups from gathering in order to stop the spread of unauthorized information.
[00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:55.375]  And you see videos where they come arrest people at their houses for being online criticizing the lockdown.
[00:16:55.375 --> 00:17:00.019]  Had a bunch of guests on and arresting preachers.
[00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.000]  Arresting preachers.
[00:17:01.698 --> 00:17:02.539]  You see it all.
[00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:03.920]  This is the Soviet Union.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.261]  This is Nazi Germany.
[00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:06.002]  And it's here.
[00:17:06.002 --> 00:17:08.003]  No longer about health.
[00:17:08.003 --> 00:17:15.049]  Canada will prevent groups from gathering in order to stop the spread of unauthorized information.
[00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:19.813]  Health Canada!
[00:17:19.813 --> 00:17:21.034]  It's always about that.
[00:17:21.034 --> 00:17:28.460]  In the videos out of Germany, where they bust into the doctor's apartment when he's on FaceTime or whatever, you know, talking to a group of people online on Zoom.
[00:17:30.323 --> 00:17:32.664]  These people are on a scale of 1 to 10.
[00:17:32.664 --> 00:17:36.247]  A 10 when it comes to tyrants.
[00:17:36.247 --> 00:17:45.793]  So, here ladies and gentlemen is the clip out of Nova Scotia externalizing the method, admitting total tyranny out in the open.
[00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:56.421]  I'm wondering about the injunction banning public gatherings and whether there really is a need for such a far-reaching one given the trajectory we're on now.
[00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.242]  So, I mean, I think it's still there.
[00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:05.504]  We still have, you know, bringing large numbers of people together.
[00:18:05.504 --> 00:18:08.845]  It can present some risk.
[00:18:08.845 --> 00:18:11.386]  We'll continue to look at that.
[00:18:11.386 --> 00:18:23.931]  But I think the other purpose of the injunction is to prevent, you know, groups that are spreading, deliberately spreading false information that can actually create risk.
[00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:29.514]  The information itself, if listened to, creates risk to the public as well.
[00:18:29.514 --> 00:18:34.998]  And that certainly is a need to manage that misinformation campaign as well.
[00:18:34.998 --> 00:18:36.899]  Canada is under martial law.
[00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:41.883]  They must keep lockdowns and not let gatherings get together because they might say the government's tyrannical.
[00:18:41.883 --> 00:18:48.768]  Kind of like the new national strategy that Biden put out a week and a half ago says questioning lockdowns is an act of terrorism.
[00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:51.654]  And the National Jewish Congress here in the U.S.
[00:18:51.654 --> 00:18:56.400]  says, arrest anyone that questions it and put them in jail.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.582]  Alright, that's the New America.
[00:18:57.582 --> 00:18:58.503]  We'll be right back.
[00:18:58.503 --> 00:18:58.884]  Stay with us.
[00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:06.243]  Infowars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:19:06.243 --> 00:19:08.905]  That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years.
[00:19:08.905 --> 00:19:19.831]  And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:24.074]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[00:19:24.074 --> 00:19:29.177]  Now regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[00:19:29.177 --> 00:19:30.898]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[00:19:31.398 --> 00:19:36.500]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.101]  It's essential in the body.
[00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:41.883]  But we have our amazing Tri-Iodine, a big shipment came in.
[00:19:41.883 --> 00:19:45.245]  We're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[00:19:45.245 --> 00:19:50.887]  That is Survival Shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[00:19:50.887 --> 00:19:56.970]  Tri-Iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more powerful at the cellular level.
[00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.591]  You and your family will love it.
[00:19:58.591 --> 00:19:59.631]  It's incredible for your body.

[00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:09.156]  The globalists are having their revolution, but for humanity has to have its revolution.
[00:20:09.156 --> 00:20:22.863]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled
[00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:26.418]  Slaves.
[00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:27.158]  Worse than slaves.
[00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:31.219]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:38.742]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[00:20:38.742 --> 00:20:48.785]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[00:20:48.785 --> 00:20:51.686]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[00:20:52.922 --> 00:20:55.123]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[00:20:55.123 --> 00:20:55.923]  Freedom or slavery.
[00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:57.404]  Good or evil.
[00:20:57.404 --> 00:20:58.664]  It is a spiritual battle.
[00:20:58.664 --> 00:21:02.526]  And InfoWars is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:07.648]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:21:44.426 --> 00:21:46.267]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[00:21:46.267 --> 00:21:47.547]  It's very bittersweet.
[00:21:47.547 --> 00:21:50.848]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[00:21:50.848 --> 00:21:53.088]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:21:53.088 --> 00:21:54.489]  But I don't care about that.
[00:21:54.489 --> 00:21:56.049]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.606]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[00:22:18.606 --> 00:22:21.971]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:23.493]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:24.675]  But let's just say this.
[00:22:24.675 --> 00:22:25.996]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:28.460]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.721]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:22:32.721 --> 00:22:33.781]  They're great products.
[00:22:33.781 --> 00:22:35.302]  Plus they fund the operation.
[00:22:35.302 --> 00:22:38.483]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:39.343]  Do they fund freedom?
[00:22:39.343 --> 00:22:40.443]  No, a lot of them don't.
[00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:46.885]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[00:22:46.885 --> 00:22:48.625]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:51.446]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[00:22:52.026 --> 00:22:55.148]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[00:22:55.148 --> 00:23:05.514]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[00:23:05.514 --> 00:23:08.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:17.863]  Yeah.
[00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:48.809]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:48.809 --> 00:23:52.355]  I'm going to get more into this big story in the next hour.
[00:23:52.355 --> 00:23:58.907]  How do we fight back against the UN-directed shutdown of free speech online, shutdown of demonstrations in the streets?
[00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:09.875]  It's not just in Canada or Germany or England that they've gone and harassed people at their houses, or Australia, and arrested people that were organizing outdoor protests against the lockdown.
[00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:16.017]  It was big tech that would ban anybody's Facebook or Twitter that tried to organize demonstrations here in the U.S.
[00:24:16.017 --> 00:24:19.879]  And in many cities, they'd send police out to attack you.
[00:24:19.879 --> 00:24:26.881]  Oh, but Black Lives Matter, Antifa, if they wanted to burn some buildings down, well then it was mostly peaceful.
[00:24:26.881 --> 00:24:28.022]  This is big megabanks.
[00:24:29.452 --> 00:24:45.603]  Looting the world, collapsing the planet, starving the third world, and using useful idiot community college brainwashed people that they're fighting the man when they're trying to bring down their very country and become total slaves.
[00:24:45.603 --> 00:24:47.624]  It is insane.
[00:24:47.624 --> 00:24:50.246]  And then I will open the phones up after Barnes leaves us.
[00:24:51.884 --> 00:25:15.921]  And we're going to take your calls on whatever subject you want to mention, but I could do the whole show on this, and in fact, the name of the broadcast today, if you go to InfoWars.com, the title that we put on this show is, DARPA Announces Superhero Vaccine That Takes Over This Subdermal Implant, The Entire Body!
[00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:17.142]  And you see, 60 minutes,
[00:25:19.082 --> 00:25:22.683]  Saying, oh, the troops are all going to have a chip that tracks them.
[00:25:22.683 --> 00:25:27.145]  And, oh, we're going to give you vaccines that make you where you're not depressed or you don't use drugs anymore.
[00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:29.826]  Or, oh, vaccines that where you don't have children anymore.
[00:25:29.826 --> 00:25:42.611]  Oh, and now Stanford, that is DARPA's spokesperson, says they're creating superhero vaccine that takes over all the DNA in your body so you don't get Alzheimer's, heart attacks, or liver failure again.
[00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:44.931]  Yeah, right.
[00:25:44.931 --> 00:25:46.532]  The superhero jab.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.341]  Well, what do they call it in communist China?
[00:25:50.341 --> 00:25:57.365]  China has done human testing to create biologically enhanced super soldiers, says top US official.
[00:25:57.365 --> 00:26:14.535]  For 20 years, they tried to get mRNA technology authorized, but every time they did animal studies, a good percentage of the animals would die of heart attacks, stroke, bloody lungs, or, or, or liquefied liver.
[00:26:14.535 --> 00:26:15.476]  Don't just believe me.
[00:26:17.614 --> 00:26:31.080]  The discoverer of mRNA, the inventor of mRNA vaccines says people should not be forced to take experimental COVID vaccines and that they will kill more people than they help especially young people.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.722]  But you don't need to listen to Dr. Robert Malone.
[00:26:34.722 --> 00:26:38.423]  He's just world famous and the expert.
[00:26:38.423 --> 00:26:44.046]  You're only allowed to listen to the UN and you just heard the public health spokespeople up in Canada.
[00:26:44.796 --> 00:26:51.179]  Up in Nova Scotia, saying, oh, we're not letting people go out and have public gatherings!
[00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:57.501]  The lockdown never ends because you don't want them sharing information!
[00:26:57.501 --> 00:27:09.166]  Here's the UN Director of the WHO admitting their plan for more face masks, the vaccines don't work, and then from 11 years ago, my analysis and others about what we're really facing.
[00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:13.028]  That a vaccine will complement the other tools we have.
[00:27:13.818 --> 00:27:15.480]  Not replace them.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.204]  A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic.
[00:27:20.204 --> 00:27:22.846]  Surveillance will need to continue.
[00:27:22.846 --> 00:27:27.610]  People will still need to be tested, isolated and cared for.
[00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.714]  Contacts will still need to be traced and quarantined.
[00:27:31.714 --> 00:27:37.439]  Communities will still need to be engaged and individuals will still need to be careful.
[00:27:38.522 --> 00:27:41.464]  We still have a long road to... You sounded urgent.
[00:27:41.464 --> 00:27:50.269]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines.
[00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:57.933]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[00:27:57.933 --> 00:27:59.474]  Who's behind all this?
[00:27:59.474 --> 00:28:00.534]  The Bilderberg Group.
[00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:05.477]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their forced depopulation agenda.
[00:28:05.477 --> 00:28:07.278]  And they want to do it through the medical system.
[00:28:07.558 --> 00:28:10.120]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.323]  We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions.
[00:28:14.323 --> 00:28:16.164]  This is being done by design.
[00:28:16.164 --> 00:28:18.525]  They kill you slowly over time.
[00:28:18.525 --> 00:28:20.347]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[00:28:20.347 --> 00:28:22.768]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to.
[00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:24.509]  Dr. Rima Labo.
[00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:30.313]  But she doesn't live inside the United States because she's so concerned about all the police state developments that are taking place.
[00:28:30.313 --> 00:28:33.075]  But if you can get her to come up here and talk to you.
[00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:34.396]  She's a medical doctor.
[00:28:34.396 --> 00:28:35.957]  She's treated heads of states.
[00:28:35.957 --> 00:28:37.178]  And she really understands
[00:28:37.658 --> 00:28:39.039]  What's happening on the inside?
[00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:40.759]  Where's the doctor now?
[00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:41.720]  She's in Panama.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.280]  Panama.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280]  So I gotta find her.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.181]  You can either go down to Panama and talk to her or somehow get her up here.
[00:28:46.181 --> 00:28:47.302]  She doesn't like to come up here though.
[00:28:47.302 --> 00:28:49.422]  Here's her phone number and information in Panama.
[00:28:49.422 --> 00:28:50.003]  Alright.
[00:28:50.003 --> 00:28:56.485]  I'm gonna work on it.
[00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:58.746]  Within days, arrangements are made.
[00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:08.621]  The renegade physician agrees to fly into a small airfield in the Midwest, only if the governor will meet her there, and only for a brief time.
[00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:25.222]  Dr. Lebeau, how are you?
[00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:25.982]  I'm fine.
[00:29:25.982 --> 00:29:27.522]  Thank you, Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:29:27.522 --> 00:29:28.463]  Thanks for coming.
[00:29:28.463 --> 00:29:31.864]  Now, you've left the United States of America.
[00:29:31.864 --> 00:29:33.504]  Yes, sir, I have.
[00:29:33.504 --> 00:29:34.425]  Why?
[00:29:34.425 --> 00:29:36.725]  I do not feel safe living in the United States.
[00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:36.905]  Really?
[00:29:36.905 --> 00:29:38.806]  Do you want to come and sit down?
[00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:39.606]  No, sir.
[00:29:39.606 --> 00:29:40.466]  I'd rather not.
[00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:43.947]  You'd rather just be here so you can make a fast exit if you have to?
[00:29:43.947 --> 00:29:45.428]  As soon as you and I finish.
[00:29:46.469 --> 00:29:48.110]  I'm leaving the country again.
[00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.851]  Why?
[00:29:48.851 --> 00:30:02.204]  Because in a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[00:30:02.204 --> 00:30:04.085]  What is it about these vaccinations?
[00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:05.747]  You think that they're bad?
[00:30:05.747 --> 00:30:09.751]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization
[00:30:10.411 --> 00:30:15.536]  has decided that we have 90% too many people.
[00:30:15.536 --> 00:30:24.205]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:28.750]  Doctor, the response is going to be, and you're crazy, how can you say this stuff?
[00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.912]  I show them the documentation.
[00:30:32.487 --> 00:30:34.348]  Now, this is pretty shocking.
[00:30:34.348 --> 00:30:36.829]  This process has already been ongoing.
[00:30:36.829 --> 00:30:48.733]  To make matters worse, we know that the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain a substance called squalene.
[00:30:48.733 --> 00:30:56.096]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase the response.
[00:30:57.156 --> 00:31:06.663]  If I inject you with squalene, your immune system will attack the squalene, but then it starts attacking all of the parts of your body.
[00:31:06.663 --> 00:31:09.985]  What does that look like when you meet a person to whom that is happening?
[00:31:09.985 --> 00:31:12.067]  It looks like Gulf War Syndrome.
[00:31:12.067 --> 00:31:18.771]  It looks like every joint in the body swollen and intolerably painful and immobilized.
[00:31:18.771 --> 00:31:21.313]  This is in these shots they're going to give us?
[00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:23.374]  It's in some of them, but the U.S.
[00:31:23.374 --> 00:31:25.576]  government has a trick up their sleeve.
[00:31:26.096 --> 00:31:29.079]  Which is?
[00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:32.202]  Still ahead, the conspiracy shocker.
[00:31:32.202 --> 00:31:35.725]  A group that's even more powerful than the Bilderbergs.
[00:31:35.725 --> 00:31:38.688]  What that means is a holocaust.
[00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:40.690]  A genocidal holocaust.
[00:31:48.363 --> 00:31:57.749]  They will induce a pandemic using the nasal mist vaccine, which is a live attenuated virus.
[00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:01.731]  That means that if I take it, I can infect you.
[00:32:01.731 --> 00:32:03.452]  You're going to get the flu.
[00:32:03.452 --> 00:32:05.774]  Everybody around us is going to get the flu.
[00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:15.940]  Then the United States government, based on their statements that they've already made, will say, oh my, we have a pandemic.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.802]  Oh my goodness, we don't have enough doses.
[00:32:18.802 --> 00:32:31.749]  So we'll add, mix squalene at the 90,000 injection stations that the Department of Health and Human Services announced that they will ship the vaccines to.
[00:32:33.411 --> 00:32:37.995]  People lining up, sometimes by the hundreds, for an H1N1 flu shot.
[00:32:37.995 --> 00:32:42.379]  What that means is a holocaust.
[00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:49.105]  A genocidal holocaust.
[00:32:49.105 --> 00:32:54.330]  Men and women will sicken and die, and those who survive will be infertile.
[00:32:56.776 --> 00:33:06.745]  If people start dying massively from these inoculations, won't there be like a revolution, a rebellion, a rising up from the peasants?
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:14.787]  Briefly, until the 420,000 U.S.
[00:33:14.787 --> 00:33:17.890]  military swing into action.
[00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:33.064]  If you remember NORTHCOM, the Northern Command, was created not long ago to, among other things, relocate the population in the event of civil disorder or pandemics.
[00:33:37.657 --> 00:33:47.055]  Doctor, what you're saying is that if people refuse these vaccinations that FEMA is going to put them into almost like concentration camps around the country?
[00:33:47.055 --> 00:33:48.879]  I think you have to leave out the world.
[00:33:51.371 --> 00:33:56.496]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now, and at FullWorthStore.com.
[00:33:56.496 --> 00:34:01.961]  July 4th, 2021 is now upon us, and that means our yearly big sale is here.

[00:34:54.567 --> 00:34:57.968]  What are champions made of?
[00:34:57.968 --> 00:34:59.108]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:35:05.661 --> 00:35:06.721]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.333]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:37.795]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:35:37.795 --> 00:35:39.496]  888-253-3139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[00:35:39.496 --> 00:35:40.918]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:35:40.918 --> 00:35:42.559]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:36:02.003 --> 00:36:05.806]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:36:05.806 --> 00:36:09.549]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:36:09.549 --> 00:36:11.530]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:18.015]  Robert Barnes is going to be joining us to cover the waterfront.
[00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:36.693]  ...of key issues and how to fight all the forced inoculations and tyranny, the latest on the move to indict the president, and so much more.
[00:36:36.693 --> 00:36:40.315]  That is coming up next segment.
[00:36:40.315 --> 00:36:43.356]  And then after he leaves us, I'm going to open the phones up today.
[00:36:43.356 --> 00:36:56.620]  There is so much to get to, so much to cover, so much that I really must get to today, because this is a globalist revolution of putting things in our bodies that completely change our bodies, just like Klaus Schwab said.
[00:36:58.263 --> 00:37:08.149]  InfoWars has proven that we know what we're talking about, and that we are a major game-changing organization for a pro-human future.
[00:37:08.149 --> 00:37:14.772]  And I really appreciate the listeners in the last 27 years that have helped me stay on the air.
[00:37:14.772 --> 00:37:26.919]  But now more than ever, being one of the only independent media organizations on the planet that actually understands what we're facing, and now as our prominence, and now as people's respect for us really grows to all-time highs,
[00:37:28.169 --> 00:37:35.175]  It's more important now than ever that we stay on air to continue to challenge the globalist plague.
[00:37:35.175 --> 00:37:38.037]  Our mission now is more important than ever.
[00:37:38.037 --> 00:37:40.780]  Our importance is more central than ever.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:45.083]  That means your importance and the guests and the family that is in full war.
[00:37:45.083 --> 00:37:49.447]  So, I want to thank the listeners for their support and their prayers.
[00:37:50.177 --> 00:38:00.364]  But because of the lockdowns of the last year and the supply chain breakdowns, because we sell high quality supplements as one of our main funding mechanisms, we're unable to get a lot of these products in.
[00:38:00.364 --> 00:38:06.088]  And so best sellers, that we can keep them in stock or able to fund this, aren't there.
[00:38:06.088 --> 00:38:14.014]  That's why most of the really great stuff that we have is not available most of the time, because the country is just the world's falling apart.
[00:38:14.014 --> 00:38:19.678]  So we've got to substitute some of those sales with t-shirt sales and water filter sales and storable food sales.
[00:38:20.805 --> 00:38:27.230]  Which are all things that spread the word and wake people up in the case of t-shirts or that make your water healthy and better for you and your family.
[00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.273]  We have the highest rated gravity-fed filters and storable food.
[00:38:30.273 --> 00:38:34.336]  Everybody needs that with the inflation and the lockdowns and globalism.
[00:38:34.336 --> 00:38:35.918]  These are all no-brainers.
[00:38:35.918 --> 00:38:40.722]  We go out and bring you the very, very best and we hope you will get it from us so we can stay on air.
[00:38:40.722 --> 00:38:47.267]  So please, so we can go to the border and so we can go to all of the country and all the world and cover Bilderberg Group.
[00:38:47.267 --> 00:38:49.149]  And I want to go cover Bohemian Grove again this year.
[00:38:50.049 --> 00:38:54.233]  So we can do that, I need you to be our sponsor and support us.
[00:38:54.233 --> 00:38:59.657]  And you do that by going to InfoWarsTore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:38:59.657 --> 00:39:08.704]  If you go to the front page of InfoWarsTore.com, right there in the middle, you can see where it says, Become a Sponsor, because that's what it is.
[00:39:08.704 --> 00:39:10.526]  Give a gift, a one-time gift.
[00:39:10.526 --> 00:39:11.927]  Sign up for recurring gifts, $5, $10, $20, $100 a month.
[00:39:14.835 --> 00:39:24.201]  We really need that because that is 95% of the money coming in from a donation actually funds us instead of a product.
[00:39:24.201 --> 00:39:28.864]  Remember, we make 30, 40% on it when it's on sale, sometimes even less.
[00:39:28.864 --> 00:39:38.249]  So we bring in tens of millions of dollars, but only have millions to operate with and running our own infrastructure, our own crews, our own reporters, our own legal, facing a globalist attack.
[00:39:38.249 --> 00:39:39.310]  We can't do it without you.
[00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.212]  So right now, we're running the yearly
[00:39:43.112 --> 00:39:44.414]  Fourth of July.
[00:39:44.414 --> 00:39:45.696]  Super sale right now.

[00:39:47.138 --> 00:39:48.400]  Double Patriot points.
[00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:52.543]  And many of our best-selling items, 40 to 60% off.

[00:40:05.391 --> 00:40:08.173]  Survival Shield X3, 60% off.
[00:40:08.173 --> 00:40:10.074]  BioTruth Selenium, 50% off.
[00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.015]  Ultimate Krill Oil, 40% off.

[00:40:15.689 --> 00:40:17.952]  Instead of going up in price, they're cutting 10%.
[00:40:17.952 --> 00:40:20.475]  They're only doing this two more times this year.
[00:40:20.475 --> 00:40:23.099]  In July, and again in November before Christmas.
[00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:24.701]  And then MyPatriot has to go up in prices.
[00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:25.662]  We have their whole catalog.
[00:40:26.368 --> 00:40:29.009]  For an additional 10% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:40:29.009 --> 00:40:31.650]  Nobody has a deal even near that.

[00:40:44.353 --> 00:40:46.514]  So please, help keep us in the black.
[00:40:46.514 --> 00:40:48.454]  Help keep us out at the tip of the spear.
[00:40:48.454 --> 00:40:50.955]  Because when you finance us, it's like buying war bonds.
[00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:56.597]  You literally are fun in the organization that Brian Stelter and George Soros and others completely hate.
[00:40:56.597 --> 00:40:57.697]  So please keep us on air.

[00:42:40.455 --> 00:42:43.717]  We're now into the second hour on this live June 28th.
[00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:48.872]  Monday Broadcast, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:42:48.872 --> 00:42:58.895]  And my good friend and really smart historian, also one of the top lawyers in the country, Robert Barnes joins us for the hour to cover the waterfront.
[00:42:58.895 --> 00:43:04.017]  First off, what does it mean that we've been vindicated that COVID-19 came out of a lab?
[00:43:04.017 --> 00:43:08.398]  What does it mean when even Bill Maher comes out and says, Big Tech's working with
[00:43:09.221 --> 00:43:13.202]  The very pharma companies that are poisoning us and that launched COVID-19.
[00:43:13.202 --> 00:43:17.603]  What does it mean that the wheels are coming off of that?
[00:43:17.603 --> 00:43:27.986]  And then we see the expansions in Australia, in Europe, in Canada, really Commonwealth countries are some of the worst hit by tyranny, saying, oh, we don't want the martial law to end.
[00:43:27.986 --> 00:43:36.188]  We don't want to let public gatherings happen unless it's approved sites where you've all been inoculated and do what we say, because people are communicating
[00:43:37.455 --> 00:43:39.535]  And sharing disinformation.
[00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:50.438]  So it's not enough to censor people in their homes or online or send the police to their houses in the UK, in Australia, in Spain, in Germany, knocking down doors, arresting women because they were online.
[00:43:50.438 --> 00:43:51.938]  Remember in Australia?
[00:43:51.938 --> 00:43:54.579]  Criticizing the lockdown, saying it was a fraud.
[00:43:54.579 --> 00:43:57.399]  Oh, that's not approved UN information.
[00:43:57.399 --> 00:44:03.300]  That's not approved by Tedros over there who now says, oh, the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.341]  Got to wear a mask forever.
[00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:05.481]  Got to take more vaccines.
[00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:07.522]  There will always be new variants.
[00:44:07.522 --> 00:44:09.503]  Everything we told you has happened.
[00:44:09.503 --> 00:44:16.707]  A giant criminal corporate big pharma scam through the UN with the communist Chinese rushing in now Hawaii.
[00:44:16.707 --> 00:44:19.489]  If you want to come to Hawaii, you've got to have an inoculation.
[00:44:19.489 --> 00:44:21.130]  That's a state in the U.S.
[00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.331]  They're violating interstate commerce.
[00:44:23.331 --> 00:44:25.212]  They're violating federal and state law.
[00:44:25.212 --> 00:44:26.193]  How do we push back?
[00:44:26.193 --> 00:44:27.774]  There is some good news.
[00:44:27.774 --> 00:44:32.897]  Community College waives vaccine requirements citing diversity and equality saying
[00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.013]  There was secret testing on people in this country.
[00:44:36.013 --> 00:44:37.736]  Oh, finally some common sense!
[00:44:37.736 --> 00:44:39.138]  Another one!
[00:44:39.138 --> 00:44:45.346]  Make-A-Wish Foundation backs down and decides not to mandate vaccines for wish kids!
[00:44:46.613 --> 00:44:51.636]  Meanwhile, it's coming out that it's causing all this death and illness and heart attacks, and it isn't rare.
[00:44:51.636 --> 00:45:02.664]  So to give us the state of where he thinks we are, how things are going for the power grab of the system, and what he thinks is going to happen next is Robert Barnes, because we're not just about giving you cutting-edge information.
[00:45:02.664 --> 00:45:09.328]  We're about next month's news today, next year's news today, and that's why we are the Vaunted Info Wars.
[00:45:09.768 --> 00:45:14.911]  Brought to you by We The People, and that's you, the viewers and listeners, and I salute you yet again.
[00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:25.316]  We weren't supposed to be on air during this takeover, but because we are on air, now our vision, our understanding, our analysis of the world is becoming mainstream, and the New World Order is in panic mode.
[00:45:25.316 --> 00:45:27.097]  Their gas lighting is failing.
[00:45:27.097 --> 00:45:29.258]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[00:45:29.258 --> 00:45:32.680]  This is a momentous time, the best of times, the worst of times.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.081]  How would you address the situation?
[00:45:38.962 --> 00:45:42.464]  Constitutional freedoms and liberties are going to be maintained and sustained in America.
[00:45:42.464 --> 00:45:44.526]  I'm sorry, Robert, we've got a little technical problem.
[00:45:44.526 --> 00:45:46.747]  Let's just, got his mic up now.
[00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:49.289]  Robert Barnes, please continue now.
[00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:50.470]  Hey, no problem.
[00:45:50.470 --> 00:46:07.041]  I think this is a defining time for the country because we're going back to a century ago, back to the rise of the Nazi Party, back to the rise of fascism, back to the rise of communism, back when human experimentation and eugenics and forced sterilizations were commonplace.
[00:46:07.601 --> 00:46:18.894]  I mean, I don't know if people saw, but last week, Britney Spears said about how her conservatorship has basically put her into a case of forced sterilization and forced involuntary medication.
[00:46:18.894 --> 00:46:28.344]  That's how dangerous and precarious a position we're in, and they're trying to extend that to the entire world, because that's what these new compelled, coerced vaccines are all about.
[00:46:28.864 --> 00:46:31.446]  And I think the fight back against this is essential.
[00:46:31.446 --> 00:46:42.715]  Now, because there's been so much good fight back in the court of public opinion, people have been asserting their rights to their employers, to their educational institutions, to their local schools, to their local governments.
[00:46:42.715 --> 00:46:47.778]  There's been a whole bunch of people that have stepped back from the brink and have said they're not going to do forced vaccines.
[00:46:47.778 --> 00:46:49.660]  But there are a few that have said they're going to continue.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:47:11.891]  The city of San Francisco is talking about it and what can be exclusive to announce today is I'm looking at filing suit against Madison Square Garden within the next week or two because they're trying to force all of their employees to take the vaccine regardless of whether or not they've even already had COVID, which is better immunity than the vaccine can even offer according to multiple medical studies.
[00:47:12.131 --> 00:47:14.475]  And if you've already had it, it can kill you.
[00:47:14.475 --> 00:47:15.677]  Medical doctors even say that.
[00:47:15.677 --> 00:47:19.243]  So, it's a corporation playing doctor in our lives.
[00:47:19.243 --> 00:47:21.226]  What happened to my body, my choice?
[00:47:21.226 --> 00:47:23.290]  Barnes, that's why I'm so glad you came on today.
[00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:25.193]  I tried to get you on Friday or Sunday, you couldn't.
[00:47:25.948 --> 00:47:36.913]  And then I had it in my notes yesterday to start the show off with Britney Spears and parallel how a conservatorship at 30-something years old has taken all of her rights.
[00:47:36.913 --> 00:47:40.855]  She's a slave that's got to work 360 days a year.
[00:47:40.855 --> 00:47:42.415]  They take most of the money.
[00:47:42.415 --> 00:47:46.517]  And under globalism, they make us all basically wards of the state.
[00:47:46.517 --> 00:47:47.738]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[00:47:47.738 --> 00:47:48.798]  You own nothing.
[00:47:48.798 --> 00:47:49.498]  You have nothing.
[00:47:49.498 --> 00:47:50.559]  You have no medical rights.
[00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:54.764]  This is the system trying to make us all bankrupt wards of the state.
[00:47:54.764 --> 00:47:55.985]  That's really their goal.
[00:47:55.985 --> 00:47:57.587]  And that was my own thought.
[00:47:57.587 --> 00:47:58.729]  Nobody else was saying that.
[00:47:58.729 --> 00:47:59.309]  You're saying it.
[00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:00.391]  Great minds think alike.
[00:48:00.391 --> 00:48:01.933]  That is exactly what this is.
[00:48:03.921 --> 00:48:04.282]  No doubt.
[00:48:04.282 --> 00:48:10.226]  If people want to see what the Great Reset's goal and ultimate objective is, see how the conservatorship has treated Britney Spears.
[00:48:10.226 --> 00:48:12.028]  She's required to work, but can't even.
[00:48:12.028 --> 00:48:15.030]  She has to use her own money.
[00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.432]  She has to pay lawyers to steal from her.
[00:48:17.432 --> 00:48:23.437]  Lawyers that are stealing from her, she has to pay them out of her own resources that she makes at their direction.
[00:48:23.437 --> 00:48:27.721]  She has an IUD in her body that she's not being allowed to take out.
[00:48:28.221 --> 00:48:30.943]  So they're controlling whether or not she can even have children.
[00:48:30.943 --> 00:48:33.105]  This is a form of forced sterilizations.
[00:48:33.105 --> 00:48:35.847]  They're forcing medications on her.
[00:48:35.847 --> 00:48:39.070]  Whenever she objected, they would force more medications on her.
[00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:42.813]  This has been going on for more than a dozen years.
[00:48:42.813 --> 00:48:47.357]  And the reason why she hadn't objected before was she was terrified at how they would make it worse for her.
[00:48:47.797 --> 00:48:54.379]  Not only that, they're forcing her to go to psychologists, disclose her most intimate secrets to these people, that is then used against her.
[00:48:54.379 --> 00:48:58.441]  So this is forced medication, forced sterilization, forced labor!
[00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:00.362]  She often doesn't want to do these work assignments.
[00:49:00.362 --> 00:49:04.403]  And that's what the lawyers are doing with their nanny state, with their COVID, with their big tech.
[00:49:04.403 --> 00:49:05.463]  They're doing this to all of us.
[00:49:05.463 --> 00:49:10.005]  They're gaslighting us, and using the same tactics that Hollywood uses to enslave children.
[00:49:10.465 --> 00:49:11.326]  Oh, exactly.
[00:49:11.326 --> 00:49:15.467]  I mean, you look at it, it's sort of William Faulkner's, to see the world through a grain of sand.
[00:49:15.467 --> 00:49:18.509]  People can see, I mean, first you had the music industry traffic.
[00:49:29.478 --> 00:49:30.658]  Uh, Britney Spears.
[00:49:30.658 --> 00:49:34.040]  Then you had the media traffic Britney Spears.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:40.422]  And for the last dozen years, American courts and the government has been trafficking Britney Spears.
[00:49:40.422 --> 00:49:41.382]  Uh, and that's it.
[00:49:41.382 --> 00:49:50.165]  And the dangerous, precarious precedent that sets all the legal theories and political theories behind conservatorship are the same as the Great Reset.
[00:49:50.445 --> 00:50:05.308]  That in the name of your health, they can do forced labor, forced medication, forced sterilization, control of all of your basic core freedoms and liberties, whether or not you even go on vacation or not, who you talk to, what doctor you pick.
[00:50:05.308 --> 00:50:06.389]  That's the goal and the objective.
[00:50:06.389 --> 00:50:12.170]  And if they can do it to someone this famous, this well-off, imagine what they can do to all of us.
[00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:15.150]  And that's why it's a perfect microcosm for what's going on.
[00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:17.551]  But what's also a perfect microcosm for what's going on
[00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:21.975]  Is the fact that she, like many and millions of Americans, are fighting back.
[00:50:21.975 --> 00:50:23.797]  When she understood that she did have rights.
[00:50:23.797 --> 00:50:26.700]  By the way, she was not allowed to pick her own lawyer in the proceedings.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.402]  Her lawyer was picked by the system.
[00:50:28.402 --> 00:50:30.564]  It's also like the way the system works.
[00:50:30.564 --> 00:50:32.726]  And that the lawyers are getting rich off of this.
[00:50:32.726 --> 00:50:35.589]  Nobody has an incentive to be honest in her proceedings.
[00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:38.412]  Because they only get rich the longer the conservatorship goes on.
[00:50:38.852 --> 00:50:42.534]  That's true of her father, that's true of the conservators, that's true of the trust, that's true of the lawyers.
[00:50:42.534 --> 00:50:51.438]  And that's why they want a global Marshall Plan for the UN to take over the planet under the COVID emergency to quote forgive all debts but put us all under a new system of debt.
[00:50:51.438 --> 00:50:53.299]  We're all going under the conservatorship.
[00:50:55.225 --> 00:50:55.946]  That's precisely right.
[00:50:55.946 --> 00:51:20.907]  The Global Reset is a Britney Spears-style conservatorship for the world, particularly for ordinary, everyday Americans and working-class populations that enriches a corrupt, crony, capitalist, protected few in whichever societies that they're in, that the same lawyer class that's getting rich off of stealing from Britney Spears is the same sort of political class that has gotten rich off of COVID.
[00:51:21.607 --> 00:51:25.128]  And what we need to do is we need to fight back like Britney Spears has.
[00:51:25.128 --> 00:51:26.569]  And what was the first step of that?
[00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:27.509]  She got educated.
[00:51:27.509 --> 00:51:30.850]  Self-education is the first step to self-empowerment.
[00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:36.893]  And by her getting, knowing what her rights really are, now asserting them, she may be able to finally put an end to this.
[00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:41.414]  And we should use it as an example and an exemplar to fight back against the Great Recess.
[00:51:41.414 --> 00:51:42.335]  I'm glad you brought this up.
[00:51:42.335 --> 00:51:43.015]  Let's come back.
[00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:44.676]  I totally agree.
[00:51:44.676 --> 00:51:46.478]  George Soros trying to be our conservator.
[00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:55.889]  Explain this to people when we come back because I meant to get to this and I'd forgotten it and I'm glad that you separately, with your great mind, came up with this because this is modern slavery and it's incredible.
[00:51:55.889 --> 00:51:57.271]  They won't let her have babies.
[00:51:57.271 --> 00:51:58.332]  They steal all her money.
[00:51:58.332 --> 00:51:58.933]  This is incredible.
[00:52:00.067 --> 00:52:03.671]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[00:52:03.671 --> 00:52:08.215]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[00:52:08.215 --> 00:52:17.444]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:52:17.444 --> 00:52:21.568]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:52:21.988 --> 00:52:39.421]  They are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[00:52:40.001 --> 00:52:55.831]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[00:52:55.831 --> 00:53:01.915]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[00:53:01.915 --> 00:53:06.478]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[00:53:07.355 --> 00:53:24.659]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeover is trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:25.419]  Worse than slaves.
[00:53:25.419 --> 00:53:29.460]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:36.281]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[00:53:36.986 --> 00:53:47.015]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:48.236]  It's that choice.
[00:53:48.236 --> 00:53:51.198]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[00:53:51.198 --> 00:53:53.400]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.181]  Freedom or slavery.
[00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:55.662]  Good or evil.
[00:53:55.662 --> 00:53:56.923]  It is a spiritual battle.
[00:53:56.923 --> 00:54:02.288]  And M4 War is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[00:54:02.288 --> 00:54:04.890]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:27.873 --> 00:54:38.296]  Well, I got really excited when Robert Barnes came on because we were going to be talking about the inoculations, the tyranny of it, what's happening in politics.
[00:54:38.296 --> 00:54:46.678]  But I had really meant to cover my own personal view of the parallels of the enslavement of Britney Spears with COVID, with the New World Order.
[00:54:46.678 --> 00:54:54.060]  And then Barnes came out and said even better than I was saying it or didn't say it, because it's the truth.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.201]  And as he said, it's like seeing the world through a grain of sand.
[00:54:58.738 --> 00:55:03.981]  If we can get this out to the public, we can free all of ourselves, because that's what we're being inducted into.
[00:55:03.981 --> 00:55:05.862]  So, recap what you were saying.
[00:55:05.862 --> 00:55:07.342]  This is so powerful.
[00:55:07.342 --> 00:55:13.005]  How can a 35, 36-year-old woman... In fact, how old is she?
[00:55:13.005 --> 00:55:14.366]  She's almost 40.
[00:55:14.366 --> 00:55:26.612]  How can Britney Spears be a slave where she has to go on tour after tour after tour, basically no breaks, and lawyers tell her that she can't have babies, has to have a dangerous medical device in her uterus,
[00:55:27.941 --> 00:55:32.065]  I mean, all of this is out of control.
[00:55:32.065 --> 00:55:34.208]  What would you do as a lawyer representing her?
[00:55:34.208 --> 00:55:36.410]  Because I guess this is still up in the air.
[00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:37.351]  What's going to happen with her?
[00:55:39.412 --> 00:55:54.959]  Well fortunately, I mean basically for the last dozen years she believed, because she's been under this conservatorship for 13 years now, and so basically she's been led to believe that if she said anything, if she protested, if she took any action, then it would get worse.
[00:55:54.959 --> 00:55:58.901]  And in fact that's what happened when she said anything about trying to end the conservatorship.
[00:55:59.401 --> 00:56:15.745]  They put her under a stricter regime, increased her medication, forced medication on her, dangerous medications they put on her, SSRI drugs, which you've been talking about for the better part of 20 years, the dangerous components of those drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:56:15.745 --> 00:56:19.846]  I've been doing legal cases concerning them for also about 20 years.
[00:56:19.846 --> 00:56:26.387]  You know, this goes back to the drugging of our children, you know, with ADHD drugs back when they're, you know, five and six and seven.
[00:56:27.086 --> 00:56:29.027]  Uh, so that's what she's had to face.
[00:56:29.027 --> 00:56:32.649]  And so she's been told when she will work, where she will work, how she will work.
[00:56:32.649 --> 00:56:46.635]  She's been determined, you know, what relationships she's going to be in, what doctors she will see, when she will see them, what will be in her body, what won't be in her body, whether she can have children or not have children, who she can be involved with, what work she can do, what relationships she can have, what doctors she can see.
[00:56:46.635 --> 00:56:51.237]  I mean, everything about her body, her soul or liberty has been controlled and monopolized by a
[00:56:51.986 --> 00:57:03.649]  And they were doing the same thing to Kanye West for a while, so this is the Hollywood system that claims it loves women, claims it wants to empower children, that instead is sexualizing children, that's caught in the NXIVM cult, Harvey Weinstein.
[00:57:03.649 --> 00:57:07.710]  The truth is, this is a real group of brainwashers.
[00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:12.411]  Hollywood is a cult, not just brainwashing the public, but brainwashing the people that work for them.
[00:57:14.091 --> 00:57:14.371]  Exactly.
[00:57:14.371 --> 00:57:23.157]  And there's many people who wonder whether the timing of this conservatorship really wasn't about Britney having an expressive break, which is what happened.
[00:57:23.157 --> 00:57:25.358]  I mean, she didn't cause she didn't commit any crime.
[00:57:25.358 --> 00:57:26.619]  She didn't go on some crime spree.
[00:57:26.619 --> 00:57:29.321]  She didn't harm anybody, anything like that.
[00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:32.843]  I mean, by Hollywood standards, it was a pretty minor provision.
[00:57:32.843 --> 00:57:34.564]  It's what I used to say in the Snipes case.
[00:57:35.024 --> 00:57:37.765]  If Crazy was criminal, half of Hollywood would be in prison.
[00:57:37.765 --> 00:57:47.929]  By that standard, you know, her minor break was a relatively minor break for someone who had been stressed out and trafficked as long as she had by the media, the music industry, and by her own family.
[00:57:47.929 --> 00:58:00.073]  And in that, there are many people who wonder whether or not there's other information she has that they are suppressing and keeping from the public by keeping control over her entire liberty.
[00:58:00.573 --> 00:58:15.937]  I mean, it's mighty convenient that some of the same people who would potentially be embarrassed in the Hollywood industry and in the legal industry by what's been taking place in Hollywood over the past half century or more are the people that are involved in supporting this conservatorship.
[00:58:15.937 --> 00:58:20.158]  I mean, there should have been a lot more outrage by a lot more people for a lot longer.
[00:58:20.778 --> 00:58:24.221]  And most ordinary Americans just didn't know what the score was.
[00:58:24.221 --> 00:58:30.546]  And they tricked her into telling people, you better tell people that you support this conservatorship or it's gonna get worse.
[00:58:30.546 --> 00:58:33.529]  So people assumed until she spoke last week.
[00:58:33.529 --> 00:58:35.490]  And you gotta wonder about the courts.
[00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:39.033]  The courts tried to prevent any of that recording from coming out.
[00:58:39.033 --> 00:58:40.855]  Tried to prevent people from even recording it.
[00:58:41.295 --> 00:58:43.317]  This is a right of public access.
[00:58:43.317 --> 00:58:46.781]  That's a constitutionally guaranteed right in California.
[00:58:46.781 --> 00:58:49.524]  You have a right to know what's going on in the court proceedings.
[00:58:49.524 --> 00:58:52.167]  You have a right for those proceedings to be published.
[00:58:52.167 --> 00:58:57.192]  Why is the California court system trying to suppress her statement about what was really going on?
[00:58:57.792 --> 00:59:11.498]  And as the Hollywood system collapses and all the payoffs don't work, I think it's a safe bet because a lot of these kids that work for the Disney program, we know a lot of the directors were pedophiles, convicted pedophiles are allowed back to work at Disney as directors with children.
[00:59:11.498 --> 00:59:12.658]  I think it was a safe bet.
[00:59:12.658 --> 00:59:20.822]  If I was a betting man, I would give it a very, very, very high percentage chance that she wasn't just financially and politically enslaved and
[00:59:21.062 --> 00:59:21.763]  Thank you.
[00:59:31.798 --> 00:59:41.489]  Well, I mean, put it this way, it's a mighty convenient means to accomplish and achieve that objective, particularly when you control what doctors she sees, you control what psychologists she sees.
[00:59:41.489 --> 00:59:51.080]  I mean, because the kind of people she should have had access to, she should have had access to doctors that are very good at dealing with childhood trauma, at deal with potentially being trafficked.
[00:59:52.061 --> 00:59:54.043]  Deal with being exposed in an early.
[00:59:54.043 --> 01:00:00.411]  I mean, she was sexualized at a very early age by the people who are controlling her in terms of her marketing in public.
[01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:02.734]  I mean, it was very it was for those of us who watched it.
[01:00:02.734 --> 01:00:07.900]  We were all found it disturbing those, you know, the why are they doing this to a 15 year old girl?
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.423]  We would never do let ever allow this to happen.
[01:00:10.743 --> 01:00:11.944]  To our own daughters.
[01:00:11.944 --> 01:00:14.446]  And they were doing this for the world to witness.
[01:00:14.446 --> 01:00:17.588]  And you've got to wonder about what the mindset of some of those people were.
[01:00:17.588 --> 01:00:19.350]  You've got to wonder about some of their connections.
[01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:27.196]  You've got to wonder whether or not their desire to control, especially what doctors she sees, they won't allow her to pick her own psychologist.
[01:00:27.196 --> 01:00:28.517]  Why is that?
[01:00:28.517 --> 01:00:34.722]  Why are they trying to monopolize basic access to basic information that concerns her own body and her own mind?
[01:00:34.722 --> 01:00:38.725]  There could be even darker truths than simply stealing from her.
[01:00:39.305 --> 01:00:50.511]  Uh, and we, you know, the only way we can know about that or find out about that is if she is given full, meaningful freedom and liberty to pick her own doctor, to exercise control over her own mind, body, and money.
[01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:51.992]  So what happens next with these court cases?
[01:00:51.992 --> 01:00:52.672]  What happens next?
[01:00:54.238 --> 01:00:58.779]  So she has requested that the conservatorship end and that her freedom be restored.
[01:00:58.779 --> 01:01:00.879]  And so it's going to be up to the judge.
[01:01:00.879 --> 01:01:08.221]  Now, unfortunately, a lot of judges in these situations have a history, in my view, conservatorship often violates people's constitutional rights.
[01:01:08.221 --> 01:01:11.741]  So I find it offensive in general, constitutionally offensive in general.
[01:01:11.741 --> 01:01:16.082]  Aren't there multiple ways, even if the judge refuses, she can appeal and also she's a free human.
[01:01:16.082 --> 01:01:19.923]  She could go contract, she could refuse herself and just say she's not going to comply with it.
[01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:27.577]  What's happened before is when she's refused to comply, they've increased her forced medication.
[01:01:27.577 --> 01:01:32.200]  They've done more further social isolation.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.664]  Compare her legally to human chattel slavery in 1850 South.
[01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:41.246]  There's not a great difference right now, sadly.
[01:01:41.246 --> 01:01:42.947]  And that's what's terrifying.
[01:01:42.947 --> 01:01:47.450]  They want to restore, it's like the old slave owners are still mad that slavery was abolished.
[01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:48.491]  Britney Spears is a slave.
[01:01:48.491 --> 01:01:49.772]  Britney Spears is a slave.
[01:01:51.627 --> 01:01:51.947]  No doubt.
[01:01:51.947 --> 01:01:55.068]  I mean, at multiple legal levels, that's how she's being treated.
[01:01:55.068 --> 01:01:56.909]  She doesn't have control over her own body.
[01:01:56.909 --> 01:01:58.850]  She doesn't have control over her own medicine.
[01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:00.750]  She doesn't have control over her own doctors.
[01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.531]  She doesn't have control over her own labor.
[01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:04.492]  She doesn't have control over her own property.
[01:02:04.492 --> 01:02:07.433]  How is that not legally the equivalent of chattel slavery in 1850 Mississippi?
[01:02:08.673 --> 01:02:19.015]  And you know, I mean, her family's from Mississippi and apparently that's these court systems and these little lawyers thought they should restore 1850s slavery style politics to the situation.
[01:02:19.015 --> 01:02:21.696]  And it's what people like George Soros want to do to the whole world.
[01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:24.116]  It's what Bill Gates would love to have.
[01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:32.678]  I mean, this is like a Bill Gates kind of dream, this kind of control over human beings and the methods and means and modes of that control.
[01:02:32.678 --> 01:02:38.159]  And so her case is more than about Britney Spears, more than about a celebrity, and it's more than just about American
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.340]  Exactly.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.020]  It's about us all.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.325]  It's got to scare the system that she finally got the courage or the support to do this.
[01:02:45.325 --> 01:02:57.114]  And so we'll come back and shift gears into the larger picture here and get into the politics and the support, the major push to indict President Trump.
[01:02:57.114 --> 01:02:59.716]  Is that really going to be happening?
[01:02:59.716 --> 01:03:01.418]  The world is awakening.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.643]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:16.953]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[01:03:16.953 --> 01:03:26.741]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[01:03:26.741 --> 01:03:29.243]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:03:29.864 --> 01:03:35.688]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[01:03:35.688 --> 01:03:40.712]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[01:03:40.712 --> 01:03:42.153]  That is invincible.
[01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:45.596]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[01:03:45.596 --> 01:03:51.340]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:55.403]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[01:03:55.403 --> 01:03:59.206]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.

[01:06:03.279 --> 01:06:05.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:38.316]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:38.316 --> 01:06:40.158]  Only here because of you.
[01:06:40.158 --> 01:06:42.881]  Only here because of your word of mouth.
[01:06:53.627 --> 01:06:56.548]  And the system is definitely scared of you spreading the word.
[01:06:56.548 --> 01:06:59.849]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is here with us right now.
[01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:06.471]  I'm glad he brought up Britney Spears because is that not an illustration of how tyrannical and oppressive Hollywood is?
[01:07:06.471 --> 01:07:11.032]  The NXIVM cults going down, the sex slavery, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:07:11.032 --> 01:07:18.835]  Barnes, from your research, why is there so much cult programming, sex slavery, pedophilia in the Hollywood leftist elites?
[01:07:19.588 --> 01:07:21.169]  Not just here, but all over the world.
[01:07:21.169 --> 01:07:22.470]  I mean, you've been around the world.
[01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.930]  You've studied a lot of things.
[01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:27.772]  That's undoubtedly a major theme to what they're doing.
[01:07:27.772 --> 01:07:30.674]  The sexualization of children is all over the news.
[01:07:30.674 --> 01:07:32.215]  It's being pushed as a good thing.
[01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.336]  I've got shock video.
[01:07:35.214 --> 01:07:45.039]  Hell, I guess we ought to play it of a man going in a girl's bathroom and exposing himself, and they say, that's okay, he says he's a woman.
[01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:58.386]  And so this obsession with liberals putting a fake penis in the diaper of little girls so they grow up with a penis in case they want to have a penis, I mean, this is really just pedophile pervert stuff.
[01:07:59.066 --> 01:07:59.647]  Out in the open.
[01:07:59.647 --> 01:08:01.148]  I just don't compute.
[01:08:01.148 --> 01:08:08.195]  I mean, I understand there's been sickos throughout history, but why are there so many and why are they taking over?
[01:08:08.195 --> 01:08:25.170]  Well, I think what you're seeing is a merger of two disturbing trends that go, you know, the ones that goes back to the eugenics at the turn of the century, where human beings were just seen as lesser, seen as people you could experiment on, and you know, going into the eugenics movement and everything that that was about, and that was greenlit by the most powerful people in our legal system.
[01:08:25.911 --> 01:08:40.047]  And one of the most morally horrendous decisions in world history, and definitely in American history, was the Supreme Court's Connie Buck decision, the decision that I will be challenging and contesting and seeking to permanently reverse with the vaccine challenges and lawsuits that we will be bringing.
[01:08:40.547 --> 01:08:51.877]  But in the same time, so you have that trend on the one hand, the Bill Gates of the world, the George Soros of the world, that believe in total control, merging with, you know, sort of the, what really sort of started to peak in the 1960s.
[01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:59.544]  I don't know if people are seeing, have watched the Son of Sam special that's on Netflix, that documents Maury Terry's great work over many decades.
[01:08:59.984 --> 01:09:26.769]  But, you know, that goes back to the early 60s where you had sort of, you know, the whole Anton LaVey, the process group out of the 1960s that formed with Charles Manson and the Sons of Sam cult and the rest, which basically saw human experimentation in a different way as a form of source of power and a critical, in both cases, Charles Manson and Sons of Sam, there were people deeply connected to it that were close to Hollywood and part of Hollywood.
[01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:30.812]  And that's not a coincidence, it's because Hollywood has long dabbled in that area.
[01:09:30.812 --> 01:09:38.817]  A lot of people that seek out Hollywood and want to succeed in Hollywood, and do succeed in Hollywood, are power-driven people.
[01:09:38.817 --> 01:09:47.122]  They love control, and they love various forms of cultural experimentation that undermines traditional values and traditional mores.
[01:09:47.122 --> 01:09:49.924]  And consequently, that's what you get.
[01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.125]  And they're people who want access.
[01:09:51.505 --> 01:09:58.791]  Where better can you get access to, you know, that's the history of child abusers going back, you know, centuries.
[01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:02.053]  That they look for places where they can access vulnerable children.
[01:10:02.053 --> 01:10:13.262]  And that's why you find them disproportionately in certain, sometimes in certain subparts of certain religious institutions, but you find them in orphanages, foster homes, and especially you find them in Hollywood.
[01:10:13.702 --> 01:10:20.364]  And it's because they have unusual access to young children, unusual degrees of power for young children, and it attracts that crowd.
[01:10:20.364 --> 01:10:28.227]  And that crowd has a cultural more or a lack of basic morals that allows them to engage in that behavior on a mass scale.
[01:10:28.227 --> 01:10:38.430]  And they're often involved in nationwide groups, nationwide groups that can go off on to another extreme when you see things like the Sons of Sam and Charlie Manson.
[01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:42.391]  A lot of these things tie back together when you study the intellectual and ideological
[01:10:43.532 --> 01:10:55.283]  Well, exactly, and if you look at the main founders of modern psychology, Freud, Kenzie, all of these guys,
[01:10:55.913 --> 01:10:56.153]  I think?
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:22.402]  Our civilization is really like a giant boa constrictor swallowing what's left of our civilization.
[01:11:22.402 --> 01:11:30.945]  Now, shifting gears into a similar area of power and control, Canada is under UN control, just like Australia.
[01:11:30.945 --> 01:11:37.147]  They take UN directives, medical doctors that talk about ivermectin or whatever get, you know, lose their license or whatever.
[01:11:37.147 --> 01:11:38.907]  Total control.
[01:11:38.907 --> 01:11:43.629]  Churches shut down across the country, but the rock concerts are back open and the rest of it.
[01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:44.709]  Walmart's never closed.
[01:11:45.245 --> 01:11:54.629]  This is out of Nova Scotia, the province health department, saying we're not allowing public gatherings because people might share disinformation.
[01:11:54.629 --> 01:12:05.914]  So now they admit it's martial law, and they admit like out of Red Dawn or something, but in the real world, that free speech is a super bad thing and they don't want people getting together.
[01:12:05.914 --> 01:12:13.838]  So a permanent martial law like North Korea or something, a non-authorized event, and he's admitting this is not for
[01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:16.939]  Hi there, thanks for taking my questions.
[01:12:16.939 --> 01:12:25.321]  I'm wondering about the injunction banning public gatherings and whether there really is a need for such a far-reaching one given the trajectory we're on now.
[01:12:45.367 --> 01:12:46.948]  So, I mean, I think it's still there.
[01:12:46.948 --> 01:12:52.210]  We still have, you know, bringing large numbers of people together.
[01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:55.551]  It can present some risk.
[01:12:55.551 --> 01:12:58.092]  We'll continue to look at that.
[01:12:58.092 --> 01:13:11.378]  But I think the other purpose of the injunction is to prevent, you know, groups that are spreading, deliberately spreading false information that can actually create risk.
[01:13:11.838 --> 01:13:18.082]  Okay, so he's admitting people protesting, people going out, people not liking the lockdown is the reason we're not letting him demonstrate.
[01:13:32.289 --> 01:13:36.231]  So it's really the snake eating its tail here.
[01:13:36.231 --> 01:13:45.795]  And then the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism put out two weeks ago by Biden, it says questioning lockdowns is terrorism, is white supremacy.
[01:13:45.795 --> 01:13:49.117]  And then we've got the American Jewish Congress putting out a special report saying
[01:13:50.078 --> 01:13:54.302]  Anybody that does anything, including free speech, should be shut down.
[01:13:54.302 --> 01:13:58.306]  They call for Gab to be closed because they allow free speech on there.
[01:13:58.306 --> 01:14:07.074]  So we have all these major groups, including the executive branch, doing this, Robert Barnes, and so we see this all over the world under UN control.
[01:14:07.074 --> 01:14:07.675]  What do you make of this?
[01:14:09.187 --> 01:14:11.568]  Well, I mean, it's confession through projection.
[01:14:11.568 --> 01:14:17.191]  Because the only people spreading mass false information is the institutional media and are these institutional governments.
[01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:21.933]  The ones out there spreading the real big lie about the election is that the election was free and fair.
[01:14:21.933 --> 01:14:30.377]  And yet they're saying anyone who says otherwise ends up like Rudy Giuliani, having his law license taken away for what he said in the Court of Public Opinion about the elections.
[01:14:30.377 --> 01:14:31.498]  Unprecedented in America.
[01:14:31.878 --> 01:14:37.460]  In the same context, in the same capacity, you have these governments saying, don't get together to talk about COVID.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.021]  Take the country of Canada and its various regional governments.
[01:14:40.021 --> 01:14:59.649]  Well, they have been spreading misinformation to their population for the better part of a year or more, saying that not only misinformation about what was happening in the hospital, but misinformation about alternative therapeutics, misinformation about the risk of the vaccine, misinformation about where COVID came from, misinformation about the fact that Canada shipped away its protective equipment to China.
[01:15:00.169 --> 01:15:01.991]  Uh, and the way they're involved in China.
[01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:02.812]  So that's what I mean.
[01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:18.429]  It's confession through projection and that they are saying other people are doing what they're doing and they want to be able to get away with what they're doing by not allowing other people to expose their campaign of misinformation, their campaign of lies and deception to get an idea of how certain extreme it is.
[01:15:19.204 --> 01:15:30.393]  You know, the NC North Carolina State baseball players last week lost a chance to play right on the cusp of the World Series because their vaccinated players got COVID.
[01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:36.617]  I mean, and yet, you know, and so they they got their can't they were canceled because the vaccinated players got COVID.
[01:15:36.617 --> 01:15:42.522]  But this is not information the media wants to meaningfully talk about while denying and stripping people of their core liberties and fundamental rights.
[01:15:42.992 --> 01:15:49.075]  That's right, let's come back and talk about that, because this is the official national strategy for countering domestic terrorism.
[01:15:49.075 --> 01:15:59.419]  The FBI, the CIA, they all follow it, and it says in here, protesting lockdowns, terrorism, not wanting a shot, terrorism, questioning election, terrorism.
[01:15:59.419 --> 01:16:02.241]  The equation is very simple.
[01:16:02.241 --> 01:16:11.785]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[01:16:12.953 --> 01:16:22.061]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:30.548]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:37.274]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down and use
[01:16:38.158 --> 01:16:46.240]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.761]  That's why they target InfoWars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[01:16:50.761 --> 01:16:56.103]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote InfoWars at Band.Video.
[01:16:56.103 --> 01:16:57.183]  So redouble your efforts.
[01:16:57.183 --> 01:17:01.064]  We're all in this together.
[01:17:01.064 --> 01:17:05.625]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[01:17:06.576 --> 01:17:23.823]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeover is trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[01:17:23.823 --> 01:17:24.583]  Worse than slaves.
[01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:28.625]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[01:17:28.625 --> 01:17:35.448]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:46.193]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[01:17:46.193 --> 01:17:46.873]  It's that choice.
[01:17:46.873 --> 01:17:50.354]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[01:17:50.354 --> 01:17:52.555]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[01:17:52.555 --> 01:17:53.335]  Freedom or slavery.
[01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.816]  Good or evil.
[01:17:54.816 --> 01:17:56.076]  It is a spiritual battle.
[01:17:56.076 --> 01:17:57.797]  An end for wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[01:17:59.938 --> 01:18:06.915]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[01:18:07.486 --> 01:18:13.009]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[01:18:13.009 --> 01:18:20.874]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[01:18:20.874 --> 01:18:22.335]  Humanity is strong.
[01:18:22.335 --> 01:18:23.316]  We're incredible.
[01:18:23.316 --> 01:18:27.078]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[01:18:27.078 --> 01:18:29.559]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[01:18:29.559 --> 01:18:35.483]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[01:18:35.803 --> 01:18:45.548]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.

[01:20:02.935 --> 01:20:05.596]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.051 --> 01:20:21.595]  The grid.
[01:20:21.595 --> 01:20:25.360]  A digital frontier.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.105]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer.
[01:20:29.105 --> 01:20:31.648]  What did they look like?
[01:20:33.335 --> 01:20:38.401]  Ships, motorcycles, where the circuits are three ways.
[01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:39.683]  And then?
[01:20:39.683 --> 01:20:44.849]  I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see.
[01:20:44.849 --> 01:20:50.395]  And then, one day, I got in.
[01:20:53.747 --> 01:20:59.451]  All right, final segment with Robert Barnes, and I'm going to get into a ton of news in the third hour and open the phones up and take your phone calls.
[01:20:59.451 --> 01:21:01.472]  Editorial Salente in the War Room, 3 p.m.
[01:21:01.472 --> 01:21:04.394]  Central, Owen Schroer.
[01:21:04.394 --> 01:21:07.535]  Finishing up with the whole COVID tyranny, here's an article out of the New York Post.
[01:21:07.535 --> 01:21:11.738]  Prove you're vaccinated with this immunization ban bracelet.
[01:21:11.738 --> 01:21:14.620]  And Barnes breaking the news, they're getting ready to file suit.
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.142]  It's Madison Square Garden that tries to make all its employees have it.
[01:21:18.835 --> 01:21:27.620]  And now at major football games across the country and other things, they're making people baseball games sit in areas that aren't as good if they're not vaccinated.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:29.941]  So it's not even about being able to buy a ticket now.
[01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:41.608]  Wanting to know your medical history, as they now admit, more people are, quote, getting sick and going to the hospital with COVID than have had the shot because it makes your body create the spike protein.
[01:21:41.608 --> 01:21:43.028]  They cooked this fraud up.
[01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:45.710]  It's clear, Barnes, from the very, very beginning.
[01:21:46.426 --> 01:21:50.349]  With not just lawsuits from you and others, but how do we attack this?
[01:21:50.349 --> 01:21:55.973]  I think everybody goes to city council, county commissioners, school boards, and exposes the fraud.
[01:21:55.973 --> 01:22:00.677]  We don't let them just launch the fraud and then kind of back off a little bit because they know there's opposition.
[01:22:00.677 --> 01:22:03.219]  Because as soon as we turn around, they're going to attack again.
[01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:06.882]  We've got to go on the offense and realize the UN's in charge of this.
[01:22:06.882 --> 01:22:09.284]  They're already calling for new global lockdowns.
[01:22:09.284 --> 01:22:11.265]  They're calling for permanent masks.
[01:22:11.265 --> 01:22:12.326]  This is the tyranny.
[01:22:13.982 --> 01:22:16.145]  But what did Bill Gates call it a year ago?
[01:22:16.145 --> 01:22:19.530]  When Stephen Colbert said, oh, maybe you shouldn't use that phrase.
[01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:22.735]  Bill Gates called it the final solution.
[01:22:22.735 --> 01:22:30.266]  So I'm just waiting for them to say that people need to start wearing their yellow stars if they're not in the quote-unquote proper group.
[01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:51.117]  This is the nature of what's taking place and what's transpiring, and the ability to continue to push back on it in the court of public opinion, in the court of law, in whatever court you can get access to, whether that's, as you mentioned, city hall, county commission, local school board, local business, whoever it is, the pushback is already working at an extraordinary level.
[01:22:51.117 --> 01:22:55.980]  In the same way that, you know, Britney Spears fighting back awakened people to the risk of conservatorship,
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:06.323]  Everyday ordinary Americans fighting back is awakening businessmen, awakening school board officials, political officials, others, to the fact this is not a popular proposal in America.
[01:23:06.323 --> 01:23:08.803]  America does not want to go back to the days of Connie Buck.
[01:23:08.803 --> 01:23:11.084]  America does not want to go back to the days of eugenics.
[01:23:11.084 --> 01:23:16.085]  America does not want to go back to the days of being guinea pigs for white lab coat experimentation.
[01:23:16.085 --> 01:23:19.887]  We've had enough of a live Milgram experiment we've had to live through in the last year.
[01:23:19.887 --> 01:23:21.307]  Enough is enough is enough.
[01:23:21.787 --> 01:23:24.908]  And that's why we're fighting doing what we can in the court of law.
[01:23:24.908 --> 01:23:28.209]  But what everybody's doing in the court of public opinion is mattering.
[01:23:28.209 --> 01:23:39.972]  You know, three years ago, before all this started, the number of people who were willing to question a drug labeled a vaccine, because that's all a vaccine is, just a drug, was only about 5% of the country.
[01:23:39.972 --> 01:23:41.873]  Today, that's more than a third of the country.
[01:23:42.313 --> 01:23:47.917]  So people are awakening every single day and part of how they're awakening is supporting programs like this.
[01:23:47.917 --> 01:23:50.459]  That's the reason why they've been trying to look at the timing.
[01:23:50.459 --> 01:24:02.629]  The great focus to take InfoWars off the air to defame and destroy it started not long right before this plot was launched and this plot was put out into the world.
[01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:03.089]  Why?
[01:24:03.089 --> 01:24:05.631]  Because they knew how important the court of public opinion is.
[01:24:06.432 --> 01:24:10.756]  It is the fifth pillar of power that undergirds the other four pillars of power.
[01:24:10.756 --> 01:24:15.501]  It's the perception of power and the confidence the public has in the integrity of that power.
[01:24:15.501 --> 01:24:16.742]  And that is collapsing.
[01:24:16.742 --> 01:24:24.590]  This Great Reset narrative is collapsing everywhere, constantly and continuously, thanks to people supporting networks like InfoWars.
[01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:31.492]  That people who do things like go to Infowarsstore.com and buy basic products that support their health, which by the way, go back to that.
[01:24:31.492 --> 01:24:45.477]  Look at how there was a massive legal war, political war fought on anybody who pointed out simple things like maybe silver is good for you, like maybe vitamin D is good for you, like maybe there's some alternative therapeutics that might be helpful.
[01:24:45.477 --> 01:24:50.599]  Anybody who said that was blacklisted and blackballed was targeted for political and legal assault.
[01:24:51.019 --> 01:25:01.528]  And now we're finding out, as Brett Weinstein is documenting day after day after day, despite the threats of the big media, despite the threats of big tech, that in fact these alternative therapeutics have real value.
[01:25:01.528 --> 01:25:13.097]  We're finding that people that had high levels of vitamin D, that didn't have major deficiencies in vitamin D in certain parts of the world, like Japan and other places, those are places where COVID never really took hold in a dangerous way in the first place.
[01:25:13.457 --> 01:25:19.684]  So, we're getting more and more information out there, and it's critical that people continue to support independent information.
[01:25:19.684 --> 01:25:20.865]  People don't think it matters.
[01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:21.766]  It does matter.
[01:25:21.766 --> 01:25:24.048]  By you being able, by each individual doing what they can.
[01:25:24.048 --> 01:25:25.269]  Robert, let me expand on that.
[01:25:25.269 --> 01:25:26.551]  Let me expand.
[01:25:26.551 --> 01:25:29.734]  This is the whole New World Order, whole world government takeover.
[01:25:30.014 --> 01:25:36.257]  The rest of our lives is going to be the Great Reset and hysteria over bugs and forced inoculations.
[01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:50.105]  So the harder we push now, the quicker we're going to beat this, because they're going to launch new attacks, it's going to get crazier, but up front, us exposing them and discrediting them is going to change the entire game and shorten how long this whole Antichrist takeover is going to happen.
[01:25:50.105 --> 01:25:56.148]  So, exactly, just because they're backing off in some areas, you've got to hammer more than ever and have complete
[01:25:57.070 --> 01:26:02.068]  Ernestness and just absolutely be on fire realizing...
[01:26:03.090 --> 01:26:05.292]  That now is the time.
[01:26:05.292 --> 01:26:21.404]  Now is the time to be warning and engaging, because this is the whole corporate New World Order, carbon tax, post-human move is now, and everybody, no matter where you work or what color you are, this is targeting you, and we better come together against the globalist eugenics operation.
[01:26:21.404 --> 01:26:23.126]  And you're right, Barnes, that's the great news.
[01:26:23.126 --> 01:26:27.169]  Thanks to the listeners and you and all of us together and the shows you're doing and countless others.
[01:26:27.868 --> 01:26:32.049]  Now it's becoming mainstream about eugenics and depopulation and New World Order.
[01:26:32.049 --> 01:26:37.551]  It's not just them pushing it, it's people countering and saying, these aren't good people, these are monsters.
[01:26:37.551 --> 01:26:43.193]  And so, as bad as things have been the last year and a half, it could have been a lot worse, so thank God Lister's kept us on air.
[01:26:44.802 --> 01:26:51.104]  Absolutely, because it's not a coincidence that the first people out there protesting were people who are InfoWars fans.
[01:26:51.104 --> 01:26:57.747]  They were the tip of the spear, and at the time there was all this criticism, all this condemnation, all these attacks, but that crowd was the right crowd.
[01:26:57.747 --> 01:26:59.568]  They were right all along.
[01:26:59.568 --> 01:27:04.409]  And that's what's done the most important valuable work, and it's the most important valuable work for people to continue to do.
[01:27:04.409 --> 01:27:07.030]  People can contribute in every level of activity.
[01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:09.211]  It doesn't require a person to be publicly active.
[01:27:09.211 --> 01:27:11.552]  It doesn't require a person to put their job at risk.
[01:27:11.892 --> 01:27:20.465]  It only requires doing what you can to, in Gad Saad's words, release your inner honey badger and find that place in your life where you can do so.
[01:27:20.465 --> 01:27:20.805]  That's right.
[01:27:20.805 --> 01:27:22.828]  There must be a sense of urgency.
[01:27:22.828 --> 01:27:27.235]  The globalist assault is going to get so intense, folks, we have to...
[01:27:27.975 --> 01:27:33.919]  I mean, look at the police attacking people all over, and now folks are fighting back against the police that are attacking folks.
[01:27:33.919 --> 01:27:35.320]  So just at crazy times.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.702]  Barnes, in closing, I had a hundred other topics I wanted to get into.
[01:27:38.702 --> 01:27:40.863]  They're trying to indict Trump.
[01:27:40.863 --> 01:27:45.926]  Julian Assange, this big court case, this top witness coming out, being a fraud.
[01:27:45.926 --> 01:27:51.630]  Right-wing Watch has been permanently banned by YouTube when they were the people out getting everybody else banned.
[01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:53.051]  Tackle whatever you want in the last three minutes.
[01:27:54.528 --> 01:27:55.048]  Sure.
[01:27:55.048 --> 01:27:56.989]  So I mean we're seeing a lot of important pushback.
[01:27:56.989 --> 01:28:11.133]  Great independent investigative journalism by the Icelandic press that exposed that once again Robert Mueller and people can go back and watch the Journey to the Dark Side that was an Infowars exclusive about Robert Mueller and the whole history of who he is.
[01:28:11.133 --> 01:28:17.835]  Robert Mueller again used a pedophile, another pedophile, another fraudster to lie and fabricate evidence
[01:28:18.215 --> 01:28:25.859]  Against Julian Assange because they needed more evidence than just the Chelsea Manning case in order to try to convince the British courts to extradite.
[01:28:25.859 --> 01:28:42.126]  And now it turns out all the evidence is not only fabricated, but it turns out that guy was an undercover informant while they listed him as an unindicted co-conspirator, which is exactly what some people like Darren Beatty and others have documented may have occurred on January 6th.
[01:28:42.686 --> 01:28:44.047]  We see the same pattern.
[01:28:44.047 --> 01:28:54.491]  In fact, it appears the FBI was the one doing and instructing the hacking of various materials and information that they wanted to later shift the blame on Julian Assange.
[01:28:54.491 --> 01:29:09.718]  So, just like there's a free Britney Spears movement, there is a right and righteous free Julian Assange movement that gained major power by independent investigative journalists and ordinary everyday people sharing the story that exposed more government malfeasance
[01:29:10.018 --> 01:29:15.621]  More government misconduct, more bad actions by those in positions of power.
[01:29:15.621 --> 01:29:36.071]  So for all the bad news of people in positions of power going after Rudy Giuliani to try to set a precedent, to say lawyers can't even talk in the court of public opinion about things they don't want him to talk about, we see pushback by independent investigative journalists on the Julian Assange case, pushback by Britney Spears fighting for rights that matter for everyone in the conservatorship case,
[01:29:36.491 --> 01:29:48.081]  And ordinary everyday Americans fighting back writ large, whether it's in challenging these vaccines with their employer, with their local business, challenging Marxist critical race theory at their local school board.
[01:29:48.081 --> 01:29:58.671]  All of these ordinary people, the great schools of learning that can never be shut down, are the archives of nature and the rights of man established by God in our souls and in the world around us.
[01:29:58.671 --> 01:30:01.333]  And if we act on it, then we can change the world.
[01:30:01.333 --> 01:30:03.575]  And that's what we are witnessing over the last year and a half.
[01:30:03.855 --> 01:30:20.848]  So for all the darkness and despair of the live Milgram experiment we've all had to undergo, the fact that more people are pushing back than ever pushed back in the Milgram experiment itself is a sign of the power of the human conscience, the human soul, and of American freedom to reassert itself once again.
[01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:21.308]  That's right.
[01:30:21.308 --> 01:30:22.710]  We are living in the great task.
[01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:24.451]  We are living in incredible times.
[01:30:24.451 --> 01:30:26.713]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much for the time.
[01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:27.073]  Amazing.
[01:30:28.837 --> 01:30:29.177]  Absolutely.
[01:30:29.177 --> 01:30:29.958]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:30.458]  Thank you.
[01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:34.520]  The Assange information is just over-the-top, what he was just saying.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.920]  That's all documented, by the way.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.081]  Total fraud.
[01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:38.742]  Pedophile setting him up.
[01:30:38.742 --> 01:30:40.602]  Same old story.
[01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:41.783]  Unindicted co-conspirators.
[01:30:41.783 --> 01:30:42.763]  All right, third hour.
[01:30:42.763 --> 01:30:43.424]  Your call.
[01:30:43.424 --> 01:30:44.844]  A bunch of news coming up.
[01:30:44.844 --> 01:30:45.625]  Strap yourselves in.
[01:30:45.625 --> 01:30:46.225]  Please stay with us.
[01:30:48.897 --> 01:30:57.903]  Three of our best-selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed the supply chain.

[01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:08.290]  It's back in stock.
[01:31:08.290 --> 01:31:09.971]  Then we have Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:31:09.971 --> 01:31:11.452]  Highest grade of krill oil.

[01:31:16.135 --> 01:31:16.876]  It's back in stock.

[01:31:49.782 --> 01:31:51.022]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[01:31:51.022 --> 01:31:52.103]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:31:52.103 --> 01:31:52.863]  Trying to move quicker.
[01:31:52.863 --> 01:31:53.683]  Hey, Alex.
[01:31:53.683 --> 01:31:54.123]  Welcome.
[01:31:54.123 --> 01:31:59.265]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[01:31:59.265 --> 01:32:02.646]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[01:32:02.646 --> 01:32:09.108]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[01:32:09.108 --> 01:32:10.768]  Living Defense saved my life.
[01:32:10.768 --> 01:32:14.930]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:16.370]  Living Defense brought me back.
[01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:22.172]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[01:32:22.172 --> 01:32:24.592]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[01:32:24.592 --> 01:32:33.875]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[01:32:33.875 --> 01:32:39.317]  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[01:32:39.317 --> 01:32:40.617]  That's right where we're at bro.
[01:32:41.058 --> 01:32:46.786]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[01:32:46.786 --> 01:32:52.935]  Because God created this country.
[01:32:52.935 --> 01:32:55.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:06.599 --> 01:33:13.086]  Boys and girls take warning if you go near the lake.
[01:33:13.086 --> 01:33:19.312]  Keep your eyes wide open and look for Sneaky Snake.
[01:33:19.312 --> 01:33:24.337]  Now maybe you won't see him, maybe you won't hear
[01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:29.033]  Alright folks, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:43.996 --> 01:33:58.601]  I'm going to give the number and I'll start the next segment hitting the really big COVID news on these new vaccines that quote reprogram your whole body that they're now admitting, oh, we are going to change all your DNA and end all disease from the very group that says they want to depopulate everybody.
[01:33:58.601 --> 01:34:04.443]  I've got a proposal for viewers and listeners that is one of the most important proposals you'll ever get in your life.
[01:34:04.443 --> 01:34:10.585]  I know how good it works because I finally listened to Dr. Edward Group seven, eight years ago.
[01:34:11.587 --> 01:34:15.788]  When he said to me, Alex, you're exercising a lot, but you're overweight.
[01:34:15.788 --> 01:34:18.368]  You probably have a deficiency in high quality iodine.
[01:34:18.368 --> 01:34:22.709]  Most iodine is bound into the soil or into the food.
[01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:23.989]  You're not absorbing it.
[01:34:23.989 --> 01:34:25.950]  Most people have iodine deficiencies.
[01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:36.712]  He showed me articles where the UN admits that two billion plus people have cognitive disabilities and lower IQ because of low iodine in utero and after they were born and as adults.
[01:34:36.712 --> 01:34:38.292]  And so I finally started taking
[01:34:39.735 --> 01:34:40.596]  Well, we have it today.
[01:34:40.596 --> 01:34:41.296]  And that's Survival Shield X2.
[01:34:41.296 --> 01:34:43.699]  Survival Shield X2 is the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[01:34:43.699 --> 01:34:45.340]  It's 100% Deep Earth Crystal true nascent iodine.
[01:35:06.883 --> 01:35:10.406]  We developed, working with other scientists, X3.
[01:35:10.406 --> 01:35:13.428]  Now, I'm not saying X2 is better than X3.
[01:35:13.428 --> 01:35:15.149]  They're apples and oranges.
[01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:24.195]  And we have X2 at 50% off in stock with free shipping right now and part of our 4th of July Super Sale.
[01:35:24.195 --> 01:35:30.760]  But I was able to get in a bigger order of X3 because it's become a big seller over the years.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.343]  It's got the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine with two other types of clean, good iodine.
[01:35:36.187 --> 01:35:41.909]  That are better for some people than just one type of iodine.
[01:35:41.909 --> 01:35:49.452]  Some people can't absorb the pure iodine, the atomic iodine, and they need the other types of naturally occurring iodine.
[01:35:49.452 --> 01:35:54.514]  This has all three, so it's apples and it's oranges.
[01:35:54.514 --> 01:35:55.995]  Is an apple better or is an orange better?
[01:35:56.761 --> 01:35:58.222]  Or is a potato better?
[01:35:58.222 --> 01:35:59.322]  Or a tomato better?
[01:35:59.322 --> 01:36:01.943]  Or are black grapes better than green grapes?
[01:36:01.943 --> 01:36:05.104]  Or is this type of squash better than that squash?
[01:36:05.104 --> 01:36:08.725]  It's two different things, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:08.725 --> 01:36:15.247]  I'd liken it to regular yellow gold being gold, and you got white gold that's gold.
[01:36:15.247 --> 01:36:16.728]  It's just silver looking.
[01:36:16.728 --> 01:36:21.709]  I mean, it's very similar, but it's two different things at the molecular level.
[01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:23.530]  That's just my goofy way of breaking it down.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:28.862]  I want to challenge listeners and I want to challenge viewers to support the broadcast.
[01:36:28.862 --> 01:36:31.983]  Hell, go to infowarestore.com, right in the middle section right there.
[01:36:31.983 --> 01:36:36.305]  You can become a sponsor and make a one-time gift of $10, $50, $100 to fund us.
[01:36:36.305 --> 01:36:41.927]  That way, after credit card fees and stuff, we get about 95% of it to actually fund, you know, what we're doing.
[01:36:41.927 --> 01:36:44.428]  If you make a $5 donation, we get over $4 of it.
[01:36:45.498 --> 01:36:54.761]  With the products, we only get a fraction of that because obviously we gotta pay for the shipping and the handling and the crew and the infrastructure and the cost of the product.
[01:36:54.761 --> 01:37:03.024]  So what I'm saying is, we can't do this without you, and we've got really, really, really great products that will empower you and your family
[01:37:03.544 --> 01:37:05.425]  At the very same time.
[01:37:05.425 --> 01:37:08.385]  And those are X2 and X3.
[01:37:08.385 --> 01:37:20.869]  If you don't know about the bad halogens, fluoride, bromide, chlorine, there's a whole list of them, they hurt you, they give you cancer, they take over your thyroid, they take over your hypothalamus, they attack your organs.
[01:37:20.869 --> 01:37:28.271]  And if your body doesn't have iodine, it will absorb the bad halogens that Big Brother and the New World Order make sure in everything we do.
[01:37:28.271 --> 01:37:30.852]  And all these products, and all the plastics, and the water.

[01:39:11.415 --> 01:39:19.559]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:39:19.559 --> 01:39:22.500]  We're now into hour number three.
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.742]  I'm very honored to be here to be your host, Alex Jones.
[01:39:25.742 --> 01:39:27.123]  All right.
[01:39:27.123 --> 01:39:31.845]  I want to open the phones up in this hour specifically on any topic you want to cover.
[01:39:32.503 --> 01:39:41.070]  All I ask is you be a first-time caller because I know there's a lot of people that have not had a chance to ever get on the broadcast.
[01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:42.311]  877-789-2539.
[01:39:42.311 --> 01:39:45.154]  That's 877-789-2539.
[01:39:45.154 --> 01:39:47.255]  Alex, that's 877-789-2539.
[01:39:47.255 --> 01:39:51.939]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[01:39:51.939 --> 01:39:58.625]  You've heard a lot of the incredible stuff we've covered the last few hours, but there's other topics or other questions or other comments or you disagree with me?
[01:39:59.341 --> 01:40:08.044]  Whatever the case is, we don't screen your calls other than do you have a good clean phone line and do you have a point to make.
[01:40:08.044 --> 01:40:11.305]  We would love to hear from you today.
[01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:28.070]  Now, I need to hit this because it's what the whole broadcast is about today and by that there is a globalist move to corporately, genetically, biologically take over the human process
[01:40:29.028 --> 01:40:35.529]  And make it where it's impossible for humans to operate without corporate globalist direction and control.
[01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:38.970]  The goal is to make us biological androids or robots.
[01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:41.031]  And that's Klaus Schwab and the UN's admission.
[01:40:41.031 --> 01:40:46.132]  So, up front we should reject all that.
[01:40:46.132 --> 01:40:57.534]  But because they've got half the planet on some form of welfare, we're all becoming like Britney Spears, where we are living on a globalist plantation and need to reject it.
[01:40:58.163 --> 01:41:03.105]  And so they're saying, hey, you want your universal guaranteed income after they bankrupt the economy?
[01:41:03.105 --> 01:41:04.365]  There's no jobs?
[01:41:04.365 --> 01:41:07.887]  We'll give you enough to live in a tiny apartment, but you've got to be sterilized.
[01:41:07.887 --> 01:41:10.088]  You've got to take this inoculation.
[01:41:10.088 --> 01:41:11.768]  And they're now admitting all this.
[01:41:11.768 --> 01:41:16.090]  It's going from their academic papers to action.
[01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:20.612]  So here's this chilling report out of the Daily Mail.
[01:41:20.612 --> 01:41:26.594]  But of course, they push it like it's a great, wondrous thing.
[01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:32.553]  So let's start right here.
[01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:41.159]  Stanford scientists are creating a superhero vaccine based on DNA of Olympic athletes.
[01:41:41.159 --> 01:41:45.301]  Where have you heard of that before?
[01:41:45.301 --> 01:41:46.322]  Well, China!
[01:41:46.322 --> 01:41:47.863]  They tell their people.
[01:41:47.863 --> 01:41:53.687]  Oh, China has done human testing to create biologically enhanced super soldiers, says top U.S.
[01:41:53.687 --> 01:41:55.488]  official.
[01:41:55.488 --> 01:41:56.269]  Came out last year.
[01:41:56.269 --> 01:41:57.650]  Of course, I told you decades ago.
[01:41:58.766 --> 01:42:03.129]  China doing human testing to create super soldiers.
[01:42:03.129 --> 01:42:03.849]  Remember that?
[01:42:03.849 --> 01:42:07.272]  So it's always the same PR, the same rollout.
[01:42:07.272 --> 01:42:11.094]  Well, then our soldiers better have that too.
[01:42:11.094 --> 01:42:15.897]  Stanford scientists are creating a superhero vaccine based on DNA of Olympic athletes.
[01:42:15.897 --> 01:42:28.005]  But see, when you know the background, you know, whenever they're rolling out weather modification or global government or any of this, Stanford and MIT are two of the places they use as the mouthpiece of
[01:42:29.952 --> 01:42:31.855]  This transhumanist takeover.
[01:42:31.855 --> 01:42:38.604]  So it should be DARPA scientists are creating a superhero vaccine based on DNA of Olympic athletes.
[01:42:38.604 --> 01:42:43.071]  Then they go on to say, oh, just like your COVID shot, it changes your DNA.
[01:42:43.071 --> 01:42:44.493]  Oh, I thought it didn't change our DNA.
[01:42:46.696 --> 01:42:49.497]  See, people didn't like that, so they went, oh no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:50.838]  The UN says that's not true.
[01:42:50.838 --> 01:42:58.861]  Even though I can show you a thousand studies admitting that, oh, we can't ever approve this, it changes human DNA and will pass it down to the generations and cause all sorts of problems.
[01:42:58.861 --> 01:43:03.502]  Because you can go in and rig one gene, one generation, and get what you want that generation.
[01:43:03.502 --> 01:43:13.486]  But they know from plants and animals and human testing, the next few generations it does a bunch of wild stuff, usually lowering life expectancy, causing deformities and cancer.
[01:43:15.559 --> 01:43:19.981]  Oh, but everybody's getting their shot for the COVID.
[01:43:19.981 --> 01:43:24.962]  And then in the mainline literature, it says it can wreck your genetics.
[01:43:24.962 --> 01:43:28.803]  And imagine some families that are divorced where some of the kids live here, some live there.
[01:43:28.803 --> 01:43:36.266]  And the court says, well, we're going to let mom make the decision over dad or dad make the decision over mom.
[01:43:36.266 --> 01:43:37.366]  It's just a shot.
[01:43:37.366 --> 01:43:37.546]  Why?
[01:43:37.546 --> 01:43:39.847]  It's just the doctors, why they say it's safe.
[01:43:39.847 --> 01:43:42.468]  The ignorant judge says that doesn't know medicine or science.
[01:43:43.968 --> 01:43:55.595]  And so they inject your son or your daughter with something that on record causes heart inflammation, brain damage, will grow prions in their flesh, and then will attack their DNA for generations and generations.
[01:43:55.595 --> 01:43:59.518]  So if they do have children, there's a good chance they'll be horribly deformed.
[01:43:59.518 --> 01:44:02.220]  But by then it'll be, oh, we don't know why everybody's deformed.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:03.721]  We don't know why everybody's sterile.
[01:44:03.721 --> 01:44:04.521]  Oh, we don't know.
[01:44:04.521 --> 01:44:09.104]  We don't know why we picked bisphenol A and all the rest of these chemicals.
[01:44:10.196 --> 01:44:10.757]  But nothing's going on.
[01:44:10.757 --> 01:44:17.883]  Even though they wrote White House papers in 1974, 47 years ago, in eco-science calling for adding chemicals to the water through plastics that would do exactly that.
[01:44:34.275 --> 01:44:34.835]  Stanford.
[01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:37.396]  Oh, that's just see the first line tells you so much.
[01:44:37.396 --> 01:44:40.757]  Stanford scientists are creating a superhero vaccine.
[01:44:40.757 --> 01:44:42.518]  Oh, well, who's against a superhero?
[01:44:42.518 --> 01:44:46.399]  And of course, they're going to want to make you take it to see under a socialist health care system.
[01:44:46.399 --> 01:44:55.842]  Oh, if this shot stops cancer or the shot stops brain damage or Alzheimer's or liver, well, you better take it.
[01:44:55.842 --> 01:45:03.025]  See how it works, Stanford scientists are creating a superhero vaccine based on DNA of Olympic athletes.
[01:45:03.025 --> 01:45:03.865]  This is a rollout.
[01:45:04.645 --> 01:45:08.627]  They had to have emergency authorization for the first one, and everybody had to accept it.
[01:45:08.627 --> 01:45:16.529]  Stanford scientists are creating a superhero vaccine based on DNA of Olympic athletes, which could protect people.
[01:45:16.529 --> 01:45:17.490]  Oh!
[01:45:17.490 --> 01:45:18.570]  Oh, it could?
[01:45:18.570 --> 01:45:19.611]  It could?
[01:45:19.611 --> 01:45:22.092]  Oh, and all the lies we've been told?
[01:45:22.092 --> 01:45:26.113]  Against leading causes of death, such as heart disease and Alzheimer's.
[01:45:26.113 --> 01:45:30.955]  But your latest mRNA causes massive heart attacks and Alzheimer's.
[01:45:30.955 --> 01:45:31.715]  Funny!
[01:45:31.715 --> 01:45:33.856]  Oh, but now they've got a shot that's going to fix that.
[01:45:34.352 --> 01:45:40.875]  Because remember, Biden said, oh, within a decade, every hospital will be, every bed will be filled with Alzheimer's patients.
[01:45:40.875 --> 01:45:44.897]  Oh, but don't worry, now they'll have a shop that fixes, oh, they'll fix your DNA after they hurt you.
[01:45:44.897 --> 01:45:45.718]  Oh, I see!
[01:45:45.718 --> 01:45:59.425]  You and Ashley and his team at the University of Stanford believe they can develop a vaccine that can severely reduce heart disease, kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, among other conditions.
[01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:08.215]  A superhero vaccine that could protect against multiple multitude of diseases could come into existence in the next decade.
[01:46:08.215 --> 01:46:10.357]  You know they already have it.
[01:46:10.357 --> 01:46:22.126]  Dr. Ewan Ashley, a professor at Stanford University and genetic scientist said he and his team are working on a vaccine and believes it could realistically be available in the not too distant future because it's already been tested in China.
[01:46:23.246 --> 01:46:28.550]  Ashley says his vaccine would be genetic information from people with desirable traits.
[01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:29.491]  Wow!
[01:46:29.491 --> 01:46:32.013]  This isn't the egg and the sperm coming together and all that.
[01:46:32.013 --> 01:46:32.674]  No, no, no.
[01:46:32.674 --> 01:46:34.535]  They're going to change it in live time.
[01:46:34.535 --> 01:46:40.119]  Listen, such as Olympic athletes with Olympic athletes' genetics connected directly into your DNA.
[01:46:40.119 --> 01:46:49.066]  Listen, as a blueprint to repair DNA cells in a way that will strengthen the average person's genes.
[01:46:49.066 --> 01:46:52.329]  Oh my goodness, it'll strengthen your genes by rewriting them.
[01:46:54.881 --> 01:47:03.203]  It could potentially protect people from conditions that are the leading cause of death, such as heart disease, Alzheimer's, and liver disease, even though our life expectancy is dropping under these people.
[01:47:03.203 --> 01:47:10.965]  Ashley believes the vaccine could begin trials as early as 2026 and be available for us in 10 to 15 years.
[01:47:10.965 --> 01:47:12.646]  Oh, probably next year.
[01:47:12.646 --> 01:47:16.687]  Potentially millions of people could be impacted by the technology.
[01:47:16.687 --> 01:47:21.328]  A superhero jab for want of a better description, he said in a statement.
[01:47:22.944 --> 01:47:30.930]  And if you look at the Queen of England, and you look at Al Gore, who I know does all this stuff, does that look like what you want to look like?
[01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:33.091]  A big glowing red head that looks like a demon?
[01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:34.112]  I mean, this stuff ain't good.
[01:47:34.112 --> 01:47:36.454]  This is the mark of the beast.
[01:47:36.454 --> 01:47:48.122]  This has the potential to greatly reduce the burden of diseases with genetic components such as Alzheimer's disease, liver disease, coronary heart disease, and associated conditions such as strokes and vascular dementia, which is all happening now!
[01:47:48.949 --> 01:47:59.337]  Ashley is the founding director of the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease and the Clinical Genomics Program, where he leads the research on heart disease and gene science.
[01:47:59.337 --> 01:48:03.440]  And it goes on to talk about editing your DNA.
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:05.261]  Oh, it gets better.
[01:48:05.261 --> 01:48:14.147]  He says his program uses gene editing to change as little as one letter in an at-risk person's genome to make them more resilient.
[01:48:14.147 --> 01:48:15.408]  It's no big deal.
[01:48:15.408 --> 01:48:17.630]  We just change one little part.
[01:48:18.749 --> 01:48:21.570]  It says it's just like the COVID-19 vaccine!
[01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:26.952]  The COVID vaccine works with a similar mRNA vaccine, and it helps a person's DNA!
[01:48:26.952 --> 01:48:28.053]  It helps it!
[01:48:28.053 --> 01:48:37.276]  With a toolkit that can rewrite the DNA to acquire genes that makes a person more resilient to certain conditions.
[01:48:37.276 --> 01:48:41.838]  And of course, looks like these people have already tapped into something spiritual.
[01:48:41.838 --> 01:48:45.239]  And now their cells are resonating with death.
[01:48:45.239 --> 01:48:47.320]  And they're drawn to death like moths to flame.
[01:48:47.898 --> 01:48:49.018]  We're going to go to break now.
[01:48:49.018 --> 01:48:50.779]  That's just part of the news.
[01:48:50.779 --> 01:49:00.523]  And come back with your phone calls on the other side.
[01:49:00.523 --> 01:49:02.604]  Your voice counts.
[01:49:02.604 --> 01:49:07.666]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:49:07.666 --> 01:49:10.247]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:49:10.247 --> 01:49:11.747]  They know you're angry.
[01:49:11.747 --> 01:49:16.569]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[01:49:17.139 --> 01:49:27.882]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[01:49:47.208 --> 01:49:51.689]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.
[01:49:51.689 --> 01:49:54.569]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[01:49:54.569 --> 01:50:06.011]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[01:50:06.011 --> 01:50:14.973]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans.
[01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:23.235]  And turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[01:50:23.235 --> 01:50:23.995]  Worse than slaves.
[01:50:23.995 --> 01:50:28.058]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[01:50:28.058 --> 01:50:35.603]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[01:50:35.603 --> 01:50:39.445]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world.
[01:50:39.445 --> 01:50:44.709]  Which realizes it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[01:50:45.624 --> 01:50:46.825]  It's that choice.
[01:50:46.825 --> 01:50:49.786]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[01:50:49.786 --> 01:50:51.987]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[01:50:51.987 --> 01:50:52.767]  Freedom or slavery.
[01:50:52.767 --> 01:50:54.248]  Good or evil.
[01:50:54.248 --> 01:50:55.508]  It is a spiritual battle.
[01:50:55.508 --> 01:50:57.209]  An info war is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[01:50:58.493 --> 01:51:05.198]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming.
[01:51:05.198 --> 01:51:08.760]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.821]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[01:51:10.821 --> 01:51:13.323]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[01:51:13.323 --> 01:51:15.985]  It's well known for the things it does for our body.
[01:51:15.985 --> 01:51:17.766]  It makes our lives so much better.
[01:51:18.526 --> 01:51:22.390]  Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:24.272]  We've got both at MFullWorksStore.com.
[01:51:24.272 --> 01:51:30.898]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back in stock.
[01:51:30.898 --> 01:51:32.619]  Well, it's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:41.748]  And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at MFullWorksStore.com.
[01:51:42.088 --> 01:51:44.190]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:52:08.909 --> 01:52:14.737]  I have a peppin' nine step from getting my first COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:52:14.737 --> 01:52:15.898]  Vaccinate!
[01:52:15.898 --> 01:52:16.900]  Vaccinate!
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:19.063]  Make an appointment!
[01:52:19.063 --> 01:52:20.164]  Vaccinate!

[01:52:23.476 --> 01:52:23.956]  Vaccinate!
[01:52:23.956 --> 01:52:24.337]  Vaccinate!
[01:52:24.337 --> 01:52:25.057]  It's recording!
[01:52:25.057 --> 01:52:25.398]  Vaccinate!
[01:52:25.398 --> 01:52:25.978]  Vaccinate!
[01:52:25.978 --> 01:52:26.939]  It's recording!
[01:52:26.939 --> 01:52:27.640]  Shutting it off!
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:28.280]  Shutting it off!
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.141]  Shutting it off!
[01:52:29.141 --> 01:52:29.881]  Shutting it off!
[01:52:29.881 --> 01:52:30.662]  Gotta make time to go!
[01:52:30.662 --> 01:52:31.202]  Gotta make time to go!
[01:52:31.202 --> 01:52:31.563]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:31.563 --> 01:52:31.963]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:31.963 --> 01:52:33.284]  Gotta make it through the day!
[01:52:33.284 --> 01:52:33.825]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:33.825 --> 01:52:34.545]  Gotta make it through the day!
[01:52:34.545 --> 01:52:35.166]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:35.166 --> 01:52:35.506]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:35.506 --> 01:52:35.906]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:35.906 --> 01:52:36.247]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:36.247 --> 01:52:36.707]  Gotta make time!

[01:52:40.490 --> 01:52:40.991]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:40.991 --> 01:52:41.351]  Gotta make time!

[01:52:42.272 --> 01:52:42.672]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:42.672 --> 01:52:43.052]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:43.052 --> 01:52:43.553]  Gotta make time!

[01:52:44.093 --> 01:52:44.474]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:44.474 --> 01:52:44.914]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:44.914 --> 01:52:45.254]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:45.254 --> 01:52:45.575]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:45.575 --> 01:52:45.955]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:45.955 --> 01:52:46.275]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:46.275 --> 01:52:46.776]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:46.776 --> 01:52:47.416]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:47.416 --> 01:52:47.836]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:47.836 --> 01:52:48.397]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:48.397 --> 01:52:48.977]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:48.977 --> 01:52:49.398]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:49.398 --> 01:52:49.838]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:49.838 --> 01:52:50.238]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:50.238 --> 01:52:50.659]  Gotta make time!
[01:52:50.659 --> 01:52:50.859]  Gotta make
[01:52:51.059 --> 01:52:53.701]  It's very simple what's happening.
[01:52:53.701 --> 01:52:59.585]  A scientific global dictatorship with chemicals, biologicals, and radiologicals.
[01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:29.067]  He is twisting humanity into a monstrous creature as a sacrifice to their God.
[01:53:29.067 --> 01:53:30.808]  This is quite a time to be alive.
[01:53:30.808 --> 01:53:36.812]  They believe they will transcend humanity through this metamorphosis.
[01:53:36.812 --> 01:53:44.977]  By testing all these horrible things on us, they believe they will gain the advanced technologies they need to transcend death itself.
[01:53:44.977 --> 01:53:48.500]  So all of us have been slated for miserable, horrible, slow deaths.
[01:53:49.178 --> 01:53:52.720]  At the hands of these people right now, they're normalizing our deaths.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:54:08.868]  And right now in the UK, the US, all over the Western world, they are taking autistic boys damaged from poison vaccines and telling them that they're really girls and then taking them from their parents if they don't comply with their sterilization.
[01:54:08.868 --> 01:54:15.431]  So this is a nightmare, horror movie situation that we are all living in.
[01:54:16.317 --> 01:54:25.565]  And I want to now go ahead and take some of your phone calls on this subject here today.
[01:54:25.565 --> 01:54:33.871]  That's why you see the Supreme Court transgender boy wins bathroom case after Supreme Court refuses to hear appeal.
[01:54:33.871 --> 01:54:38.775]  It's not a boy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:38.775 --> 01:54:44.280]  It is a girl that wants to be a boy.
[01:54:51.075 --> 01:54:58.758]  Well, they're now saying, oh, we're going to have men in your little girl's restroom with your daughters because they say they're women.
[01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:00.898]  Because if you'll put up with that, you'll put up with anything.
[01:55:00.898 --> 01:55:04.640]  This is gaslighting to convince you to accept anything.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:12.042]  That's what all of these programs are about, like Sexy Beast and Sweet Tooth on Netflix that Obama basically runs.
[01:55:12.042 --> 01:55:19.165]  It's a show like human animal creatures having sex to just totally confuse everyone and totally screw up society.
[01:55:19.165 --> 01:55:20.105]  So you will accept
[01:55:21.070 --> 01:55:24.773]  All the genetic engineering, the human-animal clones, and just normalize it all.
[01:55:24.773 --> 01:55:32.077]  We are in the normalization process of the fall of humanity to an even lower level right now.
[01:55:32.077 --> 01:55:37.701]  Well, Dino is in New York, so Dino wants to talk about transgender surgeries in the military.
[01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:41.243]  Dino, welcome!
[01:55:41.243 --> 01:55:43.165]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:55:43.165 --> 01:55:49.709]  I was calling about the free gender transgender for the vets and all that surgeries and
[01:55:50.461 --> 01:55:58.864]  What I wanted to add on to that is, uh, they're doing this experimenting with rats, with ovaries, putting the ovaries in male rats.
[01:55:58.864 --> 01:56:00.785]  And I can see where they're going with that.
[01:56:00.785 --> 01:56:01.925]  They're going to start doing that.
[01:56:01.925 --> 01:56:11.208]  And whoever's doing the money funding for that is what they're going to do is they're probably going to end up doing the ovaries in men here in America too.
[01:56:11.208 --> 01:56:18.871]  And also I wanted to add, um, I was in federal prison and, uh, what happened was there was a burn victim.
[01:56:19.785 --> 01:56:28.910]  And the burn victim wanted to get extra surgery done, and they said to him in federal prison, they said, no, it's a cosmetic.
[01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:37.815]  But in the same breath, the federal government in federal prisons are doing transgender surgeries for inmates.
[01:56:37.815 --> 01:56:40.936]  Well, that's because it's sterilization.
[01:56:40.936 --> 01:56:47.960]  See, sterilization got outlawed after Hitler gave it a bad name, and so it went underground, but there was still sterilization of poor people going on.
[01:56:48.813 --> 01:56:51.595]  In Washington State until 1987.
[01:56:51.595 --> 01:56:53.196]  And so now it's just gone underground.
[01:56:53.196 --> 01:56:57.659]  They call it gender reassignment surgery when they do it.
[01:56:57.659 --> 01:57:00.780]  So they cover up all their pedophilia, all this stuff.
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:03.382]  And of course, it's about money.
[01:57:03.382 --> 01:57:13.788]  Republicans signed over $2 billion in the legislature, not just Democrats, to cut children's genitals off in just the next year.
[01:57:13.788 --> 01:57:16.390]  So there's huge money for all this gender reassignment
[01:57:17.023 --> 01:57:20.105]  Hey Alex, oh my gosh I'm so excited to be talking to you today.
[01:57:45.836 --> 01:57:46.637]  Very cool!
[01:57:46.637 --> 01:58:08.073]  So yeah, I wanted to talk about medical tyranny because for the past couple years I was diagnosed with MS a couple years ago and it's just been like such a horrible process because you have to go through all the different, you know, like treatments and they have all these different treatment options but you know it doesn't actually make you better
[01:58:08.954 --> 01:58:14.257]  It's just, oh, possibly, you know, like for the price of a car, possibly, you know, you'll feel better.
[01:58:14.257 --> 01:58:22.922]  And you know, MS and the fact that it's increasing, they'll claim it's a genetic disorder, but more and more it's linked to environmental toxins like vaccines.
[01:58:22.922 --> 01:58:24.482]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:24.482 --> 01:58:29.345]  I actually, I got the MS from the Gardasil vaccination.
[01:58:29.345 --> 01:58:29.685]  Oh, wow.
[01:58:29.685 --> 01:58:31.686]  How old were you?
[01:58:31.686 --> 01:58:35.608]  I was 18, I believe.
[01:58:35.608 --> 01:58:38.290]  And, but I didn't know that I had that problem.
[01:58:38.735 --> 01:58:39.775]  We're good to go.
[01:59:06.124 --> 01:59:12.950]  Part of the whole process was, you know, kind of like, you know, going through all these, you know, treatments and everything.
[01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:17.974]  And like, you know, I... Oh yeah, by wounding you, they get to suck money off of you for the rest of their lives.
[01:59:17.974 --> 01:59:19.876]  They've got it all figured out.
[01:59:19.876 --> 01:59:26.121]  I mean, they're coming out with vaccines for all the Alzheimer's people, because almost everybody that takes the vaccine is going to have Alzheimer's now.
[01:59:26.121 --> 01:59:26.701]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:59:26.701 --> 01:59:29.043]  I got shingles.
[01:59:29.043 --> 01:59:32.226]  I got glaucoma, heart attack.
[01:59:32.961 --> 01:59:37.703]  You know, and like at that point I was like, okay, maybe I should just like go natural.
[01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:54.549]  Let me stop you, because I was on air when they did emergency approval of Gardasil, Governor Rick Perry did it, because they couldn't get it authorized, so he declared an emergency, so that emergency authorization, just like we just saw, it's been banned in Japan, India, all over the world, exactly.
[01:59:54.549 --> 01:59:59.631]  It causes all sorts of autoimmune disorders, glaucoma, cancers, and that happened to you too?
[01:59:59.631 --> 02:00:01.432]  I am so, that pisses me off so bad.
[02:00:01.952 --> 02:00:07.214]  And think of all the countless other women that the same thing's been done to them, knowingly, by these monsters.
[02:00:07.214 --> 02:00:08.974]  And so think about how evil Merck is.
[02:00:08.974 --> 02:00:19.678]  Merck knew they were doing that with a genetic bioweapon, but they pulled out of the mRNA COVID operation, knowing it's going to be so deadly, they didn't think they'd survive it.
[02:00:19.678 --> 02:00:21.139]  Is that not... Stay there.
[02:00:21.139 --> 02:00:22.339]  I'm going to stop ranting at you, Katie.
[02:00:22.339 --> 02:00:23.579]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:00:23.579 --> 02:00:25.260]  When I come back, I want to hear what else happened to you.
[02:00:26.505 --> 02:00:29.886]  And then you wanted to make some comments.
[02:00:29.886 --> 02:00:35.087]  Yeah, folks, you've got to learn that this is all an exponential thing.
[02:00:35.087 --> 02:00:39.888]  Hundreds of millions of boys with autism around the world from deadly shots.
[02:00:39.888 --> 02:00:46.590]  Millions and millions and millions and millions of women now sterile or with cancer from the Gardasil shots.
[02:00:46.590 --> 02:00:52.371]  And now with this, just mass heart attacks, death everywhere with the so-called mRNA vaccines.
[02:00:52.371 --> 02:00:53.552]  I mean, this is a holocaust.
[02:00:53.552 --> 02:00:54.712]  They're just training us to accept it.
[02:01:00.214 --> 02:01:02.275]  Your voice counts.
[02:01:02.275 --> 02:01:07.338]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:01:07.338 --> 02:01:09.939]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:01:09.939 --> 02:01:11.420]  They know you're angry.
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:16.242]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:01:52.403 --> 02:01:52.903]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:01:52.903 --> 02:01:53.804]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:01:53.804 --> 02:02:02.727]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:07.227 --> 02:02:09.429]  Well, let me say, I love your products.
[02:02:09.429 --> 02:02:20.156]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[02:02:20.156 --> 02:02:26.160]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.201]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[02:02:29.422 --> 02:02:37.149]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:45.916]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[02:02:45.916 --> 02:02:46.737]  This is working.
[02:02:46.737 --> 02:02:47.737]  This is wonderful.
[02:02:47.737 --> 02:02:52.281]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[02:02:52.281 --> 02:02:56.905]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[02:03:00.009 --> 02:03:15.302]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim, so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God, and the incredible mission and destiny we have, being given free will.
[02:03:15.302 --> 02:03:17.524]  Being given free will, being given consciousness.
[02:03:18.044 --> 02:03:23.467]  That is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[02:03:23.467 --> 02:03:40.118]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[02:03:40.118 --> 02:03:43.540]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:45.581]  So don't worship the Globalist.
[02:03:45.581 --> 02:03:47.242]  Don't worship the NFL.
[02:03:47.242 --> 02:03:49.084]  Don't worship all the things of the system.
[02:03:49.084 --> 02:03:50.965]  But worship the things of God.
[02:03:50.965 --> 02:03:52.526]  Because we're made by God.
[02:03:52.526 --> 02:03:54.227]  And appreciate your consciousness.
[02:03:54.227 --> 02:03:55.708]  And appreciate free speech.
[02:03:55.708 --> 02:03:56.869]  While you still have it.
[02:03:56.869 --> 02:03:57.650]  While you still have it.

[02:05:08.866 --> 02:05:10.971]  We are drugged out!
[02:05:10.971 --> 02:05:13.216]  We are following other people's opinions!
[02:05:14.361 --> 02:05:17.163]  We are controlled by the media.
[02:05:17.163 --> 02:05:19.045]  Today, it all changes.
[02:05:19.045 --> 02:05:21.807]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[02:05:21.807 --> 02:05:24.649]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[02:05:24.649 --> 02:05:29.612]  Einstein says the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[02:05:29.612 --> 02:05:32.274]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[02:05:32.274 --> 02:05:34.976]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[02:05:34.976 --> 02:05:37.558]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:05:37.558 --> 02:05:39.199]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:05:39.199 --> 02:05:40.060]  We have the resources.
[02:05:44.722 --> 02:05:47.123]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:05:47.123 --> 02:05:47.823]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:40.211 --> 02:06:42.173]  And we are back live with loaded phones.
[02:06:42.173 --> 02:06:44.195]  Someone's about to shut up and let the caller talk.
[02:06:44.195 --> 02:06:49.359]  Katie, I was interrupting a lot, just talking about how deadly Gardasil is.
[02:06:49.359 --> 02:06:54.063]  And, you know, guessing that you might have had problems with a vaccine, and here it is, devastating you.
[02:06:54.063 --> 02:06:58.207]  That's why it's so important to warn everybody before they can do it to the entire population.
[02:06:58.207 --> 02:07:00.829]  It just makes me so angry, but thanks for holding over.
[02:07:00.829 --> 02:07:03.631]  Go ahead and finish your points.
[02:07:03.631 --> 02:07:06.694]  So, you know how it's simple as usually the blast?
[02:07:07.837 --> 02:07:21.608]  I decided like a month ago, I'm like, you know, with all of these, you know, horrible symptoms and everything that I've gotten from, you know, the medications and I was like, what's the point?
[02:07:21.608 --> 02:07:24.110]  You know, like, why not just go natural?
[02:07:24.110 --> 02:07:29.775]  So, I started using your, what's it called?
[02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.516]  A vitamin mineral infusion?
[02:07:31.516 --> 02:07:31.696]  Yes.
[02:07:35.013 --> 02:07:38.974]  And it gave me so much more energy, so much more focus.
[02:07:38.974 --> 02:07:41.675]  My body feels so much better.
[02:07:41.675 --> 02:07:49.277]  And when I tried your X3, that just blew me away.
[02:07:49.277 --> 02:07:54.319]  It's just so much more comprehensive.
[02:07:54.319 --> 02:07:56.360]  Things are so much easier to do.
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:59.741]  I don't know if that's explaining it right.
[02:08:01.351 --> 02:08:02.452]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:08:02.452 --> 02:08:09.758]  That's why they bombard us with bad halogen, which is bromide, bromine, chlorine, fluoride, instead of the good halogen that's iodine.
[02:08:09.758 --> 02:08:10.759]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:08:11.303 --> 02:08:14.286]  I mean, most people have major iodine deficiency.
[02:08:14.286 --> 02:08:17.108]  The stuff they sell at the store is not real iodine.
[02:08:17.108 --> 02:08:23.414]  And I didn't think Group was hyping it up when he sold me on it nine years ago, ten years ago, now time flies.
[02:08:23.414 --> 02:08:24.395]  But it changed my life.
[02:08:24.395 --> 02:08:28.058]  And when I forget to take it, I'm sluggish, I gain weight.
[02:08:28.058 --> 02:08:34.124]  When I remember to take it, and you'd think I'd know and remember to take it, I forget all the time myself to take it.
[02:08:36.027 --> 02:08:39.197]  Yeah, yeah, I mean the effects have been absolutely amazing.
[02:08:39.197 --> 02:08:41.786]  It's like, it's literally, like, I'm not...
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:43.000]  Thank you so much.
[02:09:12.833 --> 02:09:14.434]  Who's been home the longest?
[02:09:14.434 --> 02:09:16.295]  That would be Kevin.
[02:09:16.295 --> 02:09:17.435]  Kevin in Ohio.
[02:09:17.435 --> 02:09:18.136]  Thanks for calling.
[02:09:18.136 --> 02:09:20.477]  Go ahead.
[02:09:20.477 --> 02:09:21.057]  Hey, Alex.
[02:09:21.057 --> 02:09:22.418]  Long time listener.
[02:09:22.418 --> 02:09:24.198]  First time caller.
[02:09:24.198 --> 02:09:25.759]  How are you doing?
[02:09:25.759 --> 02:09:26.680]  I'm doing a little bit better.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:27.720]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:29.481]  I've gotten pretty freaked out with him killing.
[02:09:30.330 --> 02:09:34.674]  The reporter that exposed the tarmac event, killing McAfee.
[02:09:34.674 --> 02:09:37.716]  All these people said, they're coming to kill me, I'm not suicidal.
[02:09:37.716 --> 02:09:39.898]  And so I'm saying, I'm not suicidal.
[02:09:39.898 --> 02:09:43.822]  And then there's just no repercussions on the deep state, you know, if they come and kill me.
[02:09:43.822 --> 02:09:47.465]  So, but they're the ones that are starting a physical war.
[02:09:47.465 --> 02:09:48.466]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[02:09:48.466 --> 02:09:49.647]  Thank you for doing what you're doing.
[02:09:49.647 --> 02:09:51.008]  But I'll make it quick.
[02:09:51.008 --> 02:09:53.010]  I wanted to get your take on the Trump rally.
[02:09:53.010 --> 02:09:56.553]  And I was watching the Trump rally on YouTube.
[02:09:56.553 --> 02:09:58.074]  And he Trump said,
[02:09:58.641 --> 02:10:02.684]  I've only been to Washington 17 times before I became president.
[02:10:02.684 --> 02:10:04.286]  Yup, 17.
[02:10:04.286 --> 02:10:07.929]  And then all of the comments in the comment section started saying, oh my god, 17, 17, 17.
[02:10:07.929 --> 02:10:10.751]  So I'm like, what does that mean?
[02:10:10.751 --> 02:10:16.276]  So then I put two and two together and I'm like, oh, that must be the, Q must be the 17th letter of the alphabet.
[02:10:16.276 --> 02:10:24.502]  So I'm kind of with you on your theory that like Q is controlled opposition, um, or if it did start organically, it's definitely been infiltrated.
[02:10:24.502 --> 02:10:27.665]  So I wanted to get your take on that because there's only three logical conclusions.
[02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:36.254]  Either Trump is Q, either Trump is TQ, or unpopular opinion, but is Trump part of the controlled opposition?
[02:10:36.254 --> 02:10:38.235]  Let me ask you this question, brother.
[02:10:38.235 --> 02:10:48.120]  Did all the Q people think that Trump was going to take over on January 20th, and did people get suckered by that?
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:48.620]  Absolutely.
[02:10:51.079 --> 02:10:54.000]  I was never in competition with the whole Q thing.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:00.944]  Some people said, oh, you're criticizing it because Q exposed the child kidnapping and Q exposed the New World Order.
[02:11:00.944 --> 02:11:07.447]  It's like saying Q was George Washington and Q was Jesus and Q created the world.
[02:11:07.447 --> 02:11:16.271]  It's this esoteric thing where an 8-chan board could put out esoteric stuff and people would project onto it what they wanted.
[02:11:16.271 --> 02:11:17.792]  I said they're going to stage terror.
[02:11:19.156 --> 02:11:20.577]  And blame it on the American people.
[02:11:20.577 --> 02:11:23.479]  I said they've got human-animal hybrids, and I showed you where.
[02:11:23.479 --> 02:11:28.143]  I show you where this is all happening and going on, and it's crazy.
[02:11:28.143 --> 02:11:45.056]  I could go meet with the President, or go meet with General Flynn, or go meet with other people and other former heads of intelligence agencies, and then I'd be at a rally and some dude would walk over and go, I used to like you, but I'm with Q now, and Q says you're bad.
[02:11:45.056 --> 02:11:46.657]  And so it's like, it's like,
[02:11:47.353 --> 02:11:51.474]  Elementary school versus being an 80-year-old wise man.
[02:11:51.474 --> 02:11:53.735]  It has nothing to do with reality.
[02:11:53.735 --> 02:11:56.236]  It's esoteric.
[02:11:56.236 --> 02:11:58.777]  You know about the Oracle, and I appreciate your call.
[02:11:58.777 --> 02:12:02.578]  You know about the Oracle of Delphi, folks, right?
[02:12:02.578 --> 02:12:04.319]  It's there in Delphi, Greece.
[02:12:05.575 --> 02:12:19.212]  And people for hundreds of years would go up and they would listen to see what the Oracle would say, and there was nitrous oxide coming out of a volcano there, that if you stood over it, you'd get high.
[02:12:19.212 --> 02:12:23.457]  And so they would take virgins, young women up there, who would babble incoherently
[02:12:25.062 --> 02:12:26.583]  Snorting the nitrous oxide.
[02:12:54.824 --> 02:13:05.752]  So, you know, I talked to the Q Shaman on air and off air, and I'm like, dude, they're going to come arrest you.
[02:13:05.752 --> 02:13:07.793]  They're going to put you in jail.
[02:13:07.793 --> 02:13:09.194]  You are now a major figure.
[02:13:09.194 --> 02:13:12.277]  He's like, no, no, Trump's going to be in.
[02:13:12.277 --> 02:13:13.237]  We're all going to win.
[02:13:13.237 --> 02:13:14.218]  I'm invincible.
[02:13:14.218 --> 02:13:14.678]  Oh, my God.
[02:13:14.678 --> 02:13:15.999]  And I remember he kept saying that.
[02:13:15.999 --> 02:13:19.522]  I said, sir.
[02:13:19.522 --> 02:13:21.063]  You have had a full manic event.
[02:13:23.402 --> 02:13:29.687]  And I'm not going to say the rest of the stuff he said off air, but he's a well-meaning person.
[02:13:29.687 --> 02:13:31.549]  But he went into total mania.
[02:13:31.549 --> 02:13:37.154]  He believed he was a secret agent that had been injected by the Navy with superpowers and that he was there for Trump.
[02:13:37.154 --> 02:13:42.978]  It wasn't true.
[02:13:42.978 --> 02:13:49.484]  And I didn't watch Trump's speech last night.
[02:13:53.274 --> 02:13:56.956]  And so, there's no way to respond to this level of mental illness.
[02:13:56.956 --> 02:13:59.377]  I just, I can't deal with it.
[02:13:59.377 --> 02:14:12.025]  The CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, I spent years just trying to get people to know they existed when I could prove they were there.
[02:14:12.025 --> 02:14:14.966]  And that they were setting policy for the world that you now see out in the open.
[02:14:14.966 --> 02:14:18.008]  Klaus Schwab writes a book about starving you to death
[02:14:19.509 --> 02:14:21.649]  Using the lockdowns and taking over and killing you.
[02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:24.350]  I mean, it's, it's, it, we know who runs it.
[02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:25.630]  We know who's doing it.
[02:14:25.630 --> 02:14:31.631]  Everybody's, all the militaries, you know, Millie, Millie is a joke.
[02:14:31.631 --> 02:14:34.672]  Austin, they all were put in power because they're nobodies.
[02:14:34.672 --> 02:14:38.953]  They do what they're told by the globalists.
[02:14:38.953 --> 02:14:41.533]  They're like, oh, the military intelligence is going to save us.
[02:14:41.533 --> 02:14:46.194]  The military intelligence, the military intelligence is kept on a one inch leash and knows nothing.
[02:14:47.688 --> 02:14:49.071]  You know who runs everything?
[02:14:49.071 --> 02:14:51.858]  The big banks and the think tanks.
[02:14:51.858 --> 02:14:54.044]  And the devil-worshipping pedophiles that run that.
[02:14:58.554 --> 02:15:02.196]  Infowars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:15:02.196 --> 02:15:04.837]  That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years.
[02:15:04.837 --> 02:15:15.783]  And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth, out of 7.5 billion, have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[02:15:15.783 --> 02:15:20.025]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[02:15:20.025 --> 02:15:25.467]  Now regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[02:15:25.467 --> 02:15:26.828]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[02:15:27.348 --> 02:15:32.432]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[02:15:32.432 --> 02:15:34.033]  It's essential in the body.
[02:15:34.033 --> 02:15:41.197]  Well, we have our amazing Tri-Iodine, a big shipment came in, and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[02:15:41.197 --> 02:15:46.821]  That is Survival Shield X3, 60% off, with three types of powerful iodine.
[02:15:46.821 --> 02:15:53.265]  Tri-Iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more powerful at the cellular level.
[02:15:53.265 --> 02:15:54.546]  You and your family will love it.
[02:15:54.546 --> 02:15:55.607]  It's incredible for your body.

[02:15:59.669 --> 02:16:05.150]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[02:16:05.150 --> 02:16:22.373]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans, and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[02:16:22.373 --> 02:16:26.014]  Worse than slaves, they're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[02:16:27.216 --> 02:16:34.739]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[02:16:34.739 --> 02:16:44.783]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes it's a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[02:16:44.783 --> 02:16:48.944]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[02:16:48.944 --> 02:16:51.145]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[02:16:51.145 --> 02:16:53.406]  Freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[02:16:53.406 --> 02:16:56.387]  It is a spiritual battle, and M4 is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[02:16:58.749 --> 02:17:10.774]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[02:17:10.774 --> 02:17:17.856]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[02:17:17.856 --> 02:17:25.039]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[02:17:25.039 --> 02:17:27.420]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms
[02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:30.621]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[02:17:56.587 --> 02:17:57.607]  July 4th, 2021 is now upon us.
[02:17:57.607 --> 02:18:00.328]  And that means our yearly big sale is here.

[02:19:02.067 --> 02:19:04.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:16.636 --> 02:19:20.900]  All right, I want to race through your calls now so we can get to more of you.
[02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:22.841]  And I don't want to go off on a whole rant about the Q thing.
[02:19:22.841 --> 02:19:31.989]  Maybe we should do a whole show on Q. And just open the phones up and have a whole debate about the damn thing.
[02:19:31.989 --> 02:19:36.934]  I mean, I actually know the inside baseball, all of it, and I've been asked not to say anything, so I'm not going to.
[02:19:36.934 --> 02:19:43.279]  But it was a project of folks in the Trump administration that blew up in their face within a month of them launching it four years ago.
[02:19:43.279 --> 02:19:44.340]  It was not done by Trump.
[02:19:45.003 --> 02:19:46.604]  They tried to tolerate it.
[02:19:46.604 --> 02:19:47.665]  They tried to get rid of it.
[02:19:47.665 --> 02:19:50.467]  Then they got so big, they tried to, you know, pat it on the head.
[02:19:50.467 --> 02:19:56.351]  And then it just, it totally blew up everybody's face on January 6th.
[02:19:56.351 --> 02:20:04.396]  And you have to understand, folks, I talk and have long meetings with people that have two and three hour dinners with Trump on a routine basis.
[02:20:04.396 --> 02:20:04.796]  All right?
[02:20:04.796 --> 02:20:07.038]  So, I mean, I'm actually talking to the people
[02:20:07.955 --> 02:20:11.998]  And of course, I've talked to Trump many times as well, but that's always over the phone, so nothing much is said.
[02:20:11.998 --> 02:20:15.340]  I mean, I know what's going on with Trump.
[02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:20.844]  I don't even want to say what's going on with Trump, because that will basically bum people.
[02:20:20.844 --> 02:20:22.325]  Fine, let me just tell you what's really going on with Trump.
[02:20:22.325 --> 02:20:28.709]  I mean, instead of like all this fantasy land, because he went and said the number 17, that means this.
[02:20:28.709 --> 02:20:29.669]  So what does that mean?
[02:20:29.669 --> 02:20:33.552]  I mean, you understand, right?
[02:20:35.086 --> 02:20:47.669]  But I've had conversations with the very people at the top of our former government about somehow salvaging Q. And I've told them, you know, I can't do this today.
[02:20:47.669 --> 02:20:48.910]  I'm not going to do this today.
[02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:52.451]  And I got to really think back on what I can say and what I can't say.
[02:20:52.451 --> 02:20:55.231]  But it just really gives me a headache, OK?
[02:20:55.231 --> 02:20:56.552]  You need to save the country.
[02:20:56.552 --> 02:20:57.752]  It's not going to be General Milley.
[02:20:57.752 --> 02:20:59.012]  It's not going to be Austin.
[02:20:59.012 --> 02:21:00.173]  It's not going to be the military.
[02:21:00.173 --> 02:21:01.153]  They follow orders.
[02:21:02.051 --> 02:21:03.632]  We're going to have to stop complying.
[02:21:03.632 --> 02:21:11.874]  The people at the city councils and at the school boards saying no to the pedophilia and the critical race theory, they are the leaders.
[02:21:11.874 --> 02:21:19.316]  You calling into a show, you supporting the broadcast, you sharing videos and articles, you are the solution.
[02:21:19.316 --> 02:21:24.278]  Not magical thinking.
[02:21:24.278 --> 02:21:27.279]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Missouri on the same subject.
[02:21:27.279 --> 02:21:27.559]  Go ahead.
[02:21:29.028 --> 02:21:31.810]  Hi Alex, it's an absolute honor to talk to you.
[02:21:31.810 --> 02:21:36.474]  I know you hate talking about this Q crap, because it is crap.
[02:21:36.474 --> 02:21:37.334]  It's esoteric.
[02:21:37.334 --> 02:21:39.336]  Trump can't run Parler or Gabby.
[02:21:39.336 --> 02:21:41.838]  He's not getting on 4chan or 8chan.
[02:21:41.838 --> 02:21:46.421]  But what I do want to say is, I actually took the COVID vaccine.
[02:21:46.421 --> 02:21:50.644]  I took the Pfizer vaccine.
[02:21:50.644 --> 02:21:53.687]  So far I haven't experienced any sort of side effects or anything.
[02:21:53.687 --> 02:21:55.468]  Good!
[02:21:55.468 --> 02:21:56.569]  After I took it though,
[02:21:57.313 --> 02:22:03.115]  I about passed out and I had to run over to a trash can and I threw up real heavily.
[02:22:03.115 --> 02:22:10.137]  And a nurse came over to me and she said, yeah, this happens pretty commonly in men.
[02:22:10.137 --> 02:22:12.057]  Not so much women, but men.
[02:22:12.057 --> 02:22:16.478]  And then she started talking to me about the blood-brain barrier.
[02:22:16.478 --> 02:22:20.460]  Yeah, men have half the blood-brain barrier of a woman.
[02:22:22.577 --> 02:22:25.199]  But it's got me kind of nervous.
[02:22:25.199 --> 02:22:26.220]  I mean, I'm young.
[02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.483]  Oh, yeah, your body's like, get this poison out of me.
[02:22:29.483 --> 02:22:30.023]  Right.
[02:22:30.023 --> 02:22:30.484]  Yeah.
[02:22:30.484 --> 02:22:31.524]  Yeah, I know.
[02:22:31.524 --> 02:22:32.766]  I know a lot of folks have taken it.
[02:22:32.766 --> 02:22:39.291]  They either and particularly men throw up because I know a nurse that she actually got reassigned because she was I'm not going to get into it.
[02:22:39.291 --> 02:22:42.113]  But the point is, she didn't want to give the shot because some people threw up and got sick.
[02:22:42.113 --> 02:22:44.535]  A lot of folks pass out and fall down.
[02:22:44.535 --> 02:22:46.597]  So they make you wait 30 minutes before you leave.
[02:22:46.597 --> 02:22:48.859]  This is this is some bad stuff, brother.
[02:22:50.376 --> 02:22:51.817]  They wouldn't let me leave.
[02:22:51.817 --> 02:22:58.879]  I had to wait around for like 30 minutes, but what was shocking is it was like nobody cared.
[02:22:58.879 --> 02:23:02.480]  There was plenty of, I suppose they were nurses.
[02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:05.541]  I'm not really sure, just people walking around in scrubs, really.
[02:23:05.541 --> 02:23:09.562]  But only one, it was an older woman, she identified herself as a nurse.
[02:23:09.562 --> 02:23:12.043]  She was the only person who cared.
[02:23:12.043 --> 02:23:14.524]  They are dehumanizing us, brother.
[02:23:14.524 --> 02:23:15.685]  They are dehumanizing us.
[02:23:15.685 --> 02:23:16.245]  God bless you.
[02:23:16.245 --> 02:23:16.845]  Thanks for the call.
[02:23:18.382 --> 02:23:23.584]  By the way, I'm not blaming people who wanted to believe in Q and that we were all winning, everything was magic and everything.
[02:23:23.584 --> 02:23:27.786]  I just knew behind the scenes Trump was totally surrounded and couldn't get his own people to work for him.
[02:23:27.786 --> 02:23:29.927]  He can't even get them to build him a good website.
[02:23:29.927 --> 02:23:34.508]  They can't even build him a good basic social network.
[02:23:34.508 --> 02:23:37.670]  Anyone that gives Trump support gets harassed, threatened, and sued.
[02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:40.971]  So all he has is lying yes-men around him who are double agents.
[02:23:40.971 --> 02:23:42.011]  Do you understand?
[02:23:42.011 --> 02:23:43.552]  Trump is surrounded.
[02:23:43.552 --> 02:23:45.473]  I know all the inside baseball.
[02:23:45.473 --> 02:23:46.453]  I know everything.
[02:23:47.930 --> 02:23:49.271]  I could go get a meeting with Trump.
[02:23:49.271 --> 02:23:49.711]  I could go.
[02:23:49.711 --> 02:23:50.231]  I don't.
[02:23:50.231 --> 02:23:52.673]  It doesn't do anything.
[02:23:52.673 --> 02:23:54.874]  He is cut off.
[02:23:54.874 --> 02:23:56.134]  His speeches are great.
[02:23:56.134 --> 02:23:57.695]  Whoever he endorses wins.
[02:23:57.695 --> 02:24:00.197]  He's wildly popular with the people.
[02:24:00.197 --> 02:24:01.297]  I love Trump.
[02:24:01.297 --> 02:24:05.439]  But he is truly a figurehead and a man on an island by himself.
[02:24:05.439 --> 02:24:10.482]  There is no Q. There is no secret group.
[02:24:10.482 --> 02:24:14.844]  There were people that wanted to be able to put dirt out on the Clintons and others and not be sued.
[02:24:14.844 --> 02:24:15.525]  They cooked up Q.
[02:24:16.815 --> 02:24:21.820]  It was taken away from them.
[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:25.603]  By people a lot more sophisticated than them.
[02:24:25.603 --> 02:24:28.626]  End of story.
[02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:30.487]  All right.
[02:24:30.487 --> 02:24:32.309]  Dave in Pennsylvania, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:35.312]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[02:24:35.312 --> 02:24:36.193]  Welcome.
[02:24:36.193 --> 02:24:39.295]  Hey, I got a quick story for you regarding the Pfizer vaccine.
[02:24:39.295 --> 02:24:42.098]  I spoke to my sister and my brother-in-law, this was a couple months ago,
[02:24:42.768 --> 02:24:48.230]  And we were talking about the vaccine, and they were telling me they want to get the vaccine.
[02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:52.892]  I tell them, well, listen to Alex and Dr. Sherry, Tenpenny, and blah, blah, blah.
[02:24:52.892 --> 02:24:55.593]  Anyways, they got the vaccine because they go to Vegas all the time.
[02:24:55.593 --> 02:24:57.274]  Well, I spoke to them the other day.
[02:24:57.274 --> 02:25:02.516]  I don't know if you heard of this or not, this little deal I'm going to tell you.
[02:25:02.516 --> 02:25:08.899]  As my brother-in-law was going through the airport scanner, he has a screw in his neck.
[02:25:09.798 --> 02:25:19.650]  So that showed up, he was watching the screen, and he said, and he also noticed that where he got the shot, there was a little dot there.
[02:25:19.650 --> 02:25:25.717]  And the guy, you know, the guy that was doing the scan, and they just, oh go ahead, let him go through, let him go through.
[02:25:25.717 --> 02:25:30.182]  Have you, I know you've done shows on the magnetic effect of the shot.
[02:25:30.953 --> 02:25:36.237]  But have you heard of anything regarding people noticing that little dot on their arm?
[02:25:36.237 --> 02:25:37.799]  Well, this is a huge call.
[02:25:37.799 --> 02:25:44.244]  This is a huge call, sir, and I'm going to take this minute or two and put it out as a piece that runs during the break so we can get answers.
[02:25:44.244 --> 02:25:58.816]  We should definitely open the phones up for people that have done the magnet test and for TSA to call in because I've already been told by this by two different people on the street that it showed up in the airport scanning systems just like you just said.
[02:25:59.449 --> 02:26:08.512]  And so we need to get to the bottom of this and what it looks like and what the medical literature admits is these mRNA vaccines grow crystals in the body that are magnetic.
[02:26:08.512 --> 02:26:18.036]  And so they start growing a magnetic crystal field where they're injected, but they also leach into the body and start colonizing the body with magnetic cones.
[02:26:18.749 --> 02:26:26.172]  And so that would be, depending on the type of scanner they had, the type of thing that it could be picking up.
[02:26:26.172 --> 02:26:27.232]  I don't know.
[02:26:27.232 --> 02:26:28.572]  I'd have to look into it.
[02:26:28.572 --> 02:26:29.133]  But there it is.
[02:26:29.133 --> 02:26:35.675]  Scientist Engineer Magneto Protein, capable of removing a remotely controlling brain and behavior.
[02:26:35.675 --> 02:26:41.217]  And so, yeah, this is a well thought out strategic takeover plan.
[02:26:41.217 --> 02:26:45.318]  And what did your family think of this bizarre development?
[02:26:46.812 --> 02:26:50.214]  He said he wished he'd never got the vaccine.
[02:26:50.214 --> 02:26:52.195]  I said, well, you got it now.
[02:26:52.195 --> 02:26:55.477]  So, you know, that was pretty much it.
[02:26:55.477 --> 02:27:00.760]  I just wanted to check in with you to let you know, see if you heard of that, any kind of other callers that called in.
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:05.843]  I've heard of one person told me it was in the airport and they came and wanted his arm because it was going off.
[02:27:05.843 --> 02:27:12.087]  Another person, I was conflating the two, told me that they were getting an MRI for a surgery they're going to have.
[02:27:12.087 --> 02:27:15.309]  And then they saw it on their arm because they were getting a shoulder
[02:27:16.445 --> 02:27:20.767]  Rotator got prepared that they did an MRI or one of those scans.
[02:27:20.767 --> 02:27:41.076]  They were getting scanned and and and that and then it showed up on the scan image like what's that and they were it was right where he got the injection so I've heard that from two people now and so we should open the phones up for radiologists and people so they can call in and tell us because I don't know but I think it's something needs to be investigated Dave.
[02:27:41.076 --> 02:27:41.336]  Thank you.
[02:27:42.789 --> 02:27:46.412]  Yeah, it makes me angry to know this is going on.
[02:27:46.412 --> 02:27:53.737]  But there's no doubt that medical doctors in Italy and Mexico did not even believe this until they saw it for themselves.
[02:27:53.737 --> 02:27:57.239]  Magnets will jump onto the injection sites.
[02:27:57.239 --> 02:27:58.740]  But here's the deal.
[02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:03.223]  If these vaccines get above 90 degrees or so, they don't work because they're live.
[02:28:03.223 --> 02:28:05.004]  These shots.
[02:28:05.004 --> 02:28:07.806]  And so it doesn't take to a lot of people.
[02:28:07.806 --> 02:28:11.489]  That's why Bill Gates goes, you may need 2, 3, 5, maybe 10 shots, see?
[02:28:12.534 --> 02:28:13.776]  Because they want this to take.
[02:28:13.776 --> 02:28:15.439]  They're trying to plant seeds in you.
[02:28:15.439 --> 02:28:18.905]  It's like getting you pregnant with whatever it is they're doing.
[02:28:18.905 --> 02:28:23.633]  And so he's like, well, it may take once, twice, three times, but we have a final solution for you.
[02:28:23.633 --> 02:28:24.354]  We're going to go to break.
[02:28:25.748 --> 02:28:29.950]  We're going to come back with more of your calls, and then Gerald Salenta is going to be taking over.

[02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:55.363]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew.
[02:29:56.232 --> 02:30:02.596]  That has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[02:30:02.596 --> 02:30:05.498]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[02:30:05.498 --> 02:30:10.061]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got red blood.
[02:30:10.061 --> 02:30:20.547]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[02:30:20.547 --> 02:30:23.469]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working on it in the future.
[02:30:24.375 --> 02:30:27.276]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[02:30:27.276 --> 02:30:32.119]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[02:30:32.119 --> 02:30:34.760]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:39.202]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[02:30:39.202 --> 02:30:43.324]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[02:30:43.324 --> 02:30:46.285]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoHorse.
[02:30:46.285 --> 02:30:50.667]  God bless.
[02:30:50.667 --> 02:30:52.188]  What are champions made of?
[02:30:54.069 --> 02:30:55.185]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:31:01.946 --> 02:31:02.126]  What?
[02:31:02.126 --> 02:31:03.887]  Infowarstore.com is simply the best.
[02:31:31.422 --> 02:31:33.163]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:07.199 --> 02:32:12.803]  Now listen up.
[02:32:12.803 --> 02:32:14.484]  She's a razor sharp.
[02:32:14.484 --> 02:32:22.510]  And she'll get her way.
[02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:26.933]  She's a cool cool black.
[02:32:26.933 --> 02:32:29.915]  Boo like a cat.
[02:32:29.915 --> 02:32:34.879]  You might not make it back.
[02:32:37.679 --> 02:32:43.683]  She's got the looks that kill.
[02:32:43.683 --> 02:32:46.746]  All right, let's take your calls, my friends.
[02:32:46.746 --> 02:32:48.167]  Murphy and then Jim and others.
[02:32:48.167 --> 02:32:49.328]  Murphy in Nevada.
[02:32:49.328 --> 02:32:50.048]  Thanks for calling.
[02:32:50.048 --> 02:32:53.931]  Hi, thank you so much for taking my phone call.
[02:32:53.931 --> 02:32:58.795]  I'm just calling on the whole magnetism front of this vaccine thing.
[02:32:58.795 --> 02:33:07.241]  I think it's going to be used to track us in the future with maybe drones or autonomous robots via proximity or something like that.
[02:33:07.938 --> 02:33:16.603]  I don't really know how it would be used to work like that, but I know that they couldn't give us a chip, so they had to figure out some other way to track us, right?
[02:33:16.603 --> 02:33:18.324]  Oh, you're 100% right.
[02:33:18.324 --> 02:33:24.507]  Gates is obsessed with liquid nanotech crystals that grow in the body for the purposes of tracking you.
[02:33:24.507 --> 02:33:27.889]  He's got a bunch of patents, absolutely.
[02:33:27.889 --> 02:33:34.332]  Yeah, because I was just thinking, it's like, I was listening to a bunch of Hollywood movies and shit, and you're like, oh, sorry about that.
[02:33:34.332 --> 02:33:37.434]  Even in Terminator and stuff, and they were talking about
[02:33:38.064 --> 02:33:41.987]  Uh, using EMF frequencies to, like, proximity track things.
[02:33:41.987 --> 02:33:44.849]  And I was like, well, that sounds a lot like what's going on with the vaccine.
[02:33:44.849 --> 02:33:51.474]  And then not only that, they're putting it in the meat, which means they could be trying to get people who are unvaccinated with the meat.
[02:33:51.474 --> 02:34:00.440]  Sir, what I know is that they're on record saying they need a final solution for depopulation, and the groups that run world foundations on killing us run the vaccine program.
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:01.981]  That's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:34:01.981 --> 02:34:04.163]  That's just, like, the number one.
[02:34:04.756 --> 02:34:08.199]  It's like the ability to say the number one is the number one is the ability to be free.
[02:34:08.199 --> 02:34:10.241]  Not two plus two equals four.
[02:34:10.241 --> 02:34:13.063]  And it's just a fact, and they are taking over.
[02:34:13.063 --> 02:34:15.165]  They've made a deal.
[02:34:15.165 --> 02:34:19.668]  They believe that they're going to transcend if they kill everybody, and they're coming after us.
[02:34:19.668 --> 02:34:23.771]  So whatever runs it, Satan, aliens, I don't know, but it's the same effect.
[02:34:23.771 --> 02:34:25.733]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:25.733 --> 02:34:27.575]  Let's talk to Jim in Illinois.
[02:34:27.575 --> 02:34:28.175]  Welcome, sir.
[02:34:28.175 --> 02:34:30.317]  Hello, Alex.
[02:34:30.317 --> 02:34:30.557]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:31.423 --> 02:34:34.264]  Yes, I've been waiting years to talk to you.
[02:34:34.264 --> 02:34:38.847]  I think I have a solution, a game-changing solution to the problem at hand.
[02:34:38.847 --> 02:34:40.488]  What is that?
[02:34:40.488 --> 02:34:45.010]  Is that arrest Bill Gates and arrest Fauci and arrest Klaus Schwab?
[02:34:45.010 --> 02:34:48.812]  No, actually not arresting anybody.
[02:34:48.812 --> 02:34:55.375]  You have spiritual experiences that you've said you've definitely had in your life, and I've had them in my life too.
[02:34:55.375 --> 02:35:00.978]  And I was doing kind of a blog of some dreams I've had and stuff, and
[02:35:02.377 --> 02:35:06.398]  When you keep a diary in a court of law, that's like fact.
[02:35:06.398 --> 02:35:09.819]  And so, I said, what do these dreams mean?
[02:35:09.819 --> 02:35:15.520]  And they manifested in a movie in 2019, talking about a false messiah coming.
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:18.220]  Okay, now, here's the deal.
[02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:20.401]  Jesus, when he came, he was healing people.
[02:35:20.401 --> 02:35:21.441]  He wasn't leading armies.
[02:35:21.441 --> 02:35:23.962]  He was healing people to do what he did.
[02:35:23.962 --> 02:35:30.943]  Well, what you and I can do, what I would like to come do is come down to Austin, do a short video.
[02:35:31.815 --> 02:35:32.575]  I'll tell you what, sir.
[02:35:32.575 --> 02:35:33.356]  Do this.
[02:35:33.356 --> 02:35:34.176]  Shoot a YouTube video about it.
[02:35:56.323 --> 02:36:03.566]  And send it to us, or send us a video of what your idea is, and let me see it before I would have the time to meet with you and things like that.
[02:36:03.566 --> 02:36:06.287]  You don't understand, I've got a great crew, they're great people.
[02:36:06.287 --> 02:36:09.928]  I have trouble balancing my checkbook and even getting a license plate on my car.
[02:36:09.928 --> 02:36:13.570]  I mean, it would take 50 people to do that, 97,000 million years, okay?
[02:36:13.570 --> 02:36:21.833]  So, I mean, I'm just literally trying to like cover documents, cover articles, be prepared, stay on the air, fund our operation.
[02:36:23.354 --> 02:36:27.838]  Yeah, I mean, anything that has to do with Jesus, I believe, is the key to waking folks up and changing the world.
[02:36:27.838 --> 02:36:33.023]  But the big question is, who's interpretation of that?
[02:36:33.023 --> 02:36:35.485]  And so, yeah, people better get right with God.
[02:36:35.485 --> 02:36:36.366]  It's a spiritual battle.
[02:36:36.366 --> 02:36:39.549]  I appreciate your call.
[02:36:39.549 --> 02:36:43.573]  Send a video to RobDew, R-O-B-D-E-W.
[02:36:43.573 --> 02:36:44.894]  RobDew at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:44.894 --> 02:36:45.915]  He tends to get to all the email.
[02:36:46.554 --> 02:36:48.396]  And send me what it is you want to meet with me about.
[02:36:48.396 --> 02:36:52.500]  If I started to meet with everybody that wanted to meet with me, I wouldn't even have time to brush my teeth in the morning.
[02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:53.100]  Thank you so much.

[02:38:12.564 --> 02:38:14.285]  Resistance to tyrants.
[02:38:14.285 --> 02:38:16.146]  Resistance to tyrants.
[02:38:16.146 --> 02:38:18.308]  And obedience to God.
[02:38:18.308 --> 02:38:20.430]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:38:20.430 --> 02:38:25.633]  Here are some of the over-the-top stories that are so important to see on InfoWars.com.
[02:38:25.633 --> 02:38:29.416]  I haven't even gotten to since we went live three hours ago.
[02:38:29.416 --> 02:38:37.462]  Mom of three excited about getting vaccines dies from blood clot in brain following AstraZeneca injection.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:46.604]  And they're now reporting that most of the so-called COVID deaths, and that's on InfoWars.com, are from the vaccine now.
[02:38:46.604 --> 02:38:56.289]  A mother of three in the UK died after developing blood clots as a result of receiving AstraZeneca's experimental mRNA jab or family reports.
[02:38:56.289 --> 02:38:57.790]  It grew too many crystals too quickly.
[02:38:57.790 --> 02:39:00.311]  It's supposed to kill her in like five years.
[02:39:00.311 --> 02:39:01.672]  But some people are going to be hit quicker.
[02:39:03.323 --> 02:39:03.983]  Fact-checking.
[02:39:03.983 --> 02:39:09.905]  Virologist who worked at Wuhan Lab is suddenly open to lab leak hypothesis.
[02:39:09.905 --> 02:39:10.466]  Flashback.
[02:39:10.466 --> 02:39:17.688]  Bill Barr says mail-in voting scheme reckless and dangerous.
[02:39:17.688 --> 02:39:20.769]  It's all important stuff at InfoWars.com.
[02:39:20.769 --> 02:39:22.450]  Only way it gets out is you sharing it.
[02:39:22.450 --> 02:39:25.711]  I salute you and I thank you.
[02:39:25.711 --> 02:39:26.571]  Okay.
[02:39:26.571 --> 02:39:27.812]  JD in Indiana.
[02:39:27.812 --> 02:39:28.932]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:39:30.396 --> 02:39:31.957]  Thank you, sir, for taking my call.
[02:39:31.957 --> 02:39:36.601]  I gotta say, I absolutely appreciate all of your journalistic integrity.
[02:39:36.601 --> 02:39:40.184]  It's very rare nowadays, so I definitely want to thank you for that.
[02:39:41.302 --> 02:39:45.383]  I want to talk about some medical tyranny that I've had to deal with myself.
[02:39:45.383 --> 02:39:56.267]  It doesn't necessarily deal with the COVID thing, but it gets more to what you talk about us taking care of ourselves, getting good nutrition in, how we're being poisoned through our food.
[02:39:56.267 --> 02:39:58.027]  And it's absolutely the truth.
[02:39:58.027 --> 02:39:59.127]  I ended up getting injured.
[02:39:59.127 --> 02:40:00.728]  I was an officer for the state of Indiana.
[02:40:00.728 --> 02:40:02.328]  I ended up getting injured.
[02:40:02.328 --> 02:40:08.070]  And after I got injured, I ended up ballooning up to almost 400 and something pounds from all the medicine that they were putting me on.
[02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:10.051]  I actually ended up having a stroke.
[02:40:10.051 --> 02:40:10.451]  Wow.
[02:40:10.451 --> 02:40:10.651]  Right?
[02:40:11.420 --> 02:40:18.927]  So, I ended up going and completely thinking about how our ancestors used to eat, right?
[02:40:18.927 --> 02:40:22.711]  Berries, meat, living, being outside.
[02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:24.152]  That's what I started doing.
[02:40:24.152 --> 02:40:36.404]  I weigh 215 pounds right now and I didn't do anything to get that way except for change the food that I was putting into my body and get a little bit of exercise and get outside and I'm beyond healthy.
[02:40:37.515 --> 02:40:38.476]  And that's the thing.
[02:40:38.476 --> 02:40:46.085]  I'm not Mr. Health because I work 18 hours a day and have my own issues, but I'm alive because I take supplements and exercise.
[02:40:46.085 --> 02:40:48.447]  And so I know the keys to success.
[02:40:48.447 --> 02:40:51.150]  What you just said, so simple, doesn't mean I follow it.
[02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:53.293]  So when I'm up for giving advice, I'm giving it to myself.
[02:40:53.293 --> 02:40:56.376]  One finger pointed at you, three back at me.
[02:40:56.376 --> 02:40:57.257]  But absolutely.
[02:40:58.158 --> 02:41:02.960]  Everybody knows, you start living in a tent in your backyard, you're gonna lose a bunch of weight.
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:06.001]  You start going swimming and getting in the sun, you're gonna lose weight.
[02:41:06.001 --> 02:41:19.667]  You stop, you know, eating processed foods, but absolutely, I can't tell you how many people I've known, I've loved, family, that have like a car wreck, and they put them on Prozac, and then now they're on this drug and that drug, and then they're dead in five years.
[02:41:19.667 --> 02:41:23.008]  And it's just, it's just insane.
[02:41:23.008 --> 02:41:24.509]  Tonight, I'm 38 years old.
[02:41:24.509 --> 02:41:25.269]  I was going to die.
[02:41:26.261 --> 02:41:38.108]  And here in Indiana, as a matter of fact, the one thing about COVID, Ball Memorial State is now forcing all, or I'm sorry, IU Health, is now forcing all of their nurses to now get vaccinated.
[02:41:38.108 --> 02:41:39.709]  As a matter of fact, they had a protest
[02:41:40.439 --> 02:41:45.123]  Down in Indy, in front of IU, and one of the nurses was there.
[02:41:45.123 --> 02:41:45.743]  She's a liberal.
[02:41:45.743 --> 02:41:48.305]  She was even talking about being pro-vaccine.
[02:41:48.305 --> 02:41:51.447]  She knew she shouldn't have took it, and it completely paralyzed her.
[02:41:51.447 --> 02:41:54.429]  And they completely blocked this on Facebook.
[02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:55.330]  Nobody can see this.
[02:41:55.330 --> 02:41:58.012]  They recorded it, put it out there, and nobody's doing anything about it.
[02:41:58.012 --> 02:41:58.452]  That's right.
[02:41:58.452 --> 02:41:59.113]  She's a victim.
[02:41:59.113 --> 02:42:00.014]  She's paralyzed.
[02:42:00.014 --> 02:42:05.237]  She comes out to talk about it, and then they block the victim so they can victimize more people.
[02:42:05.237 --> 02:42:05.838]  God bless you.
[02:42:05.838 --> 02:42:07.139]  That's right.
[02:42:07.139 --> 02:42:07.739]  God bless you, sir.
[02:42:07.739 --> 02:42:08.660]  Thanks for your testimonial.
[02:42:09.498 --> 02:42:12.019]  I could talk all day to these callers, but Gerald Cemente is loaded for Barry.
[02:42:12.019 --> 02:42:14.420]  Let me raise that point.
[02:42:14.420 --> 02:42:22.143]  I had, a couple weeks ago, on the great nurse that was leading the fight in Houston and saying she's not going to take forced inoculations.
[02:42:22.802 --> 02:42:25.063]  And I said, hey, I'll try to come to your event in a week and a half.
[02:42:25.063 --> 02:42:26.184]  People should go to it.
[02:42:26.184 --> 02:42:29.066]  Well, I'd forgotten I had a family thing I'd agreed to months before.
[02:42:29.066 --> 02:42:30.587]  I couldn't go to it.
[02:42:30.587 --> 02:42:36.771]  So I had her back on the air Friday and said, I probably can't come, but here is where you're going to be.
[02:42:36.771 --> 02:42:37.672]  People should go.
[02:42:37.672 --> 02:42:39.693]  The Houston Chronicle didn't cover their event.
[02:42:39.693 --> 02:42:44.816]  It was all Alex Jones, a no-show at an event when I'm hardly ever a no-show.
[02:42:44.816 --> 02:42:46.197]  And I wasn't a no-show.
[02:42:46.197 --> 02:42:47.558]  I'm about to go to the border tomorrow.
[02:42:48.418 --> 02:42:51.461]  You know, where Trump's going, I've got to be here sometimes.
[02:42:51.461 --> 02:42:54.643]  But, you know, the idea is that's how they spin everything.
[02:42:54.643 --> 02:42:57.305]  Did they cover all the people that came to the demonstration, I'm told?
[02:42:57.305 --> 02:42:58.526]  They got damaged by the shots?
[02:42:58.526 --> 02:42:59.487]  No!
[02:42:59.487 --> 02:43:04.911]  It was all Alex Jones no-show at former Methodist employees anti-vax rally.
[02:43:04.911 --> 02:43:06.593]  I wanted to go to that!
[02:43:06.593 --> 02:43:08.914]  I promoted it, but see, I'm a fraud.
[02:43:08.914 --> 02:43:09.575]  I'm a no-show.
[02:43:10.214 --> 02:43:14.380]  No, the fraud is the Houston Chronicle covering up the victims and what's happening.
[02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:21.790]  And the blood is going to be on your hands when things like that happen, when people get damaged and you cover it up and more get damaged.
[02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:23.172]  It's a great point for the caller.
[02:43:23.172 --> 02:43:24.814]  Okay, listen.
[02:43:24.814 --> 02:43:25.636]  Ramon in Vegas.
[02:43:26.738 --> 02:43:39.002]  Haley in Georgia, Brian in New York, and Dave in Rhode Island, I love you, and remind me, crew, this is your job to remind me, if they want to come back on tomorrow, I'll give them all 5, 10 minutes a piece, instead of just giving them 30 seconds a piece.
[02:43:39.002 --> 02:43:48.805]  So I can't get to you, but we'll get your name and number, if you want, or the producer will give you a secret time to call in tomorrow, when nobody else is calling us, we can just get you on the line, if you'll give us your number.
[02:43:48.805 --> 02:43:53.287]  We would love to get you back on, but I need to hear what Gerald Cilente has to say.
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:44:02.523]  So, Gerald Cilente, the great trends forecaster, best-selling author and researcher, takes over in the next 50 minutes ahead of the war with Owen Schroyer.
[02:44:02.523 --> 02:44:04.664]  Gerald Cilente, thank you so much, my friend.
[02:44:04.664 --> 02:44:10.026]  Thank you, of course, for all that you do.
[02:44:10.026 --> 02:44:15.568]  And, you know, you've been talking about the, you know, the vaccinations.
[02:44:15.568 --> 02:44:20.390]  And one of our trends that we're looking at now, we're calling it COVID War 2.0.
[02:44:22.182 --> 02:44:25.763]  Look what's going on over there in Australia.
[02:44:25.763 --> 02:44:29.505]  And you keep reading the headlines everywhere.
[02:44:29.505 --> 02:44:36.888]  It's COVID-19 Delta variant prompts new travel restrictions across Europe.
[02:44:36.888 --> 02:44:38.869]  It's one after another.
[02:44:38.869 --> 02:44:41.450]  COVID-19 variant.
[02:44:41.450 --> 02:44:43.111]  So there's now they're selling the
[02:44:45.155 --> 02:44:46.556]  The Delta variant.
[02:44:46.556 --> 02:44:48.317]  Yeah, the Delta Blues.
[02:44:48.317 --> 02:44:55.341]  Two more COVID cases Australia-wide amid fear Sydney lockdown will run longer.
[02:44:55.341 --> 02:44:58.222]  Two more cases of what?
[02:44:58.222 --> 02:45:06.647]  Cases of a virus that is with the tests, as we all know, are totally inaccurate.
[02:45:06.647 --> 02:45:10.829]  The PCR test and the guy that invented them even said so.
[02:45:10.829 --> 02:45:13.651]  But the reason they're doing this is very clear.
[02:45:14.924 --> 02:45:22.288]  You only have, you have under a 5% vaccination rate in Australia.
[02:45:22.288 --> 02:45:27.231]  So what they're doing now is they're pushing for more vaccines.
[02:45:27.231 --> 02:45:29.993]  The Delta variant, there you go.
[02:45:29.993 --> 02:45:33.315]  Prompts some countries to return to lockdown.
[02:45:33.315 --> 02:45:35.116]  Now let's go back to Australia.
[02:45:35.116 --> 02:45:37.077]  25 million people.
[02:45:43.738 --> 02:45:47.819]  910 alleged COVID deaths.
[02:45:47.819 --> 02:45:52.900]  The average age is 79 years old.
[02:45:52.900 --> 02:46:02.283]  910 deaths in 18 months.
[02:46:02.283 --> 02:46:04.504]  And you're locking down the place?
[02:46:04.504 --> 02:46:09.365]  Oh, and how many people died of the virus in the last six months in Australia?
[02:46:10.649 --> 02:46:15.410]  A country of 25 million?
[02:46:15.410 --> 02:46:19.412]  How about none?
[02:46:19.412 --> 02:46:35.016]  But what they're doing in article after article is they're saying about the Delta variant and how afraid they are that this is going to get much, much worse.
[02:46:35.016 --> 02:46:38.017]  So they're selling more fear and hysteria.
[02:46:38.931 --> 02:46:45.594]  The vaccine push is going to be a big push and it's going to keep going.
[02:46:45.594 --> 02:46:51.357]  Alex is talking about the AstraZeneca vaccination.
[02:46:51.357 --> 02:47:06.845]  This little clown boy over here, Bruce Springsteen, Gutless Steen, Moron Steen, Slime Steen, has a show over here on Broadway.
[02:47:07.555 --> 02:47:10.717]  If you got the Johnson shot, you're okay.
[02:47:10.717 --> 02:47:13.659]  The Pfizer shot, you're alright.
[02:47:13.659 --> 02:47:19.562]  But you can't come in if you got the AstraZeneca shot.
[02:47:19.562 --> 02:47:21.464]  I'm not making that up.
[02:47:21.464 --> 02:47:23.325]  And what are they pushing in Australia?
[02:47:23.325 --> 02:47:28.408]  The AstraZeneca shot.
[02:47:28.408 --> 02:47:32.690]  So this is, again, this thing, none of them have been approved by the FDA.
[02:47:32.690 --> 02:47:34.752]  Operation Warp Speed.
[02:47:34.752 --> 02:47:36.933]  And to me, you have to have a warp mind to get it.
[02:47:38.112 --> 02:47:39.153]  Get the shot.
[02:47:39.153 --> 02:47:42.034]  No way in the world I'm going to get one.
[02:47:42.034 --> 02:47:45.235]  So get ready for COVID War 2.
[02:47:45.235 --> 02:47:51.038]  Things are going to cool down this summer, but they're going to heat up in the winter.
[02:47:51.038 --> 02:47:53.779]  Delta variant is back, and we'll be right back.
[02:47:54.395 --> 02:47:55.635]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:47:55.635 --> 02:47:59.557]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:47:59.557 --> 02:48:01.097]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:48:01.097 --> 02:48:04.058]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:48:04.058 --> 02:48:09.620]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:10.820]  I can help you, too.
[02:48:10.820 --> 02:48:13.741]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:48:13.741 --> 02:48:15.962]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:48:15.962 --> 02:48:20.403]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:48:20.403 --> 02:48:22.744]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[02:49:24.893 --> 02:49:28.274]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[02:49:28.274 --> 02:49:38.216]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[02:49:38.216 --> 02:49:41.557]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[02:49:41.557 --> 02:49:53.139]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[02:49:53.979 --> 02:49:58.642]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[02:49:58.642 --> 02:50:00.723]  Well, that's where M4Wars comes in.
[02:50:00.723 --> 02:50:05.046]  You fund us, you support M4WarsTore.com, you get great products to you at the same time.
[02:50:05.046 --> 02:50:14.712]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[02:50:14.712 --> 02:50:16.133]  That's our job, so please,
[02:50:16.713 --> 02:50:22.202]  Keep us on air, so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock troops in the information war.
[02:50:22.202 --> 02:50:27.951]  Fund us at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:27.951 --> 02:50:30.555]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:47.701 --> 02:50:49.623]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:50:49.623 --> 02:50:59.812]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Solenti.
[02:50:59.812 --> 02:51:02.694]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:02.694 --> 02:51:08.899]  And remember what I keep saying because you might forget it or you're not doing anything about it.
[02:51:08.899 --> 02:51:11.762]  Support InfoWars.
[02:51:11.762 --> 02:51:13.003]  Keep the truth alive.
[02:51:14.378 --> 02:51:21.219]  Censorship is only going to increase, only going to get much worse.
[02:51:21.219 --> 02:51:24.060]  You're seeing it on and on.
[02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:37.643]  Matter of fact, a study just came out, an alarming new study on media consumption around the world has found the trust between news organizations and consumers is the lowest in the United States.
[02:51:38.974 --> 02:51:56.546]  Americans are not only distrustful of traditional media outlets, the consumption of the news has also waned since Donald Trump left office, according to Digital News Report 2021, produced by Oxford University and Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.
[02:51:56.546 --> 02:52:00.229]  Ask whether they agree that most news can be trusted.
[02:52:00.229 --> 02:52:02.170]  A majority of the time, only 29% of U.S.
[02:52:02.170 --> 02:52:02.871]  respondents agreed.
[02:52:02.871 --> 02:52:02.971]  OK?
[02:52:02.971 --> 02:52:03.131]  29% agreed.
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:19.629]  They said there's only 30% stupid morons that swallow the crap that the major networks are shoving down our throat.
[02:52:19.629 --> 02:52:31.299]  And all they are are prostitutes, they're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[02:52:31.299 --> 02:52:35.042]  So support InfoWars.
[02:52:35.042 --> 02:52:36.563]  Buy the great products.
[02:52:37.592 --> 02:52:59.685]  Like the caller was saying, he put on 400 pounds he weighed, but when they had him on all these drugs, and he started getting healthy, now he's down to the 200 range, by eating healthy, working out, and who is the, do they ever talk about increasing your health?
[02:52:59.685 --> 02:53:00.466]  No!
[02:53:00.466 --> 02:53:05.369]  So you want Survival Shield, you want the products that they have.
[02:53:06.178 --> 02:53:08.560]  To build your health up.
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:11.242]  They never talk a word about it.
[02:53:11.242 --> 02:53:14.184]  And again, the data shows it.
[02:53:14.184 --> 02:53:20.289]  The people that are dying are elderly, infirm, 2.6, pre-existing comorbidities.
[02:53:20.289 --> 02:53:23.051]  They're allegedly dying of COVID.
[02:53:23.051 --> 02:53:32.158]  Because if you fall out of an airplane, you know, try to, you know, parachute, your parachute doesn't open.
[02:53:33.169 --> 02:53:39.213]  And you've died and they do a test and you had COVID, you died of COVID.
[02:53:39.213 --> 02:53:47.297]  So stay in tune by investing in the truth.
[02:53:47.297 --> 02:53:49.058]  So support InfoWars.
[02:53:49.058 --> 02:53:51.119]  And of course, you're going to want to read the Trends Journal.
[02:53:51.119 --> 02:53:53.081]  There's no other magazine like it.
[02:53:53.081 --> 02:54:02.166]  You know, there's a study that just came out today on the greatest fear that people have right now with Biden's popularity rating.
[02:54:03.208 --> 02:54:05.350]  And it's crime.
[02:54:05.350 --> 02:54:07.251]  Boy, can't figure it out.
[02:54:07.251 --> 02:54:10.294]  Blow me away, never would have thought of that.
[02:54:10.294 --> 02:54:14.357]  What did we write when the COVID war broke out?
[02:54:14.357 --> 02:54:16.719]  Get ready for a spike in crime.
[02:54:16.719 --> 02:54:26.806]  Because they're locking down everybody, putting hundreds of millions of people around the world, probably billions out of work, hundreds of millions into deep poverty.
[02:54:26.806 --> 02:54:29.849]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:32.602]  And they're losing it.
[02:54:32.602 --> 02:54:36.305]  And they're going to keep losing it.
[02:54:36.305 --> 02:54:39.628]  So.
[02:54:39.628 --> 02:54:43.632]  Again, we forecast history before it happens.
[02:54:43.632 --> 02:54:48.596]  So we also have articles in there by Bradley Steiner in the Trends Journal on survivalism.
[02:54:48.596 --> 02:54:51.399]  You better learn how to fight and protect yourself.
[02:54:51.399 --> 02:54:52.560]  Because if you don't, you're dead.
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:56.183]  You know, any situation could happen.
[02:54:57.182 --> 02:55:01.985]  No, the cops aren't going to be there to save your life when someone tries to attack you.
[02:55:01.985 --> 02:55:05.908]  And again, I had my own school in close combat, attackproof.com.
[02:55:05.908 --> 02:55:07.509]  That's my teacher, John Perkins.
[02:55:07.509 --> 02:55:10.651]  Not that John Perkins, the real John Perkins.
[02:55:10.651 --> 02:55:16.554]  And so anyway, that's where we're at.
[02:55:16.554 --> 02:55:18.716]  People are very concerned about what's going on.
[02:55:18.716 --> 02:55:20.797]  As I said, now they're starting COVID War 2.0.
[02:55:20.797 --> 02:55:21.598]  Here's more headlines.
[02:55:24.477 --> 02:55:29.780]  COVID-19 strain threatens Europe's recovery.
[02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:32.921]  Wall Street Journal.
[02:55:32.921 --> 02:55:39.685]  Delta variant is spreading rapidly in US.
[02:55:39.685 --> 02:55:41.245]  Wall Street Journal.
[02:55:41.245 --> 02:55:43.967]  You see the way the articles are underlined in the comments?
[02:55:43.967 --> 02:55:45.728]  That's what I do with all the stuff that I read.
[02:55:45.728 --> 02:55:48.249]  And it goes to the writers.
[02:55:48.249 --> 02:55:52.391]  They write the story and then I tell what the trend forecast is going to be.
[02:55:54.847 --> 02:56:04.109]  Fauci declares Delta variant greatest threat to the nation's efforts to eliminate COVID.
[02:56:04.109 --> 02:56:08.029]  All right?
[02:56:08.029 --> 02:56:12.530]  White House Chief Medical Advisor, White House Chief B.S.
[02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:14.730]  Artist.
[02:56:14.730 --> 02:56:23.352]  Not that other freak lying slime or that unhealthy looking blob from Minnesota, that guy, Osterholm.
[02:56:24.935 --> 02:56:27.657]  Hey, we don't hear from Lola anymore.
[02:56:27.657 --> 02:56:28.278]  What's her name?
[02:56:28.278 --> 02:56:29.219]  His name?
[02:56:29.219 --> 02:56:35.224]  Rachel Levin, the health expert, the United States, the health minister, whatever.
[02:56:35.224 --> 02:56:42.189]  Anyway, that guy Ulsterholm was warning about a Category 5 COVID.
[02:56:42.189 --> 02:56:46.453]  And how about that other one, Rochelle Walensky, the CDC head?
[02:56:47.506 --> 02:56:54.910]  Warning about, oh, last March, oh, I'm so fearful of what's going to happen, the doom.
[02:56:54.910 --> 02:56:57.872]  Yeah, the doom seller.
[02:56:57.872 --> 02:57:11.419]  So anyway, they're selling the greatest threat to the nation is the COVID-19 variant, the Delta variant, the Delta blues, goddamn Delta blues.
[02:57:11.419 --> 02:57:12.640]  There she is, Ms.
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:13.681]  Fatshah Brutha.
[02:57:14.938 --> 02:57:17.899]  Yes, she is telling us the crap.
[02:57:17.899 --> 02:57:19.459]  Impending doom.
[02:57:19.459 --> 02:57:21.080]  That's what she was selling.
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:24.361]  How about you're full of baloney?
[02:57:24.361 --> 02:57:26.701]  Oh, and again, has nothing to do with women.
[02:57:26.701 --> 02:57:32.483]  I just went after Freud Fauci and Katz on the old stone.
[02:57:32.483 --> 02:57:34.183]  So take it easy, everybody.
[02:57:34.183 --> 02:57:37.684]  And what else we have?
[02:57:37.684 --> 02:57:40.665]  Masks return to Queensland.
[02:57:40.665 --> 02:57:43.306]  As it posts through three new
[02:57:44.136 --> 02:57:46.198]  COVID cases.
[02:57:46.198 --> 02:57:48.900]  This is Queensland, Australia.
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:54.884]  And you look at the clowns that are holding up these stupid masks.
[02:57:54.884 --> 02:57:56.426]  The health ministers, Ms.
[02:57:56.426 --> 02:58:03.331]  Young and his other, the premier, that's a curse word, calling these leaders premiers.
[02:58:03.331 --> 02:58:05.433]  These stupid masks.
[02:58:05.433 --> 02:58:07.715]  They're holding them up, showing everybody.
[02:58:07.715 --> 02:58:11.738]  There she is.
[02:58:11.738 --> 02:58:13.159]  And you read on the masks.
[02:58:14.255 --> 02:58:20.219]  These masks do not eliminate exposure to the risks of any disease or infection.
[02:58:20.219 --> 02:58:24.662]  Here they are, right on the box, and they're shoving that crap down our mouth.
[02:58:24.662 --> 02:58:26.182]  There she is.
[02:58:26.182 --> 02:58:28.024]  She's healthy looking, huh?
[02:58:28.024 --> 02:58:33.967]  Boy, she should maybe team up with that guy with the 400 pounds before he lost it.
[02:58:33.967 --> 02:58:36.609]  And these are the people telling us what to do?
[02:58:36.609 --> 02:58:38.210]  How could you swallow this crap?
[02:58:39.378 --> 02:58:46.160]  How could anybody keep swallowing the garbage that they keep shoving down our throat?
[02:58:46.160 --> 02:58:47.880]  They're doing this for control.
[02:58:47.880 --> 02:58:54.282]  There's Lola, L-O-L-A, Lola.
[02:58:54.282 --> 02:58:56.202]  Look at this.
[02:58:56.202 --> 02:58:59.943]  That clown telling me about health?
[02:58:59.943 --> 02:59:01.683]  Again, first book I worked on.
[02:59:01.683 --> 02:59:04.464]  Natural Healing.
[02:59:05.228 --> 02:59:06.288]  Natural Healing.
[02:59:06.288 --> 02:59:07.849]  Know a thing or two about it.
[02:59:07.849 --> 02:59:10.950]  Got an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences.
[02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:20.293]  Oh, and before I forget, very important, 4th of July, festival in Kingston, New York, and Judge Napolitano's gonna be here.
[02:59:20.293 --> 02:59:24.354]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:24.354 --> 02:59:28.676]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic.
[02:59:29.469 --> 02:59:33.414]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[02:59:33.414 --> 02:59:36.758]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[02:59:36.758 --> 02:59:38.219]  And we're all in this together.
[02:59:38.219 --> 02:59:43.566]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[02:59:43.566 --> 02:59:44.266]  But it's true.
[02:59:44.266 --> 02:59:47.670]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[02:59:48.411 --> 02:59:50.893]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[02:59:50.893 --> 02:59:52.955]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[02:59:52.955 --> 02:59:54.716]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[02:59:54.716 --> 02:59:55.597]  And we're still here.
[02:59:55.597 --> 03:00:00.020]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:00:00.020 --> 03:00:01.622]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:00:01.622 --> 03:00:03.783]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:00:03.783 --> 03:00:05.505]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[03:00:06.025 --> 03:00:09.587]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[03:00:32.532 --> 03:00:49.779]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[03:00:49.779 --> 03:00:50.559]  Worse than slaves.
[03:00:50.559 --> 03:00:54.581]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[03:00:54.581 --> 03:01:01.404]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[03:01:02.122 --> 03:01:12.147]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[03:01:12.147 --> 03:01:16.329]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[03:01:16.329 --> 03:01:18.510]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[03:01:18.510 --> 03:01:20.791]  Freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[03:01:20.791 --> 03:01:22.032]  It is a spiritual battle.
[03:01:22.032 --> 03:01:23.773]  An end for wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[03:01:24.841 --> 03:01:29.182]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[03:01:29.182 --> 03:01:39.804]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.

[03:05:47.166 --> 03:05:50.127]  So please do what you can, OccupyPeace.com.
[03:05:50.127 --> 03:05:57.449]  And speaking of wars, how about that bombs away Biden, huh?
[03:05:57.449 --> 03:06:00.110]  Yeah, you don't know what he did?
[03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:01.591]  Yesterday?
[03:06:01.591 --> 03:06:02.811]  Bombs away!
[03:06:03.903 --> 03:06:09.728]  over Syria and Iraq.
[03:06:09.728 --> 03:06:13.490]  That's right!
[03:06:13.490 --> 03:06:30.864]  United States carried out three airstrikes early Monday morning in Iraq and Syria against facilities used by Iranian-backed militias that have in recent weeks conducted
[03:06:32.987 --> 03:06:37.849]  Strikes against locations where American military is, the Pentagon said.
[03:06:37.849 --> 03:06:41.450]  At President Biden's direction, U.S.
[03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:55.814]  military forces earlier this evening conducted defensive precision air strikes against facilities used by Iranian-backed militia groups.
[03:06:55.814 --> 03:07:00.496]  Pentagon spokesman, mouthpiece,
[03:07:01.448 --> 03:07:11.310]  John F. Kirby, you know what that F is for, said in a statement.
[03:07:11.310 --> 03:07:21.653]  So this is a lawless bombing of Syria and Iraq.
[03:07:21.653 --> 03:07:30.315]  The lines that they use by the prostitutes are disgusting, and CNN just keeps it going.
[03:07:32.583 --> 03:07:38.428]  The White House said the strikes were backed by Article 2 of the Constitution.
[03:07:38.428 --> 03:07:43.453]  Article 2 of the Constitution says that the President is the Commander-in-Chief.
[03:07:43.453 --> 03:07:53.903]  Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution says only Congress has the right to vote to go to war.
[03:07:53.903 --> 03:07:58.307]  And then flabber-mouthed Pelosi shoots off her crap
[03:07:59.085 --> 03:08:04.910]  And all of your libtards, they're not liberals, liberals are free-thinking people, they're against this kind of thing.
[03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:08.032]  They're misusing the word.
[03:08:08.032 --> 03:08:15.939]  She goes on to say, protecting the military heroes who defend our freedom is a sacred priority.
[03:08:15.939 --> 03:08:19.101]  Who the hell are you talking to?
[03:08:19.101 --> 03:08:23.745]  Military heroes, a sacred priority, in a war based on lies?
[03:08:23.745 --> 03:08:27.328]  That you don't hear anything about anymore?
[03:08:28.627 --> 03:08:34.531]  About that little daddy's boy with cojones smaller than a mothball, George W. Bush?
[03:08:34.531 --> 03:08:38.753]  Lying that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda?
[03:08:38.753 --> 03:08:42.856]  And you have the nerve to shoot this crap out of your mouth?
[03:08:42.856 --> 03:08:45.097]  Pelosi?
[03:08:45.097 --> 03:08:47.078]  Pelosi puke.
[03:08:47.078 --> 03:08:47.999]  That's what that is.
[03:08:49.562 --> 03:08:51.843]  Protecting the military heroes.
[03:08:51.843 --> 03:09:00.165]  Oh, you mean the people that sign up for the military because they believe your lies and then some 20 a day commit suicide?
[03:09:00.165 --> 03:09:01.945]  Because of depression?
[03:09:01.945 --> 03:09:05.726]  And then overdosing on drugs because you lie to them so much?
[03:09:05.726 --> 03:09:13.548]  And they're young and they believed you?
[03:09:13.548 --> 03:09:14.908]  So, this is what's going on.
[03:09:16.940 --> 03:09:22.562]  As demonstrated, President Biden has been clear that he will act to protect U.S.
[03:09:22.562 --> 03:09:30.805]  personnel, giving the ongoing series attack by Iranian-backed targeting U.S.
[03:09:30.805 --> 03:09:35.187]  interests in Iraq.
[03:09:35.187 --> 03:09:43.550]  I would get censored for using the proper language to describe the crap spewing out of this Kirby's mouth.
[03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:45.351]  Again, I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:49.142]  So I fight for peace and freedom and justice.
[03:09:49.142 --> 03:09:52.384]  So these aren't empty words.
[03:09:52.384 --> 03:09:53.164]  But U.S.
[03:09:53.164 --> 03:09:55.746]  interests in Iraq?
[03:09:55.746 --> 03:09:59.288]  Hey, crap face slimeball!
[03:09:59.288 --> 03:10:04.711]  America has no interests in Iraq!
[03:10:04.711 --> 03:10:09.114]  Our only interests are in America!
[03:10:09.114 --> 03:10:15.658]  By the Founding Fathers, not what you murderous freaks have given us!
[03:10:16.989 --> 03:10:20.191]  Oh, and who's our Defense Secretary?
[03:10:20.191 --> 03:10:24.253]  That spoke to Biden about doing this?
[03:10:24.253 --> 03:10:29.216]  Oh yeah, that guy Austin?
[03:10:29.216 --> 03:10:30.477]  Yeah.
[03:10:30.477 --> 03:10:33.058]  And where was he just came from?
[03:10:33.058 --> 03:10:38.081]  Before he was a General, then he'd be after him, he's a General on the Board of Directors of Raytheon?
[03:10:38.081 --> 03:10:42.604]  One of the biggest defense contractors in America?
[03:10:44.289 --> 03:10:51.155]  President Eisenhower's farewell address, January 17th, 1961.
[03:10:51.155 --> 03:11:10.972]  His farewell address, warning the American people, the military-industrial complex has taken over the nation, and robbing the country of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[03:11:13.254 --> 03:11:13.774]  There he is.
[03:11:13.774 --> 03:11:18.956]  There's Austin.
[03:11:18.956 --> 03:11:22.737]  What a joke.
[03:11:22.737 --> 03:11:27.218]  Yep.
[03:11:27.218 --> 03:11:28.959]  We have no business being there.
[03:11:28.959 --> 03:11:32.740]  This is lawless.
[03:11:32.740 --> 03:11:38.962]  And what you're looking at now is when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:11:38.962 --> 03:11:40.262]  We got the COVID war.
[03:11:40.262 --> 03:11:42.983]  People forget the economy was going down before this happened.
[03:11:46.232 --> 03:11:52.557]  And now, there's going to be the Biden bounce, but it's going to be quick and short.
[03:11:52.557 --> 03:12:02.886]  When we come back, we're going to talk a lot about inflation, where it's going, what it's doing to the markets, where it's going to go up and what's going to go down.
[03:12:02.886 --> 03:12:04.487]  Because this thing's going down hard.
[03:12:05.419 --> 03:12:10.462]  And again, people are stupid enough to follow all the crap spewed out of my politician's mouth.
[03:12:10.462 --> 03:12:17.887]  How could any moron be so stupid to believe George W. Bush, the daddy's boy, put on third base and throw you the home run?
[03:12:17.887 --> 03:12:20.269]  Afghan War?
[03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:21.810]  Here it is.
[03:12:21.810 --> 03:12:29.335]  We're going out now, after 20 years, public opinion of the Afghan War in Afghanistan.
[03:12:29.335 --> 03:12:33.238]  This is from Gallup Poll, in October,
[03:12:35.915 --> 03:12:35.935]  2001.
[03:12:35.935 --> 03:12:50.118]  88% approved of the military action against Afghanistan in the latest Gallup poll.
[03:12:50.118 --> 03:12:52.078]  That's how stupid the people are.
[03:12:52.078 --> 03:12:59.740]  How could anybody with a brain march off to a Bush war, a Clinton war,
[03:13:00.712 --> 03:13:06.577]  A Johnson war, a Nixon war, a Truman war, and the wars just keep going on.
[03:13:06.577 --> 03:13:11.582]  And now you got the Biden wars.
[03:13:11.582 --> 03:13:16.146]  So we're going to come back in a few and remember, support InfoWars.
[03:13:16.146 --> 03:13:21.330]  They got great products and you need to build your health at a time when they're destroying in front of us.
[03:13:23.795 --> 03:13:32.258]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:13:32.258 --> 03:13:42.802]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[03:13:42.802 --> 03:13:52.445]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[03:13:52.785 --> 03:13:58.750]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[03:13:58.750 --> 03:14:03.615]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[03:14:03.615 --> 03:14:11.802]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[03:14:12.102 --> 03:14:16.304]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[03:14:16.304 --> 03:14:20.627]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[03:14:20.627 --> 03:14:23.548]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[03:14:34.861 --> 03:14:39.225]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[03:14:39.225 --> 03:14:44.990]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:56.600]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:14:59.321]  I need your help more than ever now.
[03:14:59.321 --> 03:15:03.443]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[03:15:03.443 --> 03:15:14.069]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:15:14.069 --> 03:15:23.594]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[03:15:23.594 --> 03:15:24.254]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:26.076 --> 03:15:33.378]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[03:15:33.378 --> 03:15:40.180]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[03:15:40.180 --> 03:15:47.182]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[03:15:47.182 --> 03:15:51.743]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[03:15:52.003 --> 03:15:53.965]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[03:15:53.965 --> 03:15:56.567]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[03:15:56.567 --> 03:15:58.409]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[03:15:58.409 --> 03:16:00.951]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[03:16:00.951 --> 03:16:05.235]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[03:16:05.235 --> 03:16:12.481]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times better.
[03:16:13.562 --> 03:16:14.203]  We're good to go.
[03:16:31.242 --> 03:16:36.707]  July 4th, 2021 is now upon us, and that means our yearly big sale is here.

[03:17:08.210 --> 03:17:09.871]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:17:44.599 --> 03:17:47.040]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:49.722]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:17:49.722 --> 03:17:52.783]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:52.783 --> 03:17:58.166]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:58.166 --> 03:18:01.768]  And as I said before, we're having a freedom, peace, and justice
[03:18:03.047 --> 03:18:05.448]  Festival on July 4th.
[03:18:05.448 --> 03:18:09.929]  Here are the Four Corners of Freedom in Kingston, New York.
[03:18:09.929 --> 03:18:16.291]  And starting at 2 o'clock, Judge Andrew Napolitano is going to be a speaker, Lynette Zhang, myself and others.
[03:18:16.291 --> 03:18:20.573]  But I also want to remind you about the 4th of July Super Sale Specials.
[03:18:21.368 --> 03:18:24.409]  That are starting now at Infowars.

[03:19:03.201 --> 03:19:04.481]  They just added this.
[03:19:04.481 --> 03:19:07.621]  Survival Shield X2, 50% off.
[03:19:07.621 --> 03:19:14.743]  My favorite, Super Male Vitality and Super Male Female Vitality.
[03:19:14.743 --> 03:19:16.623]  A-Men and A-Women.

[03:19:21.033 --> 03:19:24.455]  BioTrue Selenium, 50% off.
[03:19:24.455 --> 03:19:26.596]  Ultimate Krill Oil, 40% off.
[03:19:26.596 --> 03:19:31.097]  And all water filtration systems and filters, 10% off.
[03:19:31.097 --> 03:19:40.981]  And we're glad to announce that after months of negotiation, InfoWars has been able to lock in their storable food prices through the end of this year.
[03:19:40.981 --> 03:19:45.263]  And they're also able to run one limited time off, especially
[03:19:46.215 --> 03:19:50.277]  To the customers to ring in the 4th of July.
[03:19:50.277 --> 03:19:52.697]  So take advantage now.
[03:19:52.697 --> 03:19:55.659]  All storable food supplies 10% off.
[03:19:55.659 --> 03:20:01.901]  So celebrate Americana and save big at InfoWars stores today.
[03:20:01.901 --> 03:20:05.642]  Again, 4th of July.
[03:20:05.642 --> 03:20:09.244]  Freedom, peace and justice.
[03:20:09.244 --> 03:20:12.205]  And do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:20:13.590 --> 03:20:17.853]  So I said I'd talk a little bit more about what's going on in the equity markets.
[03:20:17.853 --> 03:20:22.196]  The Dow's down now a bit, but the Nasdaq is going up.
[03:20:22.196 --> 03:20:23.577]  The markets are totally ricked.
[03:20:23.577 --> 03:20:32.503]  We got Gregory Manorino, of course, that writes for us, does great pieces, and where it's going, and we've been forecasting it as well.
[03:20:32.503 --> 03:20:36.926]  And you're looking at inflation, you know, it's a joke.
[03:20:36.926 --> 03:20:38.087]  Here, this is from Reuters.
[03:20:38.906 --> 03:20:43.627]  A period of high inflation in the United States may last longer than anticipated, two U.S.
[03:20:43.627 --> 03:20:46.528]  Federal Reserve officials said on Wednesday.
[03:20:46.528 --> 03:20:47.928]  You see, that's a curse word to me.
[03:20:47.928 --> 03:20:49.589]  That's profanity.
[03:20:49.589 --> 03:20:51.409]  Calling these banksters officials.
[03:20:51.409 --> 03:20:53.530]  What, official pieces of crap?
[03:20:53.530 --> 03:20:56.691]  Official liars?
[03:20:56.691 --> 03:20:57.471]  The banksters.
[03:20:57.471 --> 03:20:59.191]  You remember that guy, Jesus Christ?
[03:20:59.191 --> 03:21:03.452]  Yeah, he drives the banksters out of the temple, has the Last Supper and hanging on the cross.
[03:21:03.452 --> 03:21:04.432]  Are those officials?
[03:21:04.432 --> 03:21:05.953]  Yeah.
[03:21:05.953 --> 03:21:06.313]  Anyway.
[03:21:09.024 --> 03:21:17.970]  Promoting one to pull forward his views on when the central banks should start raising interest rates.
[03:21:17.970 --> 03:21:30.679]  Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostic said, with growth surging to an estimated 7% this year and inflation well above the Fed's 2% target, he now expects interest rates will need to rise in late 2022.
[03:21:30.679 --> 03:21:36.483]  Quote, given the upside surprise in recent data
[03:21:37.051 --> 03:21:38.012]  Points.
[03:21:38.012 --> 03:21:43.815]  I pulled forward my projection.
[03:21:43.815 --> 03:21:58.064]  And they go on to say, placing him among seven Fed policy makers at the central bank meeting last week projected the overnight policy rate may need to be lifted from the current near zero level sometime next year.
[03:21:58.064 --> 03:22:05.929]  That marked a decisive shift from the end of 2020 when 12 Fed policy makers, policy makers,
[03:22:07.483 --> 03:22:12.547]  Felt the crisis levels of interest rates would need to remain in place until 2024.
[03:22:12.547 --> 03:22:14.328]  All right.
[03:22:14.328 --> 03:22:18.111]  I'm reading that to show you what full of crap they are.
[03:22:18.111 --> 03:22:20.193]  A decisive shift from the end of 2020.
[03:22:20.193 --> 03:22:27.918]  They knew all along that these interest rates are going up.
[03:22:27.918 --> 03:22:31.441]  They're not going to admit it because they know inflation is going up.
[03:22:33.044 --> 03:22:35.928]  When inflation goes up, interest rates go up.
[03:22:35.928 --> 03:22:43.199]  They're raising them in Brazil, they're raising them in Turkey, they're raising them in Russia, because inflation is going up.
[03:22:43.928 --> 03:22:45.829]  They're rigging the inflation numbers.
[03:22:45.829 --> 03:22:47.690]  They're artificially low.
[03:22:47.690 --> 03:22:54.455]  Housing prices went up over 20% in a year and housing isn't put into the CPI.
[03:22:54.455 --> 03:23:04.741]  This way they don't have to pay us more money for Social Security because that's put into the CPI and they want to keep interest rates low so the bigs could keep getting bigger as you keep seeing it over and over.
[03:23:04.741 --> 03:23:10.625]  Blackstone returns the housing market.
[03:23:10.625 --> 03:23:11.506]  Blackstone Group
[03:23:12.091 --> 03:23:18.095]  Has agreed to buy a company that buys and rents single-family homes in a six billion dollar deal.
[03:23:18.095 --> 03:23:20.537]  One deal after another.
[03:23:20.537 --> 03:23:22.078]  And you know why it rentals?
[03:23:22.078 --> 03:23:24.280]  Because people can't afford to buy them.
[03:23:24.280 --> 03:23:37.670]  The bigs after they crashed the market in 2007, 2008, what they did was they bought up all the people that went in foreclosure, they bought their homes, now they're renting them because people can't afford homes because the average price now is around $350,000.
[03:23:40.923 --> 03:23:51.766]  In 1980, in Rhinebeck, I bought 38 acres of land and a small house for $28,000.
[03:23:51.766 --> 03:23:56.688]  The house needed, you know, it was totally wrecked.
[03:23:56.688 --> 03:23:57.048]  $28,000, 1984.
[03:23:57.048 --> 03:24:03.450]  Oh, Rhinebeck, that's where Chelsea Clinton got married.
[03:24:03.450 --> 03:24:06.171]  That's like the Hamptons of the North.
[03:24:08.044 --> 03:24:11.466]  That's how inflation is robbing and killing us.
[03:24:11.466 --> 03:24:18.811]  But they don't care because they're keeping the interest rates low so the bigs could keep getting bigger and artificially rig up the markets.
[03:24:18.811 --> 03:24:24.035]  Because once upon a time you used to have a thing called savings accounts.
[03:24:24.035 --> 03:24:26.937]  And you put your money in the bank and you got interest on it.
[03:24:26.937 --> 03:24:27.998]  Nothing.
[03:24:27.998 --> 03:24:28.458]  Nothing.
[03:24:28.458 --> 03:24:30.219]  It's only there for the bigs.
[03:24:30.219 --> 03:24:32.461]  The bigs have gotten bigger.
[03:24:32.461 --> 03:24:34.222]  The multinationals have become bigger.
[03:24:35.146 --> 03:24:55.442]  And all we do is have lousy jobs on the plantation of Slavelandia every time, every time I go into a Home Depot, they used to have hardware stores, and a, uh, uh, uh, uh, any of the places, Home Goods, uh, uh, Staples, and used to have stationary stores.
[03:24:55.442 --> 03:25:00.426]  My heart breaks for the people working there because they have no future.
[03:25:00.426 --> 03:25:02.107]  So we're going to look at higher inflation.
[03:25:03.331 --> 03:25:08.913]  When inflation goes up, this economy crashes.
[03:25:08.913 --> 03:25:11.634]  It's been built up on fake money.
[03:25:11.634 --> 03:25:12.175]  Period.
[03:25:12.175 --> 03:25:14.135]  Paragraph.
[03:25:14.135 --> 03:25:15.736]  Unprecedented.
[03:25:15.736 --> 03:25:18.137]  Buying junk funds.
[03:25:19.289 --> 03:25:21.490]  That's how rigged the Bankster game is.
[03:25:21.490 --> 03:25:23.391]  This is not capitalism.
[03:25:23.391 --> 03:25:26.813]  It's fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:25:26.813 --> 03:25:31.255]  Our Treasury Secretary comes from the Bankster gang, Janet Yellen.
[03:25:31.255 --> 03:25:33.336]  Oh, if only a woman was in charge.
[03:25:33.336 --> 03:25:35.157]  I'm tired of hearing that crap.
[03:25:35.157 --> 03:25:37.838]  The woman, men, black, white.
[03:25:37.838 --> 03:25:42.921]  Oh, what color was Colin Powell, the guy that did all that little colon of crap selling us the Iraq War?
[03:25:42.921 --> 03:25:43.761]  Oh, yeah.
[03:25:43.761 --> 03:25:46.323]  Condoleezza Rice, the next Mushroom Cloud, you hear?
[03:25:47.103 --> 03:25:52.527]  Again, good, oh that guy Austin Fitts now, Raytheon, now to our Defense Secretary?
[03:25:52.527 --> 03:25:53.928]  Couple of shades darker than me.
[03:25:53.928 --> 03:25:57.370]  It doesn't make any difference what race, creed, color you are.
[03:25:57.370 --> 03:26:01.773]  Or religion.
[03:26:01.773 --> 03:26:09.558]  You hear I call out Cuomo, Fauci, if his name was Fauci, Berg or Cuomostein, you'd be calling me an anti-Semite.
[03:26:11.832 --> 03:26:13.072]  Has nothing to do with it.
[03:26:13.072 --> 03:26:17.014]  Good and bad comes in all of them and right now we got the bad ruling us.
[03:26:17.014 --> 03:26:19.394]  And ruining us!
[03:26:19.394 --> 03:26:22.155]  And that's why we have to unite!
[03:26:22.155 --> 03:26:27.277]  For freedom, peace and justice because if we don't, we're done!
[03:26:27.277 --> 03:26:31.618]  And that's why you have to support InfoWars.
[03:26:31.618 --> 03:26:33.999]  That's why you need to buy the products.
[03:26:33.999 --> 03:26:36.620]  That's why you have to subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:26:37.239 --> 03:26:40.400]  The more we have, the more we can do.
[03:26:40.400 --> 03:26:44.262]  The last edition, 130 pages.
[03:26:44.262 --> 03:26:47.263]  No ads.
[03:26:47.263 --> 03:26:49.844]  Right on the money with everything we've called.
[03:26:49.844 --> 03:26:55.086]  And, by the way, we called where the cryptos were going, where they're heading, and where the bottom is.
[03:26:55.086 --> 03:26:56.046]  But this is important.
[03:26:58.317 --> 03:27:07.162]  FBI seizes 800 Beverly Hills safety deposit boxes with $86 million attorney claims fed rate unconstitutional.
[03:27:07.162 --> 03:27:08.263]  This just came out, right?
[03:27:08.263 --> 03:27:10.344]  A day or two ago.
[03:27:10.344 --> 03:27:18.649]  I'm mentioning that because people ask me, if I buy gold or silver, should I put it in a safety deposit box?
[03:27:18.649 --> 03:27:24.772]  And I say, if you're really stupid and trust the banksters, put it in a safety deposit box.
[03:27:26.545 --> 03:27:34.788]  That's an oxymoron, and you gotta be a moron to believe there's safety deposit boxes.
[03:27:34.788 --> 03:27:44.211]  Just when you saw what happened with the Feds going in there, you see the video of them emptying them out.
[03:27:44.211 --> 03:27:44.871]  America?
[03:27:44.871 --> 03:27:49.892]  This isn't my America.
[03:27:49.892 --> 03:27:51.313]  I want a true America.
[03:27:52.563 --> 03:27:58.930]  The America of the founding fathers and the America that my ancestors came here for.
[03:27:58.930 --> 03:28:00.732]  Freedom, peace, and justice.
[03:28:00.732 --> 03:28:10.183]  So join us the 4th of July at the Four Corners of Freedom.
[03:28:10.183 --> 03:28:13.087]  And support InfoWars.
[03:28:13.932 --> 03:28:15.854]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[03:28:15.854 --> 03:28:26.921]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[03:28:26.921 --> 03:28:30.884]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break.
[03:28:30.884 --> 03:28:32.265]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[03:28:32.265 --> 03:28:37.389]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[03:28:37.389 --> 03:28:37.809]  And I get it.
[03:28:37.809 --> 03:28:39.570]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[03:28:39.570 --> 03:28:41.712]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt.
[03:28:42.483 --> 03:28:43.083]  We're good to go.
[03:28:58.051 --> 03:28:59.932]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[03:28:59.932 --> 03:29:01.933]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[03:29:01.933 --> 03:29:03.533]  Thank you for spreading the word about InfoWars.
[03:29:03.533 --> 03:29:07.755]  And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:07.755 --> 03:29:11.396]  Because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air.
[03:29:11.396 --> 03:29:12.376]  So thank you for the support.
[03:29:12.376 --> 03:29:17.298]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:17.298 --> 03:29:19.599]  The globalists are having their revolution.
[03:29:19.599 --> 03:29:21.840]  But free humanity has to have its revolution.
[03:29:22.771 --> 03:29:40.018]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[03:29:40.018 --> 03:29:40.778]  Worse than slaves.
[03:29:40.778 --> 03:29:44.820]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[03:29:44.820 --> 03:29:51.643]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[03:29:52.361 --> 03:30:02.385]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[03:30:02.385 --> 03:30:03.586]  It's that choice.
[03:30:03.586 --> 03:30:06.567]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[03:30:06.567 --> 03:30:08.748]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[03:30:08.748 --> 03:30:09.548]  Freedom or slavery.
[03:30:09.548 --> 03:30:11.029]  Good or evil.
[03:30:11.029 --> 03:30:11.969]  It is a spiritual battle.
[03:30:11.969 --> 03:30:18.572]  An end for wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[03:30:18.572 --> 03:30:21.173]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:30:22.275 --> 03:30:22.484]  Yeah.
