[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  and police abuse and all this stuff, but when your 70 year old mom is choking to death on the floor of your kitchen, you call 911.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, I was about to say, it's a cop out because it's individuals.
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.000]  And the person, the cop.
[00:19.000 --> 00:21.000]  Is this Bing Crosby?
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.000]  Getting like a thought criminal or something now, they said white Christmas is racist.
[00:26.000 --> 00:31.000]  I thought it meant snow.
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  You know, like your kids say, oh, I want to see snow.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  My younger daughter hasn't seen it since she was about four years old. She's eight now.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  And she said, could we go to Colorado this year or somewhere? I hear there's snow there.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  And I said, honey, we're going to stay home. There's too much going on in the world right now.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  But maybe in February or something, there's still snow. We'll go there.
[00:52.000 --> 01:03.000]  She didn't know she was racist because she wanted to see all those billions of snowflakes that form that beautiful white snow on the ground has nothing to do with what color it is.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  It's not dreaming of white people, but they they've so brainwashed the left and their minions that they think it's bad.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  You know, that was last year that colleges and places said that don't have Christmas parties and don't even say the word holiday.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  It's gotten worse this year.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  They're now saying, baby, it's cold outside. It's a song about rape. And so you can't have that.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  What it really is is a cult, as I talk about a lot, that wants to totally impose its will on you.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  And the answer to the cult is to openly exercise your rights and put it back in the bully's faces.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  I remember 15 years ago when I first started seeing concealed carry rallies in Austin, Texas, people wearing guns openly.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  I was so conditioned at first, you know, as pro-second of members that I was like, maybe that's too much.
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  Maybe it's dangerous. But no, I figured out these people are geniuses. And I talked to them, you're out openly carrying.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  It's only concealed carry that's normally illegal because it's concealed.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  That goes back to common law where your weapons openly.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  So you have to get a license to do something that would otherwise be illegal.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  And I'm over concealed because it makes the criminals not know where the guns are and it doesn't freak out liberals.
[02:04.000 --> 02:12.000]  But why not really just openly wear the guns to exercise your right and say, look, you keep implying guns are illegal.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  You keep implying no one can have them.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  I mean, I remember until I was about a teenager, even growing up in Dallas, you'd see people driving around their own trucks with a gun rack,
[02:20.000 --> 02:30.000]  with a 30-odd 6 or a 308 or a 223 or a shotgun, you know, Remington shotgun or Winchester Defender in their car.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  And then suddenly you didn't see that anymore by the 90s because the police would pull you over and harass you.
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  That's a right you had in almost every state and county and city, but they were creating the illusion through Hollywood.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  And all these made for TV movies and cop shows that are based in Chicago or other places where they pull you over and go,
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  you got a gun, you're going to prison.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  I got you with a gun possession.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  That's only in a few cities like D.C. New York.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  You name it, they have that in place, but they create the perception of zero tolerance.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  Why a kid in his article at school wrote an article about hunting and talked about hunting double the shotgun.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  He wrote the word shotgun.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  Expel, Jimmy.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  They want to bully us into submission.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  And the answer to that bullying is to say no, no, no.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  And to openly practice Christianity.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  And, you know, I remember growing up here in Hardcore Christians ago, the Tenenbaum is really Germanic and it's a winter solstice ritual.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  And the Deep of Winter and it's a cultic.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  So they wanted Christmas shut down because of that.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Look, God doesn't care if we like pretty trees and lights.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  It's art.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  We're not trying to be satanic to the super, you know, right wing Christians, in my view.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  I mean, I'm not saying you're bad.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  Just come on.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  God judges the heart.
[03:35.000 --> 03:44.000]  But on the other side, you have the crazy leftists and the jihadists who want it banned because they want to dominate culture and run over people with trucks and 18 wheelers and the media covering it up.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  So this is the insanity.
[03:47.000 --> 03:57.000]  The answer is to exercise our First Amendment, to exercise our right to eat non-GMO, to exercise our right to everything, free speech, you name it, or we will lose it.
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  And to realize free speech is under attack, info wars is under attack, the free press is under attack.
[04:04.000 --> 04:16.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage all of you to continue to support us right into next year because I never thought info wars would become the spearhead, the tip of the spear, the whole nine yards.
[04:16.000 --> 04:25.000]  We are, but that's because we are representing basically you and your will and your honor and your courage to be free.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  We're going to go to break and we're looking back at a few days after the election in the middle of November.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  I guess a Tuesday was November 8th of 9th only on 13th or whatever it was.
[04:35.000 --> 04:45.000]  When we had the Sunday broadcast and I kind of laid out what I thought Trump would try to do, how they would try to counter him, the fact that they try to block his election, which they did do.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  And as of taping this for the Sunday broadcast, they haven't overthrown Trump yet, but they're openly calling for him to be killed.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000]  You name it.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  So let's pray for America.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  Let's pray for a free world.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  Let's pray for Christians being persecuted in the Middle East and elsewhere by the jihadis.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  Let's pray for peace and a great awakening this Christmas.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  I'm very, very thankful.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.000]  I'm very, very thankful to you.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  Let's also pray for Trump and pray for America and the unborn.
[05:06.000 --> 05:07.000]  Thanks to the crew and everybody else.
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.000]  I love you.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  We'll be right back with the retransmission.
[05:14.000 --> 05:23.000]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise, not from objects in their Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  So much is from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[05:37.000 --> 05:44.000]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  For that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  Join the Info Wars.
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.000]  Spread the information.
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  Educate yourself and others.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  The truth shall set you free.
[06:07.000 --> 06:26.000]  For Info Wars.com, I'm David Knight.
[06:26.000 --> 06:44.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  Last Sunday, we were sitting here only two days out from the presidential election,
[06:49.000 --> 06:58.000]  killing our fingernails.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  Well, we were proving right.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  He did win, but she successfully stole at least five states.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  The numbers are overwhelmingly clear.
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  I had Bev Harris, the Democrat, the liberal, the top election fraud expert in the country,
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  extremely bipartisan, totally respected.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  And she came out and laid out the fact that they were going to try to steal it from Trump beforehand and they certainly did.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  And she concurred on those key states where Hillary, the evidence that leans towards, stole it.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  Lots of evidence of late night, right as the polls are closing,
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  some precincts getting 100% of the voters voting.
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.000]  That never happens.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  Or sometimes more than 100% voting.
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.000]  Major evidence.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  But despite that, despite that still, Donald Trump becomes the 45th president
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  of the United States.
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  I want to pull back here before I plunge into all the latest news and information.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  And I want people to saber this victory.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  I was the one Tuesday night, Wednesday morning, saying, look, they're going to counter strike.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  Soros will fund a bunch of riots.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  They're going to try to block him in Congress.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  Our fight has just begun.
[08:06.000 --> 08:13.000]  But it is important to basically think about what we have done together because it's big.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  It's very, very big.
[08:18.000 --> 08:26.000]  The entire establishment media has been discredited.
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  All the pollsters have been turned into laughing stocks.
[08:30.000 --> 08:46.000]  The entire political correct cult trying to bully this country into submission to cultural tyranny has been blown into a million, million pieces.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  And the successes go on.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  Globalism itself and the fact that crony capitalists control and manipulate the system worldwide has been exposed.
[08:55.000 --> 09:06.000]  This last year and a half campaign did more work to expose the global tyranny than all of the Liberty Movement's 60-year history to try to restore this republic.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  Because we're coming towards the peak, the crescendo here in the next decade or so, maybe even sooner.
[09:15.000 --> 09:28.000]  Donald Trump is already moving to fulfill his promises, announcing he's going to reverse the climate deal Obama signed seven years ago without congressional approval.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  I have the articles right here. We'll go over them in a moment.
[09:30.000 --> 09:42.000]  We have John Kerry trying to race to get it ratified with other countries globally and completed before Trump takes office in two months.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  Think about them apples.
[09:45.000 --> 10:00.000]  Trump is announcing already that he is going to ignore the EPA's order to shut down their 500 power plants and allow the other clean burning plants that were shut down to get their licenses and fire back up.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  Get ready for more energy competition.
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  Get ready for dropping prices.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  The hidden taxes against the poorest Americans of every race, color and creed.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  Trump reportedly looking for a way to pull U.S. out of climate agreement.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  Looking for a way.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  Congress didn't pass it so the Supreme Court just said that the EPA could do whatever they wanted to.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  Well, guess what? This is over the EPA.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  L. President Taye, he could abolish that cabinet position.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  U.S. to push ahead on climate pact before Trump takes over Kerry.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  Yahoo News, A.P. Reuters.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  Report, Obama administration giving up on the Pacific trade deal.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  Not a trade deal.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  A global government deal to merge the Asian Union, the EU and the American Union that have already all been set up through the Atlantic Treaty Agreement.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  And TPP in deep trouble.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  Chock that up to the patriots, you, the listeners, the heart of the Info War.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  Chock that up to Donald Trump.
[11:07.000 --> 11:14.000]  The reason I wanted to start here with some positive news is we're now seeing the game plan against Trump.
[11:14.000 --> 11:25.000]  When he's still two months out and change the rest of November, December and then what, 18 days into January.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  We're more than two months out.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  We're more than 60 days out.
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  67 days.
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  Thank you, Darius.
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  You popped in my ear.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  67 days out.
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  And they're already saying he failed and didn't deliver.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  That's going to be their tactic.
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.000]  It's also going to be something I discovered yesterday that made me so mad it gave me a headache and that rarely happens because I hate Amy Schumer.
[11:51.000 --> 12:00.000]  Ever since I saw her pig face on TV and her anti-family garbage and know that they force feed her and all the young girls in America and she's not even popular, she's a failure.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  I saw this headline.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  It punched me in the stomach because it was a fake headline.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  The New York Times had put out an article over a year ago that they had to retract.
[12:10.000 --> 12:29.000]  But for this, they doled up a fake news headline from supposedly 20 years ago with yellowed acid damage paper and jaggedly cut edges.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  And it's supposedly Donald Trump saying if I were to run, I'd run as a Republican, they're the dumbest group of voters in the country.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  They believe anything on Fox News, I could lie and they'd still eat it up.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  I bet my numbers would be terrific.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  At the end of a lengthy article she puts out, she admits it's a fake quote.
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  But she knows full well 90 plus percent of people would never read down to the bottom of it to find out she says it's fake.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  This is super fraud.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  Now, why do I mention that? Because there's so many of these that I can't even cover them all.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  You're going to have to decipher it yourself, deal with it yourself because a lot of the time they don't admit it's a fake.
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  I mean, I'm seeing stuff now where they are saying things about me, which is fine.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  They're liars, they've been discredited, they've lost so far, but they're going to the next level.
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  They're not backing down.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  They're only intensifying their lies where they'll write the wildest crap about me that I never even said.
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  They'll usually kind of trim it apart and move it around and change it when they lie.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  Now they're doing stuff that's just whole hog, I never said.
[13:34.000 --> 13:44.000]  So they're hitting next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  So it goes on and on.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  Now, that said, let me give you the big news here.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  Most people, if they had to link the conversation with President-elect, would tell you all about it.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  And the conversation was not off the record.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  I asked the President, Donald Trump Friday, it was off the record.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  He said, no.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  But most of the conversation is going to be off the record.
[14:06.000 --> 14:13.000]  Just because the enemy's out there trying to use this against the movement to restore the Republic.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  But I can assure you Donald Trump's for real, and he knows exactly what he's doing.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  And I'm going to give him my complete backing and confidence until I see the policies he starts to deliver.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  And he's going to try to deliver them or die fighting.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  He's never let me down.
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  He's never let you down.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  And I have to know for a fact that Donald Trump Jr. is not going to let you down.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  He's a big lesson for years.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  And I'm going to just stop right there.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  But Donald Trump's for real, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  And that's why they're so scared of him.
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  I have a clip coming up of Dave Chappelle.
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  It's up on infowars.com saying, let's give Donald Trump a chance.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  And I always liked Dave Chappelle when I've seen him on TV.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  I went and saw his concert.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  And I guess he bought into the hype.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  And it was just the biggest race-baiting thing I ever heard.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  I want to hear some funny comedy, man.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  Not about how white people are black people.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  This is always race comedy.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  It gets a little old.
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.000]  I've never been big on the race jokes.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  It's not that I've been politically correct around my life.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  I just like to think about people as individuals.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  And then if I don't like that individual, I'll tell you why I don't like them.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  It's not because of what color they are.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  But the old Dave Chappelle was back.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  He just made a really great point about we're saying this guy can't govern.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  He can't rule.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  It's just like people used to say black people couldn't rule or couldn't come in the White House.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  And he goes, let's just give Donald Trump a chance.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  And only Dave Chappelle could say that to a Saturday Night Live audience.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  They didn't really even boo.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  Because really, what has Donald Trump done except say he tried to have major reinvestment
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  in black communities and cut taxes.
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.000]  And I mean, the truth is Donald Trump is going to deliver.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  And the media is going to do everything they can to try to stop it.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  Because the media works for foreign multinationals that want to slow this country up.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  They want to bag this nation up.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  They want us poor.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  So they can fire everything up.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  Folks, it's real simple.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  We'll be right back.

[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  The general public doesn't.
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  that didn't do as good a job.
[19:07.000 --> 19:13.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsprime.com.

[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  must mean that we're running up our debt.
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.000]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over 100 times, does not increase our debt.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  It does not somehow promote profligacy. All it does is it says,
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress.
[20:53.000 --> 21:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  By the way, Nico Acosta, our great lead producer here for the radio slash TV transmission,
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  six days a week, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  And of course, we come back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  I came here and I said, look at this, Nico.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  He said, no, I put that on screen for you when you came in today.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  I've forgotten the time Donald Trump, I guess 10 years ago,
[21:24.000 --> 21:30.000]  the 43rd president of the United States now, but back in the future,
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  he body slams the guy and, of course, there's a mock beat up of him.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  So he is a great actor, but he is going to actually deliver lower taxes
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  and turn the carbon taxes off.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  That alone will be a death blow to the globalists.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  If he's moving in that direction right now, but for TV viewers,
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.000]  here it is, Donald Trump slamming down the opposition.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  We ought to get this and love this in the computer, actually play it with audio.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  Trump doing a mock beat up.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.000]  Oh, it's hilarious.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  Just the fact that he'd go out there and do all that.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  He's so ridiculous.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  I love it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  He's got such an amazing sense of humor.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Hey, will you guys get that with audio, please?
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  I want to play this for everybody.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  There's Vince McMahon.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  Oh my gosh, he's going to get his head shaved when Trump beats him.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  Those guys are ridiculous.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  Okay, let's expand on all this.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  I want to play the Dave Chappelle clip in a little while, but first off,
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  we've got to play this clip one more time.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  And then I want to walk through the attacks and what's going to happen.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  They're trying to get previous in right now.
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.000]  Steve Bannon was the general that ran the attack, the best person in the campaign.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  We've talked to people inside the campaign, not just Roger Stone from outside the campaign.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  Bannon really kicked ass, the head of Breitbart.com.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  So we need Bannon to be the chief of staff.
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  He's hardcore, folks.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  I mean, Bannon, since he took over Breitbart, they run my videos.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  They run our articles.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  They love what we do.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  They get it.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  They've gotten more hardcore like us.
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  They've moved more towards drudge and info wars on the libertarian constitutional side than
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  Mainline Republican.
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.000]  And in some cases have surpassed what I've done.
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  So I'm very, very excited to see that.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  Prince Priebus, the head of the Republican Party, backstabbed Trump 100 different ways.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  When Trump finally defeated him so many times, he kind of backed off at the end.
[23:23.000 --> 23:32.000]  But all I can tell you is we absolutely need to try to keep as many established with people
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  out as we can.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  Now, here's the deal.
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.000]  Obviously, Trump knows to really get things done if someone who's been on the inside will
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  come over to our side.
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  Then that's fine.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  As long as the policies then flow towards the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[23:47.000 --> 23:54.000]  But if you get enough old guard neocons, Democrats, Republican establishment in, then the assassination
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  temp level goes way up because they'll be able to come in and take over very, very quickly.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  Mike Pence is trusted by Trump.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  I trust the vice president.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  He's a patriot.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  He's pro-gun, pro-sovereignty.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  He wants to control our borders.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  He's a little too pro-war towards Russia.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  But compared to Hillary Clinton, he is a piece of it.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  Now, all of that said, I should have written notes about what I would talk about with my
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  discussion with the president-elect Friday because some of it would be newsmaking.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  Trump is just so real.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  It was all very, very positive.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  But later in the broadcast, I'm going to sit here and think about it in a break.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  I want to write down a few notes of what he told me, what we talked about, that I can relate to the viewers out there.
[24:43.000 --> 24:53.000]  But number one, he just called me to thank you and to thank, of course, myself and the crew.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  They're fully aware that we had $85 million.
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.000]  We thought it was $85 million the seven days from a few days before the election right through to yesterday.
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.000]  So we're talking $80 plus million conservatively just on videos online.
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  That's not counting.
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  $5 million a day terrestrial radio we've gone from.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  We can never get above 170 affiliates.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  It's a few times 190.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  But it would always, stations change hands.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  They sell.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  They change formats.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  We never got to 200.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  We're at like 250.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  It was like 230 a week ago.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  We're like 250 now.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  We're talking blowtorch stations, AMF and across the country.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  The info was taken over folks.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  It's a big deal.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  Now some people, and I want to address this now because it's so important.
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  I'm going to come back and play all the clips for the next long segment are saying, Alex, you're the establishment now.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  You're the elite now.
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.000]  We've gotten a beachhead in Washington that's tenuous, a big beachhead though getting that beachhead is half the battle.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  In fact, if Trump has the initiative and we backing, I'd say 70% of the battles won.
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  The rest of it's moral for us individually in our own lives to work hard and be good people to do the right thing.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  But we're at least 50% of the way there right now, but hey, that's a long way to fall as well.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  I'm the opposite of establishment.
[26:13.000 --> 26:22.000]  I want to be the guy out in the wilderness that's trying to wake folks up and being able to be the purist and talk about what's right and what's good like Ron Paul does.
[26:22.000 --> 26:32.000]  It's a different thing to have your hands in the guts doing the emergency surgery with how big this government is in bureaucracy, the biggest thing in the world.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  But believe me, Trump is in there.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  He is moving to get it done and he is the outsider.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  He's the consulate outsider.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  They hit him with everything they had and it failed.
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  Every lie, every fake poll and the big win is the establishment is totally discredited.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  It's a huge joke and the only way Trump loses is by being gracious and giving quarter.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  And the folks don't know about fencing or war.
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  They said before a battle, no quarter taken, no quarter given.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  A white flag means you're giving up.
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  If an army's running black flags from the beginning of a fight, it means we're not giving up.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  If there's a skull on a flag, pirates didn't invent this by the way folks.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  It means we're going to kill you.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  We don't just take prisoners, we're going to kill you.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  If the pirates come out of the skull, it means we're going to torture you.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  And armies would fly those flags.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  So the black flag means no surrender.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  They're running a black flag up folks.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  They're not surrendering.
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  So it's not we want to persecute Hillary.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  It's justice.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  He's got to keep his promises.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  They're promising him now.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  They'll back off and have his agenda if he just is nice to them.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  Once he gets in, they're going to start up a bunch of controversies.
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  They're going to sap out his first 100 days or so and then he'll be pretty much the lame duck.
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  They're going to start impeachment proceedings run by the Republican Party itself.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  Get ready.
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  That's already leaked.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  I'm going to get to that later.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  And people finally know to listen to me that I know what I'm talking about.
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.000]  This is the current thinking.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  Sure, reconciliation, let's all be nice.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  No one in the liberal media is saying that except Dave Chappelle.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  And he's a maverick.
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  And he's always bitched about black leaders only taking money from black folks and selling them out.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  He likes what Trump's saying.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  I mean, you're listening to what Trump's saying.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  You know, I think black people should have lower taxes and predominantly black areas and tax incentives
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  because it's not taking money from somebody else.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's your money.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  Let you keep it.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  I'm all for that.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  Give folks a leg up that have been disadvantaged.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  I'm all for cutting poor people's taxes across the board.
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  I don't care what color you are.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  The way you break down his main tax plan, $40,000 or less, zero federal tax.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  Zip, zero, zero, zero.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  Boy, they don't want you to hear that, do they?
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  So, Trump just wanted to say thank you to the listeners.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  He said, what amazing people say all over the country.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  He's just, oh my God, I can't believe the influence you've got.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  Obviously, it's just amazing.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  And we're aware of the numbers.
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  We've looked at it.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  It's just phenomenal.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  I mean, we talked about, yeah, he was like, what is it?
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.000]  75, 80 million a week?
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  We're like, yeah, something like that.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  It was a good discussion.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  We'll be back.
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  Stay with us.
[29:12.000 --> 29:18.000]  In case we're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  we can produce.
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  it's very, very important.
[29:28.000 --> 29:34.000]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  Those telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  It works like an antioxidant.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  It's in powder form.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  I take this.
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.000]  This is the product that I take.

[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  We have the new product at Infowarslife.com, Biotru Selenium.
[32:18.000 --> 32:29.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.000]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[32:46.000 --> 32:52.000]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[32:52.000 --> 32:57.000]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.000]  I'm taking it now every day.
[32:59.000 --> 33:04.000]  This is Soki, Biotru Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring.
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[33:06.000 --> 33:32.000]  Excusably available at M4WarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[33:32.000 --> 33:37.000]  This morning, my wife heard the White House's backyard is in the trampoline.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  The toll-free runs out. She sees it.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  It's a magic moment.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  It's a family dog too.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  It's Donald Trump.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  I'll pick up it down now.
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  From jail, I see it.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  It's the parody side over there.
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  You can't always get what you want.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  That's pretty funny.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  If you're a radio listener, we'll post...
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  Can we get whoever's on this weekend or whoever's on today to post that?
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  Video at infowars.com.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  Video from the UK.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  Hillary can't always get what she wants.
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  That dirty dog Donald Trump steals it from her every time.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  The Russians are pulling out of the global corporate government.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  The UK's pulling out of it.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  All 25 members of the EU are trying to pull out.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  Trump is trying to get us to pull out of the New World Order.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  We have huge carbon taxes and open borders, everything else.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  It's a very, very important time to be alive.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  And we're attempting to restore the real American establishment
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  that is due process, a bill of rights, a constitution,
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  free speech, not political correctness.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  We're not supposed to have an establishment in this country.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  You see, because the establishment globally is the Fortune 500.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  And they're all lockstep to take your guns
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  and shut down your company or your business to consolidate control.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  That's why Donald Trump, myself, and others are opposing them.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  Now, let's continue.
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  Donald Trump comes out and says, oh, TPPs did.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  They admit that.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  One of the biggest global government moves in history
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  makes NASA get pale in comparison.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  Trump reportedly looking for a way to pull U.S. out of climate agreement.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  Fox News, President-elect Donald Trump, is reportedly looking to ways
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  for the U.S. to back out of a landmark climate pact,
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  which would defy an agreement to cut carbon emissions across the globe.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  Defy an agreement.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  They say Fox is right-wing.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  How about nationalistic? No.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  Obama defied Congress and signed on to that outside of law
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  that ordered the EPA to follow it,
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  and they shut down more than half our power plants that were totally clean.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  How do we compete when China has energy three times cheaper than ours
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  and builds coal plants every week?
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  That's why they all move to Mexico, folks.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  They move the coal plants down there and built the factories there.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's crazy. It's crazy.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  But don't worry, Kerry says,
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  U.S. to push ahead on climate pact before Turkey,
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  and others sign on to it.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  U.S. to push ahead on climate pact before Trump takes over.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  They're trying to get a bunch of other countries to sign on like New Zealand
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  and others to get it done.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  So there you go.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  Now, let's look at some of the other news here.
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  Analysts say Trump's stocks rally could persist.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  Yeah, they tried to plunge it the first day,
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  but it still picked back up with the stock market.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  Ground analysts and traders chanting,
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  lock her up, lock her up,
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  because it's the big mega banks and brokerage firms
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  that are shutting down all the rest of Wall Street and rigging it
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  with fractional systems and currency fixing
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  and other price fixing with interest rate fixing.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  It's all come out.
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  The LIBOR scandal is all rigged,
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  and most of our real diverse stock market systems
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  that built the country have been shut down,
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  and you have the super high-frequency trading systems run by Goldman Sachs
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  that are literally consolidating power with a little guy,
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  the little gal can't win anymore,
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  and they want that to change as well.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  And guess what? Trump is on the side of that.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  But before I get to all the other huge news,
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  I want to get to some more of these clips.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  We have Sidney Blumenthal,
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  who says right-wing FBI agents took down Hillary in coup d'etat.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  Is that really true?
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  I'll give you my honest analysis of that in a moment,
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  but first, we've got to play this
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  because there's different compilations.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  I played several this week, earlier this week,
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  but here's a new one I saw on m4wars.com earlier today.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  When people laughed at the idea
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  of Trump actually being elected president,
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  compilation.
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  Now, before I air this, I want to point something out.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  And I even said this myself,
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  and I don't say that to brag,
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  it's so people understand, I know how these people work.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  I've studied history. I've studied this establishment.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  And they really think they're better than you.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  Pride goes before a fault.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  And they really give these echo chambers of yes men.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  And Hillary, in these emails, was telling her own party,
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  don't attack Trump too much.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  Let's let him get in the lead with these other Republicans.
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  He's such a clown. He's going to be easier to be.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  And we'll be able to say he's racist wanting a border wall.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  Let him go.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  Plus, they were all getting ratings.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  I remember at the time saying they think they can beat him.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  They don't get it.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  Being radical is what's popular.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  They're playing by old playbooks.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  We were all bullied into political correctness
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  and scared in doing what we were told.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  Sure enough, they panicked.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  When it was clear he was going to get the nomination.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  So they started saying, oh, you don't get the nomination now.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  That backfired even more.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  And the critical game changer was drudgerport.com.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  And in full war, so secondary extent.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  It's not about the credit, but history needs to know
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  with those headlines, another voterless victory for Ted Cruz.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  Another voterless victory for Hillary.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  Though it didn't stop Hillary from stealing it.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  The number one website in the world with a 50 to 60
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  to 70 million people are more a day.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  Seeing that went, yeah, that's not right.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  They would have the whole mainstream media say it was OK,
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  but just a small voice in the wilderness
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  compared to all the rest of the media together.
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  The truth coming out, they couldn't stand against it.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  And they're all discredited.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  So we should celebrate that.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  But if Trump doesn't press it and doesn't continue to point out
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  that they're the traders we're trying to get rid of,
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  they're the swamp we're trying to drain,
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  they will only bite him in the ass
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  because they understand fundamentally at every level
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  that what he represents is the end of their good old boys club
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  where they don't have to produce anything.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  They just got to stay in control.
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  So here's the victory video.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  People laugh at the idea of Trump actually being elected president.
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  This was their own delusion.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  Here it is.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  Donald Trump just last week, he confirmed to the national review
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  Do it.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  Do it.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  Look at me.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  Do it.
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  I will personally write you a campaign check now
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  on behalf of this country,
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  which does not want you to be president,
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  but which badly wants you to run.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  as a Republican, which is surprising
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  since I just assumed he was running as a joke.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  People think that Donald Trump is a clown.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Donald Trump is a clown.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  Does anybody seriously think that Donald Trump is serious
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  about running for president?
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  Donald Trump.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  You know, he's a clown.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  So manly.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  But he apparently believes that Donald Trump is a clown.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  Which Republican candidate has the best chance
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  of winning the general election?
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  Donald Trump.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  They're all followers.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  No, they're followers.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  We're leaders.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  How does it feel, folks?
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  At real Donald Trump.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  At real Donald Trump.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  At least I will go down as a president.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  Yep, 44.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  He's 45.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  Basically, this is the beginning of the end for Trump.
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  The beginning of the end.
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  The beginning of the end?
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  This is probably starting of the beginning of the end
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  for Donald Trump.
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  to the presidency.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  The strongest person usually isn't the loudest one
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  in the room.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  So right now we have Hillary's best.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  Donald's against your war, punk.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  It's her favorite.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  We have different versions.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  She can look at it.
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  Oh, has Hillary Clinton up?
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  By double digits.
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.000]  Nationally 12 points.
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  50 to 38.
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  Full-way race.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  Clinton leading in Florida.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  Clinton leading in North Carolina.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  Clinton leading in Ohio.
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  Clinton leading in Nevada.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  I could go on and on and on.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  He'll go on and on online, dude.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  And so, right now, Mr. Trump, to answer your call
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  for political honesty, I just want to say,
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  you're not going to be president, all right?
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  This is a much-renewed song.
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  Trump, you like your song.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  It's been great.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  You overshadowed it.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  You overshadowed it.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  What?
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  You broke the mic and drove it.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  Come on, come on, buddy.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  You broke the trance.
[42:18.000 --> 42:25.000]  Come on, come on, come on.
[42:25.000 --> 42:45.000]  Come on, come on, come on.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  The state of Montana winning winning winning winning
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  Iowa, Utah, Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  with six electoral votes, Nebraska with its five electoral votes
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  and Wyoming with its three electoral votes

[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  you
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.440]  Before I go there, I want to play the State of Chappelle Club and get some other news
[47:52.560 --> 47:54.560]  But just pulling back from this
[47:54.920 --> 48:01.720]  If I've got a call from President Barack Obama, it would mean nothing to me. I would just say please stop selling our country out
[48:01.720 --> 48:06.960]  It's not fair to have higher taxes on us than China has on their industries. Why are you doing this?
[48:07.920 --> 48:10.340]  Power means nothing to me. It's not doing good
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.400]  I mean, I've had Obama talk about me. I've had Hillary talk about me and attacked me
[48:15.400 --> 48:19.800]  It means nothing. I've been on Nightline. I've been in movies. I've been on HBO. I
[48:20.680 --> 48:24.200]  Bet at the A-list parties. I don't want to sell out to the system
[48:24.200 --> 48:27.720]  I don't want to go to the inauguration sit around people in tuxedos and hang around with Trump. I
[48:28.440 --> 48:33.960]  Want to change the world. I want to build a better planet. I want to have a better future. That's what I meant to
[48:35.320 --> 48:43.160]  But you do have to pinch yourself like some parallel universe when the South delivered a Yankee into the White House beautiful
[48:43.160 --> 48:47.360]  Whole South went for him New York his own state
[48:48.800 --> 48:54.360]  They never steal that because there's almost no Republicans even on the ballot. So there's not even a Republican Party in most counties basically
[48:55.560 --> 48:59.000]  So it's all Democrats that he lost his own state
[49:00.480 --> 49:03.360]  She stole five other states that's clear, but but he still won
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.720]  it's beautiful all this demonization of the North the South it's all made up crap and
[49:08.720 --> 49:16.480]  It's like some parallel universe that we were in they finally broke it back into the real universe. I
[49:17.640 --> 49:21.440]  Mean Obama double black unemployment. He didn't do anything for those communities
[49:22.120 --> 49:23.920]  except few racism
[49:23.920 --> 49:26.320]  To give people a wound instead of a job
[49:27.760 --> 49:29.760]  And that's what I'm tired of is
[49:30.200 --> 49:37.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, I covered the demographics in 2008. I covered the demographics in 2012. So did you you saw it a record number?
[49:37.880 --> 49:39.880]  of white people
[49:40.200 --> 49:45.480]  More than voted for Ronald Reagan. This is more people, but still a record number voted a
[49:47.280 --> 49:55.840]  Record number of Republicans voted for Barack Obama because they were so sick of George W. Bush in the wars and the spying and the stuttering and the lying and
[49:56.320 --> 49:59.840]  I mean with George W. It was like we had a retarded monkey in the White House
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.560]  And so Americans are like, yeah, sure this guy says he didn't want our guns wants to cut taxes
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.440]  He wants to do all this great stuff. Sure put him in. He's just articulate good-looking guy
[50:10.320 --> 50:14.560]  Incomes Obama screws this up one side and down the other. So I came up with the same I
[50:15.760 --> 50:17.600]  tweeted it
[50:17.600 --> 50:19.600]  Yesterday, but we should tweet it again
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.080]  We voted for Obama because we wanted to prove we weren't racist
[50:26.440 --> 50:29.040]  We voted for Trump to prove we weren't stupid
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.680]  And I didn't vote for Obama, but I was I was I was neutral
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.640]  I was so sick of the Republican establishment John McCain is as bad. Maybe he works totally out of his mind
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.720]  Like more warm longer than Obama. So maybe maybe that was the right choice as bad as it was
[50:43.960 --> 50:48.920]  Obama was the wake-up call, but man, I was all for Romney even though I didn't really like him because I
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.240]  Mean Obama had done so much bad in four years. I mean hurt poor people so damn bad
[50:55.240 --> 51:04.080]  One thing I harped on every day was you shut down 500 plants his first administration another 500 600 second
[51:04.640 --> 51:08.440]  That was almost half our plants everything we got to move into Mexico folks
[51:08.440 --> 51:15.000]  They're building brand new dirty running plants one tent the price of ours and the electricity bit cheaper than dirt
[51:16.440 --> 51:20.040]  So you run a factory three four times cheaper in Mexico just on electricity
[51:20.040 --> 51:25.880]  That's the number one cost in a factory. It's above labor in a manufacturing plant generally
[51:26.320 --> 51:28.320]  Where are you gonna go?
[51:29.760 --> 51:33.920]  America has like bowling balls tied to its legs playing a football game. It's not right
[51:35.800 --> 51:41.040]  Trump gets that and that's why all these special interests are so pissed because they sold us out
[51:43.640 --> 51:49.440]  Now Dave Chappelle tells some historical stories and I'm a pretty big historian and the Abraham Lincoln story is true
[51:49.440 --> 51:51.440]  And I'm not defending Roosevelt
[51:52.760 --> 51:56.320]  But that's a story that's been this privilege he did not call the person inwards
[51:56.320 --> 52:03.160]  But the point is is that yes everything in America was class run not as much as Europe, but still class run
[52:03.160 --> 52:04.600]  We were a little bit better
[52:04.600 --> 52:08.160]  But he makes the point that he goes to the White House. It's all black people there for this party
[52:08.680 --> 52:13.680]  Everybody's saying Trump can't do it. Trump can't do it that the sense of what you get is it's this elitism
[52:13.680 --> 52:19.440]  What a multi-billionaire white guy suddenly isn't qualified and Obama's all arrogant says you can't do it
[52:19.440 --> 52:21.440]  So I say the black man can't be president
[52:23.040 --> 52:27.680]  Obama's a smart guy if he wasn't a globalist, he'd be great. See it's not the color of their skin
[52:27.680 --> 52:32.600]  It's who they stand up for who they serve like Bob Dylan says you got to serve someone
[52:32.600 --> 52:42.200]  Well, I stand up for nationalism that'll teach other countries to stand up for nationalism so the multinationals just don't run over the top of us
[52:45.600 --> 52:49.720]  But it is surreal you know how real Donald Trump is I
[52:52.280 --> 52:55.160]  Could have gotten Donald Trump back on the show since he first came on
[52:55.160 --> 52:56.160]  But I knew they were gonna use it
[52:56.160 --> 52:59.880]  I wasn't a hundred percent sure that my association with him was good overall
[52:59.880 --> 53:04.200]  I knew it was with the grassroots proving he was bonafide. We knew the numbers
[53:05.160 --> 53:09.960]  But I just didn't push even though I could have got him on we talked some on the phone here and there
[53:11.160 --> 53:13.160]  real conversations
[53:14.720 --> 53:17.560]  And then boom I see Trump Tower calling
[53:18.320 --> 53:23.600]  Friday that lengthy conversation. He says your number 61 Alex on my list. Let's talk to the
[53:24.240 --> 53:26.760]  Queen of England and then this person and you know now you
[53:26.760 --> 53:30.560]  Do you? Yeah, well, you're a little busy sir. Maybe we start like as well
[53:30.560 --> 53:35.960]  I understand that but just keep doing what you're doing and those other things were said, but I appreciate you in your audience
[53:35.960 --> 53:40.960]  It's amazing what you're doing and good God. It's incredible the influence you you know talk like that and
[53:44.160 --> 53:48.840]  But the point is just that I wouldn't have cared if it was a Barack Obama or a George Bush
[53:48.840 --> 53:55.800]  Or a Bill Clinton. I wouldn't probably take that call. I mean, I had the governor when he was a president elect try to get me to
[53:57.160 --> 54:01.320]  Say nice things about him. He wanted to have me come over the governor's mansion. They had the
[54:02.200 --> 54:07.160]  State police come over and then later federal Marshall saying look, you must be nice to you. He likes you
[54:08.560 --> 54:12.280]  But I guess that you a Bush collective talk shows like you collected baseball cards didn't happen
[54:12.280 --> 54:19.600]  Well, you know what? I'm a baseball card. I'm in the pocket of Donald Trump as long as he delivers. He delivers half
[54:19.680 --> 54:21.680]  It's earth-changing. I
[54:22.680 --> 54:27.520]  Mean he wants the whole enchilada. He is in an uphill battle. So we better understand that but everything against him
[54:27.520 --> 54:29.720]  We only have a tenuous beachhead right now
[54:30.240 --> 54:33.480]  And he's already delivering on so many fronts and if he thinks
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.960]  Appointing some big banker is the treasury person because they have the connections as long as they do his will and our will
[54:39.960 --> 54:44.600]  It's like World War two if Nazis were defecting over to our side that we just check them out
[54:44.600 --> 54:46.600]  No, we had to have them to win the war
[54:48.080 --> 54:51.680]  Same thing you know with our Revolutionary War, but I
[54:53.040 --> 54:56.200]  Will always be honest in the final equation about what I see sampling
[54:56.200 --> 54:58.600]  It's not about some relationship or being star-struck by Trump
[54:58.640 --> 55:05.720]  But it's good to finally be enchanted again a little bit and to find something exciting because nothing's exciting to me
[55:05.720 --> 55:12.160]  Except my kids having a fun time out on the lake or sunset or barbecuing or hiking or loving God and being a good man
[55:12.600 --> 55:18.560]  Power means nothing to me unless it's doing good for people. So know this I believe Trump's my gut tells me he's for real
[55:18.760 --> 55:20.240]  But also
[55:20.240 --> 55:22.080]  Evidence shows he's already moving in the right direction
[55:22.080 --> 55:28.000]  But it's not gonna be perfect and the main enemy attacks me bitching and complaining and saying he didn't deliver everything on a plate of gold
[55:28.240 --> 55:31.040]  Like Dave Chappelle said let's give him a chance. Here's that piece
[55:31.040 --> 55:36.200]  Before I go, I do want to say one thing and then this is not a joke
[55:36.200 --> 55:40.800]  But I think it's important that I say this because they're marching up the street right now speak a
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.960]  Few weeks ago. I went to the White House for a party. It was the first time I've been there many years
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.760]  And BT it's fostered the party so everyone there was was black
[55:56.760 --> 56:02.760]  And it was beautiful. I walked through the gates, you know from Washington
[56:02.760 --> 56:05.760]  So I saw the bus stop or the corner where the bus stop used to be
[56:05.840 --> 56:11.480]  Where I used to catch the bus to school and dream about nights like tonight. It was a really really beautiful night
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.880]  And at the end of the night everyone went into the West Wing in the White House and it was a huge party
[56:16.880 --> 56:26.920]  And everybody in there was black except for Brad the Cooper for some reason
[56:26.920 --> 56:31.600]  And on the wall were pictures of all the presidents of the past
[56:32.640 --> 56:34.640]  Now I'm not sure if this is true
[56:34.640 --> 56:41.720]  But to my knowledge the first black person that was officially invited to the White House was Frederick Douglass. They stopped him at the gates
[56:41.720 --> 56:47.560]  Abraham Lincoln had to walk out himself and escort Frederick Douglass into the White House
[56:47.640 --> 56:51.760]  And it didn't happen again as far as I know until Roosevelt was present
[56:52.880 --> 56:59.120]  Roosevelt was president he had a black guy over and got so much flat from the media that he literally said I will never have a
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.620]  Nigger in this house again. I
[57:01.620 --> 57:11.220]  Thought about that and I looked at that room and I saw all those black faces and Bradley and I saw
[57:11.940 --> 57:17.540]  And I saw how happy everybody was these people have been historically disenfranchised
[57:17.540 --> 57:23.820]  And it made me feel hopeful and it made me feel proud to be an American and it made me very happy
[57:24.260 --> 57:28.820]  About the prospects of our country. So in that spirit
[57:28.820 --> 57:34.140]  I'm wishing Donald Trump luck and I'm gonna give him a chance and
[57:35.420 --> 57:41.260]  We the historically disenfranchised demand that he give us one, too
[57:41.900 --> 57:45.300]  Thank you very much. Well, don't worry. He's not out to get you like the global star
[57:45.300 --> 57:47.300]  He's not gonna build more abortuaries in your neighborhood
[57:47.500 --> 57:53.100]  So that's a very very exciting little piece there because it shows that folks at a deep down level understand what's happening here

[59:16.180 --> 59:22.700]  Knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[59:22.700 --> 59:30.140]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today

[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:51.060]  Where you've got the George Soros funded people run around burning stuff and screaming racism this racism that
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:01.500]  This is just ongoing crap, but that's not as important as every network channel
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:07.460]  Saying it's a white lash. It's a white lash. It's a white lash. I'm gonna go back and get the demographic numbers this week
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:13.620]  I mean I remember them record numbers of whites record numbers of Republicans vote a huge mandate landslide
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:20.140]  Let me tell you some Barack Obama didn't need to steal his first election. He won in a frickin landslide
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.540]  Because people want to change
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.300]  People just want change. I can tell you as a white person believe me. I
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:37.500]  Don't care if our president had brown skin black skin white skin. I don't care if it's a woman. I
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:42.140]  Just want him to do economic systems that we know work
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:50.140]  And it's so insulting to hear that this is because we didn't like Barack Obama because he was black
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:58.420]  Now I'll tell you seeing them hype folks up in the racial hatred and seeing a bunch of racist black people run around saying
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.820]  Whites are bad. It gets a little old. I mean, it's just like damn. You're ignorant
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.180]  There were systems of economic degradation against basically everybody
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:11.860]  Classism was a system of control and the lowest area that class was being a black slave. I get it. It was wrong
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.860]  But to sit there and project class warfare on
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.820]  Anybody that didn't black
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:25.660]  Like they did something to you is a fundamental insult and I'm tired of it
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:31.420]  And it's not racism. I have I'm sick of your ignorance. It's like let me tell you something
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.500]  You can be black. You can be white. You can be Hispanic. You can be an Asian woman
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:42.540]  I'm going down the highway. I grew with ludicrous on this and you're in the fast lane in my way
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.900]  You see them headlights. You see me like them curtains down
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.980]  Get out of the way
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.580]  You should be smart enough to get the hell out of my way
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:59.540]  Everybody likes success. I don't care what color you are. We came from you're cool. You're smart. You got success you guys
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.020]  Give a damn
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:04.420]  And I'm tired of you insulting who I am
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.300]  Telling me that I got a problem with you because of what damn color you are
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.060]  When all that is is some program more
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:17.580]  Classism that we can't ever seem to get rid of based on just where you're from what you look like instead of what you do
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:22.260]  How voters who heavily supported Obama switched over to
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.620]  Trump Wow, I didn't even see that. I didn't believe the Washington Post told the truth
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.340]  I guess now the new regime is in there not all you know, that's one thing I was thinking about
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:34.340]  Most of me was under terror. You would get fired by the executives. They had such control
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:38.580]  That's in the way he likes it if he didn't you get kicked out. So maybe so many people are finally telling the truth
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.980]  We prepped that I didn't even know the Washington Post told the truth there
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:44.300]  That's just what the numbers showed it was Obama voters that beat Hillary
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:56.060]  But what panics the social engineers you see is that whoa if we get non whites on board for libertarianism and free market
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.060]  They're gonna be so damn wealthy
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:05.180]  Even the laziest whites blacks that matter gonna be better off at this. We're gonna have so much damn prosperity that we're not gonna
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.180]  Need us anymore. They're gonna eat welfare anymore
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:12.380]  It'll be like oh, yeah five percent saw that we're trying to be you know too bad
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:17.700]  They're they're you know, they're mentally ill or whatever. Yeah, take care of the mentally ill people whatever. Oh, oh another big one
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.700]  We're going to break

[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:29.540]  They say he's not gonna deport anybody and they say he's gonna keep Obama here. None of that's true. I
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.060]  Spent all weekend reading what's really happening

[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:29.020]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.020]  We are a long way from being out of the woods my friends
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:41.020]  But let me tell you we are fighting back humanities on the march from Russia to the UK the United States globalism is in decline
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:51.020]  And the elite said in all their major publications. I've really beat this to death, but I'm talking Washington Post financial times of London the Economist New York Times
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.020]  That you've
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:58.020]  Hillary fell she'd be the final domino for the New World Order
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:10.020]  They had headlines Wednesday morning and Thursday morning in the two days of the election world government's in trouble but but but see you acted in a vacuum
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:14.020]  Like nobody else knew that stuff was going on
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:25.020]  You acted in a vacuum where they'd be announcing world government and on C-Span we play the club they go but there is no world government Mr. Jones you're being anti-semitic
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:30.020]  And I'd say I don't think Jews run the world
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:35.020]  That would turn into Jerusalem Post Alex Jones Jews run the world
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:45.020]  I don't want Obamacare it says here it has death panels it'll double prizes in the first three years shut up racist you're deeply racist what
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:08:03.020]  So he didn't make people racist it just pissed everybody off and it got so ridiculous that record numbers of blacks and record numbers of Hispanics in any election ever voted for Republicans since the 1950s
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:11.020]  Because minorities were voting Republican then because they were for civil rights movement and the Democrats flipped over and they ran the media because they've been the establishment and that was it
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:17.020]  The Republicans were not the establishment they were trying to change things they weren't perfect
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:31.020]  But since the caller or since Nico was mentioning earlier when take your calls here in a moment the number is 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:38.020]  You guys brought me the article in here where it showed how voters who heavily supported Obama switched over to Trump
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:53.020]  This is a November 10th article I had seen from a couple days ago I guess on Thursday and they admit that all these people that had actually given Obama the big victory went for Trump because they want an economic future
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:09:04.020]  In all these deindustrialized areas particularly in the north central area and the east isn't that interesting because that's really what happened
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:13.020]  These people don't care what color the president is just man it's hard to get a job and then if you're on welfare it doesn't pay the bills
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:18.020]  And we're supposed to do this big prosperous nation what happened you got sold out
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:23.020]  So I was reading during the break it's just amazing that this is actually a truthful article
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:31.020]  I think my head's spinning out of the Washington Post the revenge of the white working class voter and where millions of Obama supporters flipped for Trump
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:39.020]  So see Town Hall says the revenge of white working voter even a conservative side and then where millions of Obama supporters flipped their vote
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:45.020]  It wasn't white voters it was record numbers of blacks record numbers of Hispanics and record numbers of former Obama voters and whites
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:51.020]  Because they proved they weren't racist they voted for Obama and they got screwed
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:59.020]  So again the biggest strength in this is that Obama was repudiated people came together to elect Trump so what do they do
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:09.020]  You can't be part of this new future you got a block you got to go out and riot you can't know it's racist the KKK just got elected
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:13.020]  That's why the South's just voted for Donald Trump the Yankee
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:23.020]  See all the rules are off all the old garbage is over I'm only 42 might be 43 I didn't grow up in the world of
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:31.020]  Naked racism I mean if I was not even one area it wasn't women or anything it was it was race stuff
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:42.020]  I was so colorblind that I was so dumb when I was young I wondered why a lot of black people keep trying to beat me up
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:53.020]  Well now I think back when they were they were racist I was brought up so colorblind like a like a dodo bird or something that I didn't even know what was hitting me
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:11:00.020]  And that's what's so funny about the whole thing
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.020]  This is crazy
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:13.020]  I mean it really is crazy to see what they've done in reality how they've turned the whole thing upside down I was talking to my dad last night he came over to the house
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:23.020]  About his dad who was elected in different county positions and how he was the first person in the family to go Republican and how the KKK had even the rest of it
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:31.020]  And he was like well it wasn't that bad sure they threatened him and did some stuff and did some things but big deal they were a bunch of wimps
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:42.020]  Everybody hated them he said my dad was just one of the first people to stand up and say we're not going to let him push people around anymore
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:52.020]  And then I got to sit here when both my grandfathers fought Hitler one of my grandfathers was in the civil rights movement just like Chuck Heston
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:59.020]  They called Chuck Heston a racist but he was involved in the 50s man almost getting killed places like Oklahoma and Alabama
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:09.020]  He stood up for our second amendment he stood up for civil rights he stood up across the board he was amazing it's a freaking angel
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:15.020]  Before he died they called him a racist because he was pro-gown what the hell does that mean they got these Fox News sports people
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:25.020]  Oh my the new KKK's the NRA the NRA was founded to train northerners on how to shoot and blacks how to shoot
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:33.020]  They could protect themselves from the KKK I'm so sick of the inversion of reality I'm so sick of
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:43.020]  I remember I caught black guys getting paid to go testify I guess they were like actors because they didn't talk in like urban accents until they got up on stage
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:48.020]  They're like yeah I'm a thug I kill people I'm black but take my guns
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:56.020]  Outside they're like thank you sir for the money there's a guy paying them 300-400 bucks a piece and I was like you're actors
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:13:03.020]  So the news calls me up and they go did you do this because they're black and I went excuse me they were being bribed
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:06.020]  The House Ethics Committee had mentioned we beat a bunch of legislation because of it
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:11.020]  My first big story was in 99 I mean I had a bunch of big stories that was one of the first really big ones on guns
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:17.020]  When Nationwide NRA picked it up and they were like and the paper was like Alex Jones is a racist
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:23.020]  And they had these black actors up there going yo we're dangerous we're gonna get you
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.020]  And then they go outside and say thank you sir for the money I'm only here
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:30.020]  Whoa next level
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:37.020]  And I mean I didn't know that much when I got into all this folks I learned watching it for myself that we're not in Kansas anymore
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:43.020]  And they are gaining people big time big time
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:48.020]  And I get it people are dissing you people treat you bad in your life you learn to bow up and be arrogant and not care
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.020]  I know how that is how I fight to me all day I don't care what they say about me
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:58.020]  But it is a mental wound it is a projection to say that if we have a border it's racist
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:02.020]  There's six plus billion people in the third world that want to come here
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:06.020]  The third world's collapsing we ought to try to stabilize it
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:11.020]  You don't do that by bringing the total unwashed here who have no future with diseases you name it
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.020]  All you do is drive down wages and what a big corporations want a permanent poor class
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.020]  They want that they get that it's in game they win
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.020]  We're gonna come back and go to your phone calls from across the country

[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:37.020]  But let me just add this we've extended this
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:42.020]  We rarely do this three four days because it has been so successful and folks keep asking us to wait

[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:15.020] 원�
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:20.220]  you name it. I want to build it to a whole new like YouTube platform that's separate from all that,
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:25.500]  aka Matt Drudge's advice, have our own systems that are separate from the bigger platforms.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.420]  We'll also put a lot of that information on there, but it's just more and more we're being censored by
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:34.220]  Facebook and YouTube and they've been spanking Facebook in the New York Times, the Washington
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:41.340]  Post. You're the reason Trump won. You didn't censor enough. Well, when Trump supports 30 to 1,
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:47.980]  what are you going to do? I mean, she had crowds of 300 on average. She had crowds of 20,000 on
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:52.940]  average. He's probably one of the biggest victory in history. They stole so hard,
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:22:00.380]  Everest, Democrat, liberal, top expert, stole at least five states. She's still lost. This is epic,
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:04.940]  epic. I want to go to your phone calls just briefly and I'll flesh this out more during the
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:11.340]  weekday show, but the big attack is he's waffling, isn't delivering. When he said I'm going to get
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:17.340]  rid of Obamacare, he meant the forced mandate tax level that you have to have it. They're going
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:23.340]  to produce a government system where you can go into a market and where you can't be refused if you
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:30.060]  are have a preexisting condition and children can stay on until 26. He thinks those are good
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:35.020]  provisions. His advisors do. He said that a year ago when they put it on the damn website, and I'm
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:40.620]  sorry, but man, they play people because they don't pay attention. That's what he said a year ago on
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:46.780]  the website. He never said all Mexicans are criminals and he's going to deport all of them that are
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:54.140]  illegal. He said, if you're a felon and we catch you in a checkpoint or a, you know, a stop or
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:59.020]  whatever, you're going back and people that are illegally were going to create a process for you
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:04.460]  to go out and come back in if you're not a criminal. And if you're skilled, boom, we're going to bring
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:09.500]  here because as long as the factories are here, I don't care if he brings tool workers in. We
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:15.340]  got to compete, folks. Some would call that too liberal of a plan. The reason I like it with Trump
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:23.660]  gets a real plan. He's not lying to you. It's so refreshing. It's like these protests everywhere.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:29.420]  We're on camera. People pick it up from California to Texas. They go, he's a homophobic. You
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:35.500]  could criticize him from a conservative perspective that he's been pro equality for 30 years.
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:44.060]  Hillary, in her speech at the DNC, didn't mention being nice to LGBT and all that
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:50.380]  stuff and then being hit everybody clapping. Again, it's my biggest problem with the Trump
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:55.180]  bashing is and I got some issues with Trump is that it's none of its reality based. It's like
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:59.260]  this Amy Schumer article she put out that has hundreds of thousands of shares and likes millions
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:03.980]  of readers that I caught in our ad feed on him for wars. I'm going to get rid of that ad feed,
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:09.020]  man. It's all this anti-liberty crap, but I got to get money to fund the operation at the same
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:13.180]  time. I'm not going to put this out. That's why I almost have no advertising is crap like this.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:19.420]  I caught this on other sites that are patriot where he says that if he runs the Republican,
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.940]  the dumbest people, all this stuff, it says she admits that Obama has a fake quote,
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:26.780]  knowing no one's going to actually read pages, two pages down to the fine print.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:38.700]  I don't like scumbags. I don't like people scamming everybody. I'm sick of it. And you
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:42.780]  know what I don't like? The public buying into it. All right, let's take a few calls.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:46.620]  The two more seconds coming up. We'll get to a few right now. We got Rusty and Charles and
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:51.580]  Dean and Al killer and Raven and Tony and James and Wade and Mitchell. Who's up first? Let's go
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:57.580]  to James in the great state of Seattle. You're on the air. Go ahead. Wow. Thanks for taking my
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:03.900]  call, brother. God bless you, man. God bless you. What's on your mind? Uh, a warning of a
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:11.500]  prophecy warning that has been very silenced and quieted by many people in the Christian community.
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:16.620]  And this timeline might be wrong, but I have to get it out or blood's on my hands and you need
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:21.660]  to know about it. Be aware of it. Tell us what's on whose prophecy and what? I'm both a man who
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:29.660]  died in 2008-ish and named man named Dewey Bruton. That's on YouTube. That's called Daniel's timeline.
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:40.140]  It ends November 17th and Obama accidentally left the country for six days to do a speech in
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:45.660]  Greece where it all began because we're still following a timeline that says he is the beast
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:50.380]  and people better wake up because I hear where you're going. I appreciate your call. This is
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:54.220]  what people say. He's still got two months in office. Well, they start World War three before
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:59.020]  then and they've been trying to start World War three with, with, with Russia and people say,
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:05.580]  why isn't Trump in World Russia? Russia has two bases. Russia's trying to not collapse.
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:10.300]  Russia's done nothing. I'm not anti-China, but China is buying up Hollywood in our business.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:15.980]  I went and saw a rival last night. So I saw my parents and we were keeping the kids
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:21.980]  and it was just all Chinese propaganda. Nothing is a Chinese, but every movie is how the Chinese
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:27.180]  save us because they're buying up all the Hollywood right now. It's like, no, this is our country.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:32.220]  You can't, we can't go buy China's movie production. They never let you do that. If this is getting
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:38.700]  serious. Thank you, James. Owl killer in New Jersey. You're on the air.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:45.740]  Hey, Alex, am I on? Yes, sir. Hey, I'll have to say thank God for the renegades in the life they
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:52.460]  lead way far ahead of their time. Thank God for the renegades. Absolutely. I have some very,
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:57.100]  very important stuff to put out with about Trump. Well, I had seen, I went to go see
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:02.540]  Roger Stone at the palladium about four weeks ago and I got a book sign that I spoke to him for
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:07.820]  a couple of minutes. It was about the cleanse war on women. Now we have Trump in office.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:12.540]  You could see the system is scared to death of him. We're going to have the Supreme Court.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:16.060]  He's got to put the most conservative, the most constitutional.
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:21.260]  By the way, let me interrupt you just because I want to say, I wanted to say this earlier,
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:28.860]  the litmus test is he better put somebody more conservative than Scalia. I want Patriots and
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:34.380]  I want them now. And that's my litmus test. If he doesn't do that, I am going eight SH, you know what?
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:42.940]  Absolutely. Now, the day he got elected, there was such a breath of fresh air and relief
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.740]  in the military. There's people that got out that are trying to get back in.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:50.620]  Dad, we're fears of what's been going on that are trying to come back in. Now,
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:56.220]  this is where the game plan comes in. We've got to press the local government. Everybody
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:00.380]  has to get involved from the sheriff to your councilman, to your mayors, to your governors.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:03.500]  We're going to squash the new world order like a trust, in fact,
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:07.260]  from the top all the way and from the bottom. We're going to meet right in the middle.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:10.380]  We've got that. That's what we have to do.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.340]  I agree. And they're going to nitpick all day. I'm going to tell you right now. I trust Trump.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:16.620]  I've talked to him. He's probably got to put some people in that know how the system works,
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.580]  because they know how, where all the trap doors are. I mean, it's a bucket of spaghetti,
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.260]  the biggest government in history. But as long as he delivers on policies
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:32.060]  or fights to do it, I'm for him. I mean, the Supreme Court, political correctness repudiated,
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:36.620]  the media destroyed, the pollsters proven to be fraudsters. The victory was him running.
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:40.860]  The victory was him winning. We have had a devastating victory. Let's not let them get
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:45.980]  us all pissy and sour it because he doesn't deliver at all before he's not even in office.
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.500]  Here's the thing. Now, with the whole issue with the Hillary pardon,
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:57.100]  let her get her pardon and let's get the freedom of information act and just bury them and everybody
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:00.860]  that's attached to them for the rest of their lives. No, no, I hear you. Let me, let me give you
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:04.780]  the inside baseball. Well, here's the problem with this level. They're all watching. Should I
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:11.900]  give people the inside baseball? Should I let you know? I think they're smart enough to already know.
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:15.820]  I am very not a group. You developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:21.180]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:26.940]  me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:33.260]  in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:39.100]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees, spreading disease
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:43.820]  around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.180]  about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:52.620]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.140]  at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:00.140]  on it today. It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com. And folks,

[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:26.540]  for us. It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:32.860]  very, very important. What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:38.380]  of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes, but when it runs out
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:43.980]  you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:49.660]  the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:55.260]  nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.

[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:42.540]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:48.460]  Well, I was told this a few hours ago when I was still at home and then I got some calls here
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:55.820]  about 30 minutes ago and it just went live on infowars.com. Trump names previous chief of staff
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:02.620]  banning senior counselor. Now again, previous knows how DC works. He knows who the people are.
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:07.420]  He knows Congress. He stabbed Trump in the back. I don't know 40 times is what I was told by an
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:12.540]  insider and Trump knows that. But I mean these people roll over to whoever their master is.
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:16.860]  That's what they do is follow orders. So if he knows you're calling the janitor that knows
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:23.660]  where all the keys fit and where all the detergent is, I'm trusting Trump because the enemy hates him.
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:27.580]  He's already trying to deliver on tax cuts, controlling the border and so much more. But
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:33.020]  it's up on infowars.com. It's from Fox News. Trump names previous chief of staff banning senior
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:37.580]  counselor. So that just means that banning will be up there helping make the decisions,
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:41.420]  but then previous will carry out the wills. That's a good thing. Trump said that previous
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:47.340]  and banning will work as equal partners. So that's that's good. President-elect Donald Trump's on
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:52.060]  Sunday appointed Republican National Committee Chairman, where it's previous as the White House.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:56.060]  That's that's almost like putting Paul Ryan in. I mean, Paul Ryan's many times worse than
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:01.740]  a total demon. But Trump also announced that campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, the executive
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:05.660]  chairman of Breitbart News, will be his chief strategist and senior counselor.
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.580]  Banning was notably given top billing in the press release announcing
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:14.220]  the appointments. And that's what I was going to say earlier. We have this clip. Kathleen Conway
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:18.220]  said Steve Bannon has been the general in this campaign, but says that previous is being looked
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:22.780]  at. Let's cue that up, play that thing, go back to phone calls because this really says it all
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:30.540]  without knowing him. Trump said a hundred with me and he's staying at a hundred. He gets in in
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:37.100]  67 days. We see delivery 67 days. We see him fighting hard on this. That's great. But these
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:41.340]  Republican weasels will tell him whatever he wants to hear. Well, they're cooking up scandals
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:45.740]  behind the scenes and leaking information. Everybody out of the sun. And I think he just
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:50.780]  put Henry Kissinger in his administration. I think this is a bad move. And I told him it was
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.980]  a bad move Friday, but whatever. Trump can do whatever he wants. I'm sure he's smarter than
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:59.180]  I'm anyways. So whatever. I'm not pissed. I'm very, very happy. We've defeated the globalists
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:03.740]  on so many fronts. The media is discredited. The pollsters discredited. They're in total
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.220]  panic. Trump's getting ready to turn the power plants back on. I mean, just he's not out to get
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:16.540]  us. It's wonderful. But I'll tell you what I really think. I think previous is a grand weasel.
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:21.660]  But maybe he can be Trump's weasel. Maybe he's just, you know, maybe, maybe he's just a good
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.860]  little servant and does whatever he's told. I mean, I've seen a major flip in some media
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:29.500]  figuring out there's a new sheriff in town. We'll see. But here is Conway,
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:34.700]  the former head of the campaign, the spokeswoman talking about this earlier today. Two leading
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:42.220]  candidates are reportedly Republican Party chair and insider Rines Priebus and campaign CEO Steve
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:49.340]  Bannon, who's a fierce anti-establishment critic of Washington. Won't that Kellyanne tell us a lot
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:55.660]  about how Mr. Trump plans to govern whether he chooses an insider? Maybe he still wants to change
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:00.220]  it, but by using an insider or whether he chooses somebody from the outsider who really does view
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:06.460]  Washington as a swamp. Well, it tells you a great deal about President Trump that both of those men
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:13.260]  are thought to have very important roles in his administration, very senior roles. And that,
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:16.780]  regardless of title, that is absolutely what's going to happen. And that is probably the case
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:22.380]  for most of his very small, but loyal and frankly effective senior team inner circle.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:27.260]  But I, you know, the thing about Steve Bannon that people don't understand is that in this
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:31.420]  campaign, he's been the general and he's worked very closely with Rines Priebus and the rest of us
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:35.740]  as part of that small quarantine. We couldn't have done it without Priebus or Bannon. I can say
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:39.580]  that unequivocally as the campaign manager. Sure. And we weren't there for all these that
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:44.620]  happened. And by the way, I never convinced myself of what I want to believe. I go with my gut and
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:51.180]  I don't trust Priebus, but I'll say this, it just clicked. Trump is really smart. He's got the outsider
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:56.220]  that'll give him the vice to be his chief counselor, who then just send the little gremlin down the
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:03.180]  rat hole, little goblin to take him through the different portals and different entrances and
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.460]  exits. And I'll say this knowing Trump, because it all just clicked while I was watching that clip.
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:12.380]  If Priebus doesn't deliver, his ass will be gone in a month or two. In fact, I think once Priebus,
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:17.500]  I'm predicting this now, because he totally rolls over to liberty. But Trump never forgives
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:23.420]  a traitor. I can tell you that. I think Priebus is gone in 90 days after they're in office.
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:35.500]  I'll bet you that by, I bet by May of 2017, Priebus is gone or demoted. You heard it.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:40.380]  Because I know how Trump works. And I know my gut tells me he's on the right target.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:44.780]  And I know the enemy is scared of him. But here's the deal. I don't want to say this. We got 67
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:49.420]  days left. The globalists are scared to death. If Trump doesn't play possum a little bit,
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:53.260]  they'll probably try to kill him or start a war. I don't know. The problem is they're,
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:59.100]  well, they underestimated Trump already. So point is, is that I think I'm betting on Trump.
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:03.500]  I mean, he's already trying to get rid of the Obamacare. Oh, that's another lie again. He's
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:07.100]  already got Obamacare. He's getting rid of the provision that it's a forced mandate.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:11.420]  But that insurance companies have to have preexisting condition if they take your money.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:18.380]  That's only fair. And that 26-year-olds or 26, you can tell your parents insurance. That sounds
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:21.740]  reasonable because that's when you're out of college by then. That's something everybody
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:26.460]  agreed to. But then they spit it. Oh, he backed off. Oh, he's not going to deport every person
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:29.900]  there illegally. He's not going to have a force that goes to every building. We already have a
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:34.140]  force that does that. But notice Paul Ryan comes out and lies to everybody on the news and goes,
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:38.460]  I'll assure you we're not doing this. Congress is doing, I speak for Trump. What?
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:45.180]  What? Undermining him, undermining, undermining, playing games because he wants the big money.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:48.540]  He's still, we haven't kicked the globalist out yet. We haven't drained the swamp.
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:51.020]  We've got to have somebody that knows the depths of the swamp.
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:58.460]  Somebody that's against the swamp. But I, what do you think? Got a rusty and Charles,
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:05.260]  Dean and Raven and so many others. Who should we talk to first? Let's talk to Raven. Raven in North
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:13.580]  Carolina. Yeah, Alex. I couldn't vote for John McCain or Mitt Romney because I knew who they were.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:19.260]  I couldn't vote for Barack Hussein Obama because the writing was all over the law. I mean, you
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:23.340]  don't seem to have a very good memory, but you had exposed him before the first election that he
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:29.340]  ran in you and many of your guests. So we knew who he was, but I'm glad. I think it's a new day.
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:37.180]  It's a better day in America. Trump, I feel good that he's in there because most of all, because
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:43.180]  if he hadn't won, me and many others would have always wondered, what could Trump have done?
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:47.420]  Could he have saved the country? Because we knew what we were going to get with Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:54.300]  And I think that he has to set the tone. He has to demonstrate to the American people and to the
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:59.900]  world that none of our government officials are above the law. Hillary Clinton must go to prison.
[01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:06.860]  We need a full, impartial, complete investigation of Hillary Clinton and her crimes
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:13.900]  with her foundation, all of that stuff, all these other criminals and the Justice Department.
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:16.140]  Raven, you're on fire. I'm going to give you two more minutes before we go to break,
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:20.380]  but just answer my question then. Do you agree with my analysis? Because I never lie to myself.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:26.300]  I still have a really good feeling here. Yeah, I'm hoping, I'll be honest with you,
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:29.340]  I never followed Trump in my whole life. I don't have television. I haven't had
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:32.300]  television in like 10 years. So, I mean, I heard who, you know, that-
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:35.100]  So, what told you to lie to him, just the fact that the enemy was against him?
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.500]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, all of his enemies, all the people that are coming out against him,
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:45.900]  and no one was ever able to convince me that Donald Trump hated America, like all these other-
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:50.380]  He doesn't. They either hate him, they either hate America, or they're willing,
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:54.140]  there are a bunch of weasels and snakes, and they're willing to sell us out, and they actually-
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:58.940]  Or, or they really are racist. I mean, it's not just white racist. There's anti-white racist as well.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:05.660]  Oh, and they're self-hating white racist as well. Well, that seems to me who leads it. I don't get
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:11.820]  this whole, it's crazy. So, so, so what's your gut tell you? Yeah, Alex, come on, man. Let's be,
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:16.860]  let's be genuine here. A lot of these people that we're calling white don't consider themselves
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:22.620]  to be white. They consider themselves to be above white. They're Jewish, and they don't consider
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:26.700]  themselves to be white. And, and, and one other point, uh, try, I know-
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.900]  Let's see, here's the deal. I mean, you got liberal Jews, conservatives, you got people
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:33.100]  fight the New World Order that are Jewish across the board, so how do you just sit there and say,
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:37.100]  oh, you know, Jews? I mean, I, I want to get past all the names and just promote freedom.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:42.300]  They always seem to frame the debate. They always seem to frame the narrative. They take the left
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:45.740]  and the right, and then they control it. You get that simple. Well, I'll tell you this. Here's the
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:49.580]  good news. Here's the good news. This whole thing's getting shattered. People don't want to have World
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:53.340]  War Three. I don't care whether they're German, Jewish, or Chinese, but I listen, I'll agree with
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:58.300]  you on this. Trump's for real. He's got the system scared, and he's got my backing. I want to see
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:03.100]  what he does once he gets in. I'm going to let him navigate the waters he's in. I'm not there with
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:10.780]  anything, but I mean, I really do have a good feeling. We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:18.060]  We have... This is Ashley Beckford for infowars.com. This is your tip of the week, article for
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:25.340]  Merkola.com. Fluoride, the only drug intentionally added to your tap water. Fluoride is an endocrine
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:31.980]  disrupting neurotoxic and bone weakening substance that the FDA defines as a drug when used to prevent
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:37.900]  disease. Because unlike the minerals we need, humans have no known physiological requirement
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:44.060]  for fluoride. Sodium fluoride, long known as an effective roach poison, is added to tablets and
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:50.140]  drops for the purpose of preventing tooth decay. In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:55.660]  supplement. It is a prescription drug and a dangerous one. FDA recently announced that
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:02.700]  marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law because FDA never
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:09.420]  approved these products as either safe or effective. Don't use fluoride. Use the Alexa pure water filter
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:14.940]  to remove contaminants from your water supply. Please listen carefully because I'm about to point

[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:29.180]  resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We are on the march. The empire
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:37.500]  is on the run. Alex Jones and the GZN radio deputy. I'm waiting in my cold cell.
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.420]  Reflecting on my past life.
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:54.700]  Real advanced intellects can look forward and backward in the future.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:48:02.380]  And they know that the time for me is running low.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:12.700]  Let's crank this up. The sands of time for all of us individually are running low.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:22.300]  But for the species that we survive, the sands run on for eternity and we are so close to that
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:31.740]  mark. So close. Running low. I'll be back tomorrow, by the way, we'll take some more phone calls.
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:37.260]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central with a weekday transmission. And to say info wars is hitting on

[01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:04.860]  that mainstream media isn't all powerful. What matters is what you stand for, what you do,
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:13.100]  what you say, what you speak. Briefly, we are having a sale that ends finally. It will end

[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:35.820]  making it all possible, bucking the system, bucking the curb, funding an operational tell the truth
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:42.700]  that is now kicking butt. Now, I mean, look, mainstream media, CNN was down to basically
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:46.780]  15 million viewers a day. There are smaller shows, 100,000 viewers. There are bigger shows,
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:52.860]  a million viewers. We were having 20 million views a day just on different videos a month ago
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:56.780]  and threshold radio, 5 million viewers a day. So the average day was 25, 30 million viewers.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:03.660]  I mean, a week, just six months ago, it was 30 million. It hit 80 something million last week
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:09.420]  just on video views and just 5 million a day on the radio, just one of the biggest media events
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:12.540]  in the world. I mean, we're definitely bigger than Rush Limbaugh, which I don't know why I'm
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:18.940]  bigger than Rush Limbaugh, that's great. The point is, is that we are in total reach in what we're
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:25.020]  doing and we're going to get bigger because I want to win. That's nothing. It's because of you
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:29.340]  supporting us. So thank you for your support, your prayers, sending our videos out or articles out.

[01:50:54.700 --> 01:51:01.100]  calls as fast as we can. Now, Rusty in Arkansas, Rusty, thanks for holding. Alex, I'm so glad you
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:06.300]  picked me right after the introduction there and where you're speaking about the things that we
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:11.580]  have accomplished. I wanted to reflect a little bit. I've been listening to you since 2004 when
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:17.180]  I first ordered Marshall Law 9 11 rise of the police state and it woke up tremendously with
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:23.980]  you and your video since then. I've passed them out from Little Rock to Orlando left them on
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:29.260]  windshields of cars and my wife tracking me down say, get out there, get away from there. But I've
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:33.020]  done, you were the original, you folks spreading our films before the internet even spread stuff
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:38.300]  viral. You did it. That's right. And I'm so, I'm so, but you see how long it took though?
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:42.380]  Like four stands from Navarone. They bombed the dam. It didn't blow up for 30 minutes.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:48.140]  That's right. But you know what? We finally got here. We got a little beach head like you've been
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:54.460]  saying. I just wanted to say that I'm just so thrilled to hear those numbers and that we've,
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:59.100]  and that those of you that are out there listening, you've been a part of this and you've been
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:05.100]  helping them for war. And we've, we've finally got a beachhead and that's something to be proud of.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:09.660]  Well, I'll tell you the paradox. I know now why they've got to put billions a year from Carlos
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:14.780]  Slim, Mexican kingpins in the New York times and everything. Cause listen, you'd think the economy's
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:19.100]  so shot. You'd think with those listeners and viewers, we'd have extra money. We barely had
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:23.500]  more money come in per day than we did before with all the shine audience. What's crazy is
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:29.980]  there's so much media now. Audience doesn't even bring in money. So we're successful audience-wise,
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:33.500]  monetarily we're not, which scares me for the economy. I mean, what does that say?
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:38.940]  Yeah, it says a lot. You know, there's been so many people, you know, I've been laid off twice
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:45.020]  since 2012. Brother, most of my family, college degrees, super successful last 10 years had to
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:50.940]  sell their houses and now I understand. Exactly. So we know the economy isn't like they told us.
[01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:56.380]  Now, and speaking on that, I'd like for everybody to go out to info awards,
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:04.700]  to the store and to media and videos and look at the specials that they've got going on the
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:11.500]  videos there. My silver album or 995, you can buy those and give them as dirty Santa gifts
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:17.020]  and just give them, you know, give them to people in your family that may not agree with you
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:21.420]  and just say, you know, watch it. That's the thing about truth. Mountains of lies,
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:24.220]  I mean, is all by that. Well, God bless you. I appreciate your brother, your checks in the
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:31.980]  mail for the plug. Yeah, we basically, it's surreal because I never, I always wanted to just
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:34.620]  fight the new world order. I thought it'd be a small part of it. I didn't realize we'd be a
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:40.540]  dominant part of it. It is bizarre, but it goes, the praise goes to Christ, to you, to the listeners.
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:44.860]  I mean, all of you, the crew, I mean, I'm just just one small part of this and it's very, very
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:48.780]  humbling. So thank you for the support. All right. Charles in New York here on the year. Charles,
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:53.900]  go ahead. Thank you very much for taking my call. I just wanted to tell you that there's
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:54:02.220]  any fundamentally important contribution that you can make to Donald Trump as he becomes president
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:08.460]  of the United States. I can look back on the last few weeks at the great analysis and distribution
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:15.900]  message distribution to that you and in four Wars and Drudge contributed along with a sound
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:20.620]  just verification and validation of many of the analyses. You had people like Molina,
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:27.900]  Piscinic, Stones, Lenti, Watson. These were great contributors to the analysis and you did the
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:33.020]  distribution and this is fundamental. And for that, I believe it would be historic in the
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:40.140]  modern media. Now, the challenge that is facing Trump is that the half of the population that
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:48.460]  or those that voted for Hillary Clinton weren't really being given the reason why they should
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:53.580]  not vote for her. They were many of these analyses were not getting through to them through the
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:57.980]  mainstream media. I agree. So our challenge is now reach out to them and reprogram them.
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:03.900]  Exactly. You got to convince the other people who are genuinely disappointed because as he
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:08.300]  Trump thinks he actually compromises and be nice to them because Hillary's saying be nice,
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:12.940]  but that's on the level that that's on a false level. Her surrogates are all saying attack,
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:18.220]  attack. That's why he has to point out, hey, you're still ordering this. They bust. We saw
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:24.380]  move on.org funded buses, literally over a hundred of them bust people in from all over the state
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:29.180]  to riot in Austin the last three days. I mean, you've got a counter organized stuff like doesn't
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:34.780]  say it's organized. You're saying be nice, but you're not being nice. Yes, analyze this for a
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:40.940]  second. What do you think 25,000 30,000 people would turn out to see Donald Trump? Why? Because
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:46.220]  they couldn't reach him other than to go to see him directly. They would put their signs on the
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:50.220]  on the loan and they would be destroyed. They would try to reach the media. They would be told
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:54.780]  and get off. They would not be given. So they had to go to him to beat other people like themselves
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:59.420]  and actually suppressing us is what made us stronger. Great points. God bless you. Amazing
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:03.580]  points. Yeah, we've got to figure out because the average person thinking that Trump's a KKK
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:08.380]  member really means well. They have no idea that he got awards from the NAACP for hiring record
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:12.220]  numbers and blacks and Hispanics and others and promoting him. He doesn't care as long as you get
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:16.380]  the job done. And Trump has said this even in some of our like 15 years ago this. I love my
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:19.180]  black and Hispanic employees. As long as they get paid, we'll take care of them. They get so
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:23.180]  enthusiastic. It's going to work harder and harder. A lot of my other employees get promoted, get lazy.
[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:30.460]  See, it's all BS, man. It's like Trump's not perfect, but he's not out to get you. And we have
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:35.500]  to come together and realize that. I got so many callers here. Thank you, Charles. We got Dean
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:41.100]  and Tony and Wade and Michael and Mitchell. I'm almost out of town, but out of town out of time.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.420]  Mitchell and Oregon, you're on the air. We've got 30 seconds. Go ahead, Mitchell.
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:50.780]  Yeah. Based on your talks with Bev Harris, how big of a landslide is it take to override the voting
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:55.260]  fraud algorithms? And secondly, the other two things you need to worry about with Trump is
[01:56:55.260 --> 01:57:00.860]  electoral college voting fraud because there's something called a faithless elector where they
[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:04.620]  don't honor their pledge. That's right. They've already got Democrats, two million signed. He's
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:09.100]  trying to get the electoral college not to honor him, but he's already president-elect or not.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:13.100]  They would have challenged it earlier. I think he's in. But as for Bev Harris, she agreed about
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:18.060]  five states. They tried to steal. They did steal. And so you have that together. He probably won
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:23.740]  by five, six million popular vote and 300 plus electoral votes. So they had to try to dampen
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:28.940]  that. But despite that, he won. Well, the last people to speak as strongly as Trump has has been
[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:34.060]  John F. Kennedy and Reagan. They didn't get Reagan, but he actually backed off after they
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:38.780]  attempted to get him. So I'm really, really worried about a Trump assassination. I think that's the
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:43.820]  prime issue. They know he's playing nice and they know he's got the military on his side while
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:48.300]  they're standing down. But if they think they're going to kill Trump, get away with it. Everything's
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:54.540]  being watched. Look, they're scared because the military and the police are away. This is a true
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:58.540]  battle for the republic. Thank you. Great job, everybody. Thank you so much. Tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:10.860]  Central. That's the kickoff. Spread the word.
