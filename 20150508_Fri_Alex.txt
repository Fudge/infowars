[00:00.000 --> 00:14.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.880 --> 00:35.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well now the new defense secretary
[00:35.240 --> 00:43.200]  Ash Carter has quote flatly denied in a press conference and we're pulling that press conference
[00:43.200 --> 00:49.760]  in right now or at a Pentagon briefing that there is a takeover of Texas and Marshall
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.240]  law plant what we said was is that the feds are openly preparing the military for civil
[00:55.240 --> 01:03.040]  war and gun confiscation and civil unrest that is in hundreds of news articles hundreds
[01:03.040 --> 01:10.400]  of different public manuals we link to them at nauseam so they come out and misrepresent
[01:10.400 --> 01:18.280]  that we're saying an imminent total takeover is happening in July and August into September
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.480]  and that is not the case and they act like in the media that for just some crazy reason
[01:22.480 --> 01:32.160]  Chuck Norris Governor Greg Abbott Alex Jones Senator Ted Cruz are just imagining things
[01:32.160 --> 01:38.360]  are going on have you looked around at what's happening the president is acting as a dictator
[01:38.360 --> 01:45.960]  outside of law not even with executive orders deciding policy and law and Congress isn't
[01:45.960 --> 01:51.160]  even challenging and I'll tell you why Congress isn't challenging Congress tells court that
[01:51.160 --> 01:59.600]  Congress can be investigated for insider trading and what's happening is Congress has previously
[01:59.600 --> 02:09.560]  passed a law claiming that they're allowed to insider trade but that other people aren't
[02:09.560 --> 02:14.720]  allowed so again Congress tells court that Congress can't be investigated for insider
[02:14.720 --> 02:22.480]  trading my news article was printed cut off the T bottom my articles are printed with
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.240]  a little bit of stuff cut off so I read can't I thought I mean can I thought let's not write
[02:26.240 --> 02:31.920]  that they said can't and I had to double take and go back but Congress imagine telling court
[02:31.920 --> 02:41.320]  that Congress can't be investigated for insider trading kind of like the Obama administration
[02:41.320 --> 02:47.440]  says they can't be investigated for IRS gate or Benghazi gate or fast and furious gate
[02:47.440 --> 02:58.640]  or NSA gate the list goes on and on and on so that's all coming up today but just in
[02:58.640 --> 03:07.080]  one stack of news I was going through out of more than 20 just look at the atmosphere
[03:07.080 --> 03:15.560]  we're in Carter denies internet rumors no Texas takeover plant but the words of John
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.800]  Stewart the takeover already happened we're just pointing out the continued acclimation
[03:20.800 --> 03:28.520]  and conditioning and then look at these headlines secret deal could contain a myriad of gun
[03:28.520 --> 03:34.640]  restrictions and ammo bands gun owners of America let's get Larry Pratt on this Sunday
[03:34.640 --> 03:40.400]  or this Monday because the word is from Professor lot and others is the next big wave of gun
[03:40.400 --> 03:47.120]  grabbing is coming look at this headline police sees 10 children from off the grid homeschool
[03:47.120 --> 03:52.880]  family that openly published photos of their farm life and their good-looking happy homeschool
[03:52.880 --> 03:58.600]  family on Facebook and they just said well we don't feel like your kids are getting a
[03:58.600 --> 04:03.040]  good education they're not vaccinated we're taking them that's in the news and there's
[04:03.040 --> 04:09.360]  no law in Kentucky to be inoculated but they just took them my children aren't either there's
[04:09.360 --> 04:15.280]  no law but they might I guess come here's another one appeals court rules cops can track
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.920]  your cell phone without a warrant here's another headline Obama is more hostile towards the
[04:20.920 --> 04:26.840]  press than any president in history here's another headline motel sharing daily guest
[04:26.840 --> 04:31.920]  lists with police and aiding warrant checks on every guest and when you order a pizza
[04:31.920 --> 04:38.560]  from a major chain same thing happens and what I just mentioned Congress tells court
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.200]  that Congress can't be investigated for insider trading I guess if a cop pulls you over and
[04:43.200 --> 04:49.080]  you got a bottle of Jack Daniels and drunk with a stripper passed out next to you just
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.760]  tell them I can't be investigated for drunk driving see how that works I guess it may

[08:51.080 --> 08:57.600]  coming on the new documentary coming out of dogs and men the unprecedented police shooting
[08:57.600 --> 09:05.040]  of even dogs as small as chihuahuas or police shooting a barking dog that's over a fence
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.440]  it's it's just people that want to use their gun too much that are hotheads and then you've
[09:11.440 --> 09:17.440]  got police departments defending it it's it's all part of this accelerated out of control
[09:17.440 --> 09:23.240]  militarization that is coming up today both those guests will be joining us for the first
[09:23.240 --> 09:33.800]  twenty thirty minutes of the second and third hours at the bottom of the third hour or halfway

[09:47.200 --> 09:56.040]  developments they're going to break down dealing with jade helm that no one else has basically
[09:56.040 --> 10:02.720]  talked about or looked at other than establishment trade publications some of them going back
[10:02.720 --> 10:08.400]  five years and we're going to have video clips we're going to have analysis we're going
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.360]  to have graphs breakdowns of all of this if you're a radio listener you can go to info
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.120]  wars dot com forward slash show to find the free video feed or later by this evening I
[10:19.120 --> 10:27.520]  will have full reports on this posted at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.760]  this is just more proof I'll give you a sneak preview of what's coming up a first look with
[10:34.760 --> 10:41.200]  the factor using Facebook and Twitter and systems to geographically map the United States
[10:41.200 --> 10:46.520]  and where the resistance to a globalist takeover is going to be and where resistance to gun
[10:46.520 --> 10:51.960]  confiscations going to be so they can focus their rural affairs commission run by the
[10:51.960 --> 10:57.160]  Pentagon and they can focus their different FEMA groups and their different threat fusion
[10:57.160 --> 11:04.520]  activities against anyone who wants to be self sufficient and who just wants to be left
[11:04.520 --> 11:09.880]  alone this is a full conquering not just of the states and the cities and the towns and
[11:09.880 --> 11:15.600]  the full federalization a conquering of the local police that could be taken back by the
[11:15.600 --> 11:22.040]  people and used to restore law and order by the globalist that have occupied the country
[11:22.040 --> 11:27.040]  and that ties into a host of articles that I have today I want to try to get this family
[11:27.040 --> 11:37.800]  on police sees 10 children from off grid homeschool family and you they've got 26 acres it's on
[11:37.800 --> 11:43.800]  a lake it's a pastoral you can go to their different websites and it just looks like
[11:43.800 --> 11:52.160]  heaven looks like kind of place my dad grew up and just happy hardworking farming family
[11:52.160 --> 11:58.400]  and they have had their children taken and in the CPS reported said they are not inoculated
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.360]  and they don't have teaching certificates to teach the children California and two other
[12:02.360 --> 12:06.400]  states trying to pass laws you have a teaching certificate from accredited college to be
[12:06.400 --> 12:12.240]  a home schooler the problem with that is is a school choice be basic freedom parental
[12:12.240 --> 12:19.240]  rights but when you move on down the line the most overarching issue is home schoolers
[12:19.240 --> 12:24.840]  have the highest test scores the highest rate of scholarships the highest rate of corporate
[12:24.840 --> 12:30.920]  head hunting the highest rate of winning international spelling bees geography bees
[12:30.920 --> 12:37.920]  math quizzes everyone knows that almost every international and national spelling bee champion
[12:37.920 --> 12:51.640]  is a homeschooler my late uncle and his wife my aunt rated homeschool their children and
[12:51.640 --> 12:55.700]  one of runs a music school successfully in New York the other works for a major computer
[12:55.700 --> 13:03.160]  company and is already an executive it's 35 years old the other has been in radio TV
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.680]  and very successful help launch him fall wars finally entice him to come back and work here
[13:07.680 --> 13:13.840]  Buckley Hammond the point is is that homeschooling has become so popular that in Austin about
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.020]  20% of the kids are homeschooled and now it's not even really homeschooling anymore they
[13:18.020 --> 13:21.760]  form their own homeschooling federations they have their own homeschooling academy some
[13:21.760 --> 13:25.800]  of which are bigger than public schools where the kids go two three days a week they have
[13:25.800 --> 13:30.920]  so many events my children have been homeschooled now because they want to get into more sports
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.760]  they're not they go to private school and they're enjoying that but it's it's still
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.360]  almost quasi they let the kids get out for golf or tennis or for field trips or if we
[13:41.360 --> 13:46.840]  want to go on a longer trip so so it's it's it's the private schools the prep academies
[13:46.840 --> 13:53.360]  are making themselves more like homeschooling so it's causing a choice revolution and I
[13:53.360 --> 14:00.160]  can't tell you how many cases of where the CPS's own reports prove they're out of control
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.640]  because it'll just be I see articles all the time out of the most liberal areas to like
[14:05.640 --> 14:12.440]  Washington State or Oregon where it'll be the family had five kids and lived in a trailer
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.600]  and had an air stream bus and were homeschooled and you read both parents you know that they're
[14:17.600 --> 14:24.520]  always PhD's and they're not vaccinated they have a garden or kids look super healthy their
[14:24.520 --> 14:32.520]  eyes are all shiny they don't watch television they got their own wind farm the kids are
[14:32.520 --> 14:39.680]  volunteering in town for the homeless and they come and CPS them and they inoculate
[14:39.680 --> 14:45.840]  them against the parents will outside of law and they take them away and they just put
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.240]  on screen a world that daily article about homeschooler parents interrogated about guns
[14:50.240 --> 15:00.640]  and taxes and vaccines and everything else there is a major persecution going on case
[15:00.640 --> 15:05.000]  worker demands follow public school curriculum or will take your kids that's just another
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.520]  case I mean there is an all out war I had the health department contact me a week ago
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.320]  and said you haven't filled out your vaccine exemption form in three years you need to
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.840]  fill it out I want to look at the state law you have to do that but there is the law says
[15:19.840 --> 15:26.080]  it's voluntary but fill out this form so they can track you and surveil you this is the
[15:26.080 --> 15:33.560]  atmosphere that we're in in this country so we'll be covering that report now I mentioned
[15:33.560 --> 15:40.720]  this earlier but I'm going to get to it in a tail now we got to get Larry Pratt on at
[15:40.720 --> 15:46.400]  1230 today if we can or Sunday or Monday we need him immediately as fast as we can please
[15:46.400 --> 15:54.880]  remember we've got secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions ammo bands that's
[15:54.880 --> 16:02.040]  gun owners of America full article info wars dot com and believe me if we didn't have gunners
[16:02.040 --> 16:05.840]  America to make the NRA hardcore and even Ted Nugent said that on the air and he's on
[16:05.840 --> 16:13.840]  the board of the NRA we'd be down the creek without a you know what I wouldn't implement
[16:13.840 --> 16:22.000]  without a paddle secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions ammo bands now
[16:22.000 --> 16:28.600]  there's 30 plus provisions only ones been leaked by WikiLeaks last year and it says total
[16:28.600 --> 16:34.840]  takeover the web web taxes web regulations internet IDs Chinese style controls it's all
[16:34.840 --> 16:39.920]  being lined up right now Congress can't see it again just just we're worried about a federal
[16:39.920 --> 16:49.320]  takeover sometime it already happened a global takeover and they break down in a four page
[16:49.320 --> 16:59.600]  article everything that are being done here but but they're giving Obama fast track only
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.960]  the congressional leadership bipartisan Mitch McConnell Boehner and the Democrats who now
[17:04.960 --> 17:13.840]  say they love Obama the Republican leadership to fast track the TPP I'm going to read over
[17:13.840 --> 17:21.680]  some of this article but Obama said he would do this outside of domestic law and they are
[17:21.680 --> 17:26.360]  moving forward with it and they've massively increased the size of the BATF and they've
[17:26.360 --> 17:30.720]  been trying to take our guns and now they were strict in ammo and having the veterans
[17:30.720 --> 17:37.000]  have their guns taken outside of law it's on but it's another cold war against the
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.360]  second amendment starting to heat up along incremental conditioning process like our
[17:42.360 --> 17:47.920]  military being conditioned to accept anti-gun anti-patriot missions and training and it's
[17:47.920 --> 17:52.600]  in the video games in the cartoons it's in the movies and then it's in the actual manuals
[17:52.600 --> 17:56.640]  that our military is being prepared to fight their number one enemy themselves returning
[17:56.640 --> 18:01.480]  veterans and his congressman Gohmert said listen the Pentagon trains and take on veterans
[18:01.480 --> 18:09.080]  I'm a veteran myself at the army why is Texas listed hostile well now we know indeed the
[18:09.080 --> 18:13.080]  Pentagon is mapping the United States according to who they think won't go along with the
[18:13.080 --> 18:23.320]  takeover and surprise surprise as Gohmert Pyle would say guess who's listed now yes you
[18:23.320 --> 18:28.320]  can turn the jade helm map I'm going to pull up this graphic later German newspapers been
[18:28.320 --> 18:34.960]  reporting on it and and and turn the states pretty much on their side like the Middle
[18:34.960 --> 18:41.280]  East and Texas is Iran and you go right through the other red zone Utah is Syria and then
[18:41.280 --> 18:47.160]  the West Bank is Southern California and you can see that map and you can say well it's
[18:47.160 --> 18:52.600]  also a logistical attack the Middle East and an overflight plan and that's true too everything
[18:52.600 --> 18:58.560]  the globalists do is multi-use multi-training and no one is blaming the troops themselves
[18:58.560 --> 19:05.600]  it's where the strings go back to as Chuck Norris wrote for world net daily secret deal
[19:05.600 --> 19:11.760]  could contain a myriad of gun restrictions ammo bands and then Larry Pratt in this article
[19:11.760 --> 19:17.640]  goes over the different angles and where they're actually already talking about it so it's
[19:17.640 --> 19:22.360]  on we're going to go over that and then that ties into this huge news the secretary of
[19:22.360 --> 19:26.880]  defense Carter has come out and said we're not planning martial law this summer we're
[19:26.880 --> 19:35.080]  not going to take Texas over which we didn't say this was for we're going to come back
[19:35.080 --> 19:39.480]  and cover that as well but the good news is the sleeping giant is awakening and they can't
[19:39.480 --> 19:45.600]  assassinate the people what's wrong you don't like a small group of psychos hijacking your

[24:32.560 --> 24:37.240]  the courts that congress can't be investigated for insider trading you don't know why they're
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.040]  so corrupt they got a license to steal according to them well you can't pass a law saying you
[24:42.040 --> 24:46.400]  can commit a crime when it's illegal for other people to do it that's just injurious prudence
[24:46.400 --> 24:55.720]  it's well known it's called tyranny we've got record 93 million 194,000 americans not

[25:03.400 --> 25:17.000]  10% up 223 plus thousand i'm going to break down what i think happened in the uk election
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.760]  up on info wars dot com i just mentioned this police sees 10 children from off the grid
[25:21.760 --> 25:27.200]  homeschooling family secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions ammo bands that's
[25:27.200 --> 25:34.160]  coming up the 90,000 square foot 100 million dollar home that is a metaphor for america
[25:34.160 --> 25:40.840]  rush ask why left isn't censoring gay marriage so as not to incite radical islamist that's
[25:40.840 --> 25:46.000]  right you got to censor all free speech that's conservative or libertarian because it might
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.600]  anger the islamist but the gay marriage has to continue notice the islamist haven't been
[25:52.600 --> 26:03.800]  attacking too much of that that's just some of what's coming up
[26:03.800 --> 26:08.520]  but getting back to carter denies internet rumors that's the secretary of defense no
[26:08.520 --> 26:14.720]  texas takeover planned and that way when there isn't a takeover martial law gun confiscation
[26:14.720 --> 26:20.360]  this summer they could say look you were all crazy that's called putting out a false argument
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.800]  that's called constructing a straw man you know if you can't really beat mayweather in
[26:25.800 --> 26:29.880]  the ring as a walter weight you just build a paper mache of him and you beat that up
[26:29.880 --> 26:39.680]  and you say that you beat up mayweather or if you can't beat a top golfer say a tiger
[26:39.680 --> 26:46.640]  woods at golf you just find some neighbors never played golf before telling his names
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.920]  tiger and you go out you know he's a white guy he's not tiger woods doesn't play golf
[26:51.920 --> 27:00.880]  you beat him and you say you beat tiger woods that's what a straw man is
[27:00.880 --> 27:06.120]  carter denies internet rumors no texas takeover planned associated press in newspapers across
[27:06.120 --> 27:13.760]  the country defense secretary ash carter flatly denied last night that frenzied internet speculation
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.560]  that the u.s. military exercise in texas is part of a hostile takeover or other nefarious
[27:17.560 --> 27:23.000]  putting on mission well there is drills all over the country with footage of the military
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.120]  with role players saying their sovereign citizens are patriots and the vets are having their
[27:27.120 --> 27:31.320]  guns taken right now and there is gun confiscation and knocking talks going on around the country
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.240]  asking about people's guns and there is an open border outside of law and there is all
[27:35.240 --> 27:41.560]  this tyranny and obama says he's gonna raise taxes through executive orders so yeah people
[27:41.560 --> 27:48.360]  were concerned about everything and that's good but they hope to make all of our concerns
[27:48.360 --> 27:52.480]  rise and fall on jade helm and make it just about that but believe me they don't like
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.000]  the fact that there's such an awakening to this ask during a news conference about jade
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.280]  helm 15 exercise and whether the pentagon was planning to overtake texas and again if
[28:03.280 --> 28:07.520]  we go to the pentagon website you can go to the office of the secretary and they have
[28:07.520 --> 28:14.040]  the video there carter simply said no as people in a packed room laughed oh see they get invited
[28:14.040 --> 28:19.160]  into the room like white house vets people too if they all play along haha it's funny
[28:19.160 --> 28:24.720]  to say we're a police state and have warrantless wiretapping and tsa wall the borders wide
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.000]  open haha there's nothing wrong the IRS isn't taking people's houses and businesses with
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  no proof of anything there's no asset for which are seizure there's no political persecution
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.920]  of the press well wait there is all of that the exercise is the largest conducted by us
[28:41.920 --> 28:46.360]  army special operations command the military routinely conducts massive air ground sea
[28:46.360 --> 28:53.760]  and training around the world and often with multiple other countries the problem here is
[28:53.760 --> 28:58.240]  is that it's clearly infiltration training and the army manuals say they're training
[28:58.240 --> 29:04.240]  to take on the american people texas governor rick greg abbott has asked state guard to
[29:04.240 --> 29:07.640]  monitor the training exercise last week for the two hundred people packed a meeting in
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.920]  rural bastrop and other cities are canceling it asking whether the government was planning
[29:11.920 --> 29:15.760]  to confiscate guns or martial law well they've been training to do it for a while and they
[29:15.760 --> 29:21.480]  did it in katrina so yeah we're we're here ready ever vigilant as the founders said
[29:21.480 --> 29:29.880]  they can't stand it they go on to have this first apartment say they're very up front
[29:29.880 --> 29:34.640]  with their training activities oh yeah that's why they would say that black helicopters
[29:34.640 --> 29:39.600]  uh basically don't exist when they're doing these huge drills and tell you you're crazy
[29:39.600 --> 29:44.800]  if you saw them blow up something near you or you know uh military training to take over
[29:44.800 --> 29:49.160]  the local gun shop and i got news they got military doing law enforcement all over the
[29:49.160 --> 29:54.120]  country illegally we've got it on video the empire and we're exposing run we're exposing
[29:54.120 --> 30:03.000]  the elephant rings jones and the gcn radio network listen to how a drone could spoof
[30:03.000 --> 30:08.840]  wi-fi and steal your data by attaching a tiny computer to a drone robot experts were able
[30:08.840 --> 30:14.480]  to show how the device could be used for nefarious purposes while in the sky the drone poses
[30:14.480 --> 30:19.600]  as an open wi-fi network and tricks other devices to connect to it once that connection
[30:19.600 --> 30:24.160]  has been made any information that passes through like credit card information or home
[30:24.160 --> 30:29.920]  addresses can be obtained because drones are inexpensive small and hard to detect when they're
[30:29.920 --> 30:35.200]  high in the sky bad guys can operate illegally and anonymously but there are some simple
[30:35.200 --> 30:40.240]  steps you can take to protect yourself avoiding open wi-fi networks is the first step and if
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.640]  you must connect to a public wi-fi network make sure the web address you visit is correct
[30:44.640 --> 30:51.160]  and not a dummy site only open websites that have https in the address and when accessing
[30:51.160 --> 30:56.960]  a banking website only continue if a lock appears indicating that it's a secure and encrypted

[33:16.240 --> 33:23.280]  jones on the gcn radio network the globalists have us in a stranglehold but we have them in
[33:23.280 --> 33:31.760]  a stranglehold as well like a sperm whale with a big giant squid attached to our face but we're
[33:31.760 --> 33:35.600]  not biting or fighting back with the sperm whale would do we're just sitting there letting it chew
[33:35.600 --> 33:41.040]  on us instead of realizing we got teeth we're bigger we're stronger we got more history we've
[33:41.040 --> 33:58.480]  got bigger hearts more will yeah let's crank up old tetanusia for a minute
[33:58.480 --> 34:11.840]  i'd say it's a stranglehold when most the military i talk to are aware that they're
[34:11.840 --> 34:16.320]  being trained for illegal operations that's why when they get up on the news and say that
[34:16.320 --> 34:20.880]  patriots that are concerned about domestic military operations being directed towards
[34:20.880 --> 34:26.000]  the people of this country when they claim that we hate the military it doesn't fly
[34:26.000 --> 34:33.120]  the duck doesn't quack the dog doesn't hunt the motor don't run
[34:36.400 --> 34:40.720]  i've not covered the uk election yet because i'm going to be honest with you
[34:42.480 --> 34:48.800]  i'm cogitating on it and we're going to get paul watson to pop on sometime either this hour or
[34:48.800 --> 34:56.480]  next to give his expert take living in london we get steve watson on he's got a degree in geo politics
[34:59.360 --> 35:00.880]  and in uk affairs
[35:03.360 --> 35:09.680]  but as best i can tell you as a first approximation and i do follow uk politics 83
[35:09.680 --> 35:16.080]  percent of uk laws get made by the e u and that's not elected that's the bureaucracy
[35:16.080 --> 35:23.440]  camera has been posing like u kip the kind of ron paul patriot party that's the fastest growing
[35:23.440 --> 35:30.640]  but it's still medium size did gain some seats is real fast growing in the e u parliament but
[35:30.640 --> 35:36.560]  still they're only ceremonial but it is an important bully pulpit and so because cameron
[35:37.760 --> 35:41.680]  did behave like a patriot he ended up winning
[35:41.680 --> 35:49.920]  it doesn't mean cameron's good he's a globalist went to belterberg a few years ago when i was
[35:49.920 --> 35:59.600]  there covering it the tories go along with labor for the same agenda but this is a referendum
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.440]  on getting out of the e u and they've been trying to force a vote to keep the uk and the u u they
[36:05.440 --> 36:17.840]  never got a vote 20 years ago on entering it so this whole big coalition of mainly leftists and
[36:17.840 --> 36:23.200]  others thought they'd take over the country and open the borders up even more but they were honest
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.400]  about what they wanted to do so folks have gone with cameron if you believe the election
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.040]  and there is election fraud in the uk probably not as bad as here from what i've seen when i've
[36:35.040 --> 36:44.960]  studied because they do count the votes locally but that's the best breakdown i can give you on
[36:44.960 --> 36:52.400]  that front they're saying why the pollsters got it wrong they were saying a big leftist coalition
[36:52.400 --> 36:59.760]  sweep was going to happen and then the conservatives didn't just squeak by they they won by a nice margin
[36:59.760 --> 37:10.480]  together we'll make great britain greater still cameron hails shock tory outright majority
[37:10.480 --> 37:17.600]  as mellowman clagg and forage all quit s and p wins near clear sweep of seats in scotland
[37:19.920 --> 37:23.920]  and i got a stinking suspicion if we can get forage on has been on many times or get lord
[37:23.920 --> 37:34.000]  montan who founded uk that they'll have a different angle on it uh in fact that's an idea let's try
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.840]  to get lord montan on sunday if he'll do it or one of the other uk people
[37:40.960 --> 37:47.360]  here's the bloomberg headline bloomberg business uk gamblers trump pollsters in calling cameron's
[37:47.360 --> 37:54.080]  reelection yeah the los vegas or or or other major gambling spreads are always more accurate than
[37:54.080 --> 38:00.080]  put than than than pollsters pollsters are pretty accurate in widespread polls that aren't super key
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.960]  but when you get down to elections you know you'll hear this person's going to win that person's
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.920]  going to win because these polling places will really destroy their credibility when it comes
[38:09.920 --> 38:18.320]  down to a major election because they're getting in many cases behind the scenes contracts and things
[38:18.320 --> 38:24.480]  we're going to get paul watson's take on this paul watson was busy today covering geo political
[38:24.480 --> 38:31.360]  activity cited to see him write about the uk he was too busy writing about police sees 10
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.560]  children from off the grid homeschooling family in kentucky we were too busy covering secret
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.840]  deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions ammo bands the head of gunners of america larry
[38:41.840 --> 38:49.280]  pratt will be joining us to give us a breakdown we should tweet that uh obama launching international
[38:49.280 --> 38:56.880]  gun ban initiative through treaty or is obama we know he is but head of gunners america will
[38:56.880 --> 39:05.760]  expose obama's new gun grab push need to tweak that out he's coming up in 51 minutes we have a jam
[39:05.760 --> 39:11.280]  packed transmission the last 30 minutes the broadcast today huge breaking new developments
[39:11.280 --> 39:16.720]  on jade helm that ties a bunch of this together it's really even quite shocking to me i was aware
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.160]  of some of this but rob dew and david night along with our great intrepid listeners who really are
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.320]  investigative reporters uh have have have have really fared it out some key intel there's video
[39:28.320 --> 39:34.720]  breaking it down but we'll have the rest of the story in about two hours at info wars dot com red
[39:34.720 --> 39:45.040]  linked proof pentagon mapping us for insurgents patriot insurgents we should add that word to
[39:45.040 --> 39:52.480]  the headline the us for domestic insurgents subheadline including patriots because they're
[39:52.480 --> 40:01.520]  mapping it according to demographics uh with all of that information but joining us from all beyond
[40:01.520 --> 40:09.360]  from the britannic aisles from the uk under e u control never had a vote uh you're there in the
[40:09.360 --> 40:17.280]  middle of this poll i gave my take but i gave the proviso uh that i know politics are very
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.640]  sophisticated uh and so i'm not gonna act like most talk show hosts and say i know everything
[40:22.640 --> 40:29.280]  when i'm not a master of a subject you're in the middle of it um what's really going on here i mean
[40:29.280 --> 40:36.960]  did did did camera and act like u kip and steal their thunder for this victory yeah that's basically
[40:36.960 --> 40:44.240]  what happened alex um the conservatives won because people were so terrified of ed milliband the open
[40:44.240 --> 40:51.600]  marxist basically who's completely charmless and frightening the potential u kip voters switched
[40:51.600 --> 40:58.240]  their votes to conservatives simply to ensure that labor the socialists the extreme left wingers
[40:58.240 --> 41:05.360]  and ed milliband didn't get in power so that's why basically forage lost if you look at his seat in
[41:05.360 --> 41:11.760]  south bannet he got 32 percent of the vote but the conservative one with 38 percent of the vote
[41:11.760 --> 41:16.800]  so if the media hadn't said that it was such a close race between labor and conservative which
[41:16.800 --> 41:22.480]  they did for months it turned out it wasn't then a lot of those voters would have voted for forage
[41:22.480 --> 41:28.240]  and he would have held his seat but even in saying that it was a very successful election generally
[41:28.240 --> 41:35.520]  for u kip they got nearly four million votes which is more than the liberal democrats and the s&p
[41:35.520 --> 41:42.240]  combined so u kip um for taking the whole of the united kingdom into account is now the third biggest
[41:42.240 --> 41:48.480]  party and that's been started what 30 years ago by nizel forage and lord christopher mongton
[41:48.480 --> 41:54.800]  now one of the biggest in parliament in the eu and basically uh it they behave an act like
[41:54.800 --> 41:59.440]  ron paul or this show that's got to be very exciting paul to really show an awakening happening
[42:00.560 --> 42:06.480]  it's going to be very exciting for 2020 the problem is the system is so unrepresentative
[42:06.480 --> 42:14.480]  it's the first past the post system so even though for example u kip got almost 3.9 million votes
[42:14.480 --> 42:21.760]  they only got one seat in parliament whereas the scottish national party got only 1.4 million votes
[42:21.760 --> 42:29.280]  so less than half but they get 56 seats in the parliament and so it's completely unrepresentative
[42:29.280 --> 42:35.760]  that's how they tricked the scots into staying with the uk was in a way giving them more representation
[42:36.400 --> 42:40.320]  so it's almost like the socialist scots i'm not knocking the scots but they've been totally
[42:40.320 --> 42:45.520]  domesticated have actually kind of conquered england this way by giving by being given too many votes
[42:45.520 --> 42:52.000]  is that accurate yeah and it's also the fact that they game the system so the established parties
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.160]  have a greater chance and newer parties have very little chance whatsoever but as far as you keep
[42:58.160 --> 43:04.240]  a concern they've got 12.6 percent of the vote share which is the third biggest vote share after
[43:04.240 --> 43:10.720]  conservative at labour so they're going to be very influential in 2020 especially if cameron
[43:10.720 --> 43:16.800]  goes completely globalist which he now probably will because he's got a clear majority there's no
[43:16.800 --> 43:24.400]  coalition he will probably become a lot less popular in 2020 he may have to rely on u kip
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.520]  to form a coalition or whoever takes over from cameron so u kip are going to be very influential
[43:29.520 --> 43:37.280]  in 2020 according to these results all right paul well thank you so much for that analysis
[43:37.280 --> 43:42.400]  on other fronts i went to this family's website maybe we can go to info wars.com and click on
[43:42.400 --> 43:47.760]  their website the article show folks more photos police sees 10 children from off the grid homeschool
[43:47.760 --> 43:54.720]  family they're out there running a you know gardening operation parents work part of the time
[43:54.720 --> 44:02.560]  raise the kids look like really healthy kids but it's in the cps own report they're saying
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.840]  they're unvaccinated and that quote they didn't have proof they were getting full schooling
[44:07.840 --> 44:13.200]  there's no law against homeschooling not yet they're trying to pass them in what three different
[44:13.200 --> 44:19.040]  states right now but this is just crazy and i see these articles all the time there's a new one in
[44:19.040 --> 44:25.200]  world end daily today where they show up and say we want to see your vaccine records and we want to
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.280]  make sure that you don't have any guns well you're allowed to have guns and you're allowed to not
[44:29.280 --> 44:36.080]  vaccinate so the government's claiming that it's neglect when it's not neglect plus there's no judge
[44:36.080 --> 44:40.400]  or jury and if you go to their website you can see photos that they were posting that's their
[44:40.400 --> 44:44.720]  website i think they have a facebook there that i looked at this morning i know there's a link on
[44:44.720 --> 44:50.000]  this article uh that that that shows the family with their traditional lifestyle uh and the stuff
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.360]  they do i mean this is the discrimination against the nuclear family the discrimination against people
[44:55.360 --> 45:01.680]  and their dogs uh and their and their goats out there live in the dream this is the way i wish
[45:01.680 --> 45:05.520]  i could live and not have to you know be in the middle of the technocracy but i do it to fight
[45:05.520 --> 45:12.560]  the globalist paul uh tell folks about this article well obviously this is a family with an
[45:12.560 --> 45:18.640]  idyllic lifestyle they're out there in kentucky twenty six acres of land living a perfectly
[45:18.640 --> 45:26.000]  healthy natural free range lifestyle and basically the cops showed up blockaded their property
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.360]  based on an anonymous tip this is the most frightening aspect of this even more so i would
[45:31.360 --> 45:37.680]  say than them being targeted by the authorities it was an anonymous tip from somebody who knew this
[45:37.680 --> 45:43.520]  family who said they were suspicious because they had this traditional free range lifestyle
[45:43.520 --> 45:50.000]  and if you go to the website the father actually speculates and it's not confirmed but he speculates
[45:50.000 --> 45:57.680]  that the reason the authorities were sick on this family was because uh he unfriended somebody on
[45:57.680 --> 46:03.840]  facebook well i was about to say they're saying that the report probably came off of facebook
[46:03.840 --> 46:09.280]  which really it looks idyllic the children look extremely healthy i mean imagine if other kids
[46:09.280 --> 46:17.120]  could grow up on a river in the woods you know by a lake uh in the appellation mountains i mean this
[46:17.120 --> 46:23.440]  looks like heaven uh and i guess because they look like kids out of a fairy tale with flowers
[46:23.440 --> 46:29.440]  in their hair uh and they're out having a great time and they have the rubber band guns and they're
[46:29.440 --> 46:35.840]  playing i mean i imagine the horror they're now in some in some orphanage or in some foster care
[46:35.840 --> 46:40.080]  with you know 15 other and you know they've split them up too these poor little children
[46:40.080 --> 46:46.320]  are being traumatized this is sick yeah according to the latest update from the mother they don't
[46:46.320 --> 46:52.080]  even know where the two oldest boys are so it's really concerning the good news is they've they
[46:52.080 --> 46:58.080]  had a go fund me page is about two hours after we put this article up they already met their
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.760]  $10,000 figure so they've already got most of their legal fees covered but obviously we encourage
[47:03.760 --> 47:07.840]  people to support them yeah i want to send reporters sorry paul go ahead
[47:09.920 --> 47:14.320]  now they'll just the latest update is that they've now got legal representation so that's
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.320]  time to fight this yeah they need to sue everybody involved uh you know i'll see articles where they
[47:20.320 --> 47:25.200]  find where the cps has been to a house five six times and there's a kid that's six years old
[47:25.200 --> 47:32.960]  that should weigh you know 70 pounds and they weigh 22 pounds and they're covered in you know
[47:32.960 --> 47:38.000]  feces and flies and the cps leaves them there till they die i mean i that happened outside
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.840]  austin last year because it's a black baby a black child uh but if they're healthy white kids i mean
[47:43.840 --> 47:51.120]  they can get up to half a mil per child through the adoption mills and dinecore involved in child
[47:51.120 --> 47:58.160]  trafficking worldwide in texas is the biggest private contractor for cps uh and uh it's just
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.280]  it's outside of law it's it's it's totally arbitrary it's totally selective and paul we see the
[48:03.280 --> 48:09.600]  articles every day in fact there's like five articles today about different families no criminal
[48:09.600 --> 48:14.800]  record no nothing i mean the cps doesn't even say things been done wrong just we don't think your
[48:14.800 --> 48:20.320]  kids are getting a proper education they're out of here and then how long have the children been
[48:20.320 --> 48:28.560]  uh kidnapped paul well this happened on wednesday so it's it's 48 hours now at least yeah and they've
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.480]  got them to again break their will and get the kids to make something up they're they're they're
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.920]  guaranteed if it follows fast patterns saying look you know tell this tell us this happened
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.680]  you'll be able to see mommy again then they'll trick the parents if they didn't have representation
[48:41.680 --> 48:49.840]  that was good and say yeah that's go ahead paul yeah and there's there's another case in new jersey
[48:49.840 --> 48:56.080]  which she touched upon where the cps worker just came to the house demanded to be let in the parents
[48:56.080 --> 49:01.360]  not being too aware of their rights called the police and then the police basically sent her in
[49:01.360 --> 49:09.440]  and conducted this warrantless search they're now suing the cps for 60 million dollars in a us district
[49:09.440 --> 49:14.960]  court so that's how people need to react you need to get back in their face and sue the pants off of
[49:14.960 --> 49:19.840]  them well here's what i do and i i've dealt with the cps a couple times with the people you know
[49:19.840 --> 49:26.640]  doing the false reports just to mess with us and i'm very calm and i explain you know there's
[49:26.640 --> 49:31.440]  due process in this country and i know you want to follow due process and i know you don't want to
[49:31.440 --> 49:37.280]  get any litigation with someone that knows how to litigate it has the means to do it so you need
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.520]  to tell me who made the report and i need to see all the facts and as soon and i'm going to get my
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.000]  lawyer and then you can come back and meet once we've identified and they go we don't have to
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.160]  reveal who does reports i go oh but under the constitution article such and such here let me
[49:50.160 --> 49:56.080]  show you that's the case and boy they don't come back but the average person thinks groveling and
[49:56.080 --> 50:02.000]  not knowing your rights gets you ahead and i'm sorry it doesn't the cps has the highest turnover
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.440]  about 55 nationwide and it's because a lot of people get into it get a degree for the right
[50:07.440 --> 50:12.480]  reason want to help kids so i've talked to cps workers and social workers that are good and they
[50:12.480 --> 50:18.000]  say no alex you're right uh we have quotas they put bad people in that want to abuse kids we can't
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.600]  get them out that's why we quit i've talked to a lot of folks that got out of it because uh it was
[50:23.600 --> 50:28.960]  it's it's it's a greater evil than even the abusive families out there and there are abusive
[50:28.960 --> 50:34.000]  families but it needs to be done through due process through the legal system and through the courts
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.480]  not through family courts founded 100 years ago in new york city by margaret sanger and
[50:38.480 --> 50:44.400]  david rockerfeller's father the nazis of course established health departments and cps and took
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.840]  over four million children as well for neglect of course because they love them paul watson great

[54:44.480 --> 54:53.760]  you're breaking a smoking gun you won't believe the things i've done and the killing is just for fun public
[54:53.760 --> 55:02.800]  entity number one a storm car and i'm on the run through the night till the rising sun and the
[55:02.800 --> 55:14.720]  troubles just begin roses on your grave i'll be on my way we'll hit the gun news then it is so big
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.760]  and it's up at info wars dot com that's public enemy number one Dave mustain some of his newer music
[55:20.560 --> 55:27.680]  secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions and ammo bands and then we've
[55:27.680 --> 55:31.360]  got chilling statements from some of the gun grabbers that show that's exactly what's in it but oh
[55:31.360 --> 55:38.080]  i'm sorry we're not allowed to see it the dictator gets to make all those decisions and congress is
[55:38.080 --> 55:46.880]  too busy insider trading to do anything about it congress tells court that congress can't be
[55:46.880 --> 55:52.480]  investigated for insider trading in a little notice brief filed last summer lawyers for
[55:52.480 --> 55:56.480]  house representatives claimed that an sec investigation congressional insider trading
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.600]  should be blocked on principle because lawmakers and their staff are constitutionally protected
[56:01.600 --> 56:06.800]  from such inquiries given the nature of their work and in a way because the executive runs that
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.200]  it's kind of true and they've been leaving the executive alone but what about state and federal
[56:11.200 --> 56:17.520]  grand juries they should be indicting these people but congress passed a law seven years ago claiming
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.160]  that it's legal for them to i mean we're just so far gone that's what's crazy about this
[56:22.160 --> 56:28.560]  people say well then let it go all the way historically once that happens everything
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.360]  falls apart they're going to grab the pension funds they'll destroy the prosperity the crooks
[56:33.360 --> 56:38.160]  we've got running things will destroy the prosperity they'll kill the golden goose
[56:38.960 --> 56:45.200]  to dominate and control look at napoleon look at the soviets look at hitler look at gingis kahn
[56:45.200 --> 56:52.720]  look at a tell of the hunt the mindset of these rapacious elites are takeover and dominate no
[56:52.720 --> 57:00.240]  matter what that's their nature is conquering through pillaging through invasion through fraud

[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.760]  who's on the offense and hey we just got the fluoride taken out of pesticides
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:18.560]  in the fluoride level in the water they've ordered cut by half by 2017 that's because
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:24.960]  almost every scientist at the epa and for that matter the fda had a bunch joined them and said
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.280]  this is deadly poison take it out it's taken them a decade but it's happening i mean we're
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:35.600]  gaining ground they're admitting life of states causing cancer we're gaining ground it's not
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.080]  about left or right it's not about this issue is a leftist issue this is a right-wing issue it's
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:50.240]  about doing the research covering the facts period now before we go any further i i just
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.520]  want to give you a preview of some of the other news we're going to be breaking down
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.720]  appeals court rules cops can track yourself on that a warrant so another appeals court said that
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:10.640]  it's illegal what the nsa is doing but then another one comes out and says basically they can
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.600]  ruling sets precedent for unconstitutional collection of private data they just grab
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.240]  and steal your cell phone data no nothing no judge no jury no probable cause and then put it in
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.840]  databases the Atlanta base leather circuit us court of appeals has ruled police no longer
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:32.720]  need a court issued search warrant to use cell phone location records notice that they did this
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.360]  secretly and put all these stingrays up and things like that and said no those don't belong to police
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.320]  lying to us and then now they get caught doing stuff it's illegal so they try to go to the courts
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:52.320]  they're going to say it's okay and it wasn't like it was a close decision the nine two decision came
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:59.360]  earlier this week in the case of miami robbery suspect cell phone records which used to connect
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.600]  davis a number of armed robberies which he received 162 year prison sentence and look it sounds great
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:13.360]  you got a cell phone you committed to crimes you're an idiot and don't know that it links you
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:23.360]  to all of it well then go get a warrant don't just use it don't just pre-collect it because
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.720]  here's the deal they can plant stuff in the future they can track and control behavior they can tax
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.400]  you with this there's a reason stuff like this has been illegal with low tech and now with high
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:41.280]  tech it makes it hundreds of times worse i mean it is just nightmare what's going on the major
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.360]  corporations are getting all this data together and then they can gain the economy they can shut
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:51.600]  down markets they can it is just so bad in the hands of the new world order can you imagine
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.400]  dictators of this power in the past the court ruled that davis had no expectation of privacy
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.600]  in regard to location records generated by cell towers so now saying you know you can be filmed
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:09.040]  in public well now just your cell phone has this trojan horse tech that watches you listens to you
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.680]  tracks everything you do tracks where you go of course forever oh we're not watching you
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.080]  we're not tracking you we're not following you none of that's going on that's crazy alex shown stuff
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:30.400]  oh really here's the documents and then now they just go of course we are meanwhile obama is waging
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:36.320]  all-out war on the press like no other president ever has this is part of the atmosphere of tyranny
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.240]  we're in that they say don't worry about obama is more hostile towards the president any other
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.360]  president history will be breaking that down motels or gathering all the guest data running it through
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.120]  uh police systems which basically cops get in trouble if they do that to you without
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:57.280]  problem cause and then they get a percentage of the bounty on people if it pops up so folks
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:04.320]  you know about that as well stay with us is isis targeting states with strict gun control laws
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:10.240]  isis reportedly released a list of five states it's ready to attack three of which have some of
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.120]  the strictest gun control laws in the nation now the states which were named in a message signed

[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.960]  now four out of those five states listed have passing grades from groups that support more
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:32.560]  gun control and disarming the populace meanwhile in a place like texas where everyone is pretty
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.760]  much armed to the teeth isis showed up and two of those guys got taken out pretty quickly this
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.560]  is why everyone needs to be able to have a gun and according to a state ranking from guns and ammo
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.760]  which was the best state for gun owners at number one and the strictest gun control state at number
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:54.720]  50 california maryland and illinois are ranked 46 44 and 41 respectively now the other two states

[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:39.760]  communication are controlled by only a few people doesn't raise ethical questions about the use of
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:43.520]  government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:50.160]  disclosure that they were produced by the government what difference at this point doesn't make
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:56.560]  when a confident observer looks for signs of despotism in the community looks beyond fine words

[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:44.480]  you're mandatory they're not taking rural families children in kentucky because they're not vaccinated
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:51.200]  there's no law so they're trying to pass laws because their hoax is the law is following through
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.800]  you say well how do they do that they just claim it's abuse they label abuse however they want
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.160]  oh you're not you know teaching your kid uh a particular religion you're not teaching them

[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:42.640]  the fight's on texas has forced fax stuff they're trying to pass it's on and if we don't fight it
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:50.880]  they'll win just like the tpp they're trying to give obama fast track on it well under the un
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.160]  treaties we know there's gun control in there we got to shoot that down as well
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:02.800]  so joining us from 127th main legislature david shawiki representative thank you so much for
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.280]  coming on with us sir alex i really appreciate you giving me this opportunity we appreciate
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.440]  you well you've got the floor you know i'll run over folks tell folks about the bad bills the good
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:18.960]  bills uh where this fight's going and what we can do uh well i was uh inspired to uh put my
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:25.280]  bill in because i read in the newspaper uh a few days before uh the the time period to submit
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.920]  bills was closing it's just a couple days and there was an article in the paper loose and sun
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:35.520]  journal about ld 606 which was an act to remove the philosophical exemption from the immunization
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.680]  requirements for school students and employees of nursery schools and health care facilities
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:48.000]  so that's a bill in the works here and there was a another bill as well that would uh remove
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.120]  actually make it more difficult to uh uh ask for a philosophical exemption and and then i started
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.560]  seeing the very same types of bills being introduced in other states and so i just wanted to try to
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.360]  cut this off the past i think it's a very simple concept to understand that uh at the end of the
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:12.000]  day you know we are sovereign these this is our body and we must always assert the right
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.600]  to uh uh allow or not allow what we want to come into our body including a vaccine
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.840]  well think about the precedent it sets they're acting like we're crazy because we don't want
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.320]  to be forcibly inoculated i don't know of any country in the world that has laws like this
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:35.360]  except maybe north korea i saw last week isis is promising to forcibly vaccinate all these different
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.200]  arab countries they've invaded uh so i guess the us is the only other country to be joining isis
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:46.880]  and it's islamic state for forced inoculation just totally bizarre and now they even call these
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:55.520]  vaccines it's a whole other class of of of things now being brought in and just ignoring all the
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.680]  problems why do you think they're on such an offense to make this the law i really think it
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.680]  comes down to money i really think it comes down to a big farm of money and if you can mandate every
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.480]  man woman child has to receive 20 40 60 you know just keep growing the list every uh few years
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.920]  as a significant significant uh income stream going to those uh pharma companies
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.560]  walking through this for us i mean when you're there in the legislature putting on a presentation
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.840]  or in a committee uh go over the facts for us because and and again give listeners the the
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:36.640]  different bill numbers uh and and the best ways to defeat this legislation great well you know uh
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:44.320]  legislatures love to get feedback so you can go to main.gov and and just find the legislatures out
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:50.880]  there get their email addresses send them messages both sides republican democrats uh the two bills
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:16:02.960]  that are are restricting or limiting or removing rights are ld 471 and ld 606 my bill is ld 950
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:07.760]  and it's my objective in writing this bill was to make it as brief as the second amendment
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.120]  so i'm just quickly read this to you ld 950 notwithstanding any other provision of law
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.640]  a person employer or educational institution may not discriminate against an individual
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:26.800]  because that individual has refused a vaccination that's it and if it passes your legislature we
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:33.440]  could take their offense and turn it into an offense for us uh and and and get a mirror bill
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:41.440]  that's that's so clean passed all across the country so ld 950 at main.gov folks need to get
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.920]  that bill send it to your legislature as well uh california was set to pass it out a committee
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.360]  and the fight's still on but when a thousand people showed up they shut it down and and kick the
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:58.000]  can down the road a few weeks hoping pressure went away so the truth is when we put pressure on it
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.320]  has an effect doesn't it oh yeah and there's another thing that people can do if they're in the area
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:08.960]  on uh monday may 11th rfk juniors making an appearance at the state house on this uh topic
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.680]  and there'll be a rally at 12 noon and there are people coming from all over the state i know

[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.280]  us to buy their products and have liability protection it'd be like if ford made you buy a
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:51.920]  truck or chevy or toyota that blew up i mean it's it's it's it's just crazy there's so many people
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.480]  damaged by these there's so much evidence there's so many of these cases being settled
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:02.640]  by the vaccine damage court secretly and as we go from one in 30 000 having autism to one in 56
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:10.880]  and they say by 2025 it's going to be one in 10 uh sir representative uh uh what do you think

[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.560]  really digging into a diabetes and how to manage it and then we started seeing these cross-referenced
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:48.480]  articles mentioning vaccines and sure enough on the uh i believe is i won't say the company but on
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:55.360]  the the m mr vaccine uh insert it says type one diabetes is listed as one of the potential uh side

[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:36.320]  main representative david shawiki has introduced the bill 950 to say you cannot forcibly inoculate
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.720]  the people it's a great simple bill folks should get it and try to get it passed in their legislatures
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.720]  preemptively they've got bills introduced all over the country to make us take hundreds of vaccines
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:54.880]  ladies and gentlemen now if you look at this mmr vaccine the one that is giving people type
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.760]  one diabetes across the country that again they claim is genetic well yeah i mean if you shoot me
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.920]  in the head with a 45 i'll genetically bleed out i'm designed genetically to die from that
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.640]  or about 14 hamburgers they'll have a heart attack i mean you know come on um here it is
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:16.240]  pancreatitis and then once you get the pancreatitis diarrhea vomiting
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:23.840]  endocrine system shutdown then you get diabetes it says diabetes just diabetes
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.760]  how do you pronounce that diabetes mellitus
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.640]  mellitus mellitus diabetes mellitus and then over here it describes how it can kill you
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:44.000]  this is the merkin co oh the news says they're safe and effective it's a conspiracy theory
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.560]  there it is well that's just outrageous representative shawiki i had no idea that
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.280]  this should hit your daughter as well and that was the point i was going to
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.480]  is that they're not going to be able to cover this up uh when one and ten kids can't talk
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:04.480]  where do you think they're going i mean when all this ends up coming out i want these executives
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.000]  just like bear executives got caught for a decade shipping out factor eight to hemophiliacs globally
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.880]  they knew had HIV and hepatitis in it they only got prison sentences in france i'd like to see
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:19.760]  these people in prison we need to get on the offense here because i think they're on the
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.520]  offense knowing people are waking up what do you think's happening well we have this supreme court
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:32.960]  ruling that basically gave them uh you know a immunity shield excuse the pun um you're familiar
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:38.880]  with that of course right yes so i mean that was a supreme court decision we would have to uh
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:44.800]  maybe have a class action soup uh for a specific vaccine possibly the mmr vaccine show all these
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:51.120]  connections between that vaccine and the specific uh uh disease that didn't exist prior to the the
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:58.800]  vaccine that's just one idea but the government needs to understand how many people are behind
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.320]  this and how passionate they are and that there's a lot of truth behind the damage being caused by
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.480]  these vaccines there's research there's research being that proves that um i shared you know talking
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:17.520]  about the efficacy of efficacy sorry of vaccines i shared an article with your producer about polio
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:21.600]  because people keep asking me well what about polio if we didn't have the polio immunization
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.880]  program we'd be having you know polio running rampant in our country people dying going into iron
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:34.880]  lungs and this article that i shared is really uh damaging to that to that case i'll just read a
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:40.240]  couple of things here they they did a study of polio cases in several states before and after
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:47.520]  immunization uh for example this is the 1950s after mass inoculation um let's see road island
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:56.080]  reported 22 cases before inoculation of polio versus 122 cases the next year a 454 increase
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:04.160]  in massachusetts pre inoculation for polio they had 273 cases after the inoculation it was 2027
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:13.200]  642 increase dr solf has been quoted in the uh washington post 1976 uh the developer of the
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:21.280]  vaccine for polio testified that the live virus vaccine used almost exclusively between the 1960s
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.920]  to 2000 was the quote principle if not sole cause of all reported polio cases in the us
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:34.480]  since 1961 washington post 1976 and you're reading out of major medical journals we have
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:44.960]  those on screen in a boil down medical paper my grandmother had had one vaccine for the polio
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.200]  then they said benny this is in 1951 my mother was five years old four years old my uncle was 10
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:29:00.240]  she said you need to take the new string she took it and two weeks later she had polio and was
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:05.520]  almost putting an iron lung lost half the muscles she's almost 90 years old today and but i mean it
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.240]  just wrecked her life to a great extent and she was just a beautiful beautiful woman still is but
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:16.800]  i mean it just absolutely really changed our family and they just lie about it and it's so
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:22.160]  frustrating well everybody's got to get behind your piece of legislation to get you the cosponsors
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.600]  to get this through i want to invite you on next week sir for an in-depth report

[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:23.120]  to god it's alex jones last week we had the prestigious professor john lot on of more guns
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:31.200]  less crime and he was warning of a major new offensive being launched by the anti gunners
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:37.280]  the brady campaign the violence policy center of the george soros grips with a bunch of fake
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.880]  science being cooked up to claim that guns are causing waves of of shootings when in truth
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.600]  he was saying the numbers we have from the justice department are about 52 percent
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:55.200]  mass shootings and general shootings down since 1992 he was saying though that's how the justice
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.640]  department cooks them it's more like 60 but we all saw it in the news a month ago where it was
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:07.920]  admitted that the fbi cooked numbers under orders on mass shootings from the justice department
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:14.480]  to brainwash the public as the attorney general publicly said they would do now joining us is
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:21.760]  the man in the middle of it all right there on capitol hill every day tracking what's happening
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:29.360]  the conscience of the nra as the nra board member ted newton has said without goa the nra wouldn't
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.880]  have made their more hardcore turn thank god the last three four years and i'm i'm not bragging it's
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:41.120]  a fact the decade ago i really pushed larry pratt who's a classy gentleman uh to go after the nra
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.480]  and their milk tusk board to get on the offense and that's happened their rhetoric has matched
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:52.240]  the reality of the tyranny we're facing sure i mean saying obama's becoming a dictator sounds
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:36:00.320]  radical but it's true open borders been gauzy fast and furious irsk you have to match the
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:07.920]  reality with the rhetoric a lot of times people end up going under tyranny because they just
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:14.400]  can't believe what's happening to them and that's in basic criminology we know obama promised to
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.600]  sign on to the un treaty we know obama promised to use executive power at other international
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.280]  agreements to go after the second amendment they're banning imports they're going after ammo they're
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:30.400]  not letting the military sell the brass like they used to do uh there's a whole program they've got
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:36.800]  the atf harassment gun shops veterans are being put on no buy list with with no evidence of anything
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:43.920]  there is a major cold war against the second amendment but lot said get ready the new offensive
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:51.040]  is going to launch in the next few months into the campaign the expert larry pratt of gunowners.org
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.560]  joins us to the end of the hour they have a powerful article at gunowners.org the story
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:04.000]  is mirrored at info wars.com and i want to give him the floor as best i can to break all this down
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:10.800]  headline secret deal could contain a myriad of gun control restrictions ammo bands will you install
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:15.600]  gun control be rammed on our throats and then we've got the quotes of people in the system saying
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:21.200]  they'll use this to do it and it's secret congress can't see it they're trying to give the president
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:28.160]  fast track authority wiki leaks stole to their credit uh the death star plans last year but
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:33.120]  because they're leftist though only leaked the internet provision that's worse than sopa and
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:41.760]  syspa so it's on internet taxes regulations internet ids it's on just like your cell phone
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.600]  traction the internet now will no way to get around it it's on so larry pratt uh i think
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.640]  it's clear to say the next imperial offensive against the republic is on you're the general
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:57.920]  up there in the war room please give us the break down on exactly what cocktail of attacks
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:04.000]  are coming and what this secret treaty means oh hi alex thanks so much for having an interest in
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.400]  this i think that's going to be very helpful the um uh members of congress uh some at least
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.960]  some of the more liberal ones might say well yeah you uh you can find out what's in the proposed
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:24.400]  treaty uh yeah right you can go to a locked room in a basement surrendering your cell phone
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:32.560]  before you get there no pictures no dictating notes to anybody nothing with which to write
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:41.360]  and then you may look at the proposed legislation one section at a time and this is from the most
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:51.280]  open administration ever just i mean i guess we have to laugh otherwise we'd be in a in a white
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:58.480]  suit coat uh this is just absolutely outrageous and one of the dangers and there there's got
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:05.200]  to be a myriad of dangers in this approach to legislation but right now the bill is amendable
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:12.480]  it's just a bill and it's going to give authority uh to the president to negotiate a treaty and when
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:20.400]  that treaty comes back the way this thing is being set up it'll take two thirds of the senate
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:27.520]  to overturn whatever might be in there no amendments and so this is the time to make any
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:33.360]  say protection amendments for the second amendment and so far we haven't been able to
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:40.800]  to get this of enough concern for a member of the senate to say okay yeah we gotta put in
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:47.120]  amendment blocking anything to do with ammunition or firearms nothing to do with exports nothing
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:54.560]  to do with imports or whatever else our dear leader might think of to put into this legislation
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:03.120]  which will become a treaty it's really outrageous and they're treating us like mushrooms in a cave
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:09.760]  and i won't get into the weeds on how you feed those mushrooms but it's not pretty well your
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:18.640]  article at gunowners.org breaks down the subsections of what we know the un-styled gun control
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:24.240]  he says he'll do by treaty i want to get an update on the un treaty top secret tpp means
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:30.000]  you won't know what's in the bill again the tpp is secret this would just be a bill basically
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.160]  i guess authorizing it some republicans are being duped i want to talk about that other
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:44.720]  probably do all the campaign donations what's the strategy to beat this if we don't make enough
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:52.240]  noise about this and force them to say oh i didn't see what was coming on this yeah i'll vote against
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:58.160]  this or i'll at least make a motion to amend it's in such a way that the president can't
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:04.000]  diddle with firearms then it's going to go right on through it's going to take the kind of public
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:12.400]  outcry that forced the administration to pull back on banning certain ar-15 ammunition it only
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:19.840]  is a function of heat and as the old senator dirksen was so fond of saying with his gravelly
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:28.480]  cigarette affected voice uh when i feel the heat i uh see the light them they haven't felt the heat
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:35.760]  yet so uh i hope your listeners are reaching for a butane torch and we'll use it accordingly
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:41.280]  larry we know they're coming after our guns they've stated that's the plan everywhere else in the
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:49.440]  world they've taken the guns what is the constellation the attack pattern i mean the un treaty this
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:57.440]  treaty uh the atf coming after the gun the bullets what's the main attack because i was talking to
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:02.560]  you the professor as i mentioned earlier and he said he believes the biggest assault ever is about
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:11.600]  to begin well the president gives every indication that dr lot's concern is not frivolous uh the
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:18.240]  president has said that he would use his cell phone and his pen to act when the congress didn't act
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:26.080]  forget that little problem about the legislation in our constitution originating with the congress
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:32.640]  uh but the president doesn't look at the constitution as something to be obeyed he looks at it as
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:41.440]  something to be overcome and that's what he spent the last six years doing and my concern is that
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:46.800]  now that he has no other elections for which he's ever going to be likely to be on the ballot
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:53.680]  and any of the democrats who are going to be running in 16 can plausibly say well the president's
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.640]  you know not gonna be president anymore i'm you know i'm my own man and so he though they'll have
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:08.000]  that plausible deniability his ability to damage the democrat name will be a lot less and my guess
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:15.680]  is that we haven't seen the full obama yet he's getting ready to do it down and dirty and and
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.880]  that's the pattern i mean we normally see when they can pardon themselves pardon others uh when
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.920]  they can have their party turn on them they can take the fall and get the agenda through and we've
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:31.440]  already seen a massive acceleration of tyranny uh i mean just opening the borders outside of law
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.960]  shutting down power plants outside of law uh persecuting the tea party not getting in trouble
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:45.360]  and it seems to embolden this group of crooks uh now that uh they've gotten away with so much i mean
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:52.160]  in my gut not just intellectually in my gut i'm just bracing uh there's one other suggestion that
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:58.560]  i would make and again it requires in this case backbone in the part of the republican caucus
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:04.640]  and that's asking for a lot apparently uh and because it's not just the leadership the leadership
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:10.480]  is able to do what the leadership has been doing because the caucus has been willing to tolerate
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:18.320]  it has not been willing to effectively push back but the caucus could simply say on just about any
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.720]  spending bill none of these funds may be used to negotiate or implement the pacific treaty
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:32.000]  that that would just put it into a screeching halt because anything that they might do would be
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:38.160]  totally unauthorized and actually they wouldn't have had the funds to do it at all of course they
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.280]  really ought to be impeaching this jasper but clearly they don't have the backbone for that
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:49.200]  but at least cutting the funds off is a an obvious solution the founders gave it
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:56.400]  to us uh in by giving it to the house of representatives they can control that purse
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:02.240]  and if they want to close off the neck of that money bag they can do that just that easily
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.840]  you know i know that manor is in the hip pocket of obama and the guys play golf and party together
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:14.560]  that's been on record for six years but mitch mcconnell what is he doing promoting the tpp and
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:19.840]  now saying nice things about obama when we just have this major political realignment even main
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:25.120]  line analyst said it's one of the biggest in the us history probably the third largest in our 240
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:30.560]  years saying hey we put the tea party in we put conservatives in we put libertarians in we want
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:36.720]  all this socialism and big government to stop and instead it's all accelerating well mcconnell
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:43.040]  has indeed been a republican leader he's been leading republicans into the camp of voting for
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:52.000]  various obama initiatives and this guy uh the fact that he's tolerated by the republican caucus in
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.960]  the senate suggests to me that when we have an opportunity to meet our senators and actually
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:06.720]  our representatives too will you promise to me that you will under no circumstances vote for
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:13.120]  mitch mcconnell as republican leader or uh mr bainer as republican leader in the respective
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:17.600]  houses because if they won't give you that flat out commitment it means they're wrapped around the
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:25.840]  finger of a rhino pro obama leadership and that's leading us into perdition
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.120]  you're up there on capital hill covering these guys watching them
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:38.320]  why are they so spineless can't they see the trajectory of the country is going into total
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:42.800]  tyranny uh they think they're going to be insulated from this they think the democrats are going to
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:50.400]  leave them alone once they get full power can't they smell the aggressive carcinogenic tyranny
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:56.240]  don't they understand that it's like 200 proof and that it's not going to coexist with anybody
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:03.120]  i don't think they do see that they think that they're going to be rewarded for having been
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:10.160]  statesmen for having produced legislation and here's their one of their favorite phrases
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:18.320]  for showing that they can govern meaning they can reach across the aisle well why is it that
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:25.200]  uh harry reid at one time and nancy polosi why is it that none of the democrat leaders are invited
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.840]  nay and why isn't it insisted upon that they reach across the aisle why is it that the only
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:40.400]  reaching gets done from right to left uh that's because the republicans by and large there are
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:46.720]  exceptions happily but by and large the republicans want approval from the media and they know that if
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.240]  they don't play ball with the democrats then they're going to be accused of not governing well
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:58.000]  and they've that's the kool-aid that's most dangerous in this town i think that's more dangerous
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.280]  than an outright bribe it's this idea that you've got to be approved by the media or your toast and
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.840]  what they don't get is the only reason ran paul or ted cruiser popular in the head of the pack
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:16.080]  is because they are seen as anti-establishment going along especially the way things are now
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.920]  only only waters you know down the message and and then you're don't stand out with bright colors
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.240]  as the cliche goes shifting gears don't want to come back and finish up with their attacks

[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.360]  it's an understatement uh jade helm we've got senator cruz coming out saying the government's
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.320]  lost the trust under obama that's why texas are concerned louis gummer was in the military he's
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.560]  just wise texas and utah listed hostile orange county uh we've got uh all these other the governor
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:18.240]  coming out abit we're not saying the military is going to capture texas and take the guns in summer
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:24.080]  we never said that they say that the claim were deranged what we said was this is another drill
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:28.480]  that looks like it's for domestic operations we've got all these videos coming in the military
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:33.760]  training to take on tea party and gun owners the police getting the m reps saying it's for the
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:39.200]  second amendment it's for the veterans uh and it looks like the republicans a lot of them actually
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.560]  get this and aren't backing down from the media ridiculing them chuck norris has come out instead
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:49.600]  he trusts the military but not those pulling the strings i think this is healthy uh chuck norris
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:55.680]  quoted benjamin franklin in his column at wnd.com distrust and caution are the parents of security
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.080]  benjamin franklin what and we're going to skip this network breaks we have more time on larry
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:06.800]  pratt larry what do you make of the overall militarization of police the overall federalization
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:12.800]  the tsa when the feds themselves are are are basically more and more following un scripts
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.800]  i think it's healthy uh that uh i mean we heard al sharpton say use the riots to federalize police
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.480]  i mean this is a federalization happening and i think it's very healthy uh that a lot of the real
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:32.400]  libertarian conservative constitutionalist leaders are not throwing info wars under the bus
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:37.760]  they're saying no it's reasonable to question this if operation jade helm we're being conducted
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:45.200]  under a president paul or president cruiser president walker uh three of the conservative
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:51.120]  frontrunners i guess we could say um we might be watching to see what's happening but we wouldn't
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:57.840]  have the same uh inability to accept what the administration is saying this administration
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:06.880]  has not earned our trust they have lied repeatedly so even if what they're saying happens to be true
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:17.680]  who's to know i mean when have they told the truth right so god bless governor abbott who said okay
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:23.920]  uh we'll take it your word but uh don't mind if uh i have the national guard keeping an eye on you
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:30.080]  reporting to me good for him well you're supposed to have the governor over the guard and the feds
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:35.520]  have tried to take that over and and make it ceremonial now to me this is just the the states
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:42.080]  and the people flexing their muscles yeah it's long overdue but i'm glad it's happening now
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:50.960]  uh better than ever and um kudos to um uh those who are questioning and i don't know that any of
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:56.720]  these public officials have actually made any accusations that this is a new various plot
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:03.280]  all they're saying is hey let's have a little bit of openness mr president transparency well
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.520]  that's what it is i mean the president is acting as a dictator more and more congress is letting him
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.720]  do it and i think it's it's it might be too little too late i mean who knows what power grab he may
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:19.840]  pull this shows a little bit of that old american instinct like ronald reagan said to trust but verify
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:26.560]  and and i mean look everybody knows from forbs to the associated press to nightline that they're
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:31.200]  training the military to take on vets and gun owners and saying we're the threat not al-qaeda
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:38.160]  or isis everybody knows that and guess why we know they're busy claiming we don't like the military
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:41.680]  it's the military that's telling us they're being given these missions they don't like it
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:49.280]  the military is still from everything i can pick up is substantially supportive of the
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:55.600]  constitution they respect the fact that they took an oath to uphold the constitution not to support
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:01.760]  mein führer which they did in nazi germany which they've done in totalitarian countries around the
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:10.160]  world the oath is to a person rather than to a constitution and we still have substantially i
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:16.800]  think police and military that take that seriously and that's a saving grace obama's been very
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:22.400]  frustrated we know that he's been cutting out leaders from the military actually in one case i
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:31.520]  read of a battlefield officer who was cashiered on the spot in afghanistan the middle of a battle
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:38.480]  he's told you're out of here bud so that's what our dear leader is doing to try to neuter those
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:44.640]  constitutionally loyal officers in the military but i think he's going to have a lot more neutering
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:49.760]  to do hopefully and well that's right there's a battle for the heart and the soul of our republic
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:54.000]  and at the heart of it's our military and our police and the police have been given a lot of
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.800]  bad training there are some bad cops and bad departments but overall george soros is funding
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:04.560]  this anti cop movement to try to make social change and have an arab uh... you know uh...
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:09.200]  kami spring whatever you want to call it i mean al gore said we need an arab spring here in america
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:15.760]  three years ago george soros is funding it uh... but it's a a socialist spring to make reform
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:22.320]  about shooting cops in the head no that's not what reform is no it's certainly not and
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:27.200]  you know what just uh... uh... before we run out of time i just want to celebrate the unnamed
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:34.160]  officer in garland texas here's a guy who faced with a couple of muslim terrorists
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:40.560]  under fire from guys with rifles and it's it's gotta be as his off-duty weapon because it's a
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:47.760]  glock forty five i'm not aware that uh... that's a police firearm uh... in many departments anyway
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:52.800]  so he pulls out his pistol he obviously is able to perceive that hitting center of mass
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:59.360]  doesn't do anything because the the terrorists are wearing body armor so this guy is able to pop
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:07.440]  him in the head and stop them before they're able to kill anybody amazing only in america if that
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:15.200]  had been in france there's a five-day manhunt marshal law we never would have heard the end of it
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:19.680]  right and uh... what do you think of the anti gunners and just to be clear when i'm in arab
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:24.320]  spring is i mean he wanted something like that here he said a a liberal spring a black spring
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.920]  the point is they want to get a classic communist civil war going what they don't understand is
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:38.320]  that a lot of the motivation for that spring say in egypt was against morsi the the muslim dictator
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:44.400]  and things quieted down when the pro-american military took over and put morsi in his pal
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:50.800]  in jails so these guys can't even read what's happening abroad correctly they hope they can
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:57.760]  somehow ignite a muslim flame to burn up the world and our dear leader has been doing what he can
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:05.360]  and toward that end but so far they they were blocked big time in egypt and you know i'm not
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:11.200]  saying that the generals are a bunch of uh... republican small but they did stop the blowing
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.960]  up of the church is a crucifying christians upside down and letting people live in peace
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.280]  and letting tourists come to the country it's a whole lot better with them than without them
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:25.600]  larry pratt of gunners on the wrong side larry pratt of gunners america is here how

[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.920]  we're lined up on globalist targets we're firing on all cylinders thanks to the good lord above
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:43.760]  it is the friday worldwide global transmission man there is a lot of news on the economy
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  the torik party stayed in power and expanded giving david cameron five more years because
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:01:00.160]  they posed as ukep the libertarian party but that party did gain some more seats so positive news
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:05.440]  on that front people were so scared of the communists just like they were in scotland
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:12.080]  that they voted for basically the very same group under different name but we'll see now if david
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:18.240]  cameron does what he's sworn he's going to do and give the uk a vote on being in the europe
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.200]  now polls are like 85 against being in it so that's why they haven't let them have a vote but
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.560]  if they have a vote in the next few years you can bet your bottom dollar that it's going to be a
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:34.960]  fraud because the the eu is a dictatorial body they're all about not giving you a vote i wanted
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:40.240]  to show this to folks it's an amazing image if you're a radio listener go to info wars.com it's

[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.560]  boy being smuggled to spain in suitcase caught by police using x-ray scanning on bags crossing
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:02:01.520]  border into the c2 uh how do you say that ce uta enclave from morocco how do you pronounce that
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:12.240]  in spanish c2 police found an eight-year-old boy hidden in a suitcase that was smuggled across the
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:17.360]  border from north africa the 19-year-old woman took the case through a pedestrian crossing from
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:23.920]  morocco into a small spanish governed territory on thursday a spokesman for the civil guard police
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:28.240]  force said when they put the suitcase through the scanner the operator noticed something strange
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:33.360]  which seemed to be a person inside the case can you imagine the claustrophobia of that
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:40.720]  can you imagine that i mean i'm not really claustrophobic but i don't like really small
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:47.760]  and closed spaces and then they've got photos of him emerging from the bag i mean good lord
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:52.480]  the boy said it was eight years old from the ivory coast according to spokesman the civil
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:57.040]  guard arrested the woman who was due to go before a judge they also arrested the boy's father who
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:02.400]  he tried to cross the border a few months later the father is from the ivory coast and lives in
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:08.160]  spain's canary islands thousands of migrants each year risk their lives a lot more than that
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:13.120]  and trying to get into spain uh yeah you ever heard how spain got conquered from north africa
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.800]  yeah i was reading spanish history again last night it's just so fascinating i want to go to
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:23.440]  spain someday i've been to other areas of europe and stuff but i really want to go to spain because
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:30.080]  you know spain was germanic spain really wasn't even populated and then it was it was conquered
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:36.560]  by germanic tribes and then by the romans uh but it wasn't really wasn't conquered because it was
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:44.560]  sparsely populated and then they got invaded by the morse basically arabes uh just a very
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:50.320]  interesting culture and then that culture founds the new culture with the meso american culture
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:56.080]  in the united states just have very interesting to watch all that stuff mixes together but um
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:04.080]  that's why i was sitting there one time um with some friends it shows
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:09.200]  uh we were when it first came out like 15 years ago 20 years or whatever it was uh we were watching
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:12.880]  sparta i mean not sparta because that's another good movie based on a real story stanley cubrick
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:18.480]  directed that um that'll remake that i don't think that's one of his better films still it's a good
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:24.720]  film but it was more like a big hollywood blockbuster he made but i was watching a gladiator and i was
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:30.800]  sitting there and uh one of my friends goes that guy doesn't look like he's spanish from spain
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.360]  and i was just like i go how ignorant are you i go that's exactly what somebody from spain
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:41.600]  2000 years ago looked like it's just very interesting to how all this stuff works all right we'll be
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:47.360]  right back on the other side we're gonna look at something that really is bad that the police are
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:52.400]  doing and it's killing people's dogs in fact when you guys pull up the article i saw last week
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:57.120]  where the cop the video shoots the dog over the fence for no reason just barking at them they
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:02.720]  shoot them but then if you heard a police dog you're going out of the jail texas rep louis
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:08.080]  gohmert is joining a long list of congressmen who are actually doing their job and addressing the

[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:38.640]  then we're going to have a detailed presentation
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:47.040]  on deeper research into jade helm and what the pentagon and the military are being directed
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:56.800]  to do and it deals with total domination of the human domain that's a quote with everything you
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:03.280]  do in an algorithm tracking you and your family listing veterans again as the number one enemy
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:10.000]  we already know that but it's just so outrageous and and generals sitting around on c span talking
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:20.080]  about it it's a bold criminal takeover and to do that they have to get the police federalized
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:25.920]  paramilitarized to a certain extent then the cops act bad then the feds come in as the saviors
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.200]  and fully federalize them as al sharp and said two days ago they plan to do
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:37.200]  it or i guess three days ago that was on tuesday this is a phenomenon i've been covering for
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.880]  really 20 years on air because it would happen locally and people would call me on my radio
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:47.840]  show or tv show i want me to cover it and i'd go out to the house and they'd go yeah the the
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:52.880]  labrador was chained here's the photos and the cops came to serve a search warrant his
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.360]  neighbors said they smelled marijuana and they did find a you know dime bag or something at one
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:02.160]  house not at another there was a couple of these cases with labs and they would just shoot them
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:07.520]  because the dog's barking and that doesn't let us control the situation and i've seen chihuahuas
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:13.040]  pomegranians i mean you come in a house the dog jumping up and down it really wants to protect it
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:18.800]  but then you see stories where some guy kicks a police dog and gets 50 years in prison or a
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.880]  thing i saw out of pennsylvania years ago in the associated press where the guys in a walmart parking
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:27.360]  line the windows open the german shepherd goes rar and almost bites him because they got parked by
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:33.440]  police car and the guy yelled at the dog and got indicted for assault so their dogs are better than
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:43.920]  people but then our dogs have no rights and michael oseas has made the film of dogs and men
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:50.800]  dot net of dogs and men dot net and they're giving us an exclusive first sneak peek a special trailer
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:57.840]  just for info wars dot com viewers and again we're mainly a radio show uh over 170 affiliates
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:03.600]  most people are listening on am and fm but i got so sick of the media more than 14 15 years ago
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:08.160]  saying i was making stuff up so we we have a tv as well now it's a full production shoot
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:13.840]  there's nice in the studio as you'll see it you know any major city affiliate not as nice as like
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:19.360]  a fox or cnn it's one of the money but the point is it's it's it's there to to professionally show
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:25.440]  you all this so there's that added layer to it that that added dimension and if you're a radio
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.120]  listener you can always go to info wars dot com four slash show and find the free feed
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:35.200]  the video feed the free podcast draw it apps everything and most importantly pass that link
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:40.560]  on to people and tell folks about the local am and fm affiliate as well don't take
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:51.280]  this stuff for granted don't do it realize that the system is basically doing everything it can
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:59.280]  to ensure that you don't get access to mind blowing info because it's not from a leftist
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:04.080]  perspective not from a right wing perspective it's from a constitutional pro human pro liberty
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:10.640]  perspective people ask why are you against gmo you're a libertarian or a conservative i'm libertarian
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:16.400]  conservative on a lot of issues but the liberals at grass roots are have been know that gmo is bad
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.520]  they're the ones that are against vaccines more the conservatives those are real liberals not the
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:31.120]  fake fascists like obama so these labels don't mean anything at the end of the day we talk about
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.200]  liberals because new listeners that tune in every millisecond they know what i mean when i say that
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:42.720]  let's go ahead and play this first sneak peek uh for of dogs and men at ofdogsandmen.net
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:45.760]  we're going to tweet this out as well at real alex jones here it is
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:53.920]  chloe enjoyed apples if i took two slices you just kind of give me a look like that one was my
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:13:00.640]  one ava was like my fourth daughter a very very sweet gentle dog
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:05.360]  oh
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.400]  pulled out his gun and shot her right in the head i said you shot my dog you shot my dog
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:30.720]  they hunted him down from behind and killed him god please don't let my baby die
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:37.760]  this situation made a lot of people feel like it could have been there
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:43.920]  how a police officer shot and killed a woman yesterday he did not mean to shoot the lady he
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:14:00.240]  was aiming for the dog he ain't gonna do nothing everybody needs to remember there are two sides
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:15.920]  to every storm police department is anybody home we got to think about life death family
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:22.880]  fired one shot into the dog's head drug dealers have aggressive dogs have you ever seen a drug
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:35.600]  dealer using a labrador dog no the police officer had shot and killed their dog and that dog was a
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:41.920]  chihuahua the knee jerk reaction is to circle the wagons prepare for a fight and deny everything
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:46.800]  we had the witness that doesn't lie we have the videotape
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:54.400]  why is it so commonly justified that we literally shoot five six seven bullets
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:15:04.000]  had a threat that has never killed one of us in the line of duty
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:12.800]  of dogs and men of dogs and men dot net
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:17.280]  i appreciate our guests joining us
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:25.040]  michael oseas started making films on super eight camera when he was seven years old he's always
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:29.920]  known it was his career ambition to the film school for moving los angeles initially he worked
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:34.960]  as an editor for movies television shows like american idol and dr phill and son of a guns
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:41.680]  he then co-founded his new media company where he has written and directed web videos on socially
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:46.160]  relevant topics like the drug war the legal system and education he holds a ba in film
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:52.000]  production university of central florida uh michael uh thank you for coming on with us uh wow to
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:58.160]  watch him shoot the chihuahuas on that video it's crazy and i see those articles all the time where
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:04.800]  the palmarinian was shot three times the doxin was shot four times and i mean that's the reason you
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:10.160]  don't do no knock raids and stuff unless it really is terrorist or a giant drug lab but now they're
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:14.720]  doing this across the board and i just saw in the news last week where the cop have you seen the video
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.520]  where he shoots the dog over the fence because it's barking at him i mean this is just crazy just
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:25.440]  from a pr perspective i mean i'd get it if i was doing a warrant service on a child molester
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:31.440]  and a pit bull rush me i'd shoot it and nobody's gonna say you shouldn't but the videos of like
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:39.520]  the lab on a leash backing away while it's being shot i mean it's just crazy town uh i mean i went
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:44.480]  to one house where and you could see where the dog had slumped the dog never even got up they came in
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:52.000]  the lab started to get up they shot it a couple times uh i mean why is this happening is it
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:58.560]  increasing or are we just aware of it now what's going on michael well uh first of all thank you
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:03.840]  for having me on alex and playing the trailer and i appreciate uh you consistently talking about
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:08.480]  these incidents when they come up um people need to know about it there's a lot of people who just
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:14.160]  don't know that it's going on i think that's the number one obstacle um facing change right now
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:20.480]  so we're working on that but um yeah is it increasing uh we believe that it is increasing
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:25.600]  and the reason that we think so is because it really only takes a quick peek at a couple of
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:32.160]  trends and those would be really cultural trends you notice like in the in the 70s there maybe was
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.960]  a couple hundred swat raids a year using swat as an example we know that's where this whole
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:44.960]  thing started to become an issue there are ways you know in and then as recently as 2005 we're at
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:51.920]  north of 50 000 of these raids annually so if you take that and you put it together with the cultural
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:58.320]  change that we as dog owners have also experienced where the dog used to be guarding the farm and
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:04.960]  then it was in the backyard now it's in our house and so you have these these two factions basically
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:11.840]  both kind of meeting in the middle here in inside our homes with uh with tragic results
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:15.760]  because there are military forces coming in our houses looking for drugs the government
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:20.960]  shipped in the banks laundered and then our chihuahua or our doxin gets up and they just
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:25.040]  and i and i get it they want to control the situation they want to watch for humans they
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:30.000]  want to see what's happening so they just dispatch the dog as a matter of course and it's and then lie
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:38.880]  about it well it's it's become very routine and uh while there may be some departments out there
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:46.560]  that have a full-time staff of uh of SWAT officers largely the um a lot of these SWAT officers they
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:50.720]  do other things and so they're you know they're working in the prisons or they're regular B cops
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:55.680]  or something and then when there's a raid they suit up and they go do it and so in the 80s when
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:03.440]  when shooting the dog was was uh as as part of training known to be uh an acceptable means of
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:09.680]  handling that solution it started to happen with more and more regularity and then it spilled over
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:15.120]  as those same officers were were not in a SWAT situation yeah because all the dog knows from
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:20.640]  all its instincts is the cave is being invaded by another tribe of people i'm gonna bark and so
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:26.320]  they're executed for barking that's what's going on yeah i i think like if you if you charge
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.640]  through a door wearing all dark clothes and your face covered with a shield and shouting very loudly
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:38.720]  you'd really need a sack of cats to be any more assaulting on the um on the sense it's
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:44.000]  well even a lab is gonna bark when the family it loves is being i mean it's just all a big
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.640]  joke and they ship the drugs in so they can destabilize everything and and bring us to this
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:55.280]  point like a civil war like mexico stay there we've got the maker of the film of dogs and men

[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:42.640]  science is our guest the new documentary film of dogs and men when is the film coming out when
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:48.000]  can the public you know get it on dvd or is this gonna go through a process where is the production
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:56.400]  right now right now the film is i would say 90 some percent done it's it's almost there but the
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:03.680]  the primary obstacle that we're facing with the release is just finding the home for it
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:09.920]  distribution wise so as soon as we find that and we know where that is we'll know when the release
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:15.840]  date will be well this is the type of film that needs to be on hbo this is the type of film that
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:21.520]  needs to be seen and if the system got behind it it'd be a big hit too but the establishment just
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:26.400]  wants things to continue the way it is and you know for me it's not about attacking the police
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:31.040]  they're citizens they live here too they're in the middle of this big phony drug war a lot of them
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:38.560]  are good men and women but you know the just the whole death squad no knock raids it's what you get
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:46.000]  north korea or venezuela or or nazi germany and it just it needs to be curtailed and that's the
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.080]  national debate we've been having we just want to slow it down i mean that'd be good it's just
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:54.880]  growing growing where do you think all this is going to end because the biggest thing i found
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:26:00.640]  i've asked the public libertarian conservative liberal especially really are starting to hate the
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:07.360]  police uh and the biggest thing they say is have you seen them kill those dogs those little dogs
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:15.920]  people people really are getting freaked out by this well i think it's it's easier for uh for
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:20.880]  people to wrap their head around because when you hear about these incidents and involves a person
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:25.280]  there's always this thought about well what did he do what did what did this person do that that
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:30.480]  provokes the situation in the first place but in the case of the dog they're they're born innocent
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:36.720]  even in the stories that we hear about where the dog might may have behaved aggressively it's still
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:41.920]  our nature to we just we naturally understand that the dog is not born that way somebody
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:47.120]  trained the dog to be that way there's still a level of human culpability on the end of it and the
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:54.880]  dogs are uh are the ones who are paying the price well but i mean these videos where a chihuahua
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:59.920]  is just barking on the side of the street so that you shoot it or the new video we can put it on
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:08.000]  screen where the cop just shoots the dog over the fence what i mean what's the point it's well
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:14.640]  there there is there isn't one and uh in our interviews we um you know and in doing the
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.560]  interviews for the documentary talk to we talked to people who had lost their dogs we talked to
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:25.040]  politicians we talked to uh but we we talked to cops as well and there are a lot of people in
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:30.000]  law enforcement who are not happy about this situation either they want it to end they of
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.680]  course the chihuahua does not pass the smell test for anybody you know i mean it's just there's no
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:41.280]  expert witness that is going to that's going to come help you well let's say you're in a real drug
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:44.640]  house because even though the drug war is funny you can have some scum involved and you're in
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:50.880]  there and a chihuahua is running at you kick it or something it'll run off why why shoot it i mean
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:58.400]  it's just crazy i i don't know and we've asked that question because it seems it seems like
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:04.480]  the idea that the dog as a distraction in a chaotic situation would be a justification for
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:09.440]  shooting it doesn't uh it just doesn't sound right you know it's a distraction the drug war
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.360]  i'm sorry say you know the drug war is the distraction we have more drugs on the streets
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.760]  than ever the banks are laundering the money it's a total fraud where do you see all this
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:26.720]  ending if it continues to escalate i think there's really two ways that this can happen if if uh
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:31.680]  people become aware of it if they ask their local police department what they're doing about it if
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:37.040]  things are are done proactively in advance of a terrible incident happening well i mean really
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.760]  we're beating this problem one one city at a time as a terrible incident gets a lot of press and all
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:48.640]  that but if it's proactive then we can solve it culturally we can move the dog away from property
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:55.200]  and closer to family and police culture because that's how we view them in citizen culture so
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:00.640]  if we if we can do that and they can help us proactively then together we can solve the the
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:06.320]  problem probably quickly and painlessly but if they don't the the number of of people who are
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:12.720]  upset about this is growing legislation is passing mandates uh for training are passing and the
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:16.960]  lawsuits are piling up and the payouts are getting bigger and bigger so that's right it's
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:20.800]  going away and it's only going to get more painful that's right none of this is well look we're
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:24.400]  gonna have you back on the nightly news the next few weeks and follow your film as it comes out
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:28.720]  thank you for the time but they have huge funerals for police dogs that don't want to do any fine
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:35.600]  i love dogs i'm a dog lover big time uh it's just it's just they stand up for their families
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:39.360]  that's why they're being killed the cats could care less so they're fine i'm not i don't hate
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:45.680]  cats but compared to dogs give me a break oh look at that cutie pie who is that terrorist

[02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:15.040]  on earth we ever got in this situation well i'll tell you how when the democrats showed their
[02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:21.280]  true colors you got angry and you elected republicans and then when the republicans showed their
[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:28.160]  true colors you got angry and elected democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both parties
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:34.560]  were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest you acted like they were
[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:42.480]  crazy but the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting

[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:33.440]  away uh and uh city area in front of the yards and letting people by getting laws passed by just
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:38.320]  doing it at first forcing retirees to try to arrest you then pointing out its tyranny then
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:43.920]  getting the law changed to plant gardens in basically your front yards wow what a free country
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:52.480]  we can do that and and and to use unused public lands ron finley today we're battling the un treaties
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:58.960]  and the tpp treaties to go after the second amendment uh we're battling their stealth attacks
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:04.640]  then we have a guest on exposing the program to execute dogs during uh police encounters
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:12.000]  just because they are not in control the situation the dog won't shut up and so it has to die uh you
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:18.080]  ask questions you have to be tasered this uh pain compliance torture compliance this this
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:23.760]  conversion to a tyranny and now we're going to be covering jade helm uh and how that ties into
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:29.600]  the bigger picture this is a precious operation and i know you know that i wake up every morning
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.400]  and i go to bed every night as well and just remind myself hey keep your nose clean do a
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:40.400]  really good job focus on what you're doing be productive be accurate be truthful check your
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:46.080]  ego at the door and realize you're part of something big and all of you the listeners
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:55.600]  and viewers uh are part of something uh really really big as well because the globalists are
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:03.360]  all about making us feel calm while they anesthetize this while they basically dismantle our culture
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:08.880]  our society but you read their books and white papers and statements i mean they are exterminist
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:14.960]  transhumanist eugenicist the nastiest well co-hearted psychopaths you can imagine david night
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:19.520]  was just pointing out earlier that you know it's psychopaths that like to hurt little animals
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:23.760]  means one thing you know but then they extend and say gutting a deer psychopathic or putting a
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:27.280]  hook in a you know or taking a hook out of a fish's mouth the psychopathic no that's just
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:32.400]  farming that's just hunting the people that like to torture animals you know george w bush like to
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:38.560]  put firecrackers uh in the mouths of frogs and blow them up live and remember i'd see kids do
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:41.760]  stuff like that when i was a kid i was kind of like you know i don't like that's a living frog
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:46.720]  uh you know i think that's gross and it wasn't like i was some bleeding heart
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:54.720]  it's just that i had empathy and and they want us to have a lack of empathy so that when
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:02.240]  we see our neighbor being drug off or the cps taking somebody's kids uh or the globalists
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:07.200]  restricting somebody else's free speech we just keep our head down like gazelles and hope that the
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:14.560]  lions will get another animal or like a deer in the forest of india we hope the tiger just grabs
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:19.120]  one of the other deer and you know it's going to be us tomorrow but so what we're not prey animals
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:32.960]  like cottontail rabbits uh we are not domesticated idiots but they're trying to make us behave and
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:38.000]  act like that and i don't care about the military the police corporate systems whatever there's
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:46.800]  cultures and there is a culture of of oppression a culture of of of hive dronism that's going on
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:53.440]  to make us conform into different uh controlled groups uh and organizations and it's time for
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:38:00.800]  us to break free of that you don't have to subscribe uh or prescribe to what we're saying
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:08.400]  you simply know on every historical yardstick measurement if we had dials in front of us they'd
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:20.000]  all be pegged red alert the ships on fire the ship sinking tyranny is racing because of technology
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:28.400]  we can also use technology to fight tyranny but more importantly we're fighting complacency
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:34.160]  the acclimation the normalcy bias the the learned helplessness we really do have a
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:43.120]  mass stockholm syndrome worldwide where we identify and begin to submit to our oppressors
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:47.760]  now the globalists then play the other end of that and we are becoming oppressed we are being
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:56.640]  tyrannized so then they sell mindless burning and shooting not against the actual rulers the
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:02.080]  controllers but against local systems that aren't even fully controlled by them yet then in the name
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:05.840]  of reforming them they're going to come in and take them over and bring you something 10 times worse
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:12.880]  and so in that we need to appeal to the noble side of bureaucrats police ourselves corporate
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:18.800]  people business people and demand the change we want to see on what restaurants serve on what
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:24.640]  grocery stores sell on the policies on how the cps behaves we're going to get more done
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:30.000]  then challenging them and showing them how they're being manipulated because most people
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.880]  are just busy they're under peer pressure they're following a narrative they don't have any honor
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:43.040]  and it's not that they're dishonorable because they're innately dishonorable they've been moving
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:47.600]  too fast their whole life set in front of a television put into peer pressure put into this
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:53.600]  gold-based regurgitation based education system that isn't about education but about brainwashing
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:58.800]  to where they can't even communicate they can't even grasp the ideas we're talking about they have
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:05.520]  no connection to the legendary struggle of humanity against oppression and tyranny and and and just to
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:14.720]  have ideas and be able to have your own garden in japanese imperial oppression and under the show guns
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:19.360]  they had a feudalism where you could not grow plants for food unless it was authorized to give
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:24.720]  a certain percentage it was even more oppressive in in europe in the dark ages you couldn't even
[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:29.360]  have herbs or anything for people being sick or they'd burn you at the stake saying it was witchcraft
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:35.760]  there was a a total oppression the globalists describe at the club of rome in their 1960s
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:42.720]  publications that we covered in in-game blueprint for global enslavement they describe in great
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:50.640]  detail a neo feudalistic system they want to visit upon us that's their work so everything you see
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:58.960]  is a replay carbon taxes is a tax on all human activity not about the environment all of this
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:03.680]  is about total control all over the country you can't get a tax credit for putting in your own
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:12.560]  solar or your own wind you've got to put it into their system you see it's they don't want you independent
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:17.360]  they don't want us coming together as normal humans you want to defeat the globalist start
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:22.240]  having your neighbors over to barbecue no matter what color they are you want to defeat the globalist
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:27.840]  start starting a garden go to city council just see what's happening uh go to a homeless soup

[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:36.560]  they don't want us interfacing with each other they want us all just fighting with each other

[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:38.080]  now shifting gears into the really big subject i've been aware of this program for years but
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:45.200]  listeners contacted us we looked into it david night rob did we did a lot of research and we
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:49.040]  know about the domestic plans to take on the patriot movement to take on the gun owners to
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:52.960]  take on the veterans that's in hundreds of publications we know the pentagon's new main
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:58.720]  role domestically is that that's over the top and insane then jade helm comes along we just say
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:03.440]  this should be watched it lists these states in his hostile the john warter fence authorization
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:08.160]  act admits the military's preparing to put down legislative rebellions or to take out governors
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:15.440]  that's in the news we should watch this they misrepresent say that we say it's a minute takeover it's
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:18.960]  now one of the biggest stories the last month it just gets bigger and bigger they're calling it a
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.960]  firestorm but it's admitted that the pentagon is tracking everything we do putting it into this
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:31.280]  internet of things this map that that that tracks the whole world and that creates a file on every
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:37.280]  american and then files on regions and subregions of the country and that's what david night and
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:41.840]  of course rob doer here to talk about we may have to do some overdrive today to get into all this
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:46.320]  but gentlemen where should we start here well there's a ton of stuff on here i think we should
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:51.200]  start with the c-span clip we broke that down a couple days ago the sleeping giant awakens on live
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:56.480]  tv and there's the one of the questions someone calls in to talk to the colonel who is head of
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:02.160]  the asymmetrical warfare group he's the commander of this colonel john pitosa they say hey why don't
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:06.080]  you tell us about jave helm we think it's a cool little exercise you know i i know she was trying
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:10.880]  to bait the guy into a into an argument he stopped he looks over you see him look off screen shake his
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:16.320]  head goes i don't know anything about that i mean it's an amazing clip and this was on c-span live
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:21.440]  and he's like for ap hill where pigs and i were about a year ago he's he's in fort ap hill they're
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:24.720]  doing the interview he knows all about it but he knows nothing he knows nothing he's a leading
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:29.360]  expert but he knows nothing what he does the sergeant shalt defense and and i explain that in
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:34.800]  the clip so uh let's go to that clip real quick morning colonel i wanted to alert our citizens
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.240]  and to get an explanation if we could for an exciting uh military training called jade helm 15
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:44.560]  which is all over the internet i guess it involves 10 states and there's going to be
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:49.280]  civilians participating in the heavy clouds like big spring texas yeah this is a guy he said he
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:53.840]  explained the magnitude of that and what the purpose of that is and apparently you're going to
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:58.320]  have crisis factors and and they're going to be soldiers dressed in uniform and not in uniform
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:02.240]  and apparently it's very exciting could could you explain that to us thank you very much
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:09.040]  unfortunately it's not something that i'm familiar with so i i can't really explain
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:13.200]  that uh but i do know he's got a civilian handler out there oh yeah things are things
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:17.680]  that we do here where we get our soldiers the opportunity to work within an environment where
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:22.960]  there are uh civilians and soldiers as a matter of fact one of the things i i could talk about is
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:30.400]  that now unfortunately i just don't know about that particular exercise the army's plan for
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:36.320]  a multi-state training exercise this summer called jade helm 15 while the military says it's just
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:41.600]  training soldiers for the realities of war critics say the army is preparing for modern day martial
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:46.480]  law the summer calling it a texas takeover what's happening is between july and september a bunch
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:51.360]  of green berets navy seals and special ops from the air force and marines are conducting some
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:58.240]  realistic training exercises across the southwest including 17 different texas cities again i'm sorry
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:04.000]  i'm just not familiar with that exercise oh i see nothing i was not here that's a month ago
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:10.560]  he just said this a few days ago it has just been on every channel in the country now let's stop
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:15.280]  he even knew who you guys were when he had you detained oh yeah so so this is just asinine yeah
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:20.640]  now expanding on this we're getting into part two of the video that's up on info wars dot com
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:25.760]  proof pentagon mapping us for domestic insurgents including libertarians constitutionalists and
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:29.920]  patriots and what we're getting into is an event that's been happening for about eight years we've
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:37.360]  got some c-span clips from five years ago it's it's dominating the human domain analytics and we
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:41.680]  get this from trajectory magazine so you've got to go into the different pentagon publications
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:47.280]  the different trade publications to find this directly from them what they're actually doing
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.600]  you know alex when we look at this and we saw this it's like okay here here it comes again we've
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:55.360]  been talking about all these different aspects of it this is another exercise it's bigger they're
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:59.440]  increasing the scope they're increasing the frequency we were all surprised i think to see
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:03.760]  how this picked up how jade hale picked up but i think the thing is is that's like the snowden
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:09.360]  files when you see the documents when you see the slides it hits with people and they see this map
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:14.240]  that's what when he said he said i was in the army as an officer this is this is scary and that's
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.560]  concerned about martial law that's just the tip of the iceberg because what this is about
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:24.000]  this is when they say mastering the human domain when you look at that logo human domain is a term
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:27.680]  of art of the military just like unconventional warfare just like asymmetric war it means the
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:33.520]  entire ecosystem everybody exactly that means slavery they are getting all this information
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:39.760]  about you as an individual and as different groups and they're mapping it onto a geographic label
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.400]  it's full spectrum dominance exactly and there's there's the logo right there master of the human
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:50.480]  domain and in the company notice it's the same they call it mastering the human domain and that's
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:55.840]  the name of these programs so we were just searching what they meant by that this they admit is for
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:02.160]  domestic activity so we got them it is domestic and when you look at these conferences we have them
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:06.160]  alex we look at these conferences when you look at the history they tie it intimately
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:10.000]  in with law enforcement so you guys went back and looked at what is mastering human domain
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  you've got all the pentagon briefings where they admit it's tracking everything we do it's for us
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:17.920]  right you and conferences they've got james clapper the nsa the homeland security of their
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:23.520]  us geological service this is domestic it is melded with law enforcement it's a real fair
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:29.200]  yes as much intel operation as it is a military that's what i'm saying this is to test the locals
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:33.600]  this is for the rollout yeah and what what they're doing is using facebook twitter anything you put
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:38.080]  out online they're using that collecting that data and going well this is out of the ordinary we
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:43.200]  got to go to invest and see we're going to force a debate about this manhattan project happening
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:48.720]  beneath the surface they don't want to unveil it before it's ready yes it's ridiculously big when
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:52.240]  we come back we've got some more clips it's just going to boil yes so what do we call this special
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:57.280]  report uh confirmed jade helm uh is for domestic operations against american people at least in
[02:50:57.280 --> 02:51:03.360]  part oh yeah i mean we have them it's it's about mastering america heart and body extract continues

[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:38.800]  the fourth hour years ago i did the fourth hour live a lot of stations don't info wars.com forward
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:44.000]  slash show i'm going to go to five after but we're just going to continue with these guys because
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.480]  do want to get some of the clips off and ready and it was about 10 minutes late so they're going
[02:54:48.480 --> 02:54:53.840]  to do a whole presentation on this coming up but he's got clip after clip from these dominating the
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:59.840]  human environment analytics and that's the jade helm logo and then we find the same players this
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:05.440]  is for america and it's for the globe as well but it's for mapping everything taking over local
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:12.080]  towns knowing which towns are ready to do it who isn't uh it's for civil war uh and again it has
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:17.440]  dual use as well any training does but it's confirmed this is a big deal jade helm confirmed
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:24.720]  for domestic operations but it's not the takeover they're misrepresenting and again they use this
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:29.600]  as a war game now to see if they can lie to people yes i think the whole thing's a sigh up like we're
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:34.160]  in the middle yeah we're not playing we're already in general with it unfortunately yeah but by putting
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:37.520]  it out there letting people know about it they're seeing the reaction and david's got a ton to cover
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:40.800]  i'll be out of here soon he'll get to all of it but but get to the next clip what do you have to
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:46.800]  yeah so they had this 2010 mastering the human domain conference the next year the open of the
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:51.280]  2011 kind of shows everything that they've been talking about and that they've been working on
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:55.360]  for a year so i want to play that and then we'll go back and show the other clips that kind of it's
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:56:01.440]  like watching paint dry but we'll get to it this is a who's who the femahead clapper nsa top general
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:06.400]  it's the military security as well as this is them coordinating that what isan harwin
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:11.120]  decides to just like a third world country is taken over by its military but this is the bureaucracy
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:15.280]  using it for that we just want to debate the fact that we're already in the middle of the takeover
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:24.800]  here it is the threats that we face don't recognize boundaries whether those are physical boundaries
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:31.040]  or organizational boundaries no boundaries agency boundaries and every time we're inhibited
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:35.600]  in our response to those threats by our own obviously they're gonna start showing us and our
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:40.240]  impact and when we lessen our impact we lessen our services to those decision makers and we
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:45.040]  ultimately affect our national security in a negative way the consequence to the nation if we
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:49.760]  don't integrate and they go to training manuals it's all the patterns we're missing and the tv
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:55.840]  says we won't deliver the best possible solution set to our mission partners whether that's the
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:01.920]  policy and the billions you make up for the first responder this type of warfare today the first
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:08.640]  responder the military space require rapid assimilation of information rapid understanding
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:12.320]  situation where it's wrapped remember the homeless security video that should have taken up down
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:17.680]  in america intelligence it's like fighting with both hands tied behind your back oh don't tie your
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:23.360]  hands your eyes it's it's uncertain and they put all these obama noids in now it's the latest
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:28.560]  yeah it's people that didn't go along with a bunch of social workers now in general the way you are
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:34.480]  most likely us yeah into the u.s. content the substance the early warning the value of information
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:38.960]  hey remember the ad integrated in pencil venue to pay your taxes was just like the same same thing
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:43.520]  yeah you understand they have lockheed ads now where it shows them scanning u.s. cities
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:48.240]  lockheed help make this a question you understand the needs potential threats and you're putting
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.600]  that information together in a way but notice the song that it wasn't all this that stopped those
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:58.480]  guys up in dallas in garland there's one guy with a gun he used his own humid to say i bet this is a
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:02.320]  target yeah so an opportunity cop went and hung out out front yeah i don't know if you notice that
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:05.440]  at the end they they were showing the different layers that is what they're building they're
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:09.440]  building a different layers of information like this is a friendly area give us a preview what's

[02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:37.440]  alex that is also predictive because we're seeing that in law enforcement as well when they say
[02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:43.040]  that the genesis of this came from three different inputs one of them was the military in iraq the other
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:48.240]  is american law enforcement and the third one was casinos in nevada that's right it's all human

[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:24.960]  now of overdrive they're going to start over slowly methodically how jade helm we now find out as
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:30.640]  part of a large pentagon cyber security fema homeland security mastering the human domain
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:36.160]  rural affairs council of the ten regions of fema you notice that's run by the pentagon
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:43.360]  this is the accelerated rollout ahead of economic collapse and they know when one in ten has autism
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:47.040]  when people are all down to cancer there's going to be civil unrest people are going to say no
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:50.960]  when nobody has money to prep and the military is going to come and just take you away because
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:55.360]  you're a terrorist yeah um like you practice in fort lauderdale just the other day they were
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:01:00.000]  putting people in white vans and driving them off but but but this is confirming because you know
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:03.360]  starting with you about 20 minutes go through now be the first video we put up on youtube today
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:12.720]  this is just the first salvo yes jade you know proof jade helm is for domestic takeover
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:20.240]  but we need to add the proviso not the takeover itself the training for the takeover it's an
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:24.880]  exercise in the takeover is what it is you were trying to talk for when to break david tell us
[03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:29.280]  preview what's coming up with you in the next hour with rob do well what we need to do alex
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:33.760]  is we need to break down so that people really understand that this is they just don't put
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:37.680]  these words up at random when they say mastering the human domain when they talk about it being
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:42.000]  unconventional warfare when i talk to the abc reporter she had already written a story on
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.880]  jade helm she says well it's realistic but it's unconventional i said no unconventional warfare
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:54.400]  is a very specific term it is a psi op first and foremost uh but mastering the human domain is a very
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:59.360]  specific term of art of the department of defense so we're going to tell people what the human domain
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:04.320]  is why it's significant about this mapping that we see in a course that is just the tip of the
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:12.480]  iceberg that is a very coarse uh map that's like jiu jitsu is a art form of martial arts or taekwondo
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:17.680]  we have these terms you go look them up it's giant huge meetings for domestic takeover that's on the
[03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:23.440]  logo fits in with quote blending in doing things that look illegal yes i mean this that's why
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:28.480]  they're freaking out so bad is this is domestic we we gave them benefit of the doubt we looked
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:33.840]  into it they've been caught lying it's a giant domestic takeover this is folding in the and
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:38.000]  and intel they're getting from the surveillance state this is folding it into these military
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.560]  operations we don't get dragged that surveillance eventually if we don't stop this it is going to
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:46.480]  come to the point where they drag you out in the middle of the night like we just saw in fort
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:50.000]  lauderdale just as they've been authorized to do that's what they're going to do when you don't
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:54.880]  vaccinate or you homeschool they're already doing a low intensity rounding folks up it's going to
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:59.360]  intensify well notice how that family they put something out on facebook it went into the cloud
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:04.000]  the cloud analyzed it and said threat threat matrix we got to send somebody out after them
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:08.320]  the orders come into the cps they go take the kids away that's how that's how it's going to work
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:12.560]  and and i'm about overtly fighting this and saying it's morally wrong corrupt and evil
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:17.360]  but people can also choose the other route use facebook and twitter for disinformation
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:22.080]  and i think it's patriotic duties it's time this is very sophisticated folks you got to be careful
[03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:27.120]  but it's time to start pumping it with disinfo not lies about media events and things but your own
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:33.360]  homestead your own house what you're doing i would say use it but only use it to create a false image
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:38.240]  yeah you go the only way to defeat something like this is to pump it full of disinfo
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:42.720]  yeah so then there's so much it overloads the system i mean we're going to go through the whole
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:47.440]  thing there's another aspect of this from that c span interview which i kind of glossed over and
[03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:51.280]  i got i got called out on it by why didn't you cover the robot section there's a whole
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:55.840]  part where the guy talks about they have autonomous robots walking around as soldiers and civilians
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:04:00.720]  and rob that asymmetrical for ap hill center i think that's training for the robots to come
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:05.120]  after us that's the headline ap hill training robots to fight for i mean it's all listen
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:09.120]  they're announcing china plans to get rid of within five years 90 percent of its workers
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:13.520]  yeah with robots and here's the thing i mean it's on folks it's on there i mean it's their plan
[03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:18.720]  when they ask him about jade helms alex when they ask him about jade helm and he glances off
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:22.320]  and he goes and he nods and he goes i don't know anything about that and now he's got to come up
[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:26.400]  with something to talk about they were doing that it goes into his he he kind of unconsciously goes
[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:31.120]  and it's like well we got a ton of robots yeah so it's like let's let's change the subject over
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:34.720]  here something interesting that's the thing that's first and foremost in his mind they did it like
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:40.080]  a hundred times jakari was telling me and begs that to say anything the lieutenant colonel would
[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:43.520]  look back at the private corporation and they're the ones that give the money to the government
[03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:47.840]  to lobby they're now in control of the military so we're fighting for the future of the military

[03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:20.640]  this is an emergency transmission from femur region 6 in occupied north america
[03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:33.200]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:38.080]  has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:49.200]  welcome back to overdrive of the alex jones show i'm david knight and joining me now is rob do
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:57.200]  we want to give you the broader view we want to explain to you what they mean by mastering the human
[03:08:57.200 --> 03:09:02.240]  domain when they have that on the jade helm logo let's pull that logo up and take a look at that
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:08.400]  as we explain this now mastering the human domain is actually a term of art just like
[03:09:08.400 --> 03:09:12.880]  unconventional warfare unconventional warfare means something very specific to the department
[03:09:12.880 --> 03:09:18.720]  of defense and so does the human domain when they're talking about that they're talking about
[03:09:18.720 --> 03:09:24.640]  mapping you you are the humans everything that they can find out about you they're going to map
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:29.920]  on a geographical map and i think it's very important that i one of the reasons this is really
[03:09:29.920 --> 03:09:35.840]  picked up and caught the public's attention is because of the maps but they don't understand
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:41.760]  the full extent of the maps now james clapper has been speaking at several of these uh
[03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:47.360]  these uh what would you call them they're they're geo and uh psychopath conference yeah their
[03:09:47.360 --> 03:09:51.680]  conference is this is a trade organization that is grown up in this and within the military
[03:09:51.680 --> 03:09:57.440]  industrial complex exactly it's become a large part of the of this uh the military industrial
[03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:01.360]  complex and he's been the keynote speaker at several of these and this is what he had to say
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:09.840]  he says activity based intel human domain analytics are arrows that will form the
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:15.200]  intellectual underpinning for how we conduct intelligence in the future you have to understand
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:21.360]  that jade helm is as much an intel operation as it is a military operation and when they use the
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:25.600]  military and they say just salute the uniform don't pay any attention to what's going on
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:30.320]  they're using the military uniform to distract you they're using it as a red herring so that
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:35.280]  you don't pay attention to what's going on with this and of course james clapper was the guy who
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:40.720]  famously uh was asked by ron wyden if they were doing any dragnet surveillance and he put his head
[03:10:40.720 --> 03:10:46.000]  down he hit his eyes because he couldn't make direct eye contact and he said uh no uh we're not
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:50.480]  doing that we saw that he was with the slides that were released from ed snowden it's now
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:54.320]  common knowledge that he was lying of course michael haden who was head of the nsa at this at
[03:10:54.320 --> 03:10:59.520]  the time has subsequently spoken out at a uh washington and lee university conference to law
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:05.680]  students he says i blame ron wyden he knew that we were doing dragnet surveillance the staff
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:09.360]  every one of the staff of every one of those senators on the uh senate intelligence committee
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:13.600]  knew we were doing dragnet surveillance and he asked that question james clapper knowing that he
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:18.160]  couldn't answer it knowing that he would lie so he put him into the position where he would lie
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:22.720]  so i want to ask you just how much credibility people who've worked for the cia and others
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:27.440]  really have on this so uh i want to define before we go to some of these clips that show
[03:11:27.440 --> 03:11:33.520]  what this is about i want to define for you what the human domain is okay there's four data categories
[03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:40.160]  in here one of them is who you are what you do who you know context okay who you are this is
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:44.640]  analyst collecting information about your name your address your gender your biometrics your
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:48.640]  facebook page this is what we've been talking about for a very long time this is where this
[03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:55.120]  is all coming together this is domestic exactly it's domestic it is uh police-based it is intel
[03:11:55.120 --> 03:12:00.480]  based it's nsa homeland security attending these conferences and it's also the military
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:05.600]  next thing what you do collected information will include your travel your communications
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:09.520]  your financial transactions they want to see all the money that you spend that's why we have to
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:15.120]  have this war on cash your movement of physical access as assets that's right they're going to
[03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:19.200]  track you by your cell phone they're going to track you by your car who you are this is relational
[03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:23.040]  information your family your friends your associates your organizations your community
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:29.200]  involvement and then here's the broad thing the context contextual data will include demographics
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:36.320]  your politics your religion etc so do you want the government tracking all of this do you want
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:42.640]  the surveillance state that we have do you want the police and the military mapping you out on a
[03:12:42.640 --> 03:12:48.960]  geographical basis because that is what this human domain analytics is about that's what
[03:12:48.960 --> 03:12:54.640]  activity-based intel is about that is what geo intel is about and they put all that together
[03:12:54.640 --> 03:13:00.000]  and they call it multi intel because they're looking at everything about you at its full spectrum
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.800]  total awareness tyranny and let me add this if this was for our safety and for our security
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:08.400]  like they like to say it is then why are they creating the terror groups why are they funding
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:14.720]  the terrorists out there why are they making dropships to isis yeah and so and now isis is
[03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:20.400]  here supposedly in the united states they have isis agents here you know if this is supposedly
[03:13:20.400 --> 03:13:24.800]  for our safety and security then why are they funding the terrorists because they need to have
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:31.280]  both sides of it they have to have the drug war we just had freeway ricky ross and we know that
[03:13:31.280 --> 03:13:37.120]  they were running the the crack cocaine at the same time that they were were fighting the war
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:41.440]  on drugs so it's like i'm from the government i'm here to help you do both so well let's go back
[03:13:41.440 --> 03:13:46.320]  let's play the uh c span clip again if people are just joining us now the this is colonel
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:51.520]  john petosik head of the asymmetrical warfare group at 40 ap hill where you guys went about a
[03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:57.440]  year ago got detained by this colonel yes or and after you'd gotten permission to go on the base
[03:13:57.440 --> 03:14:01.600]  and check it out and you even they let you into the asymmetrical war yes they let us in and you
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:07.600]  know what when we talk about this being for the united states we stood at the corner of first in
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:12.880]  main and i took joe biggs's picture there at the corner of first of main everything about this was
[03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:17.280]  thoroughly american the street signs of traffic lights were working the only thing that was there
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:22.240]  that could be remotely considered not to be american was the mosque but they had an american church
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:28.880]  right across the street from it stained glass pews the whole bit this is training the military as
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:34.080]  well as the police and of course as we talk about this uh mastering the human domain we will see
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:40.000]  that it is a fusion of the intelligence community the law enforcement community and the military
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:45.520]  that is what should concern you and we need to pull this back and we need to say this is not
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:49.040]  going to be the mission of our government this is not going to be the mission of the military or
[03:14:49.040 --> 03:14:52.880]  law enforcement and we don't want this kind of intelligence being kept on the american people
[03:14:52.880 --> 03:14:58.720]  we're sick of it right now let's go to that clip morning colonel i wanted to alert our citizens
[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:04.080]  and to get an explanation if we could for an exciting military training called jade helm 15
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:08.480]  which is all over the internet i guess it involves 10 states and there's going to be
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:15.040]  civilians participating in towns like big spring texas um could you explain the magnitude of that
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:19.360]  and what the purpose of that is and apparently you're going to have crisis actors and and they're
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:23.840]  going to be soldiers dressed in uniform and not in uniform and apparently it's very exciting could
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:30.480]  you explain that to us thank you very much unfortunately it's it's not something that
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:36.480]  i'm familiar with so i i can't really explain that uh but i do know that those type of things
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:40.880]  are things that we do here where we get our soldiers the opportunity to work within an
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:45.280]  environment where there are uh civilians and soldiers as a matter of fact one of the things
[03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:54.240]  i i could talk about unfortunately i just don't know about that particular exercise
[03:15:54.240 --> 03:16:00.000]  for a multi-state training exercise this summer called jade helm 15 while the military says it's
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:04.960]  just training soldiers for the realities of war critics say the army is preparing for modern day
[03:16:04.960 --> 03:16:18.080]  martial law summer calling it a texas takeover what's happening between july september about oh you know
[03:16:18.080 --> 03:16:23.760]  including 17 different texas cities again i'm sorry i'm just not familiar with that exercise
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:34.160]  so we had colonel schultz of the head of the asymmetrical warfare group knows nothing
[03:16:34.160 --> 03:16:38.640]  about the biggest asymmetrical warfare exercise going on in the united states when matt drudge
[03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:43.920]  picked up our story on this and he posted our story and he also posted the uh a link to the
[03:16:43.920 --> 03:16:48.560]  document up unscribed that was their response yeah i don't know anything about this i can't
[03:16:48.560 --> 03:16:53.040]  respond to it i can't see it i don't mean i see nothing i know nothing that was their initial
[03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:58.240]  response the same response as we saw here with this uh uh colonel at the asymmetric warfare
[03:16:58.240 --> 03:17:04.080]  group and asymmetric warfare and special forces and the unconventional warfare that is all part of
[03:17:04.080 --> 03:17:08.560]  that they are intricately intermeshed with each other he knows exactly what's going on with this
[03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:14.000]  but he gives us the same lying denial it is very transparent and that's over an hour of well it's
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:19.280]  about an hour 55 minutes of this interview with this colonel people calling in not one person
[03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:23.520]  agreed with what they were doing they all saw the bs behind it they said look you're training to go
[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:27.840]  into our cities you're training to take out our american citizens you're training for gun confiscation
[03:17:27.840 --> 03:17:32.000]  just like katrina and he denied he said that well no this is for training all over the world
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:36.480]  hey and we're all over the world i'm sorry we're part of the world oh yeah well that was everybody's
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:40.720]  concerned about the ndaa when they passed that they said uh we're going to allow indefinite
[03:17:40.720 --> 03:17:44.960]  detention by the military without trial and rendition and everybody said oh wait a minute
[03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:50.480]  wait a minute wait a minute we understand that you have uh given yourself supposedly uh authorization
[03:17:50.480 --> 03:17:54.720]  for use of military force worldwide that includes the united states that's why everybody is concerned
[03:17:54.720 --> 03:18:01.040]  and rightfully so about the ndaa and you can see if you look at that fort lauderdale clip i mean
[03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:05.600]  that is training that's what that looks like when they come in the middle of the night
[03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:11.440]  march people out into white vans and take them away that is the ndaa it's been a couple of years
[03:18:11.440 --> 03:18:16.160]  and so people have kind of calmed down kind of gotten used to the ndaa but they are training
[03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:22.240]  to do precisely that i don't care if they're going to do that abroad well i do care because i think
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:28.160]  that's a very bad foreign policy it's blown back on us that it has failed nevertheless as madison
[03:18:28.160 --> 03:18:33.280]  said the means of defense against foreign danger have always been the tools of tyranny at home
[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:39.760]  and now they're practicing it they're practicing it in our streets in our cities what does it take
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:43.840]  for people to wake up and see this well they're about to start using robots because the kernel
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:48.880]  also lets out uh this let's go to this second clip and he's talking about working with autonomous
[03:18:48.880 --> 03:18:53.760]  robots how they dress them up in clothes either soldiers or civilians and they see how the soldiers
[03:18:53.760 --> 03:18:58.400]  react to it that is talk about soldiers that's freaking scary in an environment where they're
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:03.440]  civilians one of the things we're looking at here at fort ap hill is a program of using
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:08.080]  autonomous robots essentially what we do is we've taken a number of robots that can operate
[03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:12.720]  independently walk up and down these streets we can dress some up in uniforms we can dress some
[03:19:12.720 --> 03:19:17.680]  up in civilians clothes and we can use that as a chance here at ap hill to train our soldiers how
[03:19:17.680 --> 03:19:23.440]  to discriminate between friendly forces forces that may be evacuated and that's just one of those
[03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:27.760]  one of those great things that we're able to do at ap hill that's a great thing now that's kind
[03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:32.400]  of scary and that's really kind of breaking news that people are they've got robots that walk around
[03:19:32.400 --> 03:19:37.280]  that look enough like humans that they're dressing them up in uh yeah autonomous robots that means
[03:19:37.280 --> 03:19:42.080]  robots with artificial intelligence yeah absolutely it's totally yeah we got to go to break we're
[03:19:42.080 --> 03:19:58.000]  going to come back we're staying here in overdrive david night and rob dude rest of the hour
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:06.160]  silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows you to generate an

[03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:18.800]  world gold council in the u.s. mint demand is at an all-time high the stage is being set for the
[03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:24.720]  reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every

[03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:18.320]  what's life like violence break the silence come crashing into my little world
[03:24:18.320 --> 03:24:30.480]  I don't think people understand how epic this is the information that we're covering right now
[03:24:30.480 --> 03:24:35.760]  this is showing you we're explaining how jade helm is applying to you how it's for domestic
[03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:39.680]  operations they keep saying it's for worldwide training they're that's why they're training
[03:24:39.680 --> 03:24:44.880]  here in the united states it's for you okay we're part of the world but it is very much focused on
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:48.960]  the things that they have domestically this ties together the dragnet surveillance uh
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:53.920]  their surveillance of all the social media this ties together the military as well and that's a
[03:24:53.920 --> 03:24:59.040]  very troubling aspect of it but it is domestic we have the us geological service there they are
[03:24:59.040 --> 03:25:05.520]  mapping humans on to the geological map and they're looking at you at the individual level
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:11.760]  every aspect of you this is where the surveillance pays off for them this is the geo int the human
[03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:16.480]  domain and when they say mastering the human domain it's a very specific term of art from
[03:25:16.480 --> 03:25:19.600]  the military and this has been an evolution it started off as we're going to get real
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:23.680]  detailed maps of everything using satellite imagery well now they have these detailed maps
[03:25:23.680 --> 03:25:27.760]  now they know who lives at what address and now they're tying that in with your facebook
[03:25:27.760 --> 03:25:31.520]  account with your twitter account with your youtube videos so they're measuring your political
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:35.680]  beliefs and they can go up and down and go well he's kind of for us this guy's against us this
[03:25:35.680 --> 03:25:39.840]  guy's pulling the party line this guy isn't we need to put him on a watch list and they're using
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:44.800]  all this for future operations and jade helm is what that is doing is getting the troops used
[03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:50.240]  to practicing here in the us and getting local officials to work with those troops that's what
[03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:54.960]  that is and so there might be three or four more jade helms before something really happens but
[03:25:54.960 --> 03:25:59.120]  they're building up these relationships this they're building an infrastructure of tyranny
[03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:03.680]  right there's a there's a legal infrastructure things like the ndaa there is a technical
[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:08.160]  infrastructure things like the capabilities to do dragnet surveillance and then of course there's
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:12.800]  going to be a military and a law enforcement infrastructure those are merging that's what
[03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:16.960]  you have to understand when they talk about the human domain when they talk about the geo
[03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:22.320]  intelligence mapping this all together they're multi-int taking all of this multiple intelligence
[03:26:22.320 --> 03:26:27.920]  sources focusing it down to the micro level they're very concerned they say in these uh
[03:26:27.920 --> 03:26:32.720]  in these presentations they're very concerned about one guy with a computer and a video camera
[03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:37.520]  because he can have worldwide impact that's why they're looking at you as an individual
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:41.840]  exactly and now i want to go to this first clip this is lieutenant colonel al d lanardo this is
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:47.920]  from the master of the human domain 2010 geo int conference and he used to run a fusion cell for us
[03:26:47.920 --> 03:26:52.880]  special forces okay so this is not some ordinary guy when they show him in his intro picture he's
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:26:58.160]  sitting there like a robot like i'm scanning the the terrain for enemies but it's mastering the human
[03:26:58.160 --> 03:27:03.920]  domain conference right okay just like that's the bottom of the jade helm logo master human domain
[03:27:03.920 --> 03:27:07.920]  so we're going to go to this first clip uh this is clip one with the colonel and this is how they
[03:27:07.920 --> 03:27:12.160]  gather data using facebook and twitter and basically they want to predict the future so here it is
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:19.040]  so i really had the privilege of uh running a more of a multi-int innovation cell the cells
[03:27:19.040 --> 03:27:27.040]  objectives were to use as much non-traditional data uh from an intel standpoint uh that means a lot
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:35.440]  of open source data to go out and do sense making of data so that not only your analysts but your
[03:27:35.440 --> 03:27:41.120]  machine learning your your algorithms you could build within would ultimately get to a predictive
[03:27:41.120 --> 03:27:47.520]  analysis cell it's very very hard to do especially if you don't have all the data basically old data
[03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:55.040]  is good data new data is good data and all data is good um i want to in the context of how i've
[03:27:55.040 --> 03:28:02.880]  used human terrain yeah somewhat controversial uh in some in some aspects is is it's it's it's
[03:28:02.880 --> 03:28:10.080]  sociocultural information and it becomes when used in in intelligence purposes or for sense making
[03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:15.520]  for operations when you bring it to to the geoant i don't i don't mean to be coy and saying that when
[03:28:15.520 --> 03:28:21.840]  you bring geoant to it uh i i think it becomes human terrain you have to reach out and have
[03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:28.800]  human terrain using um traditional not non-traditional data sets as you see there further to the right
[03:28:28.800 --> 03:28:34.160]  right there there's a multiple ways you bring in esri products in geoant you you get outputs uh
[03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:40.640]  as as you know unclassified examples there of different layers that you would you would make
[03:28:40.640 --> 03:28:45.760]  it's that open source combined with the classified information combined with the now the old and
[03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:51.520]  the now that that begins to give you the layers you can make to to make sense of what's really going on
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:56.400]  i don't know if you notice that at the end but we showed the the jade helm logo and then
[03:28:56.400 --> 03:29:00.960]  there at the mastering the human domain conference of 2010 so just think of how far they've come in
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:04.560]  five years yeah right there they were saying well you know we're trying to get this data it's a
[03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:09.920]  little hard now it's all being seen seamlessly done it's all done through cloud computing everything
[03:29:09.920 --> 03:29:13.680]  is an open book everybody's lives people are putting their lives out there on the internet
[03:29:13.680 --> 03:29:17.440]  you saw what happened with the family in kentucky they put a picture there hey here's our beautiful
[03:29:17.440 --> 03:29:22.960]  family boom instantly yes the the arm of the law comes down on them because they're not necessarily
[03:29:22.960 --> 03:29:27.760]  looking for bad guys as they say they're looking for anomalies and then once you get another microscope
[03:29:27.760 --> 03:29:33.680]  they'll decide if they like you or not okay this is not about solving a crime right this is about
[03:29:33.680 --> 03:29:38.000]  just scanning the environment seeing what we're going to uh what we're going to come up against
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:42.880]  on the battlefield exactly and the battlefield is in the united states it all ties together with
[03:29:42.880 --> 03:29:47.040]  rumsfeld's unknown unknowns we'll talk about that when we come back
[03:29:50.480 --> 03:29:57.200]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:01.840 --> 03:30:08.640]  why use dial-up when you can use broadband why travel with this when you can use this
[03:30:08.640 --> 03:30:15.280]  and why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver
[03:30:15.280 --> 03:30:20.400]  supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times

[03:33:14.880 --> 03:33:22.480]  unsought by the military industrial in dallas texas three shots were fired at president kennedy's
[03:33:22.480 --> 03:33:28.560]  motorcade in downtown dallas the first reports say that president kennedy has been seriously
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:40.080]  wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new order it was almost as if it were planned in
[03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:48.880]  favor it's just pancake either you're with us or you're with the terrorists
[03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:06.880]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not
[03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:11.520]  the hands of criminals
[03:34:15.760 --> 03:34:20.320]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in america

[03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:32.400]  just living and dying for what the central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death

[03:34:42.800 --> 03:34:48.000]  and center i'm rob do i'm got david knight riding shotgun we're co-hosting today this last hour
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:52.720]  this last hour of overdrive to bring you some really epic information showing you how they've
[03:34:52.720 --> 03:34:57.280]  been talking about mastering the human domain for years now so when they put that on the jade
[03:34:57.280 --> 03:35:03.520]  helm logo and they show the map how it's color-coded with good guys and bad guys and and hostile and
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:08.000]  friendlies they've been talking about this for a long time this is not just a one-off exercise
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:11.200]  where they're just going to you know put some troops into the woods and you know run around
[03:35:12.160 --> 03:35:15.760]  you know for a couple months it's not going to be like that but first before we get into the rest
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:21.360]  of this presentation i want to remind you that your support is what keeps us going here on the
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:24.400]  air and one way to support us is by getting appropriate water filter and that's a great
[03:35:24.400 --> 03:35:29.120]  way to support yourself i don't know if you own a water filter if you've ever filtered your water
[03:35:29.120 --> 03:35:33.840]  but if you taste the difference between filtered water and tap water it is unbelievable you will
[03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:39.040]  never go back to tap water because it tastes like dirt it tastes like chlorinated pool water
[03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:43.520]  it's disgusting and i i own one of these proprio systems i'm the biggest one i got four filters
[03:35:43.520 --> 03:35:48.640]  in it and it's emptied every day my kids drink that water and it takes out the fluoride and if
[03:35:48.640 --> 03:35:52.080]  you're not even in the city where they're fluoridating the water you still have to be concerned
[03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:56.800]  about glyphosate making its way into the aquifer so yeah it's everywhere they're saying glyphosates
[03:35:56.800 --> 03:36:00.080]  everywhere it's a hormone filters that out as well and you never know what they're gonna come down the
[03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:04.400]  line hey i take bottled water and we have bottled water leftover i dump it in there because i just
[03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:09.360]  want to get out whatever's left whatever getting into the plastic so we have a deal running now
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:14.800]  water 20 it'll get you 20 off any of the proprio stuff there we have a whole range just through
[03:36:14.800 --> 03:36:19.440]  this weekend yeah just through this weekend we got the big king they even have a little camper version
[03:36:19.440 --> 03:36:23.920]  that's got one little filter in it that you could take camping with you it's totally portable
[03:36:23.920 --> 03:36:29.600]  put that in your bug out bag even i mean just so many different ways that you can prepare for
[03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:33.600]  something that may happen you never know you never know when you're in an earthquake zone
[03:36:33.600 --> 03:36:37.520]  or a volcano erupts you know there's volcanoes we're just taking with you when you're going to
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:40.640]  a restaurant you know they're going to give you some fluoridated water there you go pull it out
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:45.280]  there show them hey you know i feel this is what i do with your water i filter it water 20 is the
[03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:50.560]  code it supports us it's a win-win-win for everybody out there and so let's get back into this i got
[03:36:50.560 --> 03:36:56.000]  another clip of this kernel talking about oh how they use the color coding system to classify
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:37:01.440]  friendlies and hostiles in a numbering system and then i showed the jade map the jade helm map
[03:37:01.440 --> 03:37:06.000]  right there that has the different colors that he talks about and again i think that map is the key
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:11.040]  thing because just like the nsa spying this went on for a very long time we had whistleblowers
[03:37:11.040 --> 03:37:15.440]  uh william benney it's about a half dozen whistleblowers from the nsa said they're violating
[03:37:15.440 --> 03:37:19.600]  the constitution they're collecting all your data that's a violation not only the constitution but the
[03:37:20.160 --> 03:37:26.080]  faiza act and nobody paying attention to them then we got the documents people saw the snowden
[03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:30.320]  slides and i think that's the thing people look at this and say wait a minute you're labeling
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:34.480]  places as hostile and they said oh it's just an exercise don't worry about it you need to understand
[03:37:34.480 --> 03:37:39.680]  when they say mastering the human domain this is about mapping everything they can collect on you
[03:37:39.680 --> 03:37:46.400]  geographically so that is just the tip of the iceberg that is just a big uh that that's just
[03:37:46.400 --> 03:37:51.280]  only part of it the detail is if you look at geo ant let's go back to there you go let's go to the
[03:37:51.280 --> 03:37:57.280]  clip so we start out with a layered group level analysis this is much like traditional all-source
[03:37:57.280 --> 03:38:03.600]  analysis uh intelligence preparation the battlefield type of things ope these days what we do is but
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:11.680]  we focus it on groups we focus it on ethnicities uh religious three percenters and we start to map
[03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:19.280]  out in color code to different locations and we might apply some basic rooting uh and and
[03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:23.920]  of transportation nodes and roots in that now it will become a base layer the second the second
[03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:30.480]  step we start doing is support level characterizations the support level characterizations we generally
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:36.880]  will make a scale uh and we'll say plus four to minus four we'll take current ops activity in a
[03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:44.000]  particular area we'll we'll we'll base it in in the case of uh you you pick a place and try and
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:51.760]  neck it down into you know uh a plus four being bad a location a minus four being a good location
[03:38:51.760 --> 03:38:57.200]  and we start to characterize the location in a color coding simple way green yellow and red
[03:38:57.200 --> 03:39:03.760]  and then we start layering that on top of the tribal aspects and we start to see very distinct
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:09.920]  patterns of you know when they say tribal i mean demographics politics support or doesn't support
[03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:17.520]  you know hostile activities in their advice vice areas that that uh are say green and and
[03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:21.600]  read the fire senate's opportunity to work with civilians and give their trust all-source
[03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:28.240]  centric approach slide but often uh up until maybe the last five or ten years in in the
[03:39:28.240 --> 03:39:36.080]  current fight we we have not really done a very good job of making uh the cultural aspects really
[03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:42.080]  relevant in everyday intelligence analysis the next step you would take is to dive into each of
[03:39:42.080 --> 03:39:49.520]  those areas and do a deep dive and start focusing on the key leaders tribal chiefs and then specific
[03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:54.800]  locations in the example i'm using mission to start to understand patterns of movement who's
[03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:59.600]  going to work with us who isn't in a multi-int focus to understand what's going on on the ground
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:04.400]  where the intelligence doing things like cross-surface analysis to understand time
[03:40:04.400 --> 03:40:11.200]  distance travel within that group and understand what's normal activity for the particular ethnic
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:16.640]  group or location of individuals within that that region and so you now know what's normal
[03:40:16.640 --> 03:40:20.560]  activity and then you can follow the activity when do the militias go out in march collective
[03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:27.440]  methods and sensors to get to uh what is not normal and what needs to be uh adjusted over time
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:34.240]  so he's talking about it from their standpoint of this is how we do it in afghanistan iraq and
[03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:39.840]  somalia and other places but as we're going to get to we're going to show you they're bringing
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:44.240]  all this back home they're working with civilian institutions they're working with law enforcement
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:49.040]  and we've got more coming so this is just the tip of the iceberg we're trying to lay out a case
[03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:53.280]  here as if you were you were in court and you were presenting evidence going look jade helms
[03:40:53.280 --> 03:40:57.680]  for the american people jade helms for the american people jade helms for the american people that was
[03:40:57.680 --> 03:41:01.920]  our opening argument and now we're going to show you how it is being used for the american people
[03:41:01.920 --> 03:41:06.480]  the means of defense abroad have always become the tools of tyranny at home that is the lesson
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:10.960]  of history that is what james madison one of our founders said listen when he's talking about the
[03:41:10.960 --> 03:41:15.680]  the activity that people are doing this is activity based intelligence this is a key part of this
[03:41:15.680 --> 03:41:22.480]  activity based intelligence a bi joins up with human domain analytics which is hda okay together
[03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:26.960]  what they're doing is they're focusing on the activity and the transactions associated with a
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:34.000]  person a population or an area of interest now rob i want to say the key a bi enablers they say
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:39.760]  this is a quote from the organization us geospatial intelligence foundation this is kind of a trade
[03:41:39.760 --> 03:41:46.400]  organization for geo and they say that at first there are searchable databases that we need to
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:52.080]  get activity based intelligence data these must include the human domain data which is frequently
[03:41:52.080 --> 03:41:58.640]  sequestered behind law enforcement or privacy rules policy must also extend to permitting the
[03:41:58.640 --> 03:42:04.400]  exploitation of the vast amount of information that is in these unclassified public areas in
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:09.200]  other words we need to change the laws we need to change the policies so that we can legally get to
[03:42:09.200 --> 03:42:12.240]  that of course they're going to do it anyway whether or not they have the legal authority to
[03:42:12.240 --> 03:42:16.000]  do it we know that the nsa always do it after the fact that's right but they're going to try to cover
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:21.920]  themselves that's why when you see these documents who are put out uh two three five years ago they've
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:25.520]  been creating that infrastructure that legal infrastructure they've been creating that technical
[03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:30.080]  infrastructure now they are physically training the boots on the ground to put all this stuff
[03:42:30.080 --> 03:42:33.840]  together see how it works out that's why you see them picking up people in fort lauderdale the middle
[03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:38.480]  of the night marching them into white vans driving them off now they also say this the rapidly
[03:42:38.480 --> 03:42:44.240]  approaching cloud architectures used by industry and government lend themselves well to storage and
[03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:49.200]  processing of immense quantities of information enabling the data in the cloud requires all
[03:42:49.200 --> 03:42:54.320]  data have associated metadata that is tagged okay what's been the big fight with the nsa
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:58.640]  metadata hey it's just metadata we can't get anything out of metadata now william benny came
[03:42:58.640 --> 03:43:03.600]  on here said metadata i can find out everything about you with metadata that's what they're saying
[03:43:03.600 --> 03:43:09.760]  with uh mastering the human domain is getting your metadata tags that is searchable and accessible
[03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:15.120]  by the analysts who can get this stuff off of the cloud off of social media and that's on the
[03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:19.680]  technical technological standpoint now i got an article here brigade homeland tour starts
[03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:24.640]  october first if you guys could go to this shot here um the third inventory divisions first brigade
[03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:30.240]  combat group has spent 35 of the last 60 months in iraq patrolling in full battle rattle helping
[03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:34.400]  to restore central services and escorting supply convoys now they're training for the same mission
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:39.120]  with a twist at home beginning october 12 for 12 months they will be under the day-to-day command
[03:43:39.120 --> 03:43:45.520]  of us army north the army service component of northern command so they're they're coming home
[03:43:45.520 --> 03:43:51.360]  to work with north com and they say at least there's going to be 750 000 troops uh that this is back
[03:43:51.360 --> 03:43:58.000]  in 2008 so boots on the ground training here in the united states now in 2010 we see that they're
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:03.040]  grabbing this data to create battlefield models and all over the world essentially now let's go
[03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:06.240]  including the united states we have included oh definitely including the united states and now
[03:44:06.240 --> 03:44:10.400]  we're going to go to this uh third clip from this conference this is the dug winestein the office of
[03:44:10.400 --> 03:44:15.760]  the undersecretary of defense as the od department of defense for intelligence and he talks about why
[03:44:15.760 --> 03:44:20.560]  it's so important that we have all this information it even makes a reference to james clapper saying
[03:44:20.560 --> 03:44:24.400]  why he thinks it's so important that we have all this information let's roll the clip winestein
[03:44:24.400 --> 03:44:29.360]  as christ mentioned earlier i'm a policy analyst in the office of the undersecretary of defense
[03:44:29.360 --> 03:44:35.040]  for intelligence socio-cultural analysis program the program was established less than just two
[03:44:35.040 --> 03:44:41.120]  years ago to provide support for an oversight of defense intelligence socio-cultural analysis
[03:44:42.960 --> 03:44:48.320]  capabilities to apply and integrate the social sciences in addressing defense intelligence
[03:44:48.320 --> 03:44:55.280]  requirements this period of low intensity conflict irregular warfare and counterinsurgency operations
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:01.120]  has greatly increased the number of requirements related to socio-cultural analysis from data
[03:45:01.120 --> 03:45:10.880]  collection models to data collection itself to taxonomies to analytic methods to processing
[03:45:10.880 --> 03:45:16.960]  exploitation and dissemination these requirements reflect the growing needs of our combatant
[03:45:16.960 --> 03:45:24.640]  commands our combat support agencies the services our national agencies our coalition partners
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:32.080]  and academia as well on just tuesday director clapper emphasized the importance of partnerships
[03:45:32.080 --> 03:45:37.360]  and information sharing and information integration within the intelligence community
[03:45:38.080 --> 03:45:40.720]  and between our second and third party partners
[03:45:40.720 --> 03:45:46.640]  enable combatant commands socio-cultural analysis cells which exist at
[03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:53.680]  five of the six geographic commands in addition to socom so that's african sentcom
[03:45:54.400 --> 03:46:01.920]  uconn paycom and south com to mature their analytic capabilities with respect to the
[03:46:01.920 --> 03:46:06.160]  requirements of their combatant commander and the joint intelligence and operation center that they
[03:46:06.160 --> 03:46:12.080]  exist within it's like watching paint dry but he's basically describing now there's one of your
[03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:17.440]  robots yeah i think it's one of the autonomous robots right there they wheel him out and let
[03:46:17.440 --> 03:46:22.640]  him disseminate the propaganda still very dangerous right so now we go a year later we
[03:46:22.640 --> 03:46:25.840]  already played this video in the last star but i want to play it again so we have all this contained
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:31.200]  in one giant capsule of truth that we can launch out of the airlock here in a second at the end
[03:46:31.200 --> 03:46:37.040]  of this hour this so this is from the opening video of their 2011 conference so a year has gone by
[03:46:37.040 --> 03:46:40.400]  since we've heard from these guys how they want to collect data how they want to classify
[03:46:40.400 --> 03:46:45.040]  people now they're really going in 2011 when we started seeing more iphones out there they
[03:46:45.040 --> 03:46:50.240]  can really grab all this data from people all this metadata the phone calls where you travel
[03:46:50.240 --> 03:46:56.000]  and turn it into a living document that can be accessed through the cloud in real time so here it is
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:05.280]  the threats that we face don't recognize boundaries whether those are physical boundaries
[03:47:05.280 --> 03:47:12.320]  or organizational boundaries or agency boundaries and every time we're inhibited in our response
[03:47:12.320 --> 03:47:17.840]  to those threats by our own boundaries we've lessened our impact just take away all our
[03:47:17.840 --> 03:47:22.160]  impact we lessen our services to those decision makers and we ultimately affect our national
[03:47:22.160 --> 03:47:27.520]  security in a negative way the consequence of everything if we don't integrate intelligence
[03:47:27.520 --> 03:47:34.320]  i believe is simply that we will miss things we won't deliver the best possible solution set
[03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:39.280]  to our mission partners whether that's the policymaker the warfighter or the first responder
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:45.760]  this type of warfare today the the types of threats that we face require rapid
[03:47:45.760 --> 03:47:52.880]  the simulation of information rapid understanding situation where this rapid decision so if without
[03:47:52.880 --> 03:47:58.720]  integrated intelligence it's like fighting with both hands tied behind your back blindfold over
[03:47:58.720 --> 03:48:05.600]  your eyes it's it's uncertainty it's core decisions it's delayed decisions it's loss of opportunity
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:12.480]  it's loss of momentum so the way you are most likely to recognize the content the substance
[03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:16.480]  the early warning the value of information and when she talks about integrating it integrates
[03:48:16.480 --> 03:48:21.200]  it's consolidating a comprehensive way that means that's all these military soldiers understand
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:26.560]  sensors and capabilities you understand collection you understand the question you understand the
[03:48:26.560 --> 03:48:32.160]  needs potential threats and you're putting that in information together in a way that the the
[03:48:32.160 --> 03:48:38.160]  sum is significantly larger more valuable more useful than the individual parts
[03:48:38.160 --> 03:48:43.920]  all right and and now i want to play this clapper clip this is back in 2007 where he's talking about
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:48.480]  how important drones are to get the big wide area of view but we need something to get the
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:52.320]  this the straw tip and we're going quick because we're about we're running out of time here so
[03:48:52.320 --> 03:48:58.400]  i want to go to this clip right now and this is james clapper from 2007 full motion video uavs and
[03:48:58.400 --> 03:49:04.320]  all that sort of thing which is uh they can't get enough of out there and we've going through a recent
[03:49:04.320 --> 03:49:10.400]  upheaval in the in the pentagon killing innocent in response to general portrays request you know
[03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:16.400]  we've got to get more out here i think it's a good thing to bear in mind though that they're great
[03:49:16.400 --> 03:49:25.920]  for the uh fix and finish piece not so great for the fine piece and so what we really need and i
[03:49:25.920 --> 03:49:31.920]  think uh general cartwright i think spoke to this uh earl when he was here is this combination
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:38.080]  of wide area surveillance which you can then use to cue the sort of soda straw focused
[03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:45.760]  collection of the of the uavs and that in turn i think is a is a commercial for a
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:50.880]  you know the proliferation of the more the more sensors the more platforms the more
[03:49:50.880 --> 03:49:56.880]  phenomenologies that we have up there the better it is and then you got yesterday fbi admits to
[03:49:56.880 --> 03:50:01.280]  flying secret surveillance flights over baltimore for days as the city rioted over the death of
[03:50:01.280 --> 03:50:05.520]  freddy gray so they're using the drone and in this case they're flying planes but it
[03:50:05.520 --> 03:50:09.520]  probably had drones up there too getting the wide angle surveillance and then they're getting
[03:50:09.520 --> 03:50:14.880]  using twitter and facebook to get those those little in-depth the personal well of course the
[03:50:14.880 --> 03:50:18.960]  problem with all that is is that these are not surgical strikes in reality even though they're
[03:50:18.960 --> 03:50:25.040]  supposed to have this omniscient omnipotent intelligence we see that there have been thousands
[03:50:25.040 --> 03:50:29.200]  of people who are innocent who've been killed in these drone strikes a lot of show many many more
[03:50:29.200 --> 03:50:33.920]  times the number of supposedly guilty individuals and how do we determine that these individuals
[03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:38.640]  are guilty that's the thing that concerns us when this is being done domestically because we have
[03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:44.560]  lost our due process we've lost the privacy about all this information they are putting this all
[03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:49.040]  together we're going to talk about the predictive aspects of this as well we're going to show you
[03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:54.400]  more clips of what mastering the human domain really means and why you should be concerned
[03:50:54.400 --> 03:50:59.600]  about the intel aspects of this so-called military operation jade helm we'll be right back

[03:54:09.680 --> 03:54:15.840]  and the recognition of the importance of the human domain and that is sophisticated understanding
[03:54:15.840 --> 03:54:24.480]  of all those things you said the tribal history language culture uh it's so significant one of
[03:54:24.480 --> 03:54:28.960]  the programs we've put into place you know and just think about this most of the u.s. army is
[03:54:28.960 --> 03:54:33.840]  coming home i mean for various reasons it said we're not for deployed not going to be easy to
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:39.120]  study the brigade home this program we have a regionally aligned forces is an intellectual
[03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:44.240]  commitment by our army that says you're a professional soldier you're likely to fight here
[03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:49.040]  you better start that understanding of the operational environment whether you take no
[03:54:49.040 --> 03:54:55.760]  intel at rest whether your entire ace or your antel analytical section is focused on uh supporting
[03:54:55.760 --> 03:55:02.000]  a specific problem set down range studying that down to individual level fidelity the opportunity
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:07.040]  the preparation of putting leaders on the ground putting great young leaders on the ground in that
[03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:12.800]  environment growing differently experiencing a lot different culture as he said identifying this
[03:55:12.800 --> 03:55:16.800]  less different barbecue that's about it some did it well some did not do it well and then
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:23.280]  building those appropriate mechanisms uh really recently aligned forces uh in the constructs that
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:30.240]  we're developing in terms of that intellectual commitment uh to mastering that is is absolutely
[03:55:30.240 --> 03:55:36.160]  essential we have lots of people who've grown up over the last 10 years who understand working in a
[03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:42.400]  with with ngo's with governmental organizations with interagency partners so what are we going to do
[03:55:42.400 --> 03:55:48.160]  now all we get to continue that all we get to continue to develop these relationships so we
[03:55:48.160 --> 03:55:53.680]  get to understand each other how to operate together uh that's a challenge we have i'm willing to
[03:55:54.480 --> 03:56:01.600]  assign military officers and nco's to these organizations oh i'm willing to do training
[03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:07.200]  with these organizations uh the challenge is going to be is it going to be reciprocal and that's
[03:56:07.200 --> 03:56:13.600]  what we have to work on because that's why i don't have to relearn this again as you said we had some
[03:56:13.600 --> 03:56:18.640]  problems not everybody got it but we have a lot of people who did and we have a lot of young officers
[03:56:18.640 --> 03:56:25.840]  and nco's who did this at a very low level and so it's incumbent on us to make sure that we don't
[03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:31.520]  lose this and that we capture this and we continue to do it in a peacetime environment when we do our
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:37.840]  exercises now and at the training centers we are including a civil military piece of it a civil
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:42.000]  piece of it the issue is how we continue to support that as we move forward and can we continue to get
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:46.480]  support there you go civilian and military working together that was from the uh association of the
[03:56:46.480 --> 03:56:50.560]  united states army panel discussing the importance of the human domain they were just discussing
[03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:55.840]  merging together and again from the very beginning this has been the nsa this has been the us geological
[03:56:55.840 --> 03:57:01.520]  service this has been law enforcement it's been military working to put together all this information
[03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:05.840]  in terms of the dragnet surveillance working with google facebook twitter you know when that you had
[03:57:05.840 --> 03:57:08.960]  the lieutenant colonel who came here and he said well you know the cultures are different people
[03:57:08.960 --> 03:57:13.360]  are like what is he talking about he's parroting back what they're talking about with this human
[03:57:13.360 --> 03:57:18.640]  domain uh analytics and it's important to understand to the predictive nature of it they're talking
[03:57:18.640 --> 03:57:24.000]  about this in the same terms as pre crime for law enforcement that's where they're drawing this from
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:27.920]  they said we're going to look at this environment of course we're not saying there's any bad guys
[03:57:27.920 --> 03:57:32.080]  or we don't know who the bad guys are we're just collecting data on everybody then we will analyze
[03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:36.720]  it we'll see what pops up and then we'll get a close inspection on them and then if you are
[03:57:36.720 --> 03:57:41.040]  either permissive or hostile when they contact you they'll know what to do and now that we've
[03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:45.760]  destroyed the economy this is going to be one of the one areas that you can get a job at predictive
[03:57:45.760 --> 03:57:51.200]  programming predictive crime working in these areas going to the doomsday disney world and working
[03:57:51.200 --> 03:57:57.040]  there i mean that's we're just basically uh going to be creating janitors to go around and clean up
[03:57:57.040 --> 03:58:00.480]  this mess that we've created well again this predictive nature whether it's law enforcement
[03:58:00.480 --> 03:58:04.720]  especially if it's the military coming into an area that's what should really concern us this
[03:58:04.720 --> 03:58:10.560]  pre crime thing where they they analyze the data and then because you stick out in some way now
[03:58:10.560 --> 03:58:16.160]  you're treated as if you've already had due process as if you've already been found guilty of a crime
[03:58:16.160 --> 03:58:20.720]  and we see how these SWAT teams breaking down the doors of innocent people people have
[03:58:20.720 --> 03:58:25.280]  small amounts of drugs that are non-violence exactly this should be very concerning when we
[03:58:25.280 --> 03:58:30.560]  see this kind of use of this dragnet surveillance well that's it for today thank you for joining
