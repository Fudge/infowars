[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:34.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.520 --> 00:40.600]  man I'm out of breath not for running down the hall but from scrambling the
[00:40.600 --> 00:45.720]  last half hour in here just trying to go through all the news that we've printed
[00:45.720 --> 00:51.520]  in research today last night and this morning it is incredible what we've got
[00:51.520 --> 00:58.040]  coming up for you here today ladies and gentlemen obviously Sibelius the head of
[00:58.040 --> 01:04.480]  Health and Human Services has resigned and in proper Orwellian fashion they
[01:04.480 --> 01:11.040]  have declared victory they have declared victory for Obamacare is why she's
[01:11.040 --> 01:17.320]  resigning the truth is is that she continues to testify that she doesn't
[01:17.320 --> 01:20.960]  know why the website's not working well it's designed to not work and to get you
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.440]  in a database waving your rights to have your bank accounts seized by the IRS
[01:25.440 --> 01:31.080]  when you don't get the healthcare period that's why they hired 17,000 agents two
[01:31.080 --> 01:37.400]  years ago gearing up for it it's all in the stinking bill but they know you
[01:37.400 --> 01:41.600]  don't read the bill just like national news been showing Russian troop buildup
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.840]  on the border with Ukraine it's now confirmed we're gonna cover that that
[01:45.840 --> 01:58.240]  it was a 2013 drill photos this is the level of just total deception by these
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.680]  people and they're doing it on purpose to where you just get acclimated to
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.640]  accepting total lies I mean look at this Obama banks on Sibelius leaving to take
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.600]  heat off party oh yeah right everyone's just gonna love $5,000
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.360]  fines and penalties and interest when the country's going bankrupt and losing
[02:15.360 --> 02:19.680]  their doctor and seeing their insurance double at least she promised to stay until
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.800]  November resigning because Obamacare has won that's a quote I'm reading from
[02:23.800 --> 02:28.280]  Drudge you actually go read the quote from weekly standard missing page of
[02:28.280 --> 02:32.360]  goodbye speech final glitch on the way out administration makes it difficult to
[02:32.360 --> 02:38.320]  cancel Obamacare plans which just hands you over to the corporations to be
[02:38.320 --> 02:40.800]  raped the same ones that wrote it here's a really big story that's so
[02:40.800 --> 02:43.720]  important we're gonna be covering bird flu close to mutating into global
[02:43.720 --> 02:48.040]  pandemic human to human transmission feared and depending on the type of
[02:48.040 --> 02:52.040]  bird flu mutation we're talking about half the people that get it dying then
[02:52.040 --> 02:54.480]  that sounds fun
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.400]  nothing wakes you up to a transmittable diseases like family members dying like
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.360]  I've had two of the last few months and don't worry they'll have some vaccine you
[03:07.360 --> 03:11.120]  can take to protect yourself and Lord knows what will be in that it just
[03:11.120 --> 03:17.240]  absolutely makes my head spin lawmakers says cattle round up reminded him of
[03:17.240 --> 03:24.880]  Tiananmen Square and that's how to CBS news we're going to have Cliven Bundy on
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.200]  in 30 minutes with David Knight with breaking news out in Nevada where the
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.160]  feds have stolen hundreds of cattle they have now tasered and attacked more
[03:34.160 --> 03:43.560]  people last night for doing nothing if you have signs they say there's no free
[03:43.560 --> 03:48.440]  speech allowed they attack you with tasers and rub your head in the ground
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.880]  and they said the pension for attacking small women again the dishonorableness is
[03:53.880 --> 04:00.200]  so ridiculous I can't even believe it but but when you look at history and you
[04:00.200 --> 04:05.520]  see footage of oppressive police you know winding women up in in in ditches
[04:05.520 --> 04:09.680]  and shooting them at Nazi Germany and in Russia in places it's actually the
[04:09.680 --> 04:17.800]  plum is to attack women for cowards for filth for scum and I just I mean the
[04:17.800 --> 04:20.920]  government's taking everything over it's illegitimate it signed us on to
[04:20.920 --> 04:25.120]  trillions in fake debt it launders the money it runs the drugs wake up it's
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.360]  not legitimate they've all got excuses of why they do it to maintain order you're
[04:30.360 --> 04:33.240]  not maintaining order senator sessions came out and told the truth and said
[04:33.240 --> 04:40.440]  quote law enforcement federally is being collapsed oh yeah the the FBI is not
[04:40.440 --> 04:42.960]  even allowed to investigate white-collar crime now and let's talk about the
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.480]  Justice Department the board patrol I was on the border was not stopping any
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.360]  illegals and just waved us through this time at the border checkpoint when I was
[04:51.360 --> 04:56.000]  at Big Bend I mean it's just wide open ladies and gentlemen because the last
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.320]  time I was there you see 50 border patrol I saw one the globalists have
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.240]  controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.200]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive all the major
[05:09.200 --> 05:14.360]  networks are state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has
[05:14.360 --> 05:18.840]  become a political weapon against the Second Amendment pushes Obamacare MSNBC
[05:18.840 --> 05:22.400]  tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our kind
[05:22.400 --> 05:26.160]  of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their
[05:26.160 --> 05:29.160]  families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more
[05:29.160 --> 05:33.680]  important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the
[05:33.680 --> 05:38.200]  true media the establishment dinosaur press is dying we are in an

[07:15.680 --> 07:20.920]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers
[07:20.920 --> 07:26.000]  to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the result
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.680]  are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had

[08:05.600 --> 08:12.840]  homeland security homeland security begins with hometown security
[08:15.040 --> 08:20.920]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make
[08:20.920 --> 08:26.640]  scarring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap
[08:26.640 --> 08:33.640]  those revisions women are still worth 10 points more than men at all age
[08:33.640 --> 08:42.120]  brackets but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a
[08:42.120 --> 08:52.160]  big 70 points the big score anyone any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100
[08:52.160 --> 09:01.480]  points as always how fast you move determines how long you live
[09:01.480 --> 09:14.160]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones and of course the
[09:14.160 --> 09:17.800]  federal government homeland security paid millions of dollars for their
[09:17.800 --> 09:23.440]  national training centers for targets of pregnant women old men and children
[09:23.440 --> 09:30.640]  we're in there no hesitation targets to learn how to shoot old men women and
[09:30.640 --> 09:38.280]  children and old ladies in bathrobes we broke that story a year ago people did
[09:38.280 --> 09:41.840]  not believe it for a full week until the company said hey it's not our fault
[09:41.840 --> 09:47.360]  homeland security paid us two million plus dollars to supply them with targets
[09:47.360 --> 09:53.360]  for their training centers nationwide and this is what they sent us DHS
[09:53.360 --> 09:58.640]  supplier provides shooting targets of American gun owners company produces
[09:58.640 --> 10:02.320]  cardboard cutouts of non-traditional threats post quote pregnant women
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.960]  elderly and children so now death rates 2000 from the 70s a true classic with
[10:07.960 --> 10:15.160]  David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone becomes reality ladies and gentlemen I
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.240]  want to talk to John Bell before I get into all the news I literally had that
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.120]  feeling of deja vu and twilight zone is that you get every once in a while in
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.520]  the control room during the last break because it was just hitting me that it's
[10:28.520 --> 10:32.360]  just all out in the open now cancer viruses in the vaccines world government
[10:32.360 --> 10:36.160]  the government funding al-Qaeda the government attacking men women and
[10:36.160 --> 10:40.360]  children the government attacking women from behind and body slamming them day
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.560]  after day out here trying to start a fight and a shootout in Nevada here's a
[10:45.560 --> 10:50.480]  CBS headline tea party lawmaker Nevada cattle roundup reminded me of Tiananmen
[10:50.480 --> 10:55.840]  Square Democrat commissioner says better have body bags for supporters of
[10:55.840 --> 11:03.400]  Bundy and and I mean this is insane so this is the idea John Brown you had
[11:03.400 --> 11:07.200]  some really good points on this about how it's just now totally naked what's
[11:07.200 --> 11:10.800]  going on well my main point is that back when I was cutting government
[11:10.800 --> 11:16.560]  propaganda for the local news I listened to you religiously and I would have to
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.480]  go research what you're telling me even though I'm surrounded by news and now
[11:21.480 --> 11:25.080]  you come to work every day I come here to work every day and it's like we're
[11:25.080 --> 11:30.680]  holding on to this raging bison of tyranny you know it we can barely hold
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.040]  on we can barely even cover all the stories and it's all completely out in
[11:35.040 --> 11:44.240]  the open and completely insane it just gets crazier by the millisecond where
[11:44.240 --> 11:50.960]  are we going next it's all coming to a head thank you John it is like downhill
[11:50.960 --> 11:56.600]  skiing and it's just edgier seat insanity I mean let me just tell you
[11:56.600 --> 12:00.000]  what's in the news today okay let me just try to control myself and not dive
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.000]  into the first item I hit Sibelius has resigned from HHS insanely Eric Holder
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.520]  has come out and said it's basically racism that people are treating him
[12:11.520 --> 12:16.800]  with quote disrespect when he's ignored congressional subpoenas for four years
[12:16.800 --> 12:21.080]  and he says no attorney generals ever been treated like this I could dig up
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.800]  three today when I saw this clip in a few minutes online in the last hundred
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.400]  years that served prison time the last one was John in Menchel served 19 months
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.480]  and died in prison due to his involvement in the Watergate affair he was
[12:35.480 --> 12:40.560]  sentenced to prison in 1977 serving 19 months I mean I've got the attorney
[12:40.560 --> 12:43.160]  general saying that never happened of course this guy says why does the snow
[12:43.160 --> 12:49.680]  reflect as bald as a cue ball and as goofy looking as a rattlesnake the point
[12:49.680 --> 12:55.960]  is that that's all they've got now is race card you don't like Obamacare
[12:55.960 --> 12:59.240]  raping the daylights out of you your racist don't want to turn your guns in
[12:59.240 --> 13:03.480]  your KKK Aaron says or you don't like Obamacare your your racist Hank Aaron
[13:03.480 --> 13:09.160]  says Hank Aaron it's it's racist if I don't like Obamacare written by foreign
[13:09.160 --> 13:15.880]  banks I mean that's all these people have got is a religion of racial division
[13:15.880 --> 13:21.280]  being sold by the Democratic Party the party of the KKK who now has this line
[13:21.280 --> 13:28.760]  that if you're in the NRA you're the KKK the NRA was started against the
[13:28.760 --> 13:37.480]  freaking AKK KKK I mean it is just so absolutely frustrating how ignorant the
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.680]  public is and when you're informed you watch these liars up there flipping
[13:41.680 --> 13:47.080]  reality on its head in a giant con game and I've had enough of it
[13:47.080 --> 13:52.000]  Jacarie Jackson had passes to go to the presidential civil rights thing that
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.640]  Obama was promoting I mean Obama involved in the civil rights summit is a
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.920]  sick joke while they're butchering the entire bill of rights of Constitution
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.880]  right now and the Secret Service said well you know what you got to press
[14:02.880 --> 14:09.640]  past the event but we're not gonna let you in did your car run around and say
[14:09.640 --> 14:11.880]  I'm black that's why they didn't let me in no that's not why they didn't let me
[14:11.880 --> 14:15.480]  man because what's in his brain it's because what he stands for is why he
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.640]  wouldn't let in something with Kit Daniels was he not letting us he was
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.520]  white no it was because Kit Daniels is a patriot we're gonna play that we're
[14:24.520 --> 14:28.680]  showing video the Secret Service right there I mean this is all a totally sick
[14:28.680 --> 14:34.200]  joke the Secret Service knows full well that info wars he's not a physical
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.360]  threat to that criminal Obama we want him to serve a long prison term the last
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.800]  thing we want is for him to get killed the globalist might kill him to make
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.160]  him a martyr that's the only one of the only things they've got that's a
[14:46.160 --> 14:52.520]  possibility I believe we want Obama to be taken very well care of the last thing
[14:52.520 --> 14:59.040]  I want is a hair on his little chinny chin chin to be hurt we don't want one
[14:59.040 --> 15:02.840]  of his butt hairs to be hurt or the dingleberries the dangle they're from
[15:02.840 --> 15:08.400]  alright I'm sorry I shouldn't have gone off and made a joke I apologize it's just
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.160]  that it's we all know he has an official grim of the stool that takes care of
[15:13.160 --> 15:17.600]  that part the point is so does the Queen of England actually the president does
[15:17.600 --> 15:23.040]  have a toilet they ship around with him because they're afraid foreign
[15:23.040 --> 15:26.800]  agencies might get in the hotel room next door something and pipe in and get
[15:26.800 --> 15:30.640]  it I'm not getting folks to type into the search engine presidents carry toilet
[15:30.640 --> 15:37.560]  with them and I'm not joking okay I'm gonna stop right there see I said I
[15:37.560 --> 15:39.840]  cover a bunch of news okay I've covered like three of the things civilians
[15:39.840 --> 15:44.840]  resigns holder says it's racist if you don't worship him as God on earth and
[15:44.840 --> 15:47.680]  they're against his criminal activities the fast and furious you name it
[15:47.680 --> 15:52.560]  senator sessions gave a five-minute incredibly powerful speech where he
[15:52.560 --> 15:56.600]  said that the president is in a deliberate plan to collapse US law
[15:56.600 --> 16:01.480]  enforcement system on the border absolutely as much as I didn't like
[16:01.480 --> 16:05.200]  being harassed by border patrol down at the border actually once I got there and
[16:05.200 --> 16:13.880]  saw one over three days I was like oh my god we're wide open it's true and that's
[16:13.880 --> 16:18.600]  being reported everywhere wide open ladies and gentlemen but when you go
[16:18.600 --> 16:21.720]  flying an airplane from say Dallas to Denver you're gonna be harassed and ask
[16:21.720 --> 16:25.640]  questions internal checkpoints there's an up internal TSA checkpoints on the
[16:25.640 --> 16:30.040]  highways everywhere and it was creepy to be down there and never see border
[16:30.040 --> 16:36.480]  patrol until I go to the border patrol checkpoint and one guy walks out and just
[16:36.480 --> 16:41.760]  waves us through and I was like hey I wanted to bitch and complain about being
[16:41.760 --> 16:45.840]  a citizen being harassed what and I realized oh my goodness there's no
[16:45.840 --> 16:53.480]  border I mean whoa was that a wake-up call I was like where's the border patrol
[16:53.480 --> 17:00.480]  where are they went all over the place no one zero zero zero zero zero and it's
[17:00.480 --> 17:03.600]  being reported all over they got the board patrol a hundred miles in pulling
[17:03.600 --> 17:09.440]  citizens over and beating them up that's coming out in the news under orders you
[17:09.440 --> 17:12.120]  got another border patrol being shot at hitting the head with rocks and acts of
[17:12.120 --> 17:17.600]  love I mean this country is being collapsed on every front right now we
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.520]  got that coming up we got Clive and Bundy exclusive out there joining us you
[17:23.520 --> 17:29.200]  know you know I love Fox News I really do we broke this story nationally a few
[17:29.200 --> 17:32.640]  weeks ago Drudge put it out internationally and then everybody
[17:32.640 --> 17:36.600]  Fox went back picked it up and then we're out there and Fox News shows up
[17:36.600 --> 17:41.640]  and goes we have the filming rights on the Bundy ranch you can't be here we're
[17:41.640 --> 17:45.280]  like we're not gonna argue with you mr. Bunny just drive five minutes off the
[17:45.280 --> 17:47.640]  edge of your ranch and let Fox News claim they control everything because
[17:47.640 --> 17:50.640]  they're there just basically calling the shots people go well it is Fox News but
[17:50.640 --> 17:54.880]  I do what they say I mean what a joke Fox News biggest shows have three and a
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.600]  half million viewers I have that many listeners a day but there's the pump and
[17:58.600 --> 18:02.240]  the circumstance and the sponsorship that's why I built a big studio we're
[18:02.240 --> 18:05.200]  getting ready to use that looks like a Fox News studio at that point I'm like
[18:05.200 --> 18:09.520]  okay I'm better than you Fox because that's all it comes to is how how fancy
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.720]  your suit is in fact I think I'm gonna go ahead and go out and buy $3,000 suits
[18:13.720 --> 18:16.880]  and go ahead and get the perfect tie and go ahead and get a woman to put makeup
[18:16.880 --> 18:19.600]  on me every day I mean I'm already starting to do it you want me to do that
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.280]  I will do it all okay if it means I can save this country I won't come in here
[18:24.280 --> 18:28.200]  wearing a t-shirt anymore how's that sound I'll go ahead and suit up do the
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.360]  whole tie how's that sound and the photo matters I'll land in a private jet with
[18:33.360 --> 18:36.840]  news media there if that is people to listen no I'm not gonna do that the point
[18:36.840 --> 18:44.720]  is is that we're in a war folks and the good news is Boehner on top of sessions
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.280]  coming out and saying we're seeing a deliberate criminal takeover and two
[18:47.280 --> 18:51.000]  Texas Congress been saying it earlier in the week now the Domino's are falling
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.880]  the the the dam has broken the train has left the station Humpy Dumpty has fallen
[18:55.880 --> 18:59.560]  and all the propaganda and all the race card baiting can't put it back together
[18:59.560 --> 19:07.840]  again now Boehner John Boehner has come out and said we are seeing basically
[19:07.840 --> 19:11.920]  criminal activity and criminal stonewalling in the IRS criminal activity
[19:11.920 --> 19:16.440]  yeah that's hardcore Soviet style political persecution and I'm telling
[19:16.440 --> 19:23.800]  you if Holder doesn't go to jail like John in Mitchell and many others I can
[19:23.800 --> 19:29.960]  say I thought about this what we know Holder's done is 50 times Nixon you know
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.440]  what John in Mitchell did he obstructed congressional investigations and
[19:34.440 --> 19:44.240]  reportedly knew about 120 names in a file of people's IRS records 19 19 months
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.400]  in jail for that look at Holder man he is committing every crime under the sun
[19:49.400 --> 19:53.240]  publicly and when you say something about it he says watch it buddy you don't
[19:53.240 --> 19:57.080]  want to go there I'll play the race card oh please don't throw me in that briar

[23:09.600 --> 23:16.120]  next 9-11 I've just posted a video at www.next911exposed2.com that not only

[23:28.920 --> 23:32.040]  swipe trillions off markets and retirement accounts everywhere and
[23:32.040 --> 23:36.480]  destroy the way of life of millions of unprepared Americans but it will also
[23:36.480 --> 23:40.400]  trigger what promises to be the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our
[23:40.400 --> 23:44.880]  nation but you only have a few weeks left to take all the necessary steps to

[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  before it's too late
[24:15.240 --> 24:20.720]  the Dow Jones industrial average is in the toilet today down 82 points so far
[24:20.720 --> 24:32.880]  S&P down 7.57 Nasdaq down right now 18.41 and we've got Mark Fauber and
[24:32.880 --> 24:38.560]  others basically saying that the market is waking up to how clueless the Fed is
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.680]  with its QE unlimited well they're gonna try to bring in a giant inflationary
[24:42.680 --> 24:48.920]  implosion deflationary implosion to cover up the inflationary implosion so
[24:48.920 --> 24:53.920]  they're totally rigging the entire market globally with supercomputers but
[24:53.920 --> 24:58.120]  the Chinese continue to buy so much gold along the Indians that they can't
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.840]  artificially suppress that commodity as well as oil so it's all going to hell
[25:02.840 --> 25:07.320]  in a handbasket basically they're trying to create it just a depression to cover
[25:07.320 --> 25:12.680]  up the hyperinflation and it's not gonna work that's what most top economists
[25:12.680 --> 25:15.840]  are saying and the stuff economists we were having on five years ago saying
[25:15.840 --> 25:22.640]  this now that's mainstream news so that's another big story we're following
[25:22.640 --> 25:28.320]  Wells Fargo profit rises 14% though because Warren Buffett's an insider and
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.080]  controls the insider trading systems and also that endless money that comes up
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.240]  through Mexico that's laundered in Wells Fargo as part of public record but
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.960]  cops are going to pull me over and ask if I have drugs right next to a Wells
[25:40.960 --> 25:45.080]  Fargo bank that I can pull up Bloomberg talking about hundreds of billions of
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.080]  year in laundered cash and nobody gets in trouble hey cop why don't you go and
[25:50.080 --> 25:54.040]  let's go Wells Fargo oh that's the FBI does that mr. Jones mind if we search
[25:54.040 --> 26:00.560]  your car I mean it's just it's all a total fraud hoax what a joke I break
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.080]  with the hoax I don't live in the hoax I I don't live in the fantasy land where
[26:05.080 --> 26:13.320]  I'm racist if I don't worship Eric Holder Eric Holder when I look at Eric
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.000]  Holder I don't see a black guy doesn't even really look like he's black people I
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.640]  know it looks like a white guy I might be 10% black the point is I see a
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.560]  sniveling crook but then when all his crimes come out in Congress finally
[26:28.560 --> 26:32.040]  starts calling him out for being a criminal and saying you're in contempt
[26:32.040 --> 26:37.240]  of a federal subpoena you know you should go to jail and you did fast and
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.600]  furious it got caught lying and you did Selendra and you're involved as a lawyer
[26:40.600 --> 26:43.440]  with all these big banks and you're involved in all this corruption you're
[26:43.440 --> 26:46.120]  involved persecuting all these conservative and libertarian and
[26:46.120 --> 26:51.880]  Christian groups with the IRS and putting people in jail you're a crook and
[26:51.880 --> 27:00.920]  his answer is oh you're racist just like Hank Aaron says that you're a racist if
[27:00.920 --> 27:04.200]  you don't like Obamacare really I just thought I didn't want to lay off some of
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.880]  my crew I thought I didn't want to go bankrupt I thought it was really a bad
[27:07.880 --> 27:11.200]  deal I should pay the bill here is Eric Holder we're gonna play this clip of
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.920]  Eric Holder saying attacks against him or ugly and divisive and saying and he
[27:16.920 --> 27:21.960]  points at himself and he says you know this isn't this isn't about me it's
[27:21.960 --> 27:25.800]  basically about race is what he's saying and that no attorney generals ever
[27:25.800 --> 27:31.560]  been treated like this really in 1977 John and Mitchell Nixon's attorney general
[27:31.560 --> 27:39.360]  went to prison for 19 months and died in prison for obstructing justice and
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.960]  covering up for Nixon I mean this is nothing compared to what Holder did and
[27:43.960 --> 27:48.000]  let me tell you John and Mitchell should go to jail because when you are the head
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.400]  law enforcement judicial officer and you're involved in anything you should
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.760]  go to jail but oh he's like I am the attorney general everyone's laughing and
[27:58.760 --> 28:02.920]  gasping like I am God it's like Nixon said well it's not illegal when the
[28:02.920 --> 28:08.160]  president does it yeah it is Nixon and it's illegal when Eric Holder does it
[28:08.160 --> 28:12.640]  when Obama said our military's under NATO command he has the authority to do
[28:12.640 --> 28:15.080]  whatever he wants without Congress because NATO gives him the authority I
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.560]  mean that's worse than a dictator at least to be an American dictator he's
[28:18.560 --> 28:25.320]  saying I get my orders from a foreign power and the UN remember that I mean
[28:25.320 --> 28:29.840]  this is all twilight zone level this is all ridiculous and if they get away with
[28:29.840 --> 28:33.160]  the skies the limit so here's Holder saying no attorney general who have been
[28:33.160 --> 28:35.760]  treated like this knowing the general public doesn't know how many attorney
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.400]  generals have gone to jail or been indicted or had to step down or been
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.640]  died mysteriously in office to cover stuff up let's go to the clip I'm pleased to
[28:44.640 --> 28:49.400]  know that the last five years have been defined by significant strides and by
[28:49.400 --> 28:57.160]  lasting reforms even in the face even in the face of unprecedented unwarranted
[28:57.160 --> 29:07.000]  ugly and divisive adversity if you don't believe that you look at the way and
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.040]  forget about me forget about me you look at the way the Attorney General of
[29:11.040 --> 29:15.040]  the United States was treated yesterday by a House committee had nothing to do
[29:15.040 --> 29:18.360]  with me forget that what Attorney General has ever had to deal with that
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.400]  kind of treat I can pull up John and Mitchell being grilled 10 times that what
[29:22.400 --> 29:29.400]  president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment are you kidding what
[29:29.400 --> 29:33.280]  what president so the whole implication is they're black just there's no end of
[29:33.280 --> 29:36.800]  this now you see the genius of the globalist putting Obama in as their
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.760]  closing pitcher because they're gonna go for the Hail Mary take down the whole
[29:41.760 --> 29:47.080]  country with a couple black guys at the head of it hoping that no one will stop
[29:47.080 --> 29:51.320]  them because they're black frontmen I mean this is genius we're on the march the
[29:51.320 --> 29:55.960]  empires on the ranchers coming up breaking news on the standoff in Nevada radio

[33:48.560 --> 33:54.160]  standoff in Nevada the feds are calling in an emergency at BLM action in
[33:54.160 --> 33:58.960]  Nevada is unconstitutional hurt memo breaks down a report on section 8
[33:58.960 --> 34:02.800]  clause 17 of the Constitution on article 1 we've also got county
[34:02.800 --> 34:07.200]  commissioner says Bundy supporters better have funeral plans that's a
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.280]  Democrat in response to people who've had 140 plus years of the grazing rights
[34:12.280 --> 34:16.080]  to the property they just tell them the answer is death you know the answer is
[34:16.080 --> 34:20.400]  they better be ready to die meanwhile Republican commissioners and the state
[34:20.400 --> 34:23.760]  legislators are calling it the new Tiananmen Square they attack more people
[34:23.760 --> 34:28.440]  yesterday more attacks more tasers more women attacked that's just some of the
[34:28.440 --> 34:33.360]  news a BLM feds assault more protesters his first amendment area taken down
[34:33.360 --> 34:38.080]  that's all up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the right hand side
[34:38.080 --> 34:45.440]  of drudge also is covering it in great detail and I'm told a bunch of our
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.600]  militia has shown up and I'm all for the militia and I'm sure this is probably a
[34:49.600 --> 34:54.920]  nice militia I have been made aware of some folks in and around the area that
[34:54.920 --> 35:01.840]  have been well identified previously as troublesome and I would just say that
[35:01.840 --> 35:05.760]  just because someone says they're in the militia is not necessarily mean that
[35:05.760 --> 35:09.040]  it's not a federal provocateur arm and again I'm not talking about any
[35:09.040 --> 35:12.840]  specific players here I'm just saying that if I was the feds I would insert
[35:12.840 --> 35:19.280]  provocateurs into it as propaganda to then be able to demonize the larger
[35:19.280 --> 35:24.080]  land rights movement and I'm not saying that's happening here but certainly
[35:24.080 --> 35:32.720]  folks need to be watchful for those type of activities but several militias have
[35:32.720 --> 35:37.400]  have shown up in the area and I'm sure they're great I support the militia under
[35:37.400 --> 35:42.480]  the second amendment the people to be armed and I think folks that you know go
[35:42.480 --> 35:46.160]  there for self-defense should be armed I do not think that anyone should start
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.800]  something offensively with the BLM when they taser women when they body slam
[35:51.800 --> 35:57.000]  women when they attack people for the first amendment they lose and Congress
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.680]  Senate the state is all turning against the feds right now and quite frankly
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.920]  people follow Mahatma Gandhi we would hope that the BLM would actually club
[36:06.920 --> 36:11.040]  people in the head on camera and that would destroy them and reverse their
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.440]  entire land grab movement if a firefight breaks out well then that might be the
[36:16.440 --> 36:21.040]  shot heard around the world and we're into the Civil War Obama wants to play
[36:21.040 --> 36:24.800]  Lincoln and the guy on the White Horse saving everybody and then they're gonna
[36:24.800 --> 36:28.480]  start race wars and all their forms of division this country I want to avert
[36:28.480 --> 36:33.520]  that folks home last curries lined up for a race war lined up for a takeover the
[36:33.520 --> 36:36.640]  whole pumps primed so the Attorney General could commit any crime he wants
[36:36.640 --> 36:40.360]  and if you criticize him you're racist as we just played earlier now we're joined
[36:40.360 --> 36:43.480]  for the next 10 minutes so I'll get into all the huge news from senator
[36:43.480 --> 36:49.240]  sessions and other civilians resigning there from the town and in the county
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.800]  bordering Arizona they're in Nevada here CBS news expect to see a band of
[36:54.800 --> 36:59.600]  soldiers militia members arrive at Nevada Ranch County Commissioner says
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.360]  bunny supporters better have funeral plans militias mobilizing to support in
[37:04.360 --> 37:08.680]  battle Clark County rancher in class with federal rangers and again if they're
[37:08.680 --> 37:11.960]  real militia which I bet they are that they're heroes I just hope they conduct
[37:11.960 --> 37:16.800]  themselves like the men at Munker Hill okay don't fire first but if they mean
[37:16.800 --> 37:23.680]  to have a war then it'll start here if that's the way it is that's the way it
[37:23.680 --> 37:30.680]  is but I just don't want to see us pull the trigger first let's go now to
[37:30.680 --> 37:36.160]  Cliven Bundy sir thank you for talking to us under your relaying messages to
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.280]  him there get an update for him what he thinks about the militias new attacks on
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.920]  citizens is Cliven Bundy concerned about physical clashes and then I want him to
[37:44.920 --> 37:48.640]  have the floor to talk about any new developments mr. Bundy Alex wants to
[37:48.640 --> 37:52.040]  know if you're concerned about militias here and any clashes what's your
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.720]  attitude about people showing up here I'm not concerned about people showing up
[37:56.720 --> 38:01.400]  here I actually welcome we need numbers we need to we need people of America to
[38:01.400 --> 38:06.960]  show up here and exercise their rights I am not telling anybody to come and I'm
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.560]  not telling anybody anything what they're supposed to do except the
[38:10.560 --> 38:15.160]  governor and the sheriff of Clark County I'll tell them what they ought to be
[38:15.160 --> 38:20.280]  doing what would you tell them to do well I tell the governor I'd say hey you
[38:20.280 --> 38:25.160]  backed up Nevada law and you take care of your brand inspector department of
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.760]  agriculture they're supposed to be protected my property not destroying
[38:28.760 --> 38:35.320]  them not signing my name on the bottom of brand certificates and and you have
[38:35.320 --> 38:38.520]  recovered a couple more ahead of cattle today haven't you some people from out
[38:38.520 --> 38:42.200]  of state came in and got some back for you didn't yes we got a cowboys they
[38:42.200 --> 38:45.320]  here on the ranch and they're ranching they're putting cattle in here we're
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.960]  working on branding them and doing what we normally do we'll win some cattle and
[38:49.960 --> 38:53.560]  probably sell some cattle and then we're going to continue to have a ranch
[38:53.560 --> 38:59.200]  operation going on then the rest of you can join in and enjoy it and I think
[38:59.200 --> 39:03.280]  that's one of the key things isn't it is that you're concerned that they sheriff
[39:03.280 --> 39:07.840]  as well as the governor are not doing what they could do to de-escalate this
[39:07.840 --> 39:12.080]  and to really do their jobs to enforce the law they have the law enforcement
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.240]  authority here not the BLM I've never seen the BLM even on any ballots to to
[39:17.240 --> 39:21.920]  see if I agree with any of their policies you know the Constitution is a
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.760]  supreme law of the land if you read this Constitution they don't say anything
[39:25.760 --> 39:31.040]  about United States Army being here dealing with my private property or
[39:31.040 --> 39:35.600]  your citizen rights and access to your public lands if I was the governor in
[39:35.600 --> 39:39.520]  the United States or not the governor of St. Nevada tell these people get out of
[39:39.520 --> 39:44.120]  my state get your army out of my state you have no jurisdiction authority here
[39:44.120 --> 39:47.720]  that's right and there's nothing in the Constitution either about a dangerous
[39:47.720 --> 39:51.360]  species essentially the 10th Amendment says if they don't specifically mention
[39:51.360 --> 39:54.360]  it then the authority the federal government doesn't have authority to do
[39:54.360 --> 39:58.320]  that if people want to do something about endangered species that really
[39:58.320 --> 40:01.520]  should happen at the state or local level shouldn't well it should be we're
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.120]  we're our custom culture our lifestyle is here but you know how the United
[40:06.120 --> 40:09.280]  States get involved with a dangerous species through the treaty acts with
[40:09.280 --> 40:15.360]  other countries and this tortoise was bought and out of a pet store in Las
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.000]  Vegas it would probably come under the Endangered Species Act in other words
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.160]  is a commerce between two countries but what about this desert tortoise that
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.920]  never crossed into Mexico or even crossed the state line it's here in
[40:26.920 --> 40:32.560]  Nevada been here in Nevada the Endangered Species Act does not
[40:32.560 --> 40:40.520]  involve and don't qualify sure yes go ahead Alex I know just ask the rancher
[40:40.520 --> 40:45.720]  at the center of this we just joined us out in Nevada Mr. Bundy ask him to recap
[40:45.720 --> 40:48.920]  what's happened as we talked to him yesterday more videos more assaults you
[40:48.920 --> 40:54.120]  guys got video with that more feds arriving the feds have now brought more
[40:54.120 --> 41:00.520]  BLM out of Arizona and calling in an emergency David get him to give us a
[41:00.520 --> 41:05.280]  report on the latest developments we hear reports that they brought in more BLM
[41:05.280 --> 41:09.720]  out of Arizona calling an emergency last night we had a couple of people get
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.160]  tasered and beat up and detained for a while and then and then released what
[41:14.160 --> 41:18.560]  have you heard about what's going on today well I know BLM had a gathering of
[41:18.560 --> 41:23.680]  my cattle with the helicopters and armed forces around the Lake Mead area I had
[41:23.680 --> 41:27.360]  some cattle on the west side of Lake Mead and they were gathered those cattle
[41:27.360 --> 41:30.800]  the protesters went down while I was trying to load those cattle and
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.240]  protested evidently there was I don't know what really happened but there was
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.440]  at least three people arrested and I don't know what happened those people
[41:40.440 --> 41:42.840]  whether they're in their jails or whether they turn them this I don't know
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.480]  well we went down there were three people together they essentially detained
[41:47.480 --> 41:50.400]  they didn't officially arrest two of them for quite some time but they roughed
[41:50.400 --> 41:54.000]  them up pretty good by the feds acting more imperious and and arrogant
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.040]  aggressive now or if they back down I mean what what is your sense
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.760]  what is the bearing up getting more aggressive or backing down or stay in
[42:02.760 --> 42:08.720]  saying well I can tell you they back down around this protest area and around
[42:08.720 --> 42:14.320]  the ranch headquarters I don't see their presence their snipers and suffer off
[42:14.320 --> 42:18.800]  the hills or can they still have surveillance cameras out I know that
[42:18.800 --> 42:24.040]  so our presence around here we the people have come and pro the protesters
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.800]  they have really made me feel a lot better about America right here but
[42:28.800 --> 42:32.840]  they're still doing their dirty work and distance part places on my ranks like
[42:32.840 --> 42:37.840]  yesterday there's around a long Lake Mead area overton beach they were still
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.160]  taking my cattle and when the protesters found that out they moved into that area
[42:42.160 --> 42:46.280]  and of course some got hassled we got some pictures yesterday from one of your
[42:46.280 --> 42:51.360]  sons I was here and as I came in he had some pictures of us some snipers I
[42:51.360 --> 42:54.440]  think somewhere where was that taken those snipers have been all the way
[42:54.440 --> 42:58.080]  around the ranch I don't know for sure exactly what pictures but I have seen
[42:58.080 --> 43:02.000]  pictures where they we see the snipers on top of the hills that's when they
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.680]  assaulted his son is when he got the photos of the paramilitary forces
[43:05.680 --> 43:10.160]  waging war on us yeah everybody has has had that and when we're down just at the
[43:10.160 --> 43:13.520]  protest area they had some very close boots and they said they had some guys
[43:13.520 --> 43:17.160]  training rifles on them from up there just at that short range but I haven't
[43:17.160 --> 43:20.480]  seen any since I've been here because the demonstrators are pretty much scared
[43:20.480 --> 43:23.800]  of my law that's right I get to talk about what the legislators said when
[43:23.800 --> 43:29.260]  he's done I'm sorry go ahead Alex no no just just questions asking about the
[43:29.260 --> 43:32.680]  legislators what he thought about what they said what he thinks about us
[43:32.680 --> 43:36.000]  senators and people saying this looks like tyranny looks like Tiananmen Square
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.840]  you know get him to talk about that and then them destroying the water pipes and
[43:40.840 --> 43:44.920]  hundred-year-old water cisterns that the cows and wildlife are living out there
[43:44.920 --> 43:49.600]  that humans have improved Alex want me to ask you about the encounter last night
[43:49.600 --> 43:53.320]  with a couple of state legislature's legislators that got kind of contentious
[43:53.320 --> 43:58.600]  what do you think about their approach so far and also about these water
[43:58.600 --> 44:03.480]  cisterns and that they destroyed the other night well the politicians you
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.120]  know what can you say about them I didn't really get involved I stayed away
[44:07.120 --> 44:15.480]  because I on purpose you know that these kept these protesters were getting
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.960]  arrested at the same time the politicians were talking and my advice and
[44:19.960 --> 44:25.000]  this is what I said to my sons and everything I said one hell don't they
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.840]  go down there and take care of this problem then come back and tell us
[44:27.840 --> 44:31.600]  that's right and anyway that wasn't what happened they was making a lot of noise
[44:31.600 --> 44:35.080]  and I was I actually left and didn't really keep up with what went on there
[44:35.080 --> 44:38.560]  but that was my thing why don't you go solve this problem then come back and
[44:38.560 --> 44:42.280]  preach to us that's what I said I said on there yesterday he didn't hear me but
[44:42.280 --> 44:45.360]  you're asking the question I said if I was the politicians I would become
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.600]  statesman they should have marched down and said we're the state stop what you're
[44:49.600 --> 44:53.280]  doing let them have their grazing rights you're a fraud they'd be super stars
[44:53.280 --> 44:58.240]  these politicians have no instincts yes absolutely Alex is saying they ought to
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.240]  march down and demand that they stop doing what they're doing they're telling
[45:02.240 --> 45:05.080]  us that they don't have any authority to do that but they do have the moral
[45:05.080 --> 45:08.360]  authority they do have a soapbox to stand up for your right state authority
[45:08.360 --> 45:13.600]  they have a state authority well surely guys 40 are we in a sovereign state in
[45:13.600 --> 45:18.160]  Nevada these are elected officials are wanting to be elected officials and they
[45:18.160 --> 45:23.480]  do have authority our governor has authority to tell BLM and federal government
[45:23.480 --> 45:28.440]  you have no jurisdiction authority you get out of here and our county government
[45:28.440 --> 45:34.360]  isn't the county sheriff isn't his responsibility to protect us from people
[45:34.360 --> 45:40.560]  like that abuse that's been going on with these these citizens yeah that's his
[45:40.560 --> 45:44.600]  job he's the job what about those cattle of their steel never private property
[45:44.600 --> 45:50.480]  my property by the heck don't he arrest those wrestlers I so what I asked the
[45:50.480 --> 45:54.200]  lady who is there she kind of took the the approach that well we just want to
[45:54.200 --> 45:56.280]  deescalate this and make sure that nothing happens like well you're
[45:56.280 --> 45:59.240]  talking to the wrong people there the people here are not starting anything
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.400]  as the people who are throwing ladies to the ground grabbing them from behind and
[46:03.400 --> 46:07.040]  I said you know at what point does it stop you know are they allowed to rape
[46:07.040 --> 46:12.560]  people if they have the right uniform on and this is what's the sheriff supposed
[46:12.560 --> 46:17.480]  to do I mean isn't his job to protect our lives never didn't property is in his
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.520]  job to keep peace here well in fairness the governor has come out and slammed it
[46:21.520 --> 46:26.680]  and said it was illegal I mean these people are thieves yes go ahead Alex
[46:26.680 --> 46:29.840]  well no the governor has now come out and said that he slammed it and said
[46:29.840 --> 46:32.520]  it's criminal we just showed the headline so the governor is now saying
[46:32.520 --> 46:35.880]  it's criminal what did the governor say I haven't seen that headline what the
[46:35.880 --> 46:39.040]  governor say is criminal and he came out and slammed it and said that they
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.760]  shouldn't be seizing his cattle oh good the governor has now said that they
[46:43.760 --> 46:47.880]  should not be seizing or cattle that that's criminal well I'm good I'm happy
[46:47.880 --> 46:53.560]  that I the governor got to start standing up and acting like he's a governor
[46:53.560 --> 46:59.360]  of the sovereign state in Nevada if he said that's I'm happy okay I want him
[46:59.360 --> 47:02.440]  to be able to make any final points he wants to make but my final question is
[47:02.440 --> 47:08.600]  if we see him assaulting people every day every evening it seems is he
[47:08.600 --> 47:12.160]  concerned they're going to do it more and that they may push the wrong person
[47:12.160 --> 47:16.040]  Alex has one final question you want to know are you concerned that there's
[47:16.040 --> 47:19.240]  going to be more violence that is going to escalate since we see them
[47:19.240 --> 47:22.520]  continuing to do what they're doing even after they said that they were not
[47:22.520 --> 47:25.800]  going to have limit the First Amendment to an area they seem to they still
[47:25.800 --> 47:29.520]  attack those to those fellows last night yeah that was quite interesting the
[47:29.520 --> 47:32.960]  the governor did make a stand the other day and told him to take down the First
[47:32.960 --> 47:37.760]  Amendment area signs I noticed they didn't go down and they are still
[47:37.760 --> 47:43.160]  aggressive trying to get my cattle so at this point I would say the BLM is
[47:43.160 --> 47:49.640]  aggressive and continuing their what they think is their job to take me out of
[47:49.640 --> 47:54.200]  business and the bad part of their taking all of our rights and liberties
[47:54.200 --> 48:00.080]  here this is a battle for liberty and justice not justice or liberty and
[48:00.080 --> 48:05.280]  freedom that's right any any final words that you would like to we'll give you the
[48:05.280 --> 48:07.600]  last word as you want to go out is there anything else you want to say
[48:07.600 --> 48:12.040]  about property rights clarify the fact that if they take your grazing rights
[48:12.040 --> 48:15.560]  or water rights they can take anybody's property rights yeah that's true and you
[48:15.560 --> 48:20.280]  know my last word to be this morning at the day starting out let's go and fight
[48:20.280 --> 48:26.280]  for America to fight for our freedom fight for our Constitution and that's
[48:26.280 --> 48:32.160]  governor and sheriff get some guts and come with us as citizens and let's whip
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.040]  this battle it's a battle for our freedoms and liberty across the United
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.680]  States and I'm I want to thank the for all the prayers and all of the thoughts
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.840]  I'm really grateful for that and it is helping thank you well thank you mr.
[48:47.840 --> 48:50.840]  Bundy we really appreciate you taking a stand now tell mr. Bundy thank you from
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.920]  Alex and Alex says thank you thank you very much all right David not we're
[48:55.920 --> 48:59.320]  going out to break them to come back and hit other news but Congress Boehner and
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.280]  others are starting to say that the administration is criminal and that the
[49:03.280 --> 49:07.520]  attorney general's criminal and their folks are starting to resign and this
[49:07.520 --> 49:11.640]  could really grow because they've done a lot more than Nixon ever did I think
[49:11.640 --> 49:16.280]  it's time to go ahead and move to indict just like John and Mitchell Eric
[49:16.280 --> 49:21.840]  Holder oh clearly it is he's been caught doing all of the things that Nixon did
[49:21.840 --> 49:24.720]  but to a far greater extent if you remember the articles of impeachment one
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.840]  of them was using the IRS against his political enemies another one was
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.480]  stonewalling Congress refusing to provide them documents this has been going on
[49:33.480 --> 49:38.200]  for a long time and so we we have to ask how long do we allow the federal
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.120]  government to break the laws before we have anybody stand up and do anything
[49:42.120 --> 49:47.320]  about it exactly and the country is on the verge of collapse cattle ranching
[49:47.320 --> 49:50.200]  is being announced is collapsing all over the country because they fix the
[49:50.200 --> 49:54.040]  markets and harassing small operators I mean we are seeing a criminal mafia
[49:54.040 --> 49:57.400]  takeover the criminal instinct doesn't want to see any of us operating on our
[49:57.400 --> 50:02.000]  own it does it wants us under a big box store controlled by an offshore bank we
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.520]  are conquered by foreign banks not by Russians but by foreign banks we are
[50:06.520 --> 50:13.240]  that's talk about and everybody you may not have a ranch you may not have a
[50:13.240 --> 50:18.200]  business you just may have a car in a home and guess what that property is
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.440]  registered in your state your county that's what your tax Travis County is
[50:22.440 --> 50:27.240]  trying to charge people I know who bought $3,000 old truck they're trying to
[50:27.240 --> 50:31.480]  charge them more in taxes than the bill of sale and what Kelly Blue Book says
[50:31.480 --> 50:36.040]  it's worth yeah yeah I mean I mean that's an example the power to tax is the
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.600]  power to destroy but at least at the state level where this is all registered
[50:40.600 --> 50:45.840]  we have the right to we have the option to theoretically elect somebody else the

[55:54.360 --> 55:58.440]  stop the enemy and we need your support we don't get taxpayer money like NPR MS

[56:21.880 --> 56:27.400]  evil so people can't understand it or caught off guard but once we click it's
[56:27.400 --> 56:34.840]  over now let's go to senator Sessions land it out since the president took
[56:34.840 --> 56:41.440]  office interior removals have been cut nearly in half they've dropped by 44
[56:41.440 --> 56:49.360]  percent more than half of the ice removals since 2009 are the border
[56:49.360 --> 56:56.040]  apprehensions where they just caught him at the border and send them back these
[56:56.040 --> 57:03.320]  are not interior deportations as the statistics used to be focused on more
[57:03.320 --> 57:09.400]  than half or two-thirds of all ice removals last year were border
[57:09.400 --> 57:15.200]  apprehensions so now I said a half early it's really two-thirds of the numbers
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.320]  that they're counting as deportations and removals are really border
[57:20.320 --> 57:26.320]  deportations that weren't previously counted as such 94% of the people
[57:26.320 --> 57:31.880]  removed last year get this were either apprehended at the border which is not
[57:31.880 --> 57:38.920]  a true deportation or were convicted of a crime while in the United States you
[57:38.920 --> 57:43.440]  hear that colleagues 94% of the people that were removed were either people
[57:43.440 --> 57:48.680]  captured at the border or had committed a serious crime and most of the rest
[57:48.680 --> 57:54.120]  were repeat violators or fugitives that had been out on a rest in a fugitive
[57:54.120 --> 58:03.560]  warrant so 99.9% of the 12 million illegal immigrants and visa overstays
[58:03.560 --> 58:10.320]  without known crimes on their record including those fleeing from authorities
[58:10.320 --> 58:16.200]  did not face removal last year the former ICE director John Sandwood said
[58:16.200 --> 58:25.800]  recently if you are a run of the mill immigrant here illegally your odds of
[58:25.800 --> 58:33.640]  getting deported are close to zero it's just not going to happen now folks we're
[58:33.640 --> 58:36.400]  gonna come back with in the next hour where he says it's a deliberate

[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.400]  Square that CBS news family says to KSL wake up America they're taking
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.520]  everything from us it's they have the grazing rights in 1877 militia members
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.400]  arrive we're not afraid to shoot that's the Washington Times I mean this could
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.960]  really blow up big time senator session says there's a deliberate plan for the
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.920]  president to collapse law enforcement systems I was playing part of senator
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:18.680]  sessions powerful speech we're going to go back to that right now and then we
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:25.720]  have a guest who's coming up you hear that colleagues 94% of the people that
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.760]  were removed were either people captured at the border or had committed a serious
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.440]  crime and most of the rest were repeat violators or fugitives that had been out
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:45.400]  of arrest in a fugitive warrant so 99.9% of the 12 million illegal immigrants
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:52.760]  and visa overstays without known crimes on their record including those fleeing
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:58.480]  from authorities did not face removal last year the former ICE director John
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:07.600]  Sandwood said recently if you are a run of the mill immigrant here illegally
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:15.760]  your odds of getting deported are close to zero it's just not going to happen now
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.600]  that's the truth I was a federal prosecutor I know how the system works
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.400]  I've worked with ICE officers and Border Patrol officers and prosecuted their
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:30.160]  cases this is what the reality is if an individual has false documents which is
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.840]  a felony for American citizens that doesn't count as deportable crime it's
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.640]  only a drug dealing or a crime of violence or are some robbery that under
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:49.200]  the policies that we're carrying out so it just goes to show that our law
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.840]  enforcement system is in a state of collapse it's a deliberate plan by the
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.560]  president of the United States and it's wrong and people need to be aware of it
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.160]  and need to stand up to it and I think the American people are beginning to do
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.320]  so what have I been saying like a broken record the last few years as I've
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:13.080]  studied tyranny historically I have studied how these systems operate
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.600]  tyrants test you and see what they get away with and bureaucracies do as well
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:24.800]  just like kids you know bad kid or an abuser it's the same MO and if they can
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.600]  get away with anything they will do it and there's no country in the world
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.160]  that has totally open borders we basically have wide open borders now you
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.600]  have to commit an aggravated felony to be deported out of this country now an
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.400]  aggravated felony if a citizen gets caught filling out a gun form wrong and
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.920]  doesn't dot an I they charge you with a felony literally and if you criticize
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.440]  all this you're called a racist if you don't like the attorney general who's
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.360]  in control of all this allowing this to happen you're a racist if you don't like
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.480]  Obamacare you're racist don't return your guns in your racist don't want to pay
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.080]  for all the illegals you're a racist the globalists are just bringing in the
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.080]  foreign groups to vote to take our guns they're giving them drivers license
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.600]  everything but here's the attorney general he says it's all because we're
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.440]  racist here it is please to note that the last five years have been defined by
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.720]  significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face even in the
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:32.200]  face of unprecedented unwarranted ugly and divisive adversity if you don't
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:38.360]  believe that it's a wallace away and forget about me forget about me you look
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.000]  at the way the Attorney General of the United States was treated yesterday by a

[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:33.120]  Clive and Bundy on at the center of what the feds call an emergency in Nevada
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:39.720]  bordering Arizona where for 140 plus years of 50 plus families there mainly
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:45.720]  Mormons ran cattle on the desert now all sorts of oil and stuff's been
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.840]  discovered there for folks that don't understand property rights you don't
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:54.760]  just have to own property back in the old days open rangers you know if somebody
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.840]  didn't want to quote own the land they would just run cattle across it but by
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.960]  doing that and exercising and in building the water tanks and tanks over
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:09.440]  the last 144 years that you then get open range use of it you get the grazing
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.000]  rights the water rights the the forage rights you do it really being there a
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.080]  year if nobody challenges your claim then it goes to state court they're
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.840]  certified at the state feds tried to buy the land from them 10 years ago again
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:24.160]  four years ago they bought out or harassed most the other ranchers into
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.560]  selling their rights they got them to sell their rights the state and the feds
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.560]  did this is all on record and the general public just as much will be
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.680]  speaking Martian telling people this it's just like a lot of people own a
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:44.180]  ranch but they their granddaddy some of our ranch you know we've sold mineral
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:49.320]  rights to I've seen documents where some of the mineral rights were sold 80
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:54.680]  something years ago by my great great grandfather you know stuff like that and
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.040]  then my dad goes through the records and shows that oh but they didn't have all
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.680]  this land that's ours and so they've you know been doing stuff over here with
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:07.120]  mineral rights leasing it other companies and really that's our money then
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.560]  you go get land lawyers to go in and dig into all of it because they know you're
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.880]  ignorant about it okay believe me I know about this stuff not at a lawyer level
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.320]  not a land lawyer level but more than even most lawyers who don't study land
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.400]  patent and all this and the government is run by foreign corporations under Bill
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.160]  Clinton executive order with UNESCO I had a whole film about it in 1997 America
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.120]  destroyed by design and all over the country they're kicking people off the
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:37.800]  land they're kicking people off the land that they own that borders state and
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:44.040]  national parks or that is encapsulated by it they will block your access on a
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:50.160]  road to it and then basically take it by adverse possession the feds are well
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.360]  you can't do that if you already had a continuous use on a road that is
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.840]  advertised as a public right away well what the BLM will do is they'll just go
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.240]  in with bulldozers and put rocks in there and back hose and they will
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.640]  basically spike the road and then when you try to drive around it they'll
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.600]  write you a ticket saying oh that's no longer a road nowhere in common law go
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.840]  read English common law US common law they've had this in Britain where people
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.360]  build a golf course across a common law a walking path whatever they have to
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.080]  open it back up it's the same thing here and Britain's actually been upholding
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.040]  that because the Brits walk so much and the Scots and the Irish walk so much
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:34.560]  here that's not the case and people just don't know and it's very very
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:40.160]  frustrating to know about this and to see Clive and Bundy up there going hey I
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:47.240]  know my rights and to go look at the state case the governor said now no he
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:51.440]  had grazing rights has had it before he was born and the feds are doing is
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:59.480]  illegal and and and is in criminal and is wrong that's CBS news so it's just
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.880]  like when the state of Texas unanimously voted in the house to arrest TSA when
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.000]  they pat your genitals and I've had prosecutors from San Francisco on saying
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.600]  if we see someone touch somebody's genitals and non-emergency nonprobable
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:19.120]  cause situation we're gonna arrest them for assault sexual assault and you
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.040]  notice that happened in much other counties suddenly the TSA in groping
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.960]  as many genitals that they've stopped at most airports because we pushed back
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:32.800]  folks we said no so Forbes reported TSA threatens to cancel all flights out of
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.800]  Texas of groping bill passed then the lieutenant governor and others killed it
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:43.240]  and Rick Perry killed it in the Senate even though they had the votes because
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.600]  they've threatened to put F-16s in the air they didn't just threaten to cancel
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.760]  flights they said we will stop air traffic we will embargo we will blockade
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:58.840]  the state of Texas that's how the civil war started I'm gonna say that again
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.000]  state of Texas said you're not gonna touch people's genitals and we're gonna
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.800]  instruct the police in those airports not to do it that's common sense normal
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.520]  sanity unanimous vote the police don't want to do it the TSA's responded by
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.480]  saying we want to make our people armed now well then you're gonna have to get
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.080]  bonded officers they want to pass a lot of say no we can just give guns and
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.920]  whatever to our own goon squad no training no bond we're talking a week
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.640]  long course and now that's a really great idea that's a really great idea is
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:39.840]  to arm the TSA a bunch of mentally ill people who want to randomly sit around
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.960]  naked body radiation scanners all day getting cancer I'm not saying all of
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.480]  them are bad a lot of them have told me their listeners just want a job as the
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.720]  supervisors that like to grow people and I know that's true but this is the most
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.800]  dangerous group to give a uniform and a gun to because they go on these wild
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.200]  power trips statistically the safest thing as a citizen now I'm gonna shut
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.840]  up for now I've always wanted to get him on because you know he just kept saying
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.880]  there'd be major earth changes we're gonna see massive earthquake increases
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.720]  and you can look on his website stand out comedy has a what USGS graph I saw
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:18.000]  today if you scroll down that shows all the increased earthquakes a scroll down
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.760]  some more there it is right there see that white graph massive ring of fire
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.480]  increase massive shrinking and rising in different areas and the giant massive
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:32.320]  super volcano caldera out west he talks a lot about that and I'm you know I hear
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.320]  him on coast to coast ago you know he sounds credible but come on you know how
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.880]  does he know in the next few years is all gonna happen while it's starting to
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.560]  happen and he is background is in computer programming marine architecture
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:49.040]  advanced propulsion engineering and biblical studies earthquake forecasting
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.200]  he says he's held at the above top secret security clearance that worked
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:58.680]  undercover for the FBI as part of an exclusive black project and he joins us
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.120]  now just to give us his take on the whole world and what's going on in it and
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.320]  and and where he thinks we're going stand thanks for coming on with us thank
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.800]  you for having me Alex good to talk to our fellow Texan even though I'm in
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:17.560]  Colorado where do you want to start first in this crazy world well I suppose
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.400]  you started off with earthquakes there are several major curves or threat curves
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.480]  I call them to the people of earth geophysical changes of the you know
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.280]  geological changes astronomical changes political changes you know a
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.880]  real threat of war all these factors are playing heavily upon people's minds
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.240]  today the earthquake thing I used to be able to predict them fairly accurately
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:49.600]  between 70 and 90 percent on a given week using data from the US naval
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:55.440]  facility at Fenmoc over in Monterey California they monitored very subtle
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:59.800]  changes in the electric fields of the ocean and the air above the ocean plus
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:06.280]  the sea surface temperature variation and this allowed me to look at water
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:13.600]  coastlines all along the plate tectonic borders and I determined back in 1996 when
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.440]  I started doing this that you could see changes in the water surface temperature
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.480]  because of the electron flow over that area in the air and it would make like a
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.160]  little butterfly yellow and blue wing type signature over where an earthquake
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.040]  was going to happen and I perfected that technique over the years until 2005 when
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:40.160]  the Fenmoc facility the Navy put up a new consolation of satellites and new
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:46.840]  programs on a new cray computer and they did not allow me to then access the
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:52.440]  files I had before to generate these reports strange enough they were I was
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.200]  accurate enough that the Association of Island States or Island countries if you
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.400]  wish asked me to explain how to use it so that they could use it to to predict
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.840]  tsunamis on these small by the way I mean when I go to the beach or I'm going
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.080]  deep-sea fishing I would go look at the wave buoys wind systems with no one
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.840]  others I'm noticing now more and more of that is restricted to the public and so
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.320]  I'm seeing a tightening down on what was public data with all these systems you
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.400]  know not just at the scientific level you're at but just in my use of it yeah
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:30.160]  well it it is kind of predictable when you get a totalitarian government and
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:37.440]  that's what we've got the some of the information from like Yellowstone Park
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.840]  where we have the Yellowstone Caldera since I think it was about February of
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:48.720]  last year the government made all of the USGS employees truck drivers moving
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.040]  equipment in and out of the sensor range is there everybody signed non-disclosure
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:59.480]  agreements with the government facing penalties of you know cash fines and
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.960]  also imprisonment if they told what they're doing there in Yellowstone and
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:11.200]  we had a geologist break silence I won't name him but anyway they have been
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.880]  running huge like high-volume internet lines from their sensors all over the
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:21.320]  Yellowstone Park area down into Texas I think they may be now switching it over
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:27.160]  to the NSA facility in Utah well I heard you three years ago on coast to coast
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.880]  saying that Yellowstone was becoming active again when nobody else was
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.480]  saying it now this year it's all over the news they're saying it's due to erupt
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.120]  Associated Press Reuters but they say you know that could be in the next thousand
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.080]  years because they say it happens every few hundred thousand how do they know
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.200]  they've been proven to to show longer periods of meteor strikes tsunamis
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.600]  earthquakes ring-of-fire activity it isn't the hundreds of thousands or
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.280]  millions it looks like it happens a lot more often correct sir well degrees of
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:01.760]  eruption yes for to have one of those catastrophic super volcanic eruptions
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.120]  maybe you know several hundred thousand years between times but what they're
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.180]  doing now is they're measuring the increased appearance of helium an
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:15.160]  isotope of helium gas which was buried way down deep underneath Yellowstone
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.800]  and when that starts to release it means that there's geological activity down
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:26.000]  there in a deeper pool of magma which they have recently discovered and then
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.320]  they measure hydrogen sulfide gas and carbon dioxide gas emissions at the
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.840]  surface as well all those factors tell us especially the rotten eggs fell from
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:39.520]  sulfide gas when the magma is moving close to the surface but these deep
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.560]  movements in the the deep structures underneath there are a worry because that
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.440]  indicates a massive sure well you're the first guy ever heard warn of it so I
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.040]  want to hear what you say you think's going on from all the data they certainly
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.440]  are being secretive and a lot of wildlife has been moving out of the area

[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.480]  want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.080]  Patriots supply. Several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.200]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.320]  charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:22.520]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born. My Patriots supply has never taken
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:26.800]  a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.240]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women it is rare to find
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.840]  companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.720]  high-quality storeable foods for my Patriots supply go to mypatriotsupply.com

[01:23:54.400 --> 01:24:00.800]  someone who shares your values mypatriotsupply.com slash Alex
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.160]  I want to be clear
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.800]  I'm not saying that the super volcano is gonna blow up at Yellowstone this year
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.800]  next year 10 years from now but from satellite they now know if you look at
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:25.760]  Shoemaker Levy the comet that broke into a bunch of pieces decades ago and hit
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.720]  Jupiter blowing holes in the gas giant bigger than Earth scientists had thought
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.920]  that you know super collisions happened every 50 million years now they went oh
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.840]  actually we think it happens every few thousand and now they know from radio
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.640]  telescopes such as rocks and asteroids and comets all over the place and now
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.600]  they can look from satellite and see the Earth's more pot marked in the moon
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:53.320]  these things that we think are probably hitting every few hundred years and
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.960]  stuff that knocked out the dinosaurs is hitting you know every few million or
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.120]  whatever who knows the point is the geological records more sped up I
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:05.640]  mean geological the planetary record and then you got these volcanoes you got
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:09.960]  all the ancients reporting you know it being dark for a year and and most
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.280]  people dying and it being freezing and people go that's just ancient sand
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.800]  script that's a bunch of made-up stuff you know floods all this now we know the
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.840]  geological system isn't what the mainline preachers say trying to interpret
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.680]  the Bible it's not what the mainline scientists say standios our guests you
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.920]  agree with that kind of dead reckoning statement I made and getting back into
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.760]  the supervolcano you're the first guy heard you know I said years ago decades
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.360]  ago talking about 15 years ago or more with Art Bell and people but then I
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.080]  heard the last three years saying it's active becoming more active again and
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:46.400]  now it's mainstream news that's rising and lowering and their concern but don't
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:51.440]  worry or or do worry what's the bottom line well the bottom line is we're
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.000]  going to see trouble with Yellowstone and we're gonna see trouble with Lake
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.080]  Taupo caldera down in North Island New Zealand both of those are under severe
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.640]  stress from different types of tectonic plate movement but they are both
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:11.760]  supervolcanoes and Lake Taupo erupted last in 87 AD it sent up so much
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.000]  ash it from the southern hemisphere that the Chinese astronomers of that time
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.520]  recorded three days of darkness after the eruption down there now USGS has
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.920]  been told not to panic people because it hurts real estate values in the economy
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:30.960]  if it gets too serious but people who read between the lines will see that
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.520]  we're being warned by USGS by drills and just kind of subtle warnings in the
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.440]  newspaper in California that earthquake activity and hints some
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.160]  volcanic activity is somewhat imminent and they're trying to get people to
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:49.080]  gradually readjust their circumstance without causing a panic mind you with
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.280]  all the illegals and in California I guess it you know if that fell into the
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:58.400]  sea it wouldn't be a great loss but still you got to give them a chance so I
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.040]  mean what are the technicals then on Yellowstone why are they so concerned
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.400]  well it's because the event or the new plasma pool they found deep down has
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.440]  opened up a vent to the northwest heading toward Mount St. Helens direction
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:19.320]  this one is a very deep vent because when the Fukushima earthquake occurred on
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.880]  that day I was watching the seismic helicopters at Yellowstone and one of
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.240]  them the northwest corner picked up and rang like a bell before the normal
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.160]  shockwave could have even reached the United States and that means to me that
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.880]  there is a direct like hydrodynamic connection in the plasma or sorry in the
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.840]  magma between Yellowstone and the western side of the North Pacific this
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:49.520]  is what they're watching because it will be a prelude to new Madrid it'd be a
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.200]  plate prelude to a number of other volcanoes and breaking up of the west
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:58.040]  coast so the Yellowstone caldera is kind of a new kind of instrument in
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.200]  addition to being a threat standouts our guests again I'm Alex challenge
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.120]  just tuned in I want to show you a USGS I know you know it blast prediction path
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:14.240]  from the eruption date they claim 2.1 million 1.3 in the last one 640,000
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.400]  years ago so I guess they're saying every million years or so on average
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:27.040]  million is to 800,000 I guess you average it we're talking lava and ash hitting as
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:34.600]  far east as as Louisiana and Arkansas and Tennessee as far north as into
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:39.640]  Canada and going into California major hot ash I guess would kill everybody
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:46.000]  blasting out from Yellowstone Plateau into Oklahoma where do they get these
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.400]  numbers the last one being 640,000 years well they look at the carbon dating
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.640]  and various other gas components of crystallized glass that was in the ash
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.680]  that was thrown out is there any mega volcano that a super volcano this big
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.360]  that's known because I've looked at the other ones that I don't look like they're
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:09.520]  this big well the the Lake Taupo eruption was pretty massive it it was
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:14.360]  huge it fell into the the ocean a lot of the ash and stuff which which super
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:20.840]  volcano is the biggest how many are there well hmm good question there there's
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:27.360]  there's one that submerged there's the Lake Taupo there's Yellowstone there
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.640]  might be one other one I think probably four would be my account of the ones we
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:34.720]  need to consider it's not very lucky to have it right in the middle of the US
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:39.080]  no and it makes you wonder about the the drills that the government's been
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.320]  running along the new Madrid along Mississippi well explain to us the big

[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.960]  to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.520]  most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.680]  their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well

[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:20.480]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones at the time of the season for the
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:32.080]  super volcanoes to be right in this time give it to me easy let me try with
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:44.720]  pleasure here is from the army times April 28th 1997 at a conference on
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.880]  terrorism weapons of mass destruction and strategy University of Georgia
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:55.160]  by the Secretary of Defense William Cohen reading this on air out of the army
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:59.360]  times when it came out others are engaging even in an eco type of
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.120]  terrorism whereby they can alter the climate set off earthquakes volcanoes
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.280]  remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves that is the and
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.400]  you can click on the site being there three that's army times you can see
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:17.320]  where it's cited there Federation of American scientists addressed by US
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:22.240]  Secretary of State is that source but I read it directly out of the army times
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:28.400]  when I saw it there's a devastating tsunami bomb that was in the New Zealand
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.320]  Herald that the US tested and a live science reporter on the tectonic weapon
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:39.040]  to hit Haiti the thing is see when you're informed this stuff's all admitted
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.480]  but in the general public still doesn't know that spider guts have been around
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.480]  for 20 years or that you can buy a glow-in-the-dark dog for $4,000 from
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.880]  China 15 years ago I could have a glow-in-the-dark rhesus monkey for
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.480]  $15,000 last time I saw the price that I could buy out of New York that was
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:02.040]  brought in from Hong Kong I could have in studio a glowing monkey that's part
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.840]  jellyfish and the general public just is still thinking they're living in
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.480]  Kansas and you're not folks you're not in Kansas anymore and this is the stuff
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.960]  we know about Stan Dayo is our guest we're gonna go right back to him in a
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.680]  moment I want to get his take on that and more on where we're going what the
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.040]  big threats are than geopolitically and talk about the work he's doing over
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:27.080]  stando.com but first off just don't forget we are listener supported we
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.680]  don't we're not taxpayer funded with stimulus money like MSNBC year 400
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:34.720]  500 million a year depending on the year like NPR we're funded by the high

[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:14.400]  normally 205 no one has anything like this the filters are of a leading
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.200]  competitor or a hundred dollars and don't even do what this does okay they're
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:24.680]  extremely competitive we have the best deals on pro pure 2.0 systems all of it

[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.920]  off I haven't plugged it it'll probably sell out in one day they've got a
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.160]  certain amount in the warehouse I don't even know why they're offering this they
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.480]  have a big shipment coming in but there's no point would sell out in a month
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.480]  anyways the point we already had the lowest price this is this is a great
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.920]  deal and it helps fund our operation and the pro pure manufacturers here in the

[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.840]  forever and I mean with these headlines holder snaps cruise holder should be
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.480]  impeached for defying Congress and the rule of law other congressman calling a
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.660]  criminal say should be in jail employees at Dallas Iris off war pro
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:39:00.480]  bomb stickers buttons and t-shirts as a jihad brigade 44 percent twitter
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:05.680]  accounts I've never since we has interesting story you've got a boner a
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.920]  banner coming out saying there's a criminal cover-up you've got senator
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:14.400]  session saying there's a criminal collapse of America going on it's all
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.640]  happening stand a I'm ranting I want you to get into real threats back in the
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.600]  supervolcano but you've talked a lot about this and and and this criminal
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.320]  system most people as you know in government in corporations are not bad
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.560]  they love their kids too but tyranny always has this leg up that people can't
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.040]  believe it's happening in their time and so it gets a jump on people during the
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.120]  headlights I think the sleeping giant is starting to wake up I'm concerned the
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:42.640]  power structure may stage false flags as a pretext to try to get our confidence
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.600]  again or a war but I don't even think that's gonna work where do you think is
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:52.040]  a really guy that's tuned in where do you think we are historically and then I
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.240]  want to get back in the supervolcano and Cohen's quote well at the moment
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.040]  politically I think the United States is in serious serious trouble of breaking
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:05.080]  out into open anarchy this deal with Clive and Bundy is kind of the tip of
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:12.320]  the spear a number of you know people that see visions and biblical scholars
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.120]  have said that the United States doesn't have a position in the final world
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:20.560]  government and I think that's probably because the United States as a political
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:24.560]  entity will be destroyed from thin and perhaps it'll help from outside from the
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:29.560]  Chinese and the Russians the the latest thing that I saw this morning on the
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:35.600]  web page that Holly prepares for us the news page she found an article talking
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.560]  about Obama's administration trying to get rid of the electrical college
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:44.160]  electrical college and go to a popular vote which it in essence absolutely just
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.920]  turn control over to this administration do anything they want that's what the
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.360]  illegals are for absolutely everybody's getting a hand out and depending on it
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.480]  from the government will vote keep the government there and these are not always
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:04.720]  the most wise people to have that vote anyway I mean it certainly disadvantages
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.320]  those of here those of us in the western states who have smaller
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.440]  populations but did you're dead meat you're dead meat the welfare crowd the
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.160]  corporate people will literally vote to put you in slave wagons I mean I mean
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:19.240]  if you're in a democracy it's two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.400]  there's there's two things if the government wants to take us over with
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.400]  martial law and that kind of stuff they can do it if we don't resist if we do
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.200]  resist then they can do it with a vengeance because they'll be depending
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:36.280]  themselves so either way we're headed for an enslavement which will bring
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:40.080]  chaos into the country because there will be a number of us that will resist
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.480]  that and Hitler proved you can't force people to accept you know a tyrannical
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:50.360]  order they will have underground movements and like the French resistance
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.760]  they'll destroy that order so we are looking at a time of chaos approaching
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.080]  right now and with the weakening of the US stock market the US dollar I mean
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:04.120]  rapidly we could see an economic collapse of the dollar and hence the rest
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.960]  of the world following suit and rearranging their dependence and the
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.040]  way they write contracts what kind of currency to me this means that we are
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.280]  holding our breath this year that we're going to see a very destabilized US this
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:24.720]  year in my opinion simply incredible and that's what a lot of the experts are
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.800]  saying and we're already seeing in the stock market today going wild and in the
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:34.000]  lies coming out of Obama and and holders saying no attorney general's ever
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.400]  gotten in trouble when a bunch of them have gone to prison the last one John
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:43.040]  in Mitchell for 19 months died in prison for doing mild stuff compared to what
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.400]  a holder is doing I'm concerned about a false flag well that would be certainly
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.480]  on the cards it with the false flag it would enable them to put troops everywhere
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:57.040]  put martial law and put curfews out and limit what you can take out of the bank
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:03.120]  you know all those kind of draconian measures can be justified in a time of
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:08.520]  crisis especially an alleged terrorist attack on one or more U.S. cities
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.720]  cities and targets like you know I'm more and more I agree with you I'm more
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.360]  and more just ask do I evacuate the US but it's a world government there's no
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:21.360]  word to run but at the same time I see people waking up so fast and I have hope
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.040]  that people in the power structure don't really want to get rid of their own
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.560]  checks and balances so a tiny elite can run things I mean it's so bad to do what
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:33.680]  we're doing for ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent of
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:39.000]  people historically a tyranny will even destroy emperors I mean it's just a
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.880]  tyranny stinks what why would the elite want to bring this in I think at the
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:49.440]  moment that the United States is a pain in the backside of the New World Order
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.480]  that a lot of the elitists are not in the United States that's right where as
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:58.400]  you know and they need to to take us out as a military power whether we would do
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.960]  what they want or not they need to weaken us to the point that they won't the
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:05.800]  United States won't interfere with Middle East operations and operations in
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:09.160]  Australia and various other countries that the elitists want to do they want
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.000]  to take us down to remove us as a threat Russia and China know that we could
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.760]  probably our military guys could probably break with the Pentagon or with
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:21.320]  the White House anyway and make counterattacks in event of a nuclear
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.560]  war starting so they have to to neutralize our military and our will to
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.920]  fight that's why they're shutting the power plants down the beef production the
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.760]  manufacturing everything's being cut right now it is it is a military
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.640]  operation against us yes absolutely and when they hit the internet and our
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:41.520]  phones and credit card sense things like that with various worms and the
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.160]  megabanks working with all these other crime syndicates you can really see it
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.120]  they want this country totally got it yeah and well when Holly and I were
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.040]  guests of the Hopi Indians at the Shungopi tried second Mesa their
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:59.080]  prophecy keepers told us that the America will have a multi-faceted a
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.440]  multi-sided civil war very shortly and you know black against white Puerto
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:09.160]  Rican against black whatever Muslims against Christians and Jews and you know
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.600]  extreme right extreme left poor rich all these kind of different directions will
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.880]  tear America apart once the economy starts to fail and America will
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:23.320]  eventually be invaded according to the Hopi prophecies and you know a lot of
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:29.440]  what they say makes sense to me well I mean you can just look at what's going
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.160]  on and how they're race baiting everything they're really trying to
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:37.960]  vulcanize the country and set it up for race war well certainly and there's
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.120]  certainly enough weapons and ammunition and stuff around do that they've pushed
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.400]  every button from the White House that pushed every button they could to bring
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:51.040]  America into civil disorder and collapse the economy or I don't think of they've
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:56.960]  left anything undone or unplanned to tear this country apart they couldn't have
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.120]  done it better if they planned openly to destroy us incredible stand out getting
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:06.760]  back into the supervolcanoes how did you first start warning of the super
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.760]  volcano that now mainline scientists are saying is becoming active and could
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:16.360]  erupt at any time I mean how how did you first get into that and what else you
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:19.320]  concern with with the ring of fire becoming very active all these
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:25.760]  earthquakes we've seen how much of it increased the last few months well when
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.680]  you say the last few months it are you talking about actual earthquakes or
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.560]  damage from Earthquakes just all of us look at the graphs they're all off the
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:39.040]  chart from the USGS well that graph is showing of course deadly and destructive
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:42.880]  earthquakes you know how many people got killed or whatever and and the damage
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.360]  from them when you look at the actual earthquake plots they are not quite as
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:51.440]  dramatic but they do increase over the year 2000 that looks like a tenfold
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.440]  increase in death and destruction from when I see the last hundred years what
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:59.000]  yeah and what that means is is that these earthquakes are occurring in
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.040]  populated places all over the world in diverse places and that brings up the
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:08.000]  Cohen quote which is which is about it the Secretary of Defense saying that
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.960]  there's people that have earthquake weapons well yeah I mean that's we've
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.120]  known that for a while I mean Russia and the United States signed their first
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:24.360]  weather war treaty you know or geologic treaty in 1977 so since 1977 it has
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.040]  kind of been a matter of public record that this kind of nonsense has been
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:31.960]  going on bunker buster bombs at the right place nuclear detonations at the
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:36.680]  right place can cause earthquakes that are already formed and ready to happen
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:42.600]  to go ahead and trigger you know yeah the the Cohen quote could be well
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:49.280]  applicable now I I'm looking at earthquakes at the moment on my earthquake
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:55.920]  map I've got on that show images page on our website it's so for people that
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.600]  are following it's down the third row down the middle where it shows earthquakes
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:04.880]  between the 25th of March and the 1st of April this year planetary wide and you
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.040]  will see if you if you get a chance to look at it that the Richter 8 some odd
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:15.680]  earthquake in Chile there probably two and a half weeks ago now it's been
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.280]  followed by earthquakes moving up through Central America and up toward the
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:23.960]  United States on the ring of fire and I heard you on the radio a few weeks ago
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:28.280]  say watch this is gonna follow up the tectonic plate and it did it but mainline
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:34.400]  scientists said oh no connection don't worry well yeah again I think that their
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:37.320]  hands are tied by the White House that some of them had to sign these
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.880]  agreements not to pass you know terrible information the public but but unless
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.280]  the White House gives information to and that's for economic and political
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.320]  stability and all kinds of other reasons that the White House does that but I
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:57.200]  know having talked to some of these USGS officers or engineers that they their
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.960]  hands are just tied they wish they could say more to give you how long we got
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:05.280]  here we got to go a couple minutes and a couple minutes we're gonna come back
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:10.360]  to two more segments yes sir okay in the Philippines there was a volcanic
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:15.120]  corruption there and two years back and they made a documentary of the USGS
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.920]  handling this the explosion there what was it pen a tube or something like that
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:23.360]  anyway the USGS was sitting there measuring earthquakes underneath the cone
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.800]  of this big volcano trying to figure out is it about to erupt is it about to
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.880]  erupt and they were running around inside that you could see it on the
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.680]  documentary and their concern was that if they called it an earthquake and
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:38.480]  called an evacuation of a million people plus the US Air Force base there and it
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:43.360]  didn't happen everybody would you know turn on them and consume them for having
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:46.920]  given false information her business and all that kind of stuff on the other hand
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:51.480]  if they don't do it and it does happen they'd say why didn't you warn us and so
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.800]  it you know they're darned if they do darned if they don't and finally they
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.000]  bit the bullet and said look we think the eruption is imminent evacuate and it
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.080]  saved a lot of lives that's the problem facing people in official positions with
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.920]  this kind of data is you know personally they are somewhat liable no matter
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:13.480]  what happens you know they can't make a mistake and it's it's hard in this
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.520]  business in volcano prediction earthquake prediction there's a
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:21.640]  probability factor that works against you so that's why they do it and I you
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:25.200]  know I sympathize with a lot of these guys who are just caught in there but
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:29.360]  undoubtedly these earthquakes are increasing the deaths increasing yeah is
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:33.200]  that the world's more populated is why it's killing more because I'm looking at
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.960]  some of the old earthquake maps it looks like it's targeting cities now it
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:43.120]  looks really suspicious to a lay person well you look not only that yeah look in
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.920]  the United States that where we're starting to get internal earthquakes now
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:50.560]  then in Oklahoma that's what I wanted to come back with you tell us about that
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.680]  when we come back with stand a oh he's enough I want to get this guy on more a

[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:26.960]  9-11 event is scheduled to occur just like 9-11 had a lasting impact on our
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.520]  society this event will reshape America it will swipe trillions off markets and

[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:37.280]  McAfee's coming on talk about heartbleed and is this the internet false flag to
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:44.440]  bring in total control John McAfee who is top you know known expert in the
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:47.960]  internet security and also a character he's gonna be joining us via video Skype
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:50.720]  it's video Skype right that's coming up at eight after next hour
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.640]  stand out I've been asking a lot of questions you're making a lot of great
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:56.920]  points getting back into you were talking about all this earthquakes in
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:02.800]  New York earthquakes in Colorado earthquakes in places like Oklahoma and
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:06.560]  Texas and again you were talking about these fault lines the middle of the
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:09.920]  country and weird drills I remember hearing you on the radio going man I
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.520]  this guy sounds credible but you know that it's they're gonna get active in
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.800]  the middle of the country and the government knows something and then
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:19.840]  they're having drills and it all starts happening so so stand out tell us what
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.640]  you think's going on all right well now I don't know if your producer has
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.080]  ability to put this graphic up but if he doesn't you can go to stand a dot com
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.600]  they're showing it right now all right now what are these at the one that shows
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:36.720]  all the earthquakes over the planet and in the United States yes we've been
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:40.560]  showing the US and the world we've been showing different ones okay well all right
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:44.520]  we'll come back to that in a second but on the top row of the images I've put up
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.440]  for you guys on the right hand side is one called the USA stable earthquake
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  shield now what this picture is a black and white picture but it's it's hard to
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:58.600]  get this data but I want you to look at this because where this black line runs
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:01.840]  from Canada down into Texas and up into Oklahoma and across over the New
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:07.560]  Madrid and then up into the western side you know of the eastern sorry the
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.920]  western side of the Appalachian up into New York this line is what's called the
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:16.720]  stable shield where earthquakes basically don't occur outside that line
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:20.640]  toward the oceans is where the earthquakes occur right on that border
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.640]  and surprise surprise it runs through you know central Texas up into Oklahoma
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:32.360]  city over into the lower or into the start region of the New Madrid and then
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:37.320]  all up into the New England states you know past New York and whatever along
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:41.880]  those lines and up and through Yellowstone too by the way is where we're
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:47.120]  going to see massive earthquakes and possibly some volcanic activity in
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:51.280]  addition to what's going to happen in California with the volcanoes and up into
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:59.320]  the the range of them the Cascades under the West Coast there there's probably
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:02.920]  about six volcanoes that may become active there but anyway if you look at
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:08.440]  that pull that thing down and put it in your computer print it out and realize
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:13.040]  where those black lines are down the the central stable region of the US
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:19.000]  shield outside that region is is going to have some activity fairly serious
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.160]  ones now the the first graphic had him put up was showing the earthquake
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:29.520]  patterns for the last 30 days of the planet and certainly you can see from
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.880]  just looking at that that we have activity starting to increase in the
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:40.240]  northern part of Oregon southern part of Washington and at the very tip of
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:46.240]  northern California at where the Wanda Fuca plate is and that's the reason that
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:52.480]  we have a great deal of concern for the area there for tsunamis and damaged
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.520]  infrastructures because the Wanda Fuca plate all is the only one of all of
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.800]  those earthquakes you see there around the ring of fire the only one that is
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:06.640]  not released it's Richter 9 plus stress in the last 55 years everyone is
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:12.320]  watching that site if something triggers it it's going to hurt us a lot and I'm
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:16.000]  seeing earthquakes right there on this picture I've got up there right on the
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.120]  tip of the Wanda Fuca plate on a ridge that runs out it's called the Mendocino
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:25.880]  Fault Ridge runs right up to the north Pacific northeast Pacific so let's keep
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:30.800]  an eye on these things you guys you know as listeners can do it on the USGS site
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:34.040]  now the sites that do show these earthquakes daily all right Stan stay
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:37.360]  there one one more minute we're gonna come back in a final segment with you
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:47.040]  a final comment stand as our guest this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:54.720]  Network a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:58.120]  County this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:02.080]  drinking water contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:05.600]  our drinking water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:09.440]  residents my friends water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:12.920]  take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:16.800]  your tap water on average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.680]  once a week few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:25.800]  supplies worldwide remove pesticides herbicides chloramines hydrofluorosalic
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:30.560]  acid sodium hexafluorosilicate fluoride it is intense and coffee it's in water

[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:14.040]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:22.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:28.000]  Senator Sessions says there's a deliberate plan by Obama to basically
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.200]  collapse America its borders well no kidding I've said for years there's a
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:37.520]  fiat legalization stand a oh I want to get back on in the near future is our
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:41.400]  guests stand a oh.com again I got to be honest I heard him I got to be over a
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:47.320]  decade ago talking about earthquakes and then the super volcano and talking
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:50.320]  about all this stuff and I was just like that guy sounds credible but me you
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:53.920]  know that's just this is just fun talk radio stuff I'm not gonna have this guy
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.040]  on and then just over the years I keep hearing them like wow that all happened
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:02.480]  that all happened I tell you I just hope the rest of it doesn't come true but
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.200]  yeah California what will happen conservatively compared to other
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:12.800]  earthquakes in in in a similar fault lines according to the geology you know
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:16.520]  unsanitized through the federal government according to your sources
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:20.160]  what will happen if it kicks off on average will it have like a 8.0 or
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.840]  could it be big like Japan even higher well the northern California the
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:30.440]  Juan de Fuca plate is already rated at 9 Richter 9 plus that's on the new system
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:37.680]  which typically records a slightly lower value so an earthquake there could then
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:41.680]  trigger the San Andreas fault and a number of parallel faults in California
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:45.680]  breaking it up into a series of islands more than just the whole west coast
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:51.520]  falling that could be a blessing actually yeah I I know I know I'm being
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:55.600]  sarcastic folks I California beautiful status a lot of great people on it but
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:02.000]  yeah yeah yeah we know what's been going on there though and it's I'm hoping the
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.400]  wise people there have moved out certainly we've seen an influx of many of
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:10.880]  the Californians over the last 10 years into Colorado getting you know into a
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.660]  better area and they're not taking your guns yesterday well no no I mean look
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:19.240]  I mean they wreck their state and they come to Texas in Colorado and try to
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.560]  pass the anti-gun laws you see this this vest I got here made in Colorado yes
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.360]  you know by Colorado leather right in there is where you put your pistol it's
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.640]  a concealed carry and no I love Colorado I'm just saying the Democrats have moved
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:36.640]  there and are passing anti-gun laws yeah well we're trying to stop that now
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.720]  then we've been good by having a couple of our senators recalled you know friends
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:44.080]  of ours have helped organize that and no you've done great you've done great I'm
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:47.920]  starting off on a jag that's all right now this one thing I do want to say here

[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.760]  McAfee wants to do the guy that the Senate called and tried to get to fix it
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:50.120]  he said it can't be fixed the whole thing's a fraud we had him on like two
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:54.440]  days after it launched it broke here before it was on MSNBC that he'd been
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:59.800]  contacted and that's thing about John McAfee I mean I didn't know if he was
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:03.040]  telling me the truth up front with his wild stories but all of it turned out to
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:07.920]  be true all of it turned out on everything he ever told me to be true so
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:11.160]  pretty amazing on that front now we've had him on I don't know six seven times
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.160]  he's been there to Austin repeatedly we've hung out had dinner gone shooting
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.840]  really an interesting guy and I thought you know we've got the ultimate expert
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:23.600]  to come on to talk about Heartbleed and just you know how bad is it Canada
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:29.120]  holds online tax returns and wake of Heartbleed Heartbleed bug check which
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.600]  sites you have been patched we've been patched before it's even got announced
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:37.600]  Heartbleed internet security bug and they go on to say it could take down the
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:42.080]  entire internet well I think the NSA released the keys to this just like I
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:45.720]  said I thought Microsoft Israel the US were behind Stuxnet because I went and
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:48.960]  checked with IT experts and said who can do this who stands to gain they said
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:54.440]  Microsoft you know has the keys to it and it's an industrial sabotage system
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.600]  it probably is real in the US I came on said Israel US I was attacked by
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:02.160]  national media six months later turned out I was writing spades so later we're
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.920]  going to get into the lawlessness of the government coming up you've got
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:11.920]  Gohmert you've got other Texas congressman saying that that holders
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:15.440]  should be arrested for contempt of Congress you have more contempt coming
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:20.600]  down pardon me sir aren't told from Texas yes thanks for reminding me his
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:25.480]  name I said he should be arrested should be in jails the actual quote we've
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:29.640]  now got Boehner saying there's a cover up with the IRS persecution we've now
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:35.120]  got crews coming out and saying that they should be impeached holders should
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:42.480]  be impeached we've got all these other people like Senator Sessions saying that
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:46.080]  it's a criminal implosion of the government it's a criminal takedown of
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:50.440]  our sovereignty they're all finally saying what it is and as more people
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:55.360]  get courage they can't target everyone that's why I told you my job is to say
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:59.320]  the radical truths if it's true I'm going to say it if I believe it's
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:03.120]  correct and I've got the evidence I'm gonna say it I don't care how bad you
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.960]  know what crazy it sounds I told you our government criminal elements run
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.500]  al-Qaeda told you that 16 17 years ago it's mainstream news today it's a secret
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:16.520]  army being used by criminal groups to attack enemies they want to bring down
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.080]  to destabilize the world and bring down this country as well so John McAvie
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:24.960]  joins us and it's so funny because just a week ago I was talking to him via text
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:30.160]  he was saying look I've just come out with this proxy system so that they
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.320]  can't track it back to you with all the passwords compromised and I was like I
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:37.360]  get what you're saying and he's going he's also told me in person look the
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:40.920]  passwords are compromised even if you change them they know your IP address
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:44.640]  that's why you've got to constantly be changing where you come into the internet
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:47.400]  I don't understand all this technical stuff he was basically I guess talking
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:51.000]  about heart bleed and then heart bleed all broke this week and I kept thinking
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.480]  there's somebody I can get on about this who is it and I couldn't think you know
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:58.040]  sometimes the simplest thing you can't click and then I was driving in my car
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:04.520]  yesterday at about five o'clock driving home and it clicked I got to get John
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:07.320]  McAvie on see if he'll come on to tell us what he thinks about heart bleed I
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:11.240]  haven't talked to him I don't know what he's gonna say about heart bleed I don't
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:16.600]  know what his take is shirt a have I made anything that any points that make
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:19.960]  sense be what do you think's going on with heart bleed and then tell us about
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:25.280]  your new free app that I talked to my IT folks they said no it's a great way to
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:32.400]  protect yourself from things like heart bleed John what do you think hey good to
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.800]  have you with us so you've got the floor tell us what you think okay well the
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:42.320]  problem with heart bleed is that over well approximately 70% of all computers
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:49.200]  use the open SSL encryption technique to encrypt data now the problem with this
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:55.440]  is open SSL is a is a volunteer organization composed of four people
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:59.640]  there is no quality control now this this is one of the problems with open
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:05.280]  source code that American industry is using it and it hasn't been tested
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:09.880]  properly I mean for example in Microsoft there are at least 50 to 100 people in
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:15.760]  quality assurance that do nothing but test the software constantly there are
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:21.880]  none in the open source of SSL group there and they are relying on users to
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:27.680]  report bugs this is a terrible technique 70% of all computers use a program
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:34.160]  that has had a major flaw for over two years and this flaw allows hackers to
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:40.880]  get in and read encrypted mail encrypted communications of all kinds without our
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:44.480]  knowledge now keep in mind this has been going on for two years and we just now
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:48.160]  discovered it I think it's one of the problems with American corporations
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.960]  that they become lazy rather than building things in the proper way they
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:56.840]  rely on open source which is free and everybody goes oh this is great this is
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:02.800]  good stuff but this is what happens so 70% of all computers in the world have
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:11.040]  been compromised by this bug which is two years old expanding on that then
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.640]  what overall what would you do where do you think heart bleeds going will
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:20.040]  government use it as a power grab no I don't think the government will use it
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:24.840]  Alex I think I think that the fix has already been announced however it's like
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:29.400]  locking the barn door after the cows are gone two years we have had this problem
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:34.720]  now think about think about how critical this is 70% of all computer
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:39.960]  systems every almost every look major website including Yahoo including
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:46.800]  Facebook including Google use the open SSL code so everybody who's been using
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:52.560]  these systems is now and has been vulnerable for two years your passwords
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:57.680]  have probably been taken of your your secret communications but have probably
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.800]  been read hackers have known about this for quite a while the the user
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:07.080]  community has not and again it's it's the problem of laziness you know we've
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:13.160]  we've become somewhat lacks in our understanding of what we're doing our
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:18.160]  technology is so advanced and yet we are using things like open source composed
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:24.240]  of four volunteers Alex it's a it's a it's astonishing it boggles my mind and
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:27.760]  I've been saying all along that there will eventually be problems there have
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:33.880]  to be there is no organized quality control and testing process for this
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:41.360]  major element of security and privacy John McAvie the guru the inventor of
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:47.440]  what is known as antivirus software and then also well known for his intrigues
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:52.320]  down in beliefs expanding on this and we're gonna play a little animation here
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:58.600]  in a moment tell us about your new free app or software that you think is the
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.920]  answer to much of the security problems for the individual out there well our
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:07.200]  app runs on Android phones Android smartphones I still believe that phones
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:14.200]  represent our our greatest risks to security and privacy and well I have
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.880]  just released an app which will run through all of your applications and
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:22.160]  tell you which ones are watching you through your camera which ones are
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.920]  listening to you through your microphone which ones are reading your emails
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:31.800]  reading your SMS text messages or even calling without your knowledge using
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:36.960]  your telephone and you would not believe the number of apps that do this most
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:42.040]  people find that 50% of their apps or more that they have downloaded and have
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:48.040]  been using for years violate their privacy in an astonishing way after you
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.600]  run the system you can then choose which apps you want to trust and which you
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:56.120]  don't the ones you don't want to trust will simply remove from your system this
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:00.320]  is the first step in in the major decentralized product project and I think
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:04.240]  that this is probably the most important again people who run this are
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:08.200]  astonished you would be astonished Alex if you ran it on your Android phone it
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:13.760]  would again over 50% of apps are violating you in some way listening to
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:18.560]  you watching you reading your messages looking at your location and reporting
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:24.040]  it it boggles my mind what happens is people download these apps and they
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.960]  don't pay any attention to the fine print you know you have a contract which
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:33.320]  is three pages long nobody reads it you just run the app and that app why do
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:37.400]  you think they're free mostly they're free because they're making money by
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:42.840]  selling your information where you are what you're doing John McAvie I want to
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:47.120]  come back from break and have you break this down but first here's a 30 second
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:50.480]  promo you've got for your new free Android app the rollout will be another
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:19:05.440]  system soon called Decentral here it is
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:30.520]  I need to have some ads like us for that again it was mainly a visual ad
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:33.640]  where's the best place for folks to go John to see the ad that I just played
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:41.240]  the audio of okay it's it's on Google Play the program is Decentral one that's
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:48.000]  D then the word central with the number one after it it's free and I'm not
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.080]  watching for people or doing anything or who is McAvie.com let's come back and

[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:10.880]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in a
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:15.880]  halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:20.160]  federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:25.440]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:30.760]  record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously

[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.160]  next segment I want to ask you about just the state of the world right now but
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:32.560]  you were getting into your decentralized who is McAvie.com folks can follow over
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:37.760]  there to get the free Google Android app and things that you're gonna you were
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:42.000]  telling me gonna roll out to Apple systems and others soon but explain to
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:48.320]  people what what your application does to give some levels of protection but I
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:51.440]  guess it just tells you what's going on and then you're also developing another
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:55.760]  system that'll be a little box that gives people web anonymity no matter where
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:00.960]  they go so you don't have to trust a third-party proxy server. Yes what we're
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:04.600]  doing is we're rolling out decentralized phases our first phase was the
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:10.400]  privacy app that at first gets rid of those applications that are invading
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:14.760]  your privacy and again an astonishing number of apps that you download do that
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:20.120]  I mean for example Alex the Bank of America app the online banking application
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:23.400]  you think that's a that's a very trivial thing and it wouldn't need any
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:29.120]  information yet you have to give that permission to turn on the camera on your
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:34.040]  phone why because I assume because they they haven't told me I've called many
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:40.280]  times I'm assuming it's because if you empty your account online and say well
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:44.280]  hey I didn't do that they can come back and say yeah well we have we have video
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:50.000]  of you doing it and talking while you're doing it still this should be known I
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.720]  mean you should know that that while you're doing the online banking someone
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:59.480]  is watching you or recording that data and if there's an employee at the bank
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:04.040]  that's bored one day I mean at lunchtime there's nothing to prevent them
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:07.560]  turning on your camera and seeing what you're doing well that's invented at the
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:13.600]  NSA that they stalk their girlfriends ex-girlfriends wives husbands business
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:17.560]  partners I mean they're just doing whatever they want right and it's not
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:21.240]  just the NSA it's it's the major American corporation the world has changed
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:26.080]  Alex everything is about marketing now everything is about where you are what
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:30.640]  you want what you're doing what you need and the more information they have
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:35.200]  about you what you're wearing where you go every day then the more they can
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.800]  market to you it's a it's a very frightening situation so it's not just
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:45.560]  the NSA the NSA is is motivated by some bizarre concept of national security
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:50.240]  American corporations are motivated by greed and they will do anything to
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:54.080]  increase their profits including violating your privacy to an astonishing
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:58.880]  degree and our app tells you that it will tell you which applications are
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:02.280]  doing this and then you can choose you can say well I'll live with it I'll live
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:06.160]  with them watching me while I do online banking but if you don't like that we'll
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.280]  just remove the app for you let me ask you this question I had asked the crew
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:12.840]  a while back and they didn't get around to because they're busy but I said I
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:17.120]  want to do an animation or a graphic that literally shows like blinds and
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:21.080]  somebody looking through your iPad and then start talking to you're like hey
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:24.560]  what are you doing and then and the person says back oh hey you know you
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:28.080]  don't mind if I watch you do you I'm your neighbor Bob you'd go over and kick
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:31.920]  Bob's butt but if it's government or corporation it's like oh let him watch
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:36.400]  me when they're using the data just like thieves will use data off Facebook for
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:40.600]  rob your house you protect your data because there's bad people out there
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:44.880]  people go well I'm not bad so spy on me no there's bad people out there it's
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:49.040]  like I'm not gonna lock my door at night because I'm a good person no you lock
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:53.600]  your door because there's bad people out there absolutely that that is that is a
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.480]  fundamental problem and it has been a problem all along and again it's it's
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:04.400]  the it's the fact that we willingly load these apps into our system without
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:09.440]  caring we don't understand the implications of people knowing where we
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:13.680]  are what we're doing who we're with some apps actually read all of your contacts
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:17.800]  so they didn't know who all of your close friends are they read your SMS text
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:22.680]  messages believe it or not they can read your emails and download them you give
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:26.320]  apps this permission and this is frightening that we have loaded these
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:29.600]  things and we have no concept what they're doing email admits they read every
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:33.920]  email you send and put it into a data mine absolutely absolutely and they do
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.160]  that because it gives them great power to know what the world is doing what
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:42.480]  every man woman and child is doing every day what they're who they're talking to
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.080]  what they want what their dreams are well that that's great for them but it's
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:50.800]  terrible for us I don't want that I would like to have some privacy I'd like to
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:54.160]  have you know something funny I've noticed I agree with you if you're
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:57.360]  looking at one of your friends phones while they're texting just by action or
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:00.920]  because you're used to looking at screens people will get really irritated if
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:04.840]  you look over their shoulder at their computer even an internet cafe I'll see
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:08.320]  something interesting on somebody's screen and look at it they'll get mad but
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:13.000]  then the government is gang raping them corporations are and they love it they
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.200]  do and it's like well one person's looking over your shoulders you've
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:20.440]  downloaded 50 apps there are 50 people looking over your shoulder not just it
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:24.640]  what you're typing in the screen but what you typed yesterday the note that you
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:29.960]  typed to your wife think about it they are private messages our most intimate
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:34.800]  thoughts and intimate communications are being watched by corporations and the

[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:43.120]  agree stay there and I'm already finding that it's a panopticon effect where I'm
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:47.300]  doing everything as if I'm being watched it's not that I've done something bad but
[02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:51.000]  now I can't be private I've been wrong John McAfee is our guest we're on the

[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:44.760]  I've got Chris's T-Mobile drawing here and we scanned the 54 apps that are on
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:49.160]  his and if you look he's got the free iPhone app that we put out four years
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:54.080]  ago with the standard radio app that were used by hundreds of radio stations
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:02.840]  and we have a green rating showing that version 3.4.8 that's used by hundreds
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:06.320]  of thousands of people he has a green rating there's some in here that he has
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.840]  on his phone that have a orange rating or a red rating I want to ask John McAfee
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:15.160]  the antivirus guru who's launched the central bless best easiest place to find
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:19.720]  it is who is McAfee dot com you just go there and can't wait till it's on the
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:24.080]  Apple platform I'll put it online it's just great to know and and to create
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:28.560]  awareness of this of who's spying on you what does it mean that yahoo has an
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:35.440]  orange rating the battery saver has it has up to a middle rating the Google
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:39.080]  settings is into the middle into the red rating what are the rating systems on
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:42.920]  here what does it mean that I have a green rating is that good what you can
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:46.640]  do is you can click on that specific app Alex and it will tell you exactly what
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:51.480]  that app is doing it'll tell you whether it's accessing the camera or the
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:56.000]  microphone whether it's reading your emails or SMS messages whether it's
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.400]  making phone calls without your knowledge but keep in mind that Google is
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:07.240]  is is is highly rated as as undesirable not undesirable but but invasive of
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:11.360]  your privacy because they are the world's collector of data they want to know
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:16.520]  everything about you so again clicking on it will give you a rating then when
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:19.520]  you click on the application it will tell you why it's given that rating
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:24.040]  whether it's just your email messages or whether it's reading your contacts and
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:28.480]  downloading your contacts information or what have you some apps do all of that
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:34.960]  some apps read the phone use the phone send SMS messages read the SMS messages
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:41.120]  read the email watch you listen to you all of the above so clicking on them
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:45.280]  will tell you that so even though mine is very simple and we set up with a main
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:49.960]  line company to have limited stuff the way the internet's designed it has some
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:53.760]  data just so we can give you higher or lower quality audio depending on how
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:56.680]  good your internet is and then even though we have a four-year-old app that's
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:36:00.880]  been updated it's still got issues and it's it's compared to other stuff on
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:05.880]  your thing you know super good rated but still is basically wide open I guess the
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:10.280]  internet itself has been built to spy on people well I don't think that was the
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:13.960]  original intent of course I think the original intent was to to assist
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:18.240]  communication and and share knowledge but very quickly I think corporate and
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:23.720]  government agencies have got have said whoa this is a terrific platform that
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:28.640]  we can use to increase our profits to spy on our citizens to control our
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:34.360]  citizenry and that's what it's being used for now and we we are we are culpable
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:38.880]  in that we willingly do these things we willingly download these apps because
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.600]  they they make life a little bit easier but the price for that ease is a loss of
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:47.920]  privacy so estrogen horses we literally take the so-called free gift but it's
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:53.280]  not free we take the Palantir from Soran but it's so he can control us that's
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:58.000]  absolutely that's it basically it is not free it doesn't cost you money it costs
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:04.280]  you a lot more than money it costs you your privacy your your intimacy I mean
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:08.400]  think about it Alex I mean if you give an app the ability to read all of your
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:13.560]  emails some people you know they they they send quite juicy emails to their
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:18.200]  spouses or or love you know their their lovers good Lord do you want that
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:23.280]  downloaded and and accessible to some corporation I don't think so and yet you
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:27.720]  willingly when you load these apps give that app the right to do that it's
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:31.560]  insane we need to get a grip on ourselves we need to understand what we
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:36.120]  have done with the technology that we have created we have created a monster
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.040]  and we have let that monster into our home that's right John McAfee is our
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:45.320]  guest again I'm Alex Jones then for wars.com let me just give this some
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:48.200]  news with you John it's always interesting what do you think of this
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:54.240]  situation out in Nevada where clearly if you know the laws as you do they've had
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:58.680]  grazing rights for 140 plus years they've got you know cattle crossing signs
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:02.560]  there they've run 53 families out of the area they're the last family out there
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:08.000]  and now they're tasering people beating up protesters telling the governor to go
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.960]  jump in the lake when clearly they have the grazing rights the surface rights
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:17.080]  the water rights and BLM all over the country is kicking people off public
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:22.240]  land where they have grazing rights for hundreds of years in some cases and
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:26.240]  government literally with attack dogs bugging their eyes out it just seems
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:29.760]  like this imperious attitude what's your take on that yeah don't talk to me
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:34.600]  about the law Alex I've been sued 100 times in 22 years and spent over $10
[02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:41.720]  million in legal fees the problem with the law is that it helps now just the
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:45.600]  lawyers I mean lawyers are making out like crazy and it helps those who are
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:52.080]  in power so the law is something that that's no longer of a blind lady with a
[02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:57.440]  scale no it's something where the rich weigh the balance where the the people
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:03.240]  in power the people who have greed weigh this balance so so you know I'm the
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.880]  last person in the world to talk about this I'm excessively biased $10
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:13.600]  million Alex in 22 years in legal fees now this is outrageous and again I
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:18.200]  agree with you I mean grazing rights are you know they were established hundreds
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:24.920]  of years ago and and if we look at the the reality of the situation grazing
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:31.200]  rights was that's food it's one of our necessities and when we when we restrict
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.440]  ranchers when we restrict farmers when we when we legislate against the
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:41.640]  manufacturers of our food you know we're stepping on very dangerous problem well
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:45.240]  that's right and beef prices are all-time high because people are getting out of
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:48.720]  the cattle business because of the regulations and the meatpackers are on
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:52.640]  record had the FDA shut down all their competition to create a bottleneck I
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:57.480]  mean this is outrageous well I live I lived in New Mexico for a number of
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:01.640]  years and it's all ranching character I know how tough ranching is I've never
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:06.320]  done it myself but all of my neighbors did it I have a healthy respect for that
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:10.160]  lifestyle I have a healthy respect for their attitudes and I have a healthy
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:15.080]  respect for their their work ethics I mean they work harder than anyone and
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:19.320]  and they are they are put upon by everybody but certainly the government
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:23.280]  you know the government wants wants land we're running out of space we need this
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:27.960]  we need that you know and a rancher that has you know a hundred thousand acres
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:32.280]  and is working his ass off trying to make a living well that that's great
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:37.280]  that's a hundred thousand acres I can use for development it's unbelievable I
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:42.600]  mean it's just I have family and farming and ranching and the bureaucrats will go
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:46.880]  harass some little ranch with 300 cows or a hundred we can't make a living on
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:51.640]  that and then they have big aggressions above the law no one even messes with
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:55.360]  them because they write the laws and this country's gone from being able to
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:59.040]  feed the whole world in the 50s so we import half our food a third of our
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:06.200]  beef now I mean they have really jacked this country up absolutely and if you
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.440]  if you think about it food clothing and shelter are the basic necessities of
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:17.640]  life when we can when we can no longer feed ourselves as a nation when we when
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:24.360]  we make it difficult for the manufacturers of food or the producers
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:28.080]  of food to actually make a living then it makes sense for them to get out of
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:32.640]  that business and do something else it's it's insane sir well it's like
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:36.360]  third world countries and dictatorships are always hell pits because the you
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:39.120]  know the control freaks just want to control everything and point guns at
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:42.480]  people walk around black uniforms and pretty soon everything falls apart great
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:47.640]  job well it does indeed and I think it starts with our privacy Alex if we
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:51.240]  don't have privacy and if everyone knows what everyone is doing we're living
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:54.800]  in a nightmare we're living in a world where we've lost our humanity we've
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:42:01.240]  lost our our basic ability to to have communion and intimacy intimacy it does
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:06.160]  not involve outside parties it does not involve corporations and governments it
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:10.360]  right free association means we can go into a house and play poker if we want
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:14.080]  or it means we can go with our wife and do we want our girlfriend or husband it
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:17.800]  means we you know we we lower the shades not we're doing something bad but
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:22.600]  because this is our house it's not your house we built a fence because we don't
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:27.600]  want you looking at us and we have we have intimacy now privacy is a matter of
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:31.360]  choice Alex I mean when you first meet someone you don't devolve your most
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:35.680]  intimate secrets do you it doesn't happen after three or four dinners you
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:39.220]  might tell them you know where you work and a little bit about your life when
[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:42.960]  you become very close to someone you start divulging like your spouse your
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:47.000]  wife your your husband you start divulging things about yourself which
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.360]  really don't belong in the world at large wait I know where you're going with
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:54.560]  this I just click you're right you only share your you know the keys to your
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:58.360]  kingdom with people you love and trust and they are robbing and raping
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:03.000]  something that you might not even tell your wife your deepest secrets and these
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.800]  little bastards at Microsoft and these people at Google and these people at the
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:13.840]  NSA and Defense Intelligence and all over are literally raping us this is
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:18.280]  outrageous well it's not just that and and here's the issue in releasing
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:24.480]  decentralized I took a major risk Alex because I am going against the corporate
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:29.480]  thrust of every major corporation and every major data acquisition company
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:34.160]  Google you know I probably am the most unpopular person in the world for Google
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:39.440]  because my app will tell you what Google is doing sure when you first when you
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:43.160]  first read the read the fine print it says well you're giving us the right
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:47.640]  to to do a number of things so you have to agree to that and you say sure without
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:52.680]  thinking of what my app does is make you think it points out exactly what you
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:56.600]  have done you've given them the right to turn on your camera your phone you to
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:02.600]  to to listen to you to read your emails it's it is unbelievable and so I'm going
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:09.120]  to be a very unwanted person to almost every company in America because every
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:16.640]  company depends upon marketing data for profit incredible John McAvie is our
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:23.320]  guest well John in closing and I hope you'll come back soon what is your take
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.200]  on the Attorney General and the fact that they're using the IRS against their
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:32.920]  political enemies and haven't gotten in trouble and Obamacare and fast and furious
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.920]  more and more people are coming out calling them criminals and now they're
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:40.760]  threatening people back where do you where do you see this country going you
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:44.960]  know Alex it's first of all I think it's a it's an atrocity however this is
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:49.840]  nothing new Alex this has been going on since the times of J Edgar Hoover and
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:55.360]  even before it's just it's just what power does power corrupts people Alex it
[02:44:55.360 --> 02:45:00.240]  does and absolute power corrupts people absolutely and it may be in subtle ways
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:06.720]  but eventually you you realize that you do have the power to unjustly punish
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:11.240]  your enemies or people you perceive as enemies to punish your competition to
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:15.200]  punish things that are threats to you and this is this is what the world is
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:19.720]  it's human nature I'm sorry to be the cynical but it's a fact that we are all
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:25.320]  full of certain things greed and jealousy and and fear and these motivate
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:30.160]  people to do what they can to to to alleviate these fears and these these
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:35.600]  jealousies and and and so on when you have ultimate power well terrible things
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:40.360]  happen sometimes and and it's been going on for generations and it's it is an
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:43.880]  atrocity and I think that people should be punished it's unlikely that they
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:50.960]  will in the past they haven't been it's it's just a tragic situation the more
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:53.840]  important thing is we need to take we need to take charge of our own lives
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:58.760]  Alex I was decent for one I've given people a tool to do that and by the way
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:04.480]  you're asking about the the graphic ad the animation Chad Estley a very good
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:07.720]  friend of mine did that and I can certainly give him your name after this
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:12.000]  and if you want to do something similar he's extremely good he's very fast and
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.280]  he's very reasonable all right well we've got to collaborate together for
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:20.000]  liberty John McAfee who is McAfee calm to find the free app and so much more
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.840]  thank you so much for the time yes sir all right always great to talk to that
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:27.320]  guy we become friends a really really classy guy when you get to know him
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:31.840]  smart guy too obviously that goes without saying found at a four billion
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.360]  dollar company now before we go any further in the next segment we're gonna
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:39.520]  get an update of anything's happened out at the Bundy Ranch with the feds
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:42.120]  running around with their tongues hanging out with tasers and attack dogs
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:45.400]  and there's fireworks every day drudgerport.com covering it in great
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:51.400]  detail and so is m4s.com so we're gonna connect with them now on Skype out
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:57.240]  there at the Bundy Ranch and talk to them briefly ladies and gentlemen I
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:03.720]  really want to get to Boehner so so let's queue up Boehner now finally talking
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:08.240]  about a cover-up by Obama and the IRS stuff I mean you know McAfee said this
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:12.320]  always is going on yeah but John and Mitchell went to jail for the IRS stuff
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:16.120]  as Attorney General with Nixon and Holder says that no Attorney General's
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:19.800]  ever been treated like this what ask questions when you defy Congress on
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:24.840]  subpoenas a bunch of Attorney Generals have gone to jail a bunch of them have
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:30.480]  been indicted I am sick of this baloney about race card if Holder was white he'd
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:35.440]  be in jail right now Americans are so obsessed with race whites are so guilty
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:40.560]  that they will not do anything to Obama politically because they feel guilty
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:45.280]  Obama could be butchering children with a butcher knife or a meat cleaver on the
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:50.920]  White House lawn and no one would do anything about it because he's
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:55.760]  supposedly black doesn't talk or look like any black people I know personally
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:00.400]  I don't even care what color he is I'm sick of it I'm sick of it I cannot
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:04.040]  believe the top baseball player came out and said you're racist if you don't like
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:10.920]  Obamacare you're KKK I mean this is getting ridiculous you know Hank Aaron
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:14.080]  tell that all the black people getting cut back in their hours and getting their
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:19.240]  payroll tax raised like everybody else tell that to 52% of black people they
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:23.800]  get flushed down a toilet when they're born I'm sick of it it makes me want to
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:29.840]  throw up your race baiting garbage that creates racism in this country across the
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:35.360]  board and then as they ride this this horse of racial division and infighting
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:40.720]  and and balkanization they lecture those of us that are moral and just and want
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:47.200]  liberty it's the height of hypocrisy the height of fraud the the the height of
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:53.160]  hoax a giant stinking con game here is Boehner forced by constituents to start
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:57.720]  telling the truth here it is the frustration is is that the American
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:02.600]  people have not been told the truth about what happened at the IRS the
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.160]  American people have not been told the truth about what happened in Fast and
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:10.200]  Furious the administration has not told the American people the truth about
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:14.520]  Benghazi and we've been going through all of these hearings having to hold
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:18.840]  people in contempt because they've made it impossible to get to the documents
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:23.440]  they've not been forthcoming they owe the American people the truth and when it
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:27.320]  comes to Benghazi we've got four Americans who are dead and their families
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:31.640]  deserve the truth about what happened and the administration refuses to tell
[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:36.560]  them the truth now Boehner did good there but he should go further and say we
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:40.040]  know what they did and then show the testimony that contradicts all the lies
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:45.680]  of the political persecution and act like it's just all they did a few wrong
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:49.080]  things but you know we can't find they ship guns in a Mexico to blame the
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:54.000]  Second Amendment got caught with the documents that's a frame up they got
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:58.160]  caught targeting thousands of groups not letting them have 501 C3s going up to
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:01.880]  pro-life groups are the guiding people all this stuff while they're hiring all
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:06.000]  these felony groups to run the the enrollment system of Obamacare I mean

[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:02.320]  drudgereport.com and I said I want that updated I bet money Harry Reid's
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:07.520]  involved in the land now for whatever reason Watson didn't update it County
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:13.000]  Commissioner says Bundy Ranch supporters better have funeral plans okay
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:19.160]  now we found this in New American and Breitbart from years ago so just my
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:27.200]  hunch my hunch was instantly confirmed kit found documents on government sites
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:30.560]  kids got a big article coming out we need to update into Watson's article
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:35.600]  it's on drudge I don't know what you say Harry Reid behind Nevada land grab I
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:39.760]  my god you found it and you just ran in here going no we just spent the last two
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:43.760]  hours looking into what you said it's all publicly in view so let's explain
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:47.360]  something it's already in the news that Harry Reid was doing the solar panel
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:52.800]  farm and it looks like a wind farm on this very 600,000 acres now but this was
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:56.800]  two years ago New American which are very credible they're neurotic about
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:00.360]  sourcing everything we have their editor on William F. Jasper of course they live
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:07.400]  out there as well so the point is is that tell us what you discovered and
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:10.720]  what's about to break in the next 20 minutes at info wars calm it is
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:16.560]  extremely newsworthy look there it is US senator Reid's son combined for China
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:22.640]  firms desert plant and it turns out it's in that it's there holy Toledo how many
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:29.120]  years ago was that in Reuters 2012 devastating so maybe it wasn't a hunch
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:33.160]  maybe subconsciously I remember the name of that County that ranch and why they
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:37.720]  ran the 50 something people out mm-hmm I mean these oh my gosh see I just well
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:41.520]  it's unbelievable whoa I mean did I not run around the office saying Harry Reid
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:46.640]  Harry Reid absolutely I sent Harry Reid I literally go ahead yeah and the BLM has
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:50.160]  actually attempted to cover up I found documents that they deleted off their
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:53.880]  site I was able to find them off of Free Republic another devastating victory
[02:56:53.880 --> 02:56:59.680]  yes absolutely and these documents stated that the they actually directly
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:05.920]  mentioned Cleveland Bundy oh my god oh my god these criminals no wonder they're
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:10.440]  ready to kill people over this the local mob boss owns it now yeah and they're
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:15.040]  saying that they want his cattle off the land it's the chai comms with that
[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:20.040]  trader Reid communist forces literally get about some commie I bet a chop
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:23.560]  Chinese generals over it because they own everything every deal anyways yeah so
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:27.680]  communist generals in China who have mass murder factories basically mm-hmm
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:32.400]  and suicide nets and Harry Reid that degenerate pile of crap yeah and one
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:36.280]  thing to mention is Harry Reid's former senior advisor is one of the heads of
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:41.880]  BLM and the document I discovered was said that so BLM is literally a rogue
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:45.640]  criminal group for the Chinese government yeah unbelievable well that's it
[02:57:45.640 --> 02:57:50.400]  Chinese government Harry Reid behind Bundy land grabs secret documents reveal

[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:04.400]  sorry so the document mentions that the Jerome Corsi reported a year ago the
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:08.680]  chai comms take it over this year they got a deadline to get him off it's been
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:13.560]  handed over to the Chinese government meanwhile Bundy doesn't even know about
[02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:22.080]  it yeah he's getting hit by chai comm takeover and doesn't even know I mean
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:28.000]  this job is the twilight zone man on the open it's and those I guarantee those
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:33.360]  BLM would probably shoot 55 million kids that they were ordered to by Harry Reid
[02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:38.200]  and that's why they hate those lancers they are an absolute army of criminal
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:42.520]  filth and trash we'll be back with overdrive info wars.com forward slash

[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:17.480]  hearing while you've been on Skype I've been running the last 15 minutes but do
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:21.400]  you understand it was hiding in plain view and AP Reuters everywhere but we
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:24.960]  have this the documents that BLM removed off their site it's all confirmed
[03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:29.160]  the Chinese government and Harry Reid together in business talk about how
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:33.520]  infiltrated we are to take the land it's all confirmed wait till it comes out
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:36.640]  that Harry Reid with the Chinese government he's already in bribery
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:42.400]  scandals and everything else I mean this guy is such a mole enemy I mean my
[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:47.400]  god this country is in so much trouble David Knight have you heard the
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:50.960]  devastating news? Yes I did Alex and actually Neil
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:56.440]  Kornes is not just an official at the BLM he is the head of the BLM he's the
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:00.800]  guy who formerly worked for Harry Reid now we've got a lot of media here look
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:04.040]  at this we've got now CNN is right underneath the big polls that they
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:06.880]  erected a couple of days the helicopter that's here in the background that's
[03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:10.960]  Fox News I think it's Sean Hannity's crew or something so now the mainstream
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:15.840]  media is here we've kind of got I guess the the media empire is striking back
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:20.600]  and so the question is how are they going to spend this issue here and there's a
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:24.800]  lot of there's no way the Communist Chinese government and Harry Reid
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:30.040]  listing Bundy and now he's got to be off the land by 2014 all of this for two
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:35.920]  years in dozens of publications but but but but now it's blown up they covered
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:39.920]  it up it gets sensational notice they of course obviously Fox and all them know
[03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:45.640]  this and we're all hoping CNN that we didn't pick up on it but just like we
[03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:49.640]  forced everyone to cover this with Drudge now we're gonna force this again
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:53.840]  that's our key role go ahead I'm sorry absolutely that's what's behind it that's
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:57.260]  what's underlying it is his corporate fascism but how does this look on the
[03:02:57.260 --> 03:03:00.200]  ground look at these pictures that I've got here they put these up these are the
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:05.120]  Bundy kids this is his son Amon these three pictures four pictures here this
[03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:09.520]  is when he was tasered you see the neck here it was swollen up like a bee sting
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:13.200]  small vampire it's bleeding through his yeah you see it was Harry Reid a nice
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:17.840]  ferrata get into the window at night you can see him bleeding through his shirt
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:21.040]  here this is another brother Dave Bundy down here he was the one who was
[03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:24.680]  arrested the night before and thrown to the ground they eventually let him go
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:27.480]  and then this is the ant that they attacked from behind and through the
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:30.600]  ground I've been told I haven't confirmed that with her that she could not get
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:37.200]  any local doctors to document her injury she had to go elsewhere so this is
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:40.600]  what it looks like Alex his real wealth he's a small businessman he's trying to
[03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:44.000]  keep this family business his family farm has been there for generations in the
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.600]  family keep it going this is what he's fighting for this is his real wealth is
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:51.800]  his family here the communist Chinese one it was Harry Reid that's right look
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:56.000]  at look at this you were just talking to John McAfee this is what you don't see
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:59.360]  when they listen to all your internet stuff but this is what's really going
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:04.200]  on this is behind the all the NSA snooping and spying you've got a
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:08.480]  militarized presence that is there this is just right out of the Bundy ranch you
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:10.880]  can see they've got their sign there and in the background these the guys stand
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:15.240]  on the hills this militarized and they're not law enforcement it's BLM and then
[03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:18.280]  here's some more pictures that they put up so they put up this board here to to
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:21.720]  show people to show the media what's happening here and I you know we have
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:26.560]  to keep on top of this because this is the story of the people here on the
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:29.800]  ground that are fighting for their life for their livelihood but I mean what's
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:33.560]  incredible is it's known that Harry Reid the Chinese government are going after
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:38.040]  this land Bundy's in the documents and then that's not been discussed anywhere
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:41.960]  for two years and we're blowing it wide open right now with the documents that
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:46.400]  nobody has that list Bundy that he has to be removed the last guy standing and
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:51.800]  now paramilitary forces to back up Harry Reid and the Chai comms and those BLM
[03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:56.240]  look at those men women and children with pure hate they are trained well
[03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:01.320]  destroy America stay there we're gonna come right back to David Knight

[03:08:13.120 --> 03:08:20.360]  God it's Alex Jones my crew is literally just saying this is too sensational
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:33.000]  this is unbelievable let me quantify this for you for two plus hours kid nails
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:36.120]  have been doing research on this when I said I smell Harry Reid involved in this
[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:44.200]  and a compiling AP Reuters Breitbart CNN New American magazine a world net
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:48.760]  daily all about how a weird deal with the Chinese government and Harry Reid
[03:08:48.760 --> 03:08:52.000]  and his son Harry Reid making money off of it we're going to show you a mainstream
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:58.840]  news article that shows where the wind farm and solar farm begins is on their
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:03.000]  ranch the 600,000 acres that's the county that's it right there bordering
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:08.040]  Arizona and then we discovered by doing searches BLM documents that are on
[03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:14.960]  Google's way back machine but removed from BLM but confirmed by Google to to be
[03:09:14.960 --> 03:09:18.480]  where they said Bundy's the last one he's got to be removed nothing to do with
[03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:21.800]  the tortoise none of it in fact the BLM is going around killing all the
[03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:25.880]  tortoises that came out a year ago so let's let's go back to the map we'll
[03:09:25.880 --> 03:09:28.720]  blow that up now you're saying okay well this is in the news two years ago
[03:09:28.720 --> 03:09:33.080]  watch the big deal because Fox News CNN that are all there right on time the
[03:09:33.080 --> 03:09:37.280]  militia shows up you know as the media shows up so they can all make it about
[03:09:37.280 --> 03:09:41.840]  that I get a lot demonizing the militia I'm just saying a lot of militias are
[03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:45.200]  really federal front groups that's come out before and I'm sure these are good
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:49.120]  militias we'll see if they provocateur how the story changes because the media
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:54.360]  all just arrived CNN Fox MSNBC you know antenna trucks helicopters it's all
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:10:00.880]  arriving and I believe me they're not going to want it to come out that Harry
[03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:03.840]  Reed the Communist Chinese are involved because Republicans have been bought up
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:07.320]  by the Chinese government as well they dictate what Hollywood movies can have
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:12.680]  now and so now the media shows up right is entering the stage the whole world's
[03:10:12.680 --> 03:10:16.120]  the stage each of us players upon it William Shakespeare enters all the
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:22.000]  militia groups and some of them I'm sure good some of them we've done a little
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:28.080]  research and well it'll all come out the point is is that is they want to make it
[03:10:28.080 --> 03:10:33.040]  all about a standoff in a war instead the issue is I said you know I bet Harry
[03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:36.680]  Reed's involved just he runs everything in Nevada and he's super corrupt and
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:40.040]  he's always involved in scams and he's involved in all these bribery scams and
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:44.840]  payoff scams right now and Attorney General's protecting him I want to
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:48.880]  search Harry Reed because Democrats are making threatening comments in the area
[03:10:48.880 --> 03:10:51.880]  and they all look really angry and I've only seen threatening comments before
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:57.600]  when there's a land scam and they usually cut locals in on it and I said Harry
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:02.240]  Reed nothing happens in Nevada less Harry Reed gets a slice of it well we
[03:11:02.240 --> 03:11:06.560]  literally found hundreds of articles if you type in Harry Reed solar farm
[03:11:06.560 --> 03:11:12.040]  Chinese mainstream news where they're all questioning it in 2012 his
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:18.440]  involvement in all this because that was so unseemly now it is the ranch that
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:22.520]  this guy's got grazing rights to and the BLM has been told you do whatever you
[03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:26.600]  want to those people you keep them off get the cows dead destroy their water
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:31.600]  get the tortoises out of there it's ours and then the media I guarantee you
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:36.120]  seeing in all them new this their CIA they have been sent in there to make
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:40.480]  this about shootouts in the militia I'll guarantee you that's gonna be what
[03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:43.960]  they're gonna go with you watch tonight Fox is gonna do it too because they're
[03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:48.600]  all sold out to Chinese and the Saudi Arabians the rest of it and they're
[03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:51.840]  gonna go in there make it about land rights but only on the surface while
[03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:56.600]  the big issue is right in the middle of this is the Chinese government Harry
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:12:01.320]  Reed we are breaking in 10 minutes the documents the links Kit Daniels article
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:05.600]  it's a rushed job we're gonna be add more we're gonna link to it with updates
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:09.400]  Watson be ready to update your article and link to it on this linked on drugs
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:14.120]  county commissioner says Bundy supporters better have funeral plans we're
[03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:16.200]  gonna update that article there is national journal go back to that
[03:12:16.200 --> 03:12:21.560]  national journal for me how Harry Reed delivered a 235 mile long power line to
[03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:25.960]  Nevada the Senate majority leaders political influence help get a 235 mile
[03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:30.080]  transmission line for renewable energy built across the Vada with the Chinese
[03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:37.200]  government financing it and it's on Clive and Bundy's Ranch ladies and
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:43.680]  gentlemen that's the rest of the story and that's what this is all about and we
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:47.360]  got the documents where they mentioned running him out and now they're there
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:52.320]  running him out they tried to buy him out and they couldn't do it this is
[03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:57.520]  incredible it's all Obama and all these energy deals where they insiders get the
[03:12:57.520 --> 03:13:02.160]  money much insiders get the money off the wind farm in West Texas I'm not
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:05.360]  against these energy programs but half these windmills don't even turn it's
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:11.080]  just a scam man Harry Reed is a piece of trash no wonder he wants our guns he's
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:15.200]  a criminal that's robbing America he wants the people he's robbing disarmed
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:21.840]  robbers tie you down folks now let's go to the Bundy Ranch I am my head is
[03:13:21.840 --> 03:13:25.800]  spinning to see listening devices cameras snipers on the hill trained on
[03:13:25.800 --> 03:13:31.360]  people and it's also the communist Chinese government can steal ranch land
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:36.880]  from Americans so Harry Reid can get a big fat slice of money I'm just reeling
[03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:41.800]  right now this is about to break how big do you think this is and will they
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:46.520]  sweep it out of the rug David Knight well this is huge Alex the research that
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:52.480]  Daniels has found linking Harry Reed to the Bundy Ranch is just amazing we've
[03:13:52.480 --> 03:13:57.640]  had linkage before and the fact that his former staff member is now the head of
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:02.360]  BLM but the fact that they tie it to this particular ranch and we understand
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:06.280]  now what's behind it the Chinese connections for this solar farm that
[03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:09.720]  they're gonna put out here that's amazing but this operates at a lot of
[03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:13.760]  different levels and of course at one level it's what are they going to do on
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:17.480]  the ground are they going to defend the people do we have a law enforcement
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:20.800]  agency here a sheriff's department is going to defend the people to do what
[03:14:20.800 --> 03:14:24.160]  they're supposed to do there's going to be they'd line up with Chinese soldiers
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:27.680]  and bayonets citizens guarantee they'll do anything they're told that's right
[03:14:27.680 --> 03:14:31.000]  we're gonna right after we finish with this report we're going to go into
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:35.400]  Vegas there's going to be a demonstration at the sheriff's office
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:40.000]  that's at Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on 400 South Martin Luther
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:43.440]  King Boulevard in Las Vegas and of course there's a lot of people that have
[03:14:43.440 --> 03:14:48.480]  gotten the news to go out and to protest the sheriff at least shame him for not
[03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:52.600]  doing his duty for not protecting the citizens here from outright theft of
[03:14:52.600 --> 03:14:56.680]  cattle and then it will be the theft of their land and the brutalization of the
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:14:59.680]  Bundy family that we see which we are two teams out there because if you go to
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:03.880]  that they assault people every evening there I want to catch that on tape yeah
[03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:08.200]  yeah we're going to be back after the demonstration but I don't know we'll take
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:10.800]  your guidance see what you think is more important for us to be here I don't know
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:13.480]  I don't know what you think if you're the guy on the ground there it's just that
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:18.280]  I think there's going to be a I think it's going to be a lot of people there
[03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:21.000]  but of course there's a lot of stuff happening here we also have some out
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:24.800]  of state representatives who understand the constitutional issues involved here
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:27.840]  that are going to be coming in and speaking we have a stage that's being
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:31.280]  set up back here in the back and makeshift stage and so they're going to
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:34.200]  be coming in here tonight there's going to be a lot of activities here it's
[03:15:34.200 --> 03:15:36.840]  gonna be a lot more like a media circus than it's been the last couple of days
[03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:41.400]  the next couple of days what else has been going on while I've been
[03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:48.120]  hyperventilating well basically the as I pointed out before and the as the first
[03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:52.080]  started the big media has really moved in we got CNN planted themselves right
[03:15:52.080 --> 03:15:55.520]  underneath the metal structures they erected these flagpoles that you see out
[03:15:55.520 --> 03:15:59.600]  here just a couple of days ago they bolted them to some concrete and they've
[03:15:59.600 --> 03:16:02.680]  got some banners up there they took one of them down to do some repair or either
[03:16:02.680 --> 03:16:07.680]  take it to the demonstration that's going on in Las Vegas and so now we see
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:11.560]  the national media is actually boots on the ground here we also see Fox News is
[03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:14.160]  coming in with their helicopter they were circling around and around and around
[03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:18.300]  so I don't know what's going on with that but we broke this story Paul Joseph
[03:16:18.300 --> 03:16:21.480]  Watson broke it on Monday that's when it became a national story when Drudge
[03:16:21.480 --> 03:16:27.000]  picked that up and they still don't have the story they still don't get the
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.800]  understanding that this is about rights and certainly they don't have the
[03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:33.680]  information that you just broke about the connection with Harry Reid and the
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:40.120]  Chinese and the documents scoping out the Bundy Ranch in advance pre-meditated
[03:16:40.120 --> 03:16:46.440]  yes far and takeover with a trader sensational right just simply
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:50.560]  sensational I just it just never ends this is like a James Bond movie how
[03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:54.320]  evil these people are I mean of course James Bond books were written by Ian
[03:16:54.320 --> 03:17:00.080]  Fleming it was in the OSS so it's based on a lot of real scenarios you know the
[03:17:00.080 --> 03:17:03.440]  one they made a few years ago not the last one before I says about shutting
[03:17:03.440 --> 03:17:07.640]  the water off to take over the country that was based on a true story just a
[03:17:07.640 --> 03:17:11.800]  decade ago I mean it's just so criminal how they don't build anything they just
[03:17:11.800 --> 03:17:17.440]  sees and scam assets all day yes they want to turn everyone into renters they
[03:17:17.440 --> 03:17:20.440]  don't want anybody owned anything they want to move everybody off the land
[03:17:20.440 --> 03:17:23.120]  whether it's this land then it'll be the suburbs they want to move everybody in
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:27.160]  the small areas in the city under agenda 21 and of course they want to take all
[03:17:27.160 --> 03:17:30.920]  of our rights whether it is grazing rights and water rights this family has
[03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:34.800]  had for over a century about 140 years whether they want to steal that or whether
[03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:39.280]  they want to steal your property rights whether we steal your privacy everything
[03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:43.400]  is up for grabs they're taking everything and the question is how do we get
[03:17:43.400 --> 03:17:47.040]  these people under control a lot of people believe that of course one of the
[03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:50.680]  places that it has to happen is that local law enforcement they need to start
[03:17:50.680 --> 03:17:52.920]  standing up so there's so well that's what the globalists have been
[03:17:52.920 --> 03:17:55.400]  federalizing their training and everything else and turning them into
[03:17:55.400 --> 03:17:58.760]  attack dogs then it's game over we need to take our cities and counties back
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:18:03.880]  and share us back now and stop stepping and fetching when we see government we
[03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:08.920]  tell them you work for us not the Chinese government this guy who's a
[03:18:08.920 --> 03:18:13.040]  sheriff here I just found out he is not up for reelection he is standing down so
[03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:17.200]  he's doing his he's doing the bidding of the feds I guess so he's gonna get at
[03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:20.560]  some kind of nice cushy position when he retires from here because I think if
[03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:23.920]  he were to stay any longer than this fall's election he would probably be
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:31.720]  recalled and rightfully so unbelievable unbelievable David Knight just carry on
[03:18:31.720 --> 03:18:35.040]  cover whatever you think we get more funds and stuff we'll get even more
[03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:38.560]  reporters we'd have two teams out there but all of our reporters are doing just
[03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:42.040]  a fabulous job and the people that showed up out there I'm told it's in
[03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:46.200]  300 400 folks now anyone time out there the numbers are just growing you know a
[03:18:46.200 --> 03:18:49.720]  lot of people live in Vegas they should all go out there this weekend to see
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:54.960]  tyranny firsthand to see the enemy to see the BLM run by Harry Reid's former
[03:18:54.960 --> 03:19:00.320]  Chief of Staff openly stealing property openly taking police dogs at women
[03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:04.520]  trying to scare them I mean I'll be honest folks I didn't go out there cuz
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:10.880]  I'm so busy but also not cuz I'm scared I can't be around this anymore I mean I
[03:19:10.880 --> 03:19:13.800]  just cannot be around guys that literally want to menace women and
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:16.960]  children with police dogs who work for Chinese generals I just can't do it
[03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:20.960]  I just can't be around it how are you handling seeing these of these these
[03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:24.640]  BLM people and their craze craze looks in their eyes when they see an American
[03:19:24.640 --> 03:19:28.720]  it's like they were trained from birth to destroy us well that accurately sums
[03:19:28.720 --> 03:19:34.360]  it up Alex these just hired thugs who brutalized women for the Chinese so we
[03:19:34.360 --> 03:19:38.080]  can hand over our assets to the Chinese so that we can hand over all of our
[03:19:38.080 --> 03:19:42.080]  rights to the government it's really horrible I got just showed you the the
[03:19:42.080 --> 03:19:45.160]  board that they put up of what they've been doing to his family members and
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:48.400]  of course there are other people here who demonstrators and supporters some of
[03:19:48.400 --> 03:19:52.640]  them got that kind of treatment last night we have to get to the point where
[03:19:52.640 --> 03:19:56.880]  people stand up for their rights and part of that is educating them about what
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:20:00.040]  I think they're there one more second this new development's gonna blow them
[03:20:00.040 --> 03:20:06.120]  to hell how can you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies by having
[03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:10.080]  your own in-home freeze dryer from harvest right now you can cut down on
[03:20:10.080 --> 03:20:14.200]  wasted food by freeze drying your leftovers that's right create your own
[03:20:14.200 --> 03:20:18.680]  long-term food storage by freeze drying your own fruits meats vegetables even

[03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:37.040]  was wondering everybody was there in the break going how did you just say run
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:40.160]  around the office saying Harry Reid Harry Reid and I started thinking I went
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:43.160]  with a lot of things it's always about a land grab it's always about foreign
[03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:47.240]  governments that's what UNESCO in the UN is this is what happens in Africa
[03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:52.520]  Latin America they carve up different areas and the Chinese government is
[03:24:52.520 --> 03:24:57.640]  using all the money their slaves their people are putting out to buy up the
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:25:01.680]  US so I didn't think Chinese I just thought foreign government and I thought
[03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:05.560]  well who gets a piece of that it'll be whoever runs the state and Harry Reid
[03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:10.880]  runs Nevada so I said investigate that sloppy pig and sure enough he was right
[03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:14.600]  in the middle of it be like if crime was going on in New York or New Jersey and
[03:25:14.600 --> 03:25:18.200]  you said look you know look into John Gotti I mean you know there's like
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:23.520]  hijackings of 18 wheelers I mean it ain't hard I don't have a crystal ball
[03:25:23.520 --> 03:25:27.280]  here I just have all this data and then my brain can't even co-ed it all it just
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:30.520]  goes Harry Reid enemy enemy and I call watch I said it'll be it'll be him it'll
[03:25:30.520 --> 03:25:35.720]  be him I'm busy writing other articles but I will look into it and they heard
[03:25:35.720 --> 03:25:39.440]  me running around so Kit Daniels did I'm not tooting my horn it's just crazy
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:44.760]  because I just know these crooks folks I eat drink and sleep these pieces I want
[03:25:44.760 --> 03:25:48.080]  to say something I really just want to use the proper English language you know
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:51.920]  I had family in England pre-Norman and and the S word is not really a cuss word
[03:25:51.920 --> 03:25:58.080]  folks in fact it's an insult to you to shite to to even say that Harry Reid's
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:02.840]  a piece of that so excuse me I'm gonna stop right now closing comments I see
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:05.880]  you got some folks there with you David Knight you got three four minutes take us
[03:26:05.880 --> 03:26:10.720]  out of here go ahead Alex you knew that Harry Reid was up to this in some way
[03:26:10.720 --> 03:26:14.040]  because you've seen this at the local level you've talked before about how
[03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:19.600]  you've seen local governments try to use zone well not even zoning just coming
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:23.760]  around and declaring people in violation of codes and start accumulating fines on
[03:26:23.760 --> 03:26:27.200]  them on a daily basis until they can confiscate that property at the local
[03:26:27.200 --> 03:26:32.320]  level the corruption is with real estate and the people get elected there I've
[03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:36.120]  seen it in Tampa when I was younger there was Sandy Friedman they called her
[03:26:36.120 --> 03:26:39.280]  Sandlot Friedman because she condemned so many homes they use code
[03:26:39.280 --> 03:26:44.160]  enforcement and that's what's happening here only on a much bigger federal
[03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:48.520]  international scale it's nothing but the same little racket that these crooks
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:52.760]  run when they're at the at the city level now when they get to the national
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:57.480]  level the state level the international level it's the same scam they just use
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:01.960]  different justifications slightly different justifications I saw a lot of
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:05.360]  scrambling around going on saw some oathkeepers when we have in that press
