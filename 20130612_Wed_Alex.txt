[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:40.960]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.960 --> 00:47.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another worldwide transmission. It is Wednesday, the 12th day
[00:47.920 --> 00:56.920]  of June, 2013. And I really want to give the listeners and viewers of this broadcast a
[00:56.920 --> 01:05.120]  chance to sound off on all the things that have been unfolding from our coverage of The
[01:05.120 --> 01:17.200]  Globalist and the different activities that they've been involved in at Bilderberg to
[01:17.200 --> 01:25.320]  the demonization by the Republican and Democratic parties of Snowden leaking the fact that the
[01:25.320 --> 01:27.800]  NSA is spying on every man, woman, and child.
[01:27.800 --> 01:33.340]  We already knew that. They're already using them to spy and harass on the press, talking
[01:33.340 --> 01:39.840]  to whistleblowers that are exposing government criminal activity. They went after ATF people
[01:39.840 --> 01:43.740]  that blew the whistle on them shipping guns into Mexico so they could blame the Second
[01:43.740 --> 01:49.020]  Amendment. And now they're trying to say this guy's a Chinese spy or something. What about
[01:49.020 --> 01:55.720]  people being globalist spies, globalist corporate operatives in our government robbing the Treasury
[01:55.720 --> 01:59.480]  and robbing us of our Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[01:59.480 --> 02:08.240]  And then you've got the illegal immigration reform bill, which is written like Obamacare,
[02:08.240 --> 02:12.880]  where it has some nice sounding words in it, but then it's just a blank check for government
[02:12.880 --> 02:18.560]  to do whatever it wants. And the globalists want a North American Union to drive down
[02:18.560 --> 02:24.840]  wages, not to raise Mexican wages, but to drive down wages.
[02:24.840 --> 02:31.200]  And Mexico doesn't have to open its borders to Guatemala. You get six months hard labor
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.800]  if you're an illegal, they'll catch you there. And Schumer is quoted as saying illegal immigration
[02:36.800 --> 02:43.280]  will be a thing of the past. You go up to DrudgeReport.com, it's got a powerful image
[02:43.280 --> 02:50.080]  of a Las Zetas with Obama tattooed on his stomach.
[02:50.080 --> 02:54.700]  This is the type of amazing stuff that's going on. And folks, I've been to Mexico probably
[02:54.700 --> 03:00.400]  let's not exaggerate 30, 40 times. And there's a lot of neat stuff about Mexico. There's
[03:00.400 --> 03:03.280]  also a lot of horrible things about it. It's one of the most dangerous countries in the
[03:03.280 --> 03:08.920]  world and the Southwest is just collapsing into third world and that's exactly what the
[03:08.920 --> 03:09.920]  system wants.
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.440]  Meanwhile, Rand Paul says to illegals, we will find you a place. We will try to get
[03:14.440 --> 03:21.200]  a good bill to legalize legal lawful people that have been here. Because if you're legal,
[03:21.200 --> 03:27.220]  it takes you 10, 15, 20 years, 10 years to get here and then 10 years to become a citizen.
[03:27.220 --> 03:33.120]  It's too hard for people law abiding, Lee become a citizen. Because the system doesn't
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.120]  want you to go that route.
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.440]  They want you to go the illegal route. So you can have multiple identities and further
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.520]  bankrupt the country. It's all been actuated out. Your taxpayer money goes to fund the
[03:42.520 --> 03:48.400]  illegals with all the welfare and stuff as a corporate incentive, as a corporate welfare
[03:48.400 --> 03:52.200]  to bring in a group that will work for less than you can live on.
[03:52.200 --> 03:58.320]  Meanwhile, Senator Tim Kaine speaks in Spanish on the Senate floor, pushes immigration bill.
[03:58.320 --> 04:04.120]  I wonder what happened in Mexico if somebody went down there and spoke in their Congress
[04:04.120 --> 04:08.000]  in English and said, let's legalize any Americans that wanna come here. Let's give them free
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.880]  health care, let them have their babies here and pay for it.
[04:10.880 --> 04:16.600]  And I mean, they would laugh you out of the place. And if you said be loving, don't be
[04:16.600 --> 04:24.400]  mean to the Americano, you probably get shot. Because Mexico for all its failures is at
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.960]  least nationalistic. America has had its immune system politically completely dropped where
[04:29.960 --> 04:31.840]  we will put up with anything.
[04:31.840 --> 04:37.180]  Meanwhile, Snowden's put out new statements saying he's not hiding. More explosive details
[04:37.180 --> 04:41.920]  on US surveillance targets, his plans for the immediate future, steps up claims the
[04:41.920 --> 04:47.840]  US has taken since he broke cover in Hong Kong. Folks, I don't need to believe Snowden.
[04:47.840 --> 04:53.040]  This stuff's actually all public. What he's saying is not hardcore enough. It's about,
[04:53.040 --> 04:57.520]  let's not exaggerate, 10 times worse than what he's saying. Stay with us, big transmission
[04:57.520 --> 04:58.520]  coming up.
[04:58.520 --> 05:04.520]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[05:04.520 --> 05:09.440]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[05:09.440 --> 05:12.100]  It really says that the state is God.
[05:12.100 --> 05:16.640]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[05:16.640 --> 05:22.200]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[05:22.200 --> 05:27.680]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[05:27.680 --> 05:32.440]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[05:32.440 --> 05:37.720]  depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[05:37.720 --> 05:43.680]  dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on
[05:43.680 --> 05:48.760]  every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The

[08:24.400 --> 08:38.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 12th day of June 2013. I'm your host Alex
[08:38.760 --> 08:46.580]  Jones. We'll be live here for the next three hours. I do have a big whistle blower coming
[08:46.580 --> 08:51.680]  on the broadcast tonight to talk about a host of issues on the nightly news. I'll just leave
[08:51.680 --> 08:57.520]  it at that. And we have another whistle blower from inside big telecom who put in the snooping
[08:57.520 --> 09:04.880]  systems coming back. We actually have two whistle blowers from industry and the Pentagon
[09:04.880 --> 09:11.440]  coming on the transmission tonight. Info Wars Nightly News 7 o'clock Central. I'm going
[09:11.440 --> 09:15.520]  to tape the interviews before. Sometimes the show's live tonight will be taped. And then
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.160]  tomorrow we should have excerpts on the radio show for you. Before I get into the latest
[09:20.160 --> 09:26.920]  on the NSA scandal, the IRS scandal, Benghazi gate, before I get into all of it, I had a
[09:26.920 --> 09:32.300]  realization this morning when I woke up at about 4 a.m. as I'm still kind of on London
[09:32.300 --> 09:36.460]  time hours ahead of us.
[09:36.460 --> 09:44.340]  Just getting back from London Monday covering Bilderberg. I had the realization that they
[09:44.340 --> 09:49.320]  now have media matters who doesn't matter to the public. But it does matter because
[09:49.320 --> 09:54.440]  it's White House funded, White House run, White House transition chief George Soros
[09:54.440 --> 10:04.440]  funded. They spend more time attacking infowars.com and this radio show and yours truly, Alex
[10:04.440 --> 10:10.600]  Jones, than they do on anybody else now.
[10:10.600 --> 10:19.440]  Matt Drudge, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck. No, it's Alex Jones and also Rand Paul and Ted
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.760]  Cruz, because that shows you who they're really scared of. Some weeks they attack Drudge as
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.200]  much as they attack us, in fact more, but lately it's been yours truly. And that is
[10:31.200 --> 10:34.060]  directly run by the White House.
[10:34.060 --> 10:38.880]  And they're attacking us because they know we know what we're talking about. And then
[10:38.880 --> 10:44.480]  when they had Bloomberg, cuz I've reread that article this morning. When they had Bloomberg
[10:44.480 --> 10:53.920]  come out and in a big feature story and called an investigative report and say Alex Jones
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.080]  basically caused the Boston bombing.
[10:57.080 --> 11:01.360]  And they had the quote by the Southern Poverty Slime Center, who actually has been caught
[11:01.360 --> 11:06.400]  in court with one of their guys shooting up what was the Family Research Council and saying
[11:06.400 --> 11:13.880]  he did it because of them. So they've actually been caught in all that. They are then quoted
[11:13.880 --> 11:22.040]  as experts in there, saying Alex Jones doesn't build bombs, he builds bombers.
[11:22.040 --> 11:27.800]  And I was on Eric Mancal-Muller's show, by the way, he's got a new big history show coming
[11:27.800 --> 11:35.040]  out, so congratulations to him. That's actually a big show with his brother. The point is
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.840]  is I was on there and he said, why are they saying this about you? Everybody knows that
[11:39.840 --> 11:47.600]  you're against offensive violence and that you expose bombings as many times being government
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.320]  funded to take our liberties.
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.520]  And then he went on to apologize basically on air and say, I thought you were a cook
[11:53.520 --> 11:59.120]  ten years ago when I first started interviewing you. It's all come true, I apologize. And
[11:59.120 --> 12:02.960]  you better watch your back when they're doing stuff like this. And it was funny, he brought
[12:02.960 --> 12:09.080]  that up and said it because I was already thinking that this morning and then I'm on
[12:09.080 --> 12:20.480]  his show and he was talking about it.
[12:20.480 --> 12:30.080]  He was saying the same thing I was already thinking, he's a really smart guy. I mean,
[12:30.080 --> 12:33.960]  they would not be coming out. I really thought about it this morning. I woke up and I thought
[12:33.960 --> 12:39.220]  about it for a couple hours. They're in the dark of the house for the kids and my wife
[12:39.220 --> 12:45.240]  woke up, sitting there reading that article and thinking about it and then looking at
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.720]  all the other demonization pieces and everything and what popped out of my little computer,
[12:49.720 --> 12:57.200]  what popped out of my brain like the old data cards was Danger Will Robinson.
[12:57.200 --> 13:04.000]  They would not come out and say that I'm connected to bombers and that I make bombers. Which
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.680]  even though I'm a public figure, I could probably, if I really wanted to fight the case and do
[13:12.680 --> 13:16.120]  it right and file in the right district and everything, I could get a judgment against
[13:16.120 --> 13:17.120]  Bloomberg.
[13:17.120 --> 13:24.560]  Well, we got a judgment against Pittsburgh, one of my reporters, or they settled. I mean,
[13:24.560 --> 13:30.200]  I know the law pretty darn well. I made a study of it, it's very interesting. And they
[13:30.200 --> 13:35.680]  would not be risking things like that. There it is, human bombs. He does not build bombs,
[13:35.680 --> 13:44.480]  he builds bombers, they set it up on screen. And it's not just some of them quoting him,
[13:44.480 --> 13:48.280]  they say that over and over again in the article.
[13:48.280 --> 13:53.040]  And basically say the bombers did it because they were my listeners when they've killed
[13:53.040 --> 13:59.080]  two FBI agents that were on the scene. There was a drill, they've now killed one of the
[13:59.080 --> 14:04.000]  witnesses that was talking to his friends. I mean, I've been contacted by lawyers and
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.120]  family members and everything else off record.
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.840]  And I've told them, okay, if you wanna go public here, that's fine. And they're all
[14:10.840 --> 14:16.480]  being surveilled. The system is really afraid of the fact that we really caught them staging
[14:16.480 --> 14:22.440]  the London bombing. Those two brothers were total patsies, they were both on CIA payroll.
[14:22.440 --> 14:28.560]  That's come out in the foreign press, it's been confirmed, Boston bombing, Boston bombing.
[14:28.560 --> 14:34.200]  What bombing did I say? London bombing. Well, that too was carried out by MI6 and they had
[14:34.200 --> 14:40.080]  drills of targeting the same buses and the same trains at the very exact same time.
[14:40.080 --> 14:46.040]  And then I was approached by police, MI5, security people all over London saying, we
[14:46.040 --> 14:52.700]  all know the truth, we all know that that was staged. It just makes the head spin that
[14:52.700 --> 14:58.880]  they're coming after us because we freak them out by catching them with their pants down
[14:58.880 --> 15:07.060]  in a drill with patsies who were on CIA payroll on record being sent to the caucuses to go
[15:07.060 --> 15:15.940]  around and basically radicalize and create al-Qaeda cells to attack Russian held areas.
[15:15.940 --> 15:21.980]  This is an admitted publicly funded program. And they do not like the fact that I'm sitting
[15:21.980 --> 15:27.600]  here covering the things they're doing because they wanna pull off more bombings to basically
[15:27.600 --> 15:29.280]  phase in martial law.
[15:29.280 --> 15:39.440]  They wanna stage bombings to blame the Tea Party. They want this, I know their mind,
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.980]  I eat, drink and sleep this, I know the history, I know how Operation Gladio worked. Listen,
[15:44.980 --> 15:52.400]  in India, in Italy, in Germany, in England, in all these places, they can't even stage
[15:52.400 --> 15:59.080]  bombings anymore because it's come out that almost every IRA bombing for 40 years was
[15:59.080 --> 16:02.700]  MI6, MI5, SAS commandos.
[16:02.700 --> 16:08.280]  That's London Guardian, Times of London, I mean, that's admitted. You tell Brits that
[16:08.280 --> 16:12.760]  there, they don't laugh at you, they go, I know, Operation, Operative Steak Knife and
[16:12.760 --> 16:20.320]  all the rest of it. By the way, I interviewed Steak Knife and then he was dead a month later.
[16:20.320 --> 16:23.700]  You know how many people I've interviewed like the Boston Madam and Steak Knife who
[16:23.700 --> 16:24.700]  they kill?
[16:24.700 --> 16:34.260]  I mean, I can't believe I'm still alive. It just hit me, I mean, I am fearless. But it
[16:34.260 --> 16:41.440]  hit me, the reason I'm so angry is my flesh, my worldly side is extremely angry at me.
[16:41.440 --> 16:47.040]  I was psychoanalyzing this morning, why I don't like myself, why I'm so angry, why I'm
[16:47.040 --> 17:02.200]  so focused, why I'm so serious now, and I used to be a really funny, happy person. And
[17:02.200 --> 17:10.120]  it just comes down to the realization that it's all real, it's worse than I even thought,
[17:10.120 --> 17:12.560]  and I'm right in the middle of it.
[17:12.560 --> 17:18.680]  And the people that wanna do this type of stuff, to be technical, Steak Knife was kind
[17:18.680 --> 17:23.800]  of a name for several people in an operation. But I had an army commando on who blew the
[17:23.800 --> 17:28.400]  whistle and admitted it all, admitted to bombings and things. He'd been in one newspaper, he
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.040]  was a listener, he contacted us, I got him on, he was dead a month later.
[17:33.040 --> 17:37.560]  I interviewed another whistleblower over in England, and he got machine gunned off his
[17:37.560 --> 17:42.480]  motorcycle. That's why when I got approached by police and then by MI5, these guys were
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.520]  sitting there going, look, we all know it's true, we know you're right, and you better
[17:46.520 --> 17:49.640]  be safe, and we wish we could change things.
[17:49.640 --> 17:58.200]  It's because they all know, folks. And that's why I could go to England, and I could have
[17:58.200 --> 18:07.600]  police, MI5, and others come to me and say, members of Bilderberg are gonna go public,
[18:07.600 --> 18:13.080]  they're completely freaked out. You guys are doing a great job, and basically, we support
[18:13.080 --> 18:15.120]  what you're doing.
[18:15.120 --> 18:24.440]  Cuz you see, MI5, they know how many of those guys in there are child molesters. The average
[18:24.440 --> 18:29.160]  person in the government is not a criminal.
[18:29.160 --> 18:32.880]  And now they're all having a crisis of conscience, that's why you're gonna see more and more
[18:32.880 --> 18:38.000]  whistleblowers coming out. I mean, who do you think wants total power to do evil things?
[18:38.000 --> 18:46.080]  Really bad people, that's history. And it's a collection of different types of criminals,
[18:46.080 --> 18:58.160]  but I just had the realization that we really are having a huge effect, and
[18:58.160 --> 19:03.040]  that we are, I am, in danger.
[19:03.040 --> 19:13.280]  Because my gut is always right, and my gut has never told me that I am on the edge of
[19:13.280 --> 19:23.240]  the precipice, like my gut has told me. And my gut's never told me that I'm doing a good
[19:23.240 --> 19:27.980]  job like it's telling me. So I've got one side of me, the side that leans towards God
[19:27.980 --> 19:32.960]  and creation and everything that's good, is saying, well done.
[19:32.960 --> 19:38.320]  You're gonna get a good report. But my flesh is like, why don't you enjoy yourself? Why
[19:38.320 --> 19:41.680]  don't you slow down? Why don't you go along with the system a little? You don't need to
[19:41.680 --> 19:49.960]  destroy yourself. Do you know what my soul says? Full speed ahead, intensify, accelerate
[19:49.960 --> 19:55.200]  to ramming speed. And that's the decision I'm making. It's like I told you a year ago.
[19:55.200 --> 20:00.360]  We're taking the info war to the next level. Now I'm taking it to the next level.

[20:32.420 --> 20:37.300]  and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock. Chinese

[21:29.680 --> 21:34.000]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.240]  counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:38.240 --> 21:42.360]  to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[21:42.360 --> 21:45.640]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[21:45.640 --> 21:47.840]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver

[24:16.960 --> 24:26.040]  And noticing that Al Franken, the scumbag, authoritarian filth, the degenerate lover
[24:26.040 --> 24:31.340]  of death, Bill Maher, who says more abortion, more car wrecks, more death because humans
[24:31.340 --> 24:36.000]  are scum, get rid of us, less people. But ban the guns for the children because he cares
[24:36.000 --> 24:43.800]  if people die. But kill granny so he can get more money. But he loves you. Bill Maher,
[24:43.800 --> 24:50.940]  all of them have come out in defense of Obama and warrantless across the board, spying against
[24:50.940 --> 24:57.160]  the Associated Press, the media, Fast and Furious, government whistleblowers.
[24:57.160 --> 25:02.360]  How many times have I had NSA insiders like Cebel Edmonds on to tell you the NSA is really
[25:02.360 --> 25:08.840]  aimed at whistleblowers? In fact, let's get Wayne Madsen back on. Wayne Madsen, NSA whistleblower
[25:08.840 --> 25:15.120]  when he left decades ago, journalist, syndicated columnist. He said that Obama shifted even
[25:15.120 --> 25:20.360]  more than Bush to taking like a third of the NSA, to paraphrase him, he said a large portion
[25:20.360 --> 25:28.480]  of it, to just focus on the press and just focus on their opposition for dirty tricks.
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.320]  And he said that like three years ago. I was just thinking about, I said our sources said
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.420]  this, and I'm thinking, why did I know that? Well, cuz it's come out, but also I know the
[25:38.420 --> 25:42.640]  details from people that said it beforehand. And I start thinking, who told me that? Colonel
[25:42.640 --> 25:56.080]  Shafer is coming on tomorrow, big whistleblower. Cebel Edmonds, NSA, FBI translator, NSA high
[25:56.080 --> 26:04.760]  level really a commander, a division chief of the whole sector, Wayne Madsen.
[26:04.760 --> 26:09.300]  We know all this, but I don't just believe my sources. I separately have studied the
[26:09.300 --> 26:16.600]  funding and the infrastructure. And the globalists love to brag, so much of it is public so we
[26:16.600 --> 26:25.200]  know how big it is. And now you see Boner, aka Boehner, you see Chuck Schumer, you see
[26:25.200 --> 26:36.760]  them all coming out bipartisan treason and saying this man Snowden, he's a traitor.
[26:36.760 --> 26:45.800]  And the only way Snowden is a traitor, Edward Snowden, is if it's an elaborate hoax with
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.160]  all the NSA stuff already out to make it come out that he is a Chinese or Russian spy to
[26:51.160 --> 26:55.840]  make it look traitorous to expose this. And watching what he said and looking at him in
[26:55.840 --> 27:02.520]  his history, he doesn't fit the MO of that, because the revelations would have been smaller.
[27:02.520 --> 27:09.440]  My gut tells me Snowden is for real. Let me tell you who a traitor is, is Boehner. It
[27:09.440 --> 27:14.380]  turns out Congress and Ron Paul and Rand Paul, they'll talk about this now, has been briefed.
[27:14.380 --> 27:17.680]  They were given national security gag orders that I don't believe are constitutional. I
[27:17.680 --> 27:24.560]  mean, the Congress and the Intelligence Committee, they're in charge of all this.
[27:24.560 --> 27:32.040]  And to allow the NSA and the Pentagon to dictate to them is the cart before the horse. And
[27:32.040 --> 27:39.860]  really, it's an excuse to go along with all this. I mean, it's come out that the cloak
[27:39.860 --> 27:46.360]  room was being tapped. And I even predicted, they'll claim it's Democratic operatives or
[27:46.360 --> 27:53.120]  private corporations doing it, because 99% of the spying now, literally, is done by 800,000
[27:53.120 --> 27:55.800]  private contractors.
[27:55.800 --> 28:08.340]  Look at Snowden. He was working for a big private group. What, Booz Allen? So that's
[28:08.340 --> 28:12.820]  the issue here, is they're spying on each other. I mean, it came out a few years ago
[28:12.820 --> 28:20.800]  that MI6 and MI5 were spying on the Parliament, on the elected government, to be able to have
[28:20.800 --> 28:23.680]  the bureaucracy head them off at the pass.
[28:23.680 --> 28:29.560]  What's happening is the bureaucracy is completely taking over, and the bureaucracy isn't even
[28:29.560 --> 28:38.680]  a government bureaucracy. It's a private corporate bureaucracy. I was reading where one spy firm
[28:38.680 --> 28:49.120]  just in cybersecurity last month got a $10 billion contract for 2014. One company just
[28:49.120 --> 28:57.020]  on spying on us, $10 billion. I mean, you go to these NSA bases, and entire wings are
[28:57.020 --> 28:58.840]  run by different defense contractors.
[28:58.840 --> 29:05.000]  A lot of them are foreign companies. But they're always, do what we say, let us spy on you.
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.080]  We're fighting against the Russians and the Chinese. If we weren't here, they would get
[29:09.080 --> 29:14.640]  you. They would get me? The globalists have already moved all our jobs to China. The globalists
[29:14.640 --> 29:23.760]  are in bed with the Communist Chinese, cuz they're authoritarians, like them.
[29:23.760 --> 29:26.800]  So when we come back, I'm gonna get to some of these clips with Ron Paul, Rand Paul, and
[29:26.800 --> 29:34.360]  others. But we're gonna get Wayne Madsen on today, if not tomorrow. He is on today. We
[29:34.360 --> 29:38.840]  were working on earlier. He is on today, 1 o'clock. So an hour and 30 minutes, T minus.
[29:38.840 --> 29:43.640]  I'm gonna have him really get into NSA. I mean, he is the expert on this. And then I've
[29:43.640 --> 29:49.880]  got bombshell whistleblowers on tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[29:49.880 --> 30:01.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.400 --> 30:06.120]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[30:06.120 --> 30:10.880]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When

[31:01.160 --> 31:05.560]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[31:05.560 --> 31:10.680]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[31:10.680 --> 31:16.180]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[31:16.180 --> 31:21.280]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[31:21.280 --> 31:28.400]  at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds

[33:01.520 --> 33:14.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.920 --> 33:24.200]  I've absolutely got to get into all this news. I mean, Obama outside of Congress is putting
[33:24.200 --> 33:31.080]  with an executive order, it's not even executive order, it's just an executive directive added
[33:31.080 --> 33:38.360]  on to microwave oven regulations, boosting the price of carbon in the United States that's
[33:38.360 --> 33:45.160]  paid into carbon trading funds that he and the pig piece of garbage, death camp owning
[33:45.160 --> 33:54.120]  in China, slave camp owning in China, Al Gore, you have to pay money into them.
[33:54.120 --> 33:59.440]  I mean, it's a totally criminal conflict of interest waddling around in front of us with
[33:59.440 --> 34:04.400]  the general public in a coma. That's why I get so angry at these people. They are just
[34:04.400 --> 34:11.760]  the most disgusting authoritarian scumbag criminals. And you've got all these camp followers,
[34:11.760 --> 34:16.440]  so-called liberals that are really authoritarians who feel like they're part of a gang who will
[34:16.440 --> 34:22.840]  salute and support drone killing, torture, funding Al Qaeda, spying on us, warrantless
[34:22.840 --> 34:27.360]  checkpoints, government arming to the teeth against the people.
[34:27.360 --> 34:30.240]  And as long as they feel like they're winners and are part of the establishment, they're
[34:30.240 --> 34:36.440]  for it. So we're gonna get into all of that. I'm gonna get into the whistleblowing on the
[34:36.440 --> 34:42.040]  NSA in detail. We're gonna open the phones up and take your calls. Wayne Madsen's gonna
[34:42.040 --> 34:49.840]  join us. Just briefly, we sold out the last edition of Infowars magazine.
[34:49.840 --> 34:54.280]  Most editions sell out. This one will probably sell out. It's the elite plan global takeover.

[37:21.760 --> 37:25.480]  the word whistleblower because these people are coming on and just talking about on record
[37:25.480 --> 37:27.480]  what's going on.
[37:27.480 --> 37:32.000]  So I forgot one guy doesn't want to be called that. He's just getting into what as a citizen
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.840]  is on record and what he can talk about. But you notice when we have big whistleblowers
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.620]  though you never hear about it because they just hope nobody picks up on it. But more
[37:42.620 --> 37:51.120]  and more people are. And finally, we have the best vitamins, minerals, trace elements,

[38:51.200 --> 38:53.120]  That is most important and pray for us.
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.520]  Okay, that's a mid-air refueling, as I call it, to fund our media operation. We're not
[38:57.520 --> 39:04.000]  funded by George Soros or the White House like MSNBC or Media Matters or Bloomberg,
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.160]  funded by all their insider knowledge and all of his activities with his 15 bodyguards
[39:09.160 --> 39:11.280]  but doesn't want you to be able to own a gun.
[39:11.280 --> 39:18.400]  He writes yellow journalism pieces about how, quote, I don't build bombs, I build bombers.
[39:18.400 --> 39:22.160]  I guess if somebody comes up and punches you in the nose, and then you decide to defend
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.920]  yourself, you're a bad guy. Or if somebody says, hey, it's not right to bully someone,
[39:26.920 --> 39:30.680]  you're inciting them to bomb. No, I'm not. I'm inciting people to wake up and take our
[39:30.680 --> 39:34.640]  country back, and that's why you're scared of me.
[39:34.640 --> 39:38.480]  That's why you're scared. And you know what, New World Order, I studied history, so have
[39:38.480 --> 39:42.900]  you. You should be scared. You should be scared of all the crimes you've committed and the
[39:42.900 --> 39:47.960]  insanity of thinking that you could ever, ever in a million years get away with what
[39:47.960 --> 39:48.960]  you've done.
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.840]  Let me give the number out, then I'm gonna get into the news. Let me ask you this question.
[39:53.840 --> 40:03.400]  Do you think, to use the cliche, that Mr. Edward Snowden, the CIA surveillance tech,
[40:03.400 --> 40:08.200]  and then, again, most of it, over 99% of it, from what I've seen in the funding at least
[40:08.200 --> 40:10.360]  now, is done by private contractors?
[40:10.360 --> 40:17.960]  The huge cash cow of how he pointed out any analyst can get into your bank account, listen
[40:17.960 --> 40:24.240]  to your phone, you name it. Yeah, I've talked to FBI agents, and that was like seven, eight
[40:24.240 --> 40:30.360]  years ago I talked to an FBI agent. And then I talked to some federal marshals, a senior
[40:30.360 --> 40:33.840]  one, talked to a whole group of them.
[40:33.840 --> 40:40.640]  And now I think about, wow, people get arrested for this now. I mean, I'm on here saying things
[40:40.640 --> 40:50.680]  that they might be bold enough to say, take that man away. But I remember having a particular
[40:50.680 --> 40:54.360]  FBI agent tell me, Alex, you're absolutely right, I don't know how you know all this
[40:54.360 --> 40:55.920]  stuff.
[40:55.920 --> 41:02.360]  But the local police don't know it. But the systems that are at the threat fusion centers
[41:02.360 --> 41:09.720]  waiting to be turned on can type in your social security number and it will pull up your known
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.360]  group of cell phones. And then we can hit a button and listen to what you're doing.
[41:14.360 --> 41:26.040]  We can kill your car with the OnStar and listen to you. We can turn your phone on even when
[41:26.040 --> 41:27.040]  it's off.
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.320]  And he goes, but I guess you know all that. And I'm like, well, yeah, it's in the Telecommunications
[41:31.320 --> 41:35.640]  Act, the money, the infrastructure for it. And I was visited by a telecommunications
[41:35.640 --> 41:43.000]  whistleblower, come to me in 1997. In fact, I had a whole bunch of them.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.280]  I had a whistleblower from Time Warner come to me about the digital cable boxes, an engineer
[41:48.280 --> 41:53.160]  with a degree, an engineering degree from a prestigious university. And one of the head
[41:53.160 --> 41:59.020]  engineers for Time Warner here locally. I had a telecommunications engineer from a big
[41:59.020 --> 42:02.200]  phone company come to me, and man, I didn't know what I was reading.
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.200]  It was specs and boxes. They used to say, whatever you do, shred that or burn that.
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.000]  I threw it in a dumpster when you're done, okay? And these are like engineers with a
[42:11.000 --> 42:18.520]  pocket protectors, gray-haired guys sweating in parking lots. And you're 24 years old,
[42:18.520 --> 42:24.540]  you're 25 years old, and you go to the library, you go online, you find the confirmations
[42:24.540 --> 42:26.220]  of what they're telling you.
[42:26.220 --> 42:31.840]  And that's why all of you listening go, yeah, you did say 17 years ago, 16 years ago, 10
[42:31.840 --> 42:37.360]  years ago, everything that's now come out. Because I had whistleblowers, there was nobody
[42:37.360 --> 42:44.120]  on air talking about this stuff. Let me tell you, when I talked to that Time Warner guy,
[42:44.120 --> 42:46.960]  and I said, there's microphones listening to you two-way, and they're tracking what
[42:46.960 --> 42:56.640]  you watch in psychological profiles, I mean, I got death threats over that.
[42:56.640 --> 43:00.800]  I got in the face of a federal judge over a fake trial he was having, and they sent
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.880]  people to beat me up. And to tell me to shut up while they were punching me in the face.
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.620]  Of course, I went completely ape hillbilly on them, and they didn't like what happened,
[43:09.620 --> 43:12.120]  but I gave a lot better than they gave.
[43:12.120 --> 43:20.080]  But the point is, is that, let me tell you, I've lived this, ladies and gentlemen, I have
[43:20.080 --> 43:32.040]  lived this. Where engineers are sitting there at Time Warner Cable in Austin with two-way
[43:32.040 --> 43:37.080]  cable with government boxes. And I said, well, what do you mean? He goes, we are the NSA,
[43:37.080 --> 43:42.080]  there's whole floors, everything, the microphones are in it, they're listening.
[43:42.080 --> 43:47.160]  I can watch the data, I've gotta run it, it all feeds into them, we're paid. Because sometimes
[43:47.160 --> 43:56.960]  they get late paying, and it's even my job to try to do billing. That Time Warner whistleblower
[43:56.960 --> 44:06.640]  was like in 1997. And then what happens is you get one whistleblower, and then more whistleblowers
[44:06.640 --> 44:07.640]  come.
[44:07.640 --> 44:14.360]  And I mean, I was just a kid, folks. And I'd get a call, this is Thomas Sanchez, the head
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.440]  of emergency management in Kingsville County. I'd like you to come down here, I'd like to
[44:19.440 --> 44:24.040]  meet with you. Delta Force has come and offered me money and offered, most of the commissioners
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.400]  have taken money in the county and they're preparing for martial law.
[44:27.400 --> 44:32.800]  They say it's a psychological testing program. And I was in intelligence in Vietnam, and
[44:32.800 --> 44:38.000]  this is unpatriotic, and you talk about this, so I wanna come on your show. He came on.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.960]  Then the San Antonio police chief will do an interview if you call him. And I go down,
[44:42.960 --> 44:47.160]  the San Antonio police chief tells me the same thing. People say, if this was going
[44:47.160 --> 44:56.760]  on, people would blow the whistle. They do blow the whistle, they do. And then nobody
[44:56.760 --> 44:58.240]  did anything.
[44:58.240 --> 45:05.060]  Nobody stopped it, nobody reversed it, nobody tried to turn the pendulum back. And now folks,
[45:05.060 --> 45:14.980]  the word from people I know high up in banking, I know through a connection, the president,
[45:14.980 --> 45:24.140]  not the CEO, not the chairman, but the president of one of the big six banks.
[45:24.140 --> 45:28.280]  That there is no way to fix the derivatives, they did it by design, it's going to collapse,
[45:28.280 --> 45:33.240]  and they are going to take everyone's bank accounts. I've been telling you that for over
[45:33.240 --> 45:41.280]  a decade, and now they're getting ready to do it. They want you to be completely bankrupted,
[45:41.280 --> 45:43.480]  they want complete control.
[45:43.480 --> 45:47.320]  They're all exempt from the taxes. They're a mafia, ladies and gentlemen, that makes
[45:47.320 --> 45:52.160]  other mafias pale in significance. So I wanna get your take as an audience. How could anyone
[45:52.160 --> 46:00.960]  call the prism leaker, Edward Snowden, a traitor? The people that have allowed this to go on,
[46:00.960 --> 46:06.160]  they're the traitors. I would tell you in 97 that your digital cable box was listening
[46:06.160 --> 46:08.060]  to you and recording everything in your house.
[46:08.060 --> 46:16.160]  Now it's all public, that your TiVo and your Scientific Atlantic box and your Connect.
[46:16.160 --> 46:26.600]  Now the Connect fires wireless internet, one of the models, through your house through
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.620]  walls. And I've even seen the demonstrations, you can pull them up online, and it shows
[46:31.620 --> 46:40.320]  you walking around in your house, but two rooms over. And it can listen to you through
[46:40.320 --> 46:48.800]  your house. It has audio, it has face scanning, it has wireless redirected out scanning through
[46:48.800 --> 46:50.240]  your walls.
[46:50.240 --> 46:55.080]  It makes a smart meter look primitive, and it's sitting there data scanning you made
[46:55.080 --> 47:01.120]  by a eugenicist, made by a globalist who publicly has said he wants to reduce world population
[47:01.120 --> 47:09.980]  massively. And young people are paying money to bring this robot into your house. Yeah,
[47:09.980 --> 47:17.100]  there it is. What university is that? University of Washington, Wi-Fi signals enable gesture
[47:17.100 --> 47:20.700]  resignation throughout entire home.
[47:20.700 --> 47:23.980]  See how they roll it out like a service? Yeah, you'll be able to have hands free anywhere
[47:23.980 --> 47:29.720]  in the house, you'll just do an A in the air and it will recognize that gesture and do
[47:29.720 --> 47:36.720]  an A. You know, let's say your passcode is ant. You'll just go A-N-T, and see that all
[47:36.720 --> 47:46.840]  sounds great, except it's two way. It's an NSA global kill robot. This is what you want,
[47:46.840 --> 47:53.760]  this is what you get.
[47:53.760 --> 47:58.380]  And I mean, these are not nice people that want to spy on everyone like angels to end
[47:58.380 --> 48:05.560]  all war and end all problems. They want you dead. I was on ManCal this morning. He's actually
[48:05.560 --> 48:08.480]  taping it for tomorrow. He's live a lot, but he taped some segments for the next day. He
[48:08.480 --> 48:09.480]  was taping it for tomorrow to be technical.
[48:09.480 --> 48:12.960]  People are like, listen to ManCal, you weren't on there. I've heard that before, it's on
[48:12.960 --> 48:16.520]  tomorrow. And he was asking, what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole? And I go, they're
[48:16.520 --> 48:21.240]  killing us all with cancer, viruses, SV40 and others with vaccines, blah, blah, blah.
[48:21.240 --> 48:27.920]  It just hits me that this is real. I'm telling the truth. This is happening. And I really
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.800]  should be a self-preservation coward. And I should really just either go along with
[48:32.800 --> 48:36.280]  this or I should just get out of the country and try to go hide.
[48:36.280 --> 48:41.080]  But when you realize it is a master total takeover plan against all of humanity and
[48:41.080 --> 48:45.520]  you think about all the innocent children. I mean, I can hardly be in the room now with
[48:45.520 --> 48:51.800]  my innocent good children because it's something beyond rage now when I think about how innocent
[48:51.800 --> 48:52.800]  and good they are.
[48:52.800 --> 48:55.920]  And I think about how evil the globalists are, that they would commit crimes of this
[48:55.920 --> 49:01.440]  magnitude against humanity and be putting all this stuff in the vaccines on purpose
[49:01.440 --> 49:13.920]  and trying to shovel GMO on kids to hurt little sweet children. I mean, it's just, it's beyond
[49:13.920 --> 49:21.360]  rage. I can't look at Dianne Feinstein. I can't look at Obama. I can't look at Boehner.
[49:21.360 --> 49:26.800]  I can't look at any of these people anymore. They are just scum. And they're all in on
[49:26.800 --> 49:27.800]  it.
[49:27.800 --> 49:31.840]  Let me give you a newsflash. At speaker of the house level or at presidential level,
[49:31.840 --> 49:37.360]  they're in on the club. You know what's going on at Bilderberg? Life extension discussions
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.440]  and how to keep it from the public. And what did Ken Clark, number three in the British
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.880]  government say? What did Ball say when they gave statements? They said, we discussed the
[49:46.880 --> 49:53.240]  European Union and global governance, and we discussed new medical advances and these
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.800]  wild looks in their eyes.
[49:57.800 --> 50:01.920]  These pigs think they're gonna take the whole world over for themselves and dam us off from
[50:01.920 --> 50:07.840]  the future. I'm not gonna sit around and put up with it. What about you? There are things
[50:07.840 --> 50:14.360]  worse than death and turning innocence over. Any time I have the shadow of the inkling
[50:14.360 --> 50:17.040]  of fear in the back of my mind, it's not even that.
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.880]  It's more, it's self centeredness, wanting to see the world, wanting to enjoy beauty,
[50:21.880 --> 50:29.160]  wanting to spend time. Any time I have a selfish thought about my life and being killed or
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.920]  demonized or any of it, I just think about all the kids. These people got cornered right
[50:32.920 --> 50:38.080]  now in slave camps, in sex slavery camps, the ones they're killing with vaccines, all
[50:38.080 --> 50:41.880]  of it. I just think about all those kids they've got, they're hurting right now, and all I
[50:41.880 --> 50:46.760]  want to do is get the new world order off of them. Bunch of hyenas tearing kids apart
[50:46.760 --> 50:50.280]  and all I can think about is charging in and dealing with these people. But I need your
[50:50.280 --> 51:02.240]  help doing that. 800-25-99231. Is Snowden a hero or a zero? 800-25-99231.

[54:20.280 --> 54:29.120]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm Central. We're here live. By the way, the NSA was listening
[54:29.120 --> 54:37.560]  to everything pre-9-11 and Cybill Edmonds was working for the FBI on NSA intercepts
[54:37.560 --> 54:42.960]  and she's broken her gag order. She told Congress all of this and most of it's come out separately
[54:42.960 --> 54:49.840]  confirming what she said. She said they were running drugs, guns, Al-Qaeda, commanding
[54:49.840 --> 54:56.900]  Usama bin Laden, they were listening to the CIA command bin Laden and command the hijackers
[54:56.900 --> 55:00.480]  in what they thought was a drill and they were running white slaves.
[55:00.480 --> 55:04.960]  And I always get idiots sending me emails saying, well, don't you care about black slavery?
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.760]  White slavery means sex slaves, folks, for new listeners. I mean, she's on record. I'm
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.920]  gonna explain to you again, they're not spying on you to keep you safe. They're spying on
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.640]  you to make sure they can snatch kids out of your backyard and get away with it. Okay,
[55:20.640 --> 55:22.440]  all right, good.
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.840]  They don't just chase the pages around at the Capitol. They don't just have all these
[55:26.840 --> 55:35.240]  diplomats getting caught with 10-year-old girls. No, no, that's kind of light stuff.
[55:35.240 --> 55:40.040]  You don't get in the higher echelons unless you like to club little kids' heads in. And
[55:40.040 --> 55:44.240]  I'm sorry if you wanna hear all this. They already say babies that aren't born aren't
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.120]  trans, they killed 53 million of them so far.
[55:48.120 --> 55:51.560]  And by illustrating that they're doing it, we can stop it by going, you know that nine
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.640]  month old baby that you're strangling or throwing in the toilet to drown? That's murder and
[55:56.640 --> 56:02.560]  you're going to jail. How dare you extremist? No, I'm not an extremist, I have a heart.
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.040]  Other people are gonna join me and we're gonna have grand juries indict you and we're gonna
[56:06.040 --> 56:11.900]  put you under the jail. How's that sound, New World Order? How's that sound? See, we
[56:11.900 --> 56:15.960]  know who you are and I'm aware of what you're doing and I see you.
[56:15.960 --> 56:22.000]  And I'm gonna make sure everybody else sees you and we're gonna get our hands legally
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.780]  and lawfully through the court system when we take this country back around your throat
[56:29.780 --> 56:38.400]  with a rope. And there's gonna be rejoicing when your neck snap at the end of that thing.
[56:38.400 --> 56:43.000]  So you better do everything. Go ahead, come after me, whatever you're gonna do, I'm coming
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  for you.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.720]  You understand that, murderers? I'm coming for you. I know who you are, putting cancer
[56:49.720 --> 56:54.920]  viruses in the vaccines. This is the reality, folks. We beat them by being hardcore. We
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.440]  beat them by going all the way and saying who they really are. We don't beat them by
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.200]  eating around the edges. We don't beat them by, why are you targeting the Tea Party? Why
[57:03.200 --> 57:05.880]  are you targeting the press?
[57:05.880 --> 57:09.600]  We beat them by blowing the whistle. We beat them by going all the way. We beat them by
[57:09.600 --> 57:14.560]  standing up to them. We beat them by seeing what they're doing. Let's go to a quick clip
[57:14.560 --> 57:22.840]  of Ron Paul. Quick clip of Ron Paul talking about how he hopes that the government doesn't
[57:22.840 --> 57:23.960]  send a drone to kill Snowden.
[57:23.960 --> 57:27.440]  No, they won't do that. They'll throw a bag over to his head, take him and torture him
[57:27.440 --> 57:31.360]  for a couple months, and then promise to kill his family if he doesn't come out and say
[57:31.360 --> 57:35.640]  he was a Chinese spy. That's what they'll do. Let's go to the tape.
[57:35.640 --> 57:37.600]  Where do you think he is right now? Are you worried about that?
[57:37.600 --> 57:44.520]  I have no idea. Yeah, I'm worried about somebody, and our government might kill him with a cruise
[57:44.520 --> 57:50.600]  missile or a drone missile. I mean, we live in a bad time where American citizens don't
[57:50.600 --> 57:57.040]  even have rights and that they can be killed. But the gentleman is trying to tell the truth
[57:57.040 --> 58:02.520]  about what's going on. He's not defecting. There's no signs of that happening. It's a
[58:02.520 --> 58:06.200]  shame that we're in an age where people who tell the truth about what the government's
[58:06.200 --> 58:10.240]  doing gets into trouble.
[58:10.240 --> 58:14.360]  And then Rand Paul has come out and said, well, yeah, Congress was briefed. We were
[58:14.360 --> 58:19.080]  given gag orders. But at least he's saying arrest the people that are illegally doing
[58:19.080 --> 58:27.360]  all this. Yes, arrest them. I mean, you take one look at Hayden. You take one look at all
[58:27.360 --> 58:35.000]  these people. I mean, these are sickos in blue suits. I mean, I am not bowing down to
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.880]  these people anymore, folks. OK?

[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:16.160]  media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:36.360]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.820]  are now into our number two. I'm going to be taking your phone calls. I got a bunch
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:45.560]  of audio clips. We're going to be getting into Obama's going ahead with carbon taxes
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:50.800]  outside of Congress that are paid directly to him and Al Gore and others. It's just unbelievably
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.620]  outrageous. That's being reported by Bloomberg, who, of course, has been promoting and must
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:01.400]  be very happy. Obama quietly raises carbon prices, cost the climate increase. Look how
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.720]  Bloomberg reports it. Like if there's a storm, it's because you didn't pay Bloomberg or Al
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:12.320]  Gore that pig Obama money about pig just like up there, even act like they're communists.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.640]  They're not even communists. There's these globalist kleptocrats who walk around annihilating
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:24.280]  all businesses they don't own. It's just disgusting, disgusting filth. Continuing here, DHS funded
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:30.440]  exercise portrays free American citizens as terrorists. So this is our top story today.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.640]  And I get so wound up on the other news I got into. I didn't cover this in the first
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.960]  hour. This is our top story. This is huge. This is big. And I want to also ask the crew
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.760]  in there. I want you to go into this article and print me the Boston Globe that came with
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.200]  it. It's at the bottom of the second paragraph, so show people it's in the Boston Globe. A
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:58.760]  couple months before the bombing. They were going to have a drill where the Tea Party
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:07.800]  bombs the public on a public street in Boston with backpack bombs. Boy, in that way, if
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.280]  any of their operatives get caught doing it, they just say, oh, it's part of the drill.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.720]  Then that worked like Sweden. And of course, they were a few days after going to blame
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.200]  the Tea Party. They said it's a Tea Partier. They've got him. He's at the courthouse.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.840]  They're going to release the news. And then thank God we got photos of the drill and all
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.640]  the rest of it and the witnesses. And then they had to back off and I guess burn some
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.920]  of their they always have backup groups to burn.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.840]  So the brothers were out partying and having a great time. They thought, hey, we're in
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.760]  the CIA. This is awesome. You know, they were in the CIA. They were funded. They were operatives.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.480]  They were idiots. They were according to the CIA. They were useful idiots and they were
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:50.120]  set up. There's no doubting that they're killing all the witnesses around them. But I'm crazy
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:55.040]  to look at that. I'm I'm nuts. But that's not even the angle. Our article doesn't even
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:01.240]  get into all that. It gets into they were having a drill that was scheduled for next
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240]  month.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.120]  It was booked, whatever it was three months ago, a few months before the bombing of the
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:15.480]  Tea Party tripe right wing group that wears a, you know, American flag, Uncle Sam hat.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.480]  That's the symbol of it. And they were going to blow up the people just like just like
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:26.840]  I was able to dig up. The articles a few months ago when it was back in the news where they're
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:32.280]  training all over the country that that the homeschoolers are going to attack the public
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.280]  schools.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.560]  Yes. And they have drills unannounced where they traumatized the children, telling them
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:43.080]  all that this is coming. So when we come back from break, we're going to go to Ron and Robert
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:49.720]  and Regina and Chris and Aaron and many others that are patiently holding. Then I'm gonna
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.920]  get into this top story and then I'm going to get into Obama's minion.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:02.120]  Biden warns GOP led by two young senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. And he warned in the
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.800]  speech, they won't work with us. They're dangerous. We've got to stop them, these Tea Party people
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.320]  being elected. That's real Tea Party, not the fake Tea Party the Republicans tried to
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320]  co-opt.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.760]  Let me tell you, how do you know Rand Paul is good and Ted Cruz are good? Because the
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.280]  Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership have tried to do everything they can to bring
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:29.280]  them down. And whenever Biden's talking to his biggest supporters and millionaire donors,
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.320]  all he's doing is whining 24 seven about Rand Paul, because they've got Rand Paul's phones
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.320]  tap folks.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.720]  They know Rand Paul is a patriot. Ted Cruz, I don't know him well, so I don't know if
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:47.360]  I can trust him. I like what I see. And so there you go. But I know Rand Paul's for real
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:55.080]  as good as it gets. And they know he's been playing them, not the other way around. We'll
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:01.080]  be right back. Stay with us.

[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:11.320]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:16.480]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:13.040]  Big Brother. Mainstream Media. Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:22.320]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:30.200]  Here's some of the headlines. You can't make this stuff up. DHS funded exercise portrays
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:38.760]  free American citizens. That's a quote. Tea Partiers as terrorist cells who their training
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:45.240]  might commit a Boston bombing. Branding of the Tea Party as violent extremist accelerates.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:52.600]  I'd say so in that big cover story in Bloomberg just a few days ago. They say, quote, Alex
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:59.440]  Jones doesn't build bombs, he builds bombers. When I call for nonviolence outside of a jury,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:04.480]  you know, finding a ax murderer guilty and executing him. I mean, I'm for due process
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.920]  and everybody knows that. But I am trying to rile the people up to the open tyranny
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.440]  to take our country back. And if the tyrants try to oppress us or ship us off to a FEMA
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:20.040]  camp, well, you know, we got the Second Amendment for that. And that's on my right. The globalists
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:27.240]  using our money to arm to the teeth and spy on us and deindustrialize us. It's incredible.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.920]  So that's coming up. I'm going to get to the big news, too. Obama quietly raises carbon
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:37.120]  prices. Cost to climate increased. I mean, what do you say about a headline? They say
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.560]  a picture can tell a thousand words. I could write a book off that treasonous Bloomberg
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:54.100]  Decepticon headline. It's illegal for Obama in a regulation to raise the price when Congress
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:58.560]  hasn't even passed carbon taxes, but they already had him in there. Now he's raised
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:05.400]  it, but then gives waivers to all his friends. And then he sits on the boards and has massive
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.360]  stock in the Chicago climate.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:17.360]  Carbon exchange. And then Gore owns the London exchange. It's called Gore and blood. That's
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:25.900]  not a pun. The other partners named blood. Look it up, I'm not joking. And if they can
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:29.860]  force this through, it is a tax to them. Why not? They take Europeans bank accounts and
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:34.660]  give it to private bankers. We pay $85 billion a month going up on the national debt that's
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.360]  more than doubled since Obama got in to give to foreign banks and Congress is told, sit
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360]  down and shut up.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:47.460]  I'm not gonna tell you where that money's going. Yeah, it's $85 billion a month, but
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:52.680]  we're not gonna tell you Congress who gets it. Sit down and shut up. No, Congress is
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.880]  just over the power of the purse, but that's just the Constitution. Just a bleeping piece
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:05.240]  of paper. Yeah, there's another Bloomberg article. Gore and blood linked CO2 to subprime
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:12.240]  debt. Isn't that just special?
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.760]  Yeah, Bloomberg though is not telling you now, Obama raises the price of the collapsing
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:30.560]  carbon market to line his pockets. Or Obama raises price of direct tax to him. And then,
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:38.440]  the headlines got more cuz it says Obama quietly raises carbon price. You could write a book
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.080]  about that statement.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:50.480]  And then after it, as cost to climate increases, cuz Bloomberg says it's the science that carbon
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.480]  dioxide that we exhale is heating the planet even though the science is the opposite. And
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.860]  they've been proven to be known frauds and their emails are public. Doesn't matter, Bloomberg
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:06.120]  says as the cost to the climate, he says carbon dioxide out of coal powered plants is a toxic
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.560]  waste and it's hurting the Earth cuz they wave their magic wand, and that's the way
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.420]  it is.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:18.100]  And so you need to sit down and you need to shut up. And then the idiots go, what do you
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:26.120]  work for the oil companies? Most of the big oil companies, Dutch Royal Shell, BP. The
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:31.320]  only one that didn't 100% go along was Exxon Mobil. And then five years ago, Rex Tillerson,
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.000]  the board meeting was broken up. David Rockefeller showed up and he said, you will be removed
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  right now.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.780]  I'm the owner of this company. And the other big six or seven companies that were broken
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.360]  up under Standard Oil, still the owner, they just broke them up. You are fired right now,
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:50.680]  Tillerson, if you don't do this. By the way, that was in the news. Type in Rex Tillerson,
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:56.080]  David Rockefeller, click web, you can pull it up. It was a North Carolina newspaper reported
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.320]  on it cuz the meeting was in North Carolina.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:08.040]  The point is, is that it's the oil companies lobbying to shut off coal. Gee, I wonder why.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:16.000]  Coal's 52% of the energy in this country. They can use coal in some of the processes
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.500]  to make diesel. So they do shut down all the oil and then try to jack up prices, they can
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:26.440]  go to that. It's got a bunch of other distillates used that oil competes with.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.580]  So let me explain something to all you morons out there. I get zero money from oil, zero
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:40.320]  money from gas. I've got family in East Texas, after they got these tiny, like where the
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.320]  neighbor has a gas well that pumps so much and then you get a $500 check a month or something.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.520]  And by the way, it's the gas companies that lobby against coal as well.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.440]  So if I was, I've never got any money from it, but if I was, I would lobby for natural
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.280]  gas. It's actually a pretty good fuel as well. I mean, separately, but I would be lobbying
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.960]  against coal because I guess I've got connections to natural gas.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:11.860]  But the issue I'm getting at here, ladies and gentlemen, is that it's come out in lawsuits
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:18.920]  that big oil by and large, not the local wildcatters and people, but big oil, they want to shut
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:26.760]  down their competition, duh, duh. And General Electric wants it shut down because they got
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.680]  three years ago a waiver, look it up, from Obama, where they can put out whatever they
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.080]  want out of their smokestacks.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.400]  Their competition can't even put water, vapor, and carbon dioxide out now without having
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:47.720]  to pay one of five different global exchanges. Private people, you have to go buy it from
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.760]  Al the pig gore, from the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers. And then it's all selectively
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:59.120]  enforced and then I just can't get over the dumb hippie types who aren't bad people.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.500]  They're not Malthusian eugenicist scum, they mean well. But they're so ignorant, they really
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:15.780]  don't understand that 51% of our energy consumption is coal. And that if they shut that down, we're
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:22.200]  dead in the water. Meanwhile, the globalists have heavily invested in China, where they
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:28.740]  build three new plants a week, strangely enough, we shut down average more than three a week.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:35.920]  So our power is being turned off for factories, for your home, the prices go up. I mean, you've
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.600]  seen the price of energy go up. If you plug your electric car in, it's coming from coal
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.420]  most of the time, that's going up.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:48.340]  They're tearing down the dams, the hydroelectrics, we're being conquered economically. And it's
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.840]  on record they're doing this. And then look at these headlines, I'm gonna cover this down
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:16:00.200]  and then come back and go to break. Look at these headlines. CNBC, students are clamoring
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.840]  for fossil fuel divestment. And they have the universities owned by big mega conglomerates,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.200]  tax free families, come to them and then have all the students clamor and have rallies that
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.880]  are university sponsored to have the pension funds and the school endowments divest.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:24.160]  And when you hear fossil fuel, it ain't oil, folks, mainly. It is in the coal units of
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:31.320]  those. And of course, foreigners like the communist Chinese, they snap up those stocks
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.320]  immediately. In fact, I saw a study out a month ago that actually this divestment is
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.520]  just making the stock go up cuz the stock had always been locked up, people would just
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:45.480]  sell it. There's only so much of it. So now, it's actually getting out there into the market.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.560]  You think that drive it down, but actually driving it up making interest as people go,
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.160]  I can get that now. It's kind of like when they sell out of something at the grocery
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.000]  store and it comes back in or by rushes in to get it.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.440]  But I mean, just talk about useful idiot morons running around going, I wanna save the atmosphere,
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:09.080]  shut off the coal plants when our plants are clean as a whistle. And look, if they're suppressing
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:14.520]  all sorts of better energy systems, but they're not letting those roll out. I mean, I'm telling
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.360]  you folks, Texas was just energy dependent four years ago.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:23.440]  We got to buy a bunch of our power from Mexico now, and it's totally dirty stacks one mile
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:32.520]  over the border. Look it up. So buried in a little noticed rule, was out of Bloomberg
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:38.440]  on microwave ovens is a change in the US government's accounting for carbon emissions. It's just
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.400]  an accounting thing, stroke of the pen while the land kind of cool, that could have wide
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:48.360]  ranging implications for everything from power plants to the Keystone XL pipeline.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.400]  The increase of the so called social cost of carbon. See, it just says that. It just
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:59.400]  says, again, stating it's a fact that it's hurting the earth, to $38 a metric ton from
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.640]  2380 adjust the calculation the government uses to weigh costs and benefits of proposed
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:10.040]  regulations. The figure is meant to approximate losses from global warming. Again, as if it's
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.520]  a fact, such as flood damage and diminished crops.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.040]  And then they have a huge secret geoengineering program that's admitted to exist, which we
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:23.380]  talked to all the meteorologists is designed to screw the country up. I mean, we're under
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:28.040]  total siege attack. America is being conquered right now. So we collapse into the arms of
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:34.320]  the collectivist government. Just like Stalin turned off the power, the gas, the coal mines,
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.160]  and then wouldn't let people plant crops and had secret police running around burning them
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.840]  for a decade in Ukraine, Poland, and a bunch of other countries until everybody collapsed
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:53.440]  and wanted to collectivize farms that were basically gulags.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:59.320]  The great leap forward, the cultural revolution of Mao Zedong, all CIA run, now declassified.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:06.240]  66 to 84 million, nobody knows the number, the Chinese say 80 something million, killed
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:13.560]  under a CIA Ford Foundation managed operation. And the Chinese finally figured this out and
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:19.560]  arrested his wife and then Mao disappeared basically and they said he just died.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.320]  Commies don't even like Mao. Only David Rockefeller wrote obituary in the New York Times saying
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.480]  he did a great job and we need to live like them. Our criminal government put the greatest
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:36.000]  mass murder in history and power. That's now on record, okay? Now after they shut everybody
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.880]  down, then they'll turn stuff back on. But the point is they're shutting everything off
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:47.560]  right now. All right, I'm done. I promise I'm going to your calls. Ron and everybody
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:53.420]  else on the other side of this quick break, 800-25-99231. I'm Alex Jones and this is The
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:57.600]  Infall War and I'm here to try to save this country and save the planet and I need your
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.080]  help to do it. We can do it together.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.640]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time,
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.860]  they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:15.120]  two together? Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points in.308

[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:34.720]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.960]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.080]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.520]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.840]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.480]  By the way, after I take your calls, we're going to have an NSA whistle-blower himself
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:14.440]  on the broadcast, Wayne Madsen. We'll continue with calls after that as well, but the crew
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.360]  neurotically in, that's because I've told them to do it, just searches everything I
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:23.480]  say, every claim I make, which is good because sometimes I call a river the wrong name. The
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:31.880]  Thames is the Thames. My brain scrambles things. But they pulled up the 1970s New York Times
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:39.080]  article with David Rockefeller praising Mao Zedong for his obituary. And they'll print
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:44.480]  that off. I'll be able to read that later on the broadcast. Yeah, August 10th, 1973.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.520]  He talks about how great Mao was and no one can deny how fabulous his form of government
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:56.740]  is. This is from one of the richest men in the world. They got rich because the government
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:02.640]  relationships given him monopolies and they love Mao.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Vermont. Oh, we should trust a group like that to spy
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:13.280]  on us. Oh, but we can't spy on them because, because we can't be trusted. Yes, Ron, go
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]  ahead.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.760]  Yeah, it's an honor to be on your show. I have three quick points, but first for new
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:26.800]  listeners, I want to make it a point that you need to listen to Alex Jones' show for
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:33.520]  a good month to really, if you just pick a day, you might come off as, you know, a lunatic
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:39.080]  or something, but give it time and it'll sink in and you'll verify the things that he's
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]  saying are true.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.160]  Well, Ron, let me say this. I mean, I mean, in a way I am a lunatic because it'd be like
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:51.120]  if I was in Nazi Germany watching them exterminate people, I would freak out. If I was watching
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.800]  the Romans crucify thousands of Christians for no reason, I would be freaking out. If
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:02.500]  I was watching Stalin kill people, I would be freaking out because crazy nowadays is
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.760]  doing something outside the norm.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.560]  And so, because I am upset about this and I tell it like it is, and the general public
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:16.320]  has been told it's fun to live under this, I am crazy by modern definitions. Go ahead.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:22.320]  Yes. Everybody needs to get desensitized to the things that you're talking about. So,
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:28.720]  you know, you don't get nervous and they are true and they are here to stay. My first point
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:35.400]  was I was watching C-SPAN this morning and Republican Sanchez, the lady from California,
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:42.280]  she was saying what a joke it was that, you know, every time they get permission to do
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:47.580]  what they want to do, whether it be Department of Homeland Security or whatever, because
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:53.880]  she said, first I have to get permission to get like a specialized room that, you know,
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.760]  it's a clean room, no bugs or whatever. So I have to get permission to get that room.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:07.560]  Then I have to schedule it. And then the person I want to interview probably can't make that
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.240]  schedule. And then when we do agree, they don't show up.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.600]  Yeah, for those that don't know, Congress has had all of its authority taken and given
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.800]  to foreign corporations that now run all the intelligence. And they won't tell the committee
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:27.580]  chairman of the Homeland Security Committee what's in PDD 51. But the summary page says
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.180]  what's in it and that orders to the Pentagon say what it is.
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:36.360]  It's a plan to arrest 50 million Americans and put us in forced labor camps. So see,
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.800]  even though the stuff's classified at the top, the manifestation of it is not classified.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.720]  This street- Yeah, she was saying, like, you know, I'm
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:51.700]  active in Vermont. You know, I go to some committees and all. And anytime there's amendments,
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:57.480]  you get, you know, the existing bill and then you get, you know, in red ink, it tells you
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:02.840]  what the difference is. And Sanchez was saying the federal government doesn't do that. They
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:10.120]  just say, oh, it's a change based on Article 15 of some section. And then you got to look
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:13.080]  that up to see what the difference is. It's a joke.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:19.840]  My second point is, you know, back in 1990, I worked for semiconductor companies, OK,
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:26.020]  microchips and things like that. I got out because of, you know, the hydrofluoric acid
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:30.920]  that I used to work with and all on these machines. Some of the most dangerous chemicals
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.320]  there is are- Oh yeah, my cousin worked in that and he said
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.880]  when there was an alarm, they had to just run as fast as they could. And if they got
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.740]  one whiff of that stuff, they'd all be dead. Oh, absolutely. Well, you know, I went to
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:50.560]  Fort Meade. We were installing equipment there in the 90s. And, you know, if a chip broke
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.320]  or whatever, a wafer, you know, I had I was escorted out of the room. They vacuum every
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.320]  chip up, you know, so, you know, I guess you couldn't sneak a piece out or whatever.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.640]  Yeah, for those that don't know, Fort Meade's where the NSA is based.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:10.280]  Yeah, yeah. The walls are like eight inches of copper, so nothing can penetrate it. But
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:15.880]  what I was going to say back then, you know, you keep on telling people, you know, ladies
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:20.720]  and gentlemen, you know, you don't even know the half of it. And back in 90, they were
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:28.760]  already making microchips wirelessly so they can surveil, you know, combat troops in the
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.560]  field to know if they were dead or alive. They were giving vital signs.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:37.800]  Yeah, you're saying back in the 1990s, they already had chips in the troops. Yeah, no,
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.280]  I've got family that's been chipped and they're real mad at me and say, don't talk about it.
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:45.040]  Tell you what, I want to come back to you. Stay there. Yeah, no, they've they've chipped
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.880]  the military. I want you to finish your your whistle blowing and then we'll go to Robert
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.200]  and everybody else.

[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:26.960]  Media. Government cover us. You want answers? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:43.160]  radio network. You know, the actor and transformers and so many other programs back in 2008, he
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:49.600]  was on The Tonight Show talking about a dystopic NSA film he was coming out with where the
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:56.600]  computer decides the government's treasonous and attacks it, which that's a real A.I. scenario.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:03.000]  If the technocracy was actually a good self-aware system would probably go after the New World
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:13.920]  Order or it might go after all of us. He talked on Jay Leno about how he calls it an FBI informant,
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.720]  but I've looked into the case. He's been talked to about it since. It was an FBI expert who
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:23.480]  was there to advise them technically on the movie because it's about the NSA tracking
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.280]  him and stuff in the movie.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:33.440]  So it was an FBI adviser when they say informant to Hollywood about it. And just to show him,
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.760]  he dialed in and showed him recordings of him talking to his girlfriend. And this is
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.040]  exactly what I was told by the FBI a long time ago. And of course, then it came out
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.960]  that OnStar listens to You Can Kill Your Car.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:51.680]  Then it came out everything I told you. Everything I told you. Because I had real whistleblowers
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.040]  who pointed me to here's open source stuff where it's hiding in plain view. Because that's
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:03.900]  how they do it. They go, it's microwave regulation. Yeah, you got to pay Obama and Al Gore billions
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:06.200]  of dollars to these front companies.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.000]  Just a small, just a footnote in regulation. Oh, yeah, there's a telecommunications regulation
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.520]  and by law, we put snooping hubs and everything. And no big deal. It's an example of how out
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:24.560]  of control they've gotten. And here's another example. Last week, just to show you NSA style
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:33.300]  technology that's been deployed on Google, YouTube, Microsoft, Apple, all their systems.
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:38.960]  We under fair use, there's no way in court, cuz I've talked to lawyers, I've researched
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.800]  it, I've been on air 18 years.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:51.200]  I can play a 40 second clip of Jay Leno talking to somebody on a show and critique it and
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.840]  give it credit and say where it came from. That's how the news does it. Even if they
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.260]  don't have news sharing agreements, just like the news can show clips of my show without
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.200]  asking permission.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:06.600]  Now if it's an entertainment show purely, if I was a for sale entertainment show to
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:10.080]  get technical, then I'm going back to Ron and Robert and everybody else. Stay there,
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:17.920]  Ron, I'm gonna get to you. If I was selling an entertainment movie or had entertainment
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.020]  TV show, then I'd have to get permission to play a Jay Leno clip.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.920]  But I am a news First Amendment transmission. That's the same reason ABC, CBS News, Fox
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:33.600]  News, they don't have to ask permission to play clips of what I say or what I do. I don't
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:39.840]  have to ask permission to play a Audi commercial about the green police promoting green fascism.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:46.240]  Because I'm playing it to critique it. I have First Amendment commentary, but the computers
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.240]  don't care.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:59.360]  If we play a Jay Leno clip here, they will put a strike on our YouTube channel. So if
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:06.120]  I play this, I have to go tell my YouTube guy, cut this out. Because the bots, when
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:12.700]  it publishes, when the video instantly goes up, the bots are so fast now.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:20.480]  It will scan a two hour video, two hour 15 minutes of airtime in a three hour show. It
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:27.960]  will scan it and instantly block it and give us a strike for copyright material. When it's
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.640]  not, people call me and say, can I put a bumper sticker on my car?
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.740]  You bought it, you can put whatever you want on your car. People think they have no rights
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:40.400]  and they wanna use this ignorance of copyright to control people. So this is an example of
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.920]  how everything's surveilled. You can say, well, YouTube's its own private corporation.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:49.840]  Yes, but it operates as a public commons. And now you try to challenge playing five
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.400]  seconds of Jay Leno or other shows, they will automatically refuse your challenge.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:04.540]  In the past, they didn't do that. So that's an example. I wanna critique Jay Leno, I wanna
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:13.520]  critique this Hollywood Star. I wanna talk about this, totally protected, fair use, free
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.600]  speech, First Amendment. But it doesn't matter, the computers are now in charge. And that
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.760]  shows you how everything's surveilled.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:26.560]  Every phone call, every fax, every email, everything, it's all recorded, it's all saved.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:38.100]  I have real people listening in real time, okay? Members of Congress that's come out
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:43.000]  have real people listening. Most of you, just if they wanna check a file, they type a keyword
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.600]  in and then they go type it in.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.000]  And if they wanna get you talking on the phone, they can sit there and put into a program
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.040]  15 years ago this came out. They can take a recording of your voice and then have a
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:07.960]  computer that can then beat a voiceprint with it to then frame you. Do you understand how
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.280]  this technology is in the hands of very evil people?
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:21.200]  The only answer is to organically realize the system is organized against humanity.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:27.160]  And then seven and a half billion of us carrying out the digital TVs that are surveilling us,
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:32.120]  jamming their systems, speaking out against them, they still need moral authority. Exposing
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.520]  them, they will be forced to remove this. And this is the great challenge, will humanity
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.020]  be absorbed by the rise of the machines or will the machines empower us?
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:47.240]  The problem is the architecture is being built to dominate and dumb down. And we're now slaves
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:55.360]  of the machines, they've rewired our brains. And for most people, not to the better. Because
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:59.200]  they lazily just sit there and take it in instead of being interactive with it. It actually
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.680]  boosts your brain if you're interactive.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.880]  And I mean really interactive, not playing some stupid video game. The real world's going
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.880]  on, they want you playing virtual reality instead of being in the real world. So I'm
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:22.840]  going to Ron and I wanna play this clip. This is the clip of movie star Shia on Jay Leno
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:30.720]  talking about what now six, seven years later, or just about five years later, this is 2008,
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.560]  is now ubiquitous.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.920]  Where if I leave this in the upload to YouTube, they will put a strike on us. We get three,
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:44.200]  they will take down that big YouTube channel that serves the public with so much information.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:51.680]  So Shia LaBeouf, prism warning goes back to 2008. And notice Huffington Post is smart.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:57.100]  They put the interview on their own server so that they don't get blocked on YouTube.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:00.040]  And that's what we have to do more and more ourselves, cuz it's not like I can play a
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.800]  40 second clip and they're gonna come after me.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.160]  It's clearly commentary, I clearly have a right to be showing this, to be playing this
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:09.040]  here on the radio and TV. Huffington Post knows they have a right to put it on their
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:14.080]  own servers. And more and more, I think that's gonna be the answer here to get around these
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.080]  bots.
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.520]  Here's an example, Joe Rogan, good friend of mine, frequent guest on the show. Every
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:24.580]  video we'd ever posted of him got taken down. Not a strike, but taken down. I had to have
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:29.540]  him call the company he'd hired to monetize people recording his comedy thing and putting
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:30.540]  it up.
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:35.120]  But the computer didn't recognize his comedy versus his voice on my show. And then it erased
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:42.620]  like 50 something videos going back seven, eight years on YouTube of Joe Rogan on my
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:52.000]  show or me out with Joe. And guess what? When I went in and challenged that last year, even
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:59.600]  when the company took it off, for me challenging it, Google gave me a strike.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:08.040]  I'm not even allowed to have my friend that I've known since 1998 in studio with me in
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:15.200]  America. Now, that's a computer making a mistake. But this shows you how it's all surveilled.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.160]  You're like, how do they record all the calls? How do they have it all? It's keyword, folks.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:25.240]  They know Jay Leno's voice. They know the algorithm of that set. That's how it all works.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.000]  Shazam came out what, four or five years ago? You can hold your iPhone up when a car drives
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.060]  by playing the most obscure music, it'll tell you what it is.
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:40.260]  Now they've done stuff where they've taken my voice. And I warned of this when this first
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:44.260]  came out a decade ago. I said, there's a time where they can hit one button and release
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:49.480]  a virus that will erase my voice from the entire planet over every network in a matter
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:56.120]  of hours, especially once things go to the cloud. And now I had copyright claims by a
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.800]  Canadian company until I threatened to show them taking my videos down all over the web,
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.800]  not on my channel.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:07.040]  They wanted to sneak and do it. They weren't doing it to me. They were doing it to everybody
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:11.340]  that had me with my voice claiming copyright on my voice when I've never signed something
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:16.140]  like that. That's happened with a guy that does the voice of Optimus Prime, because one
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:17.140]  day my kids wanted to hear it.
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:20.440]  So I looked it up and found out there were all these claims on him at book signings and
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.520]  stuff with little kids. They'd say, well, you do Optimus Prime for me? And it was identical
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:30.500]  basically in the voiceprint to the movie. And so copyright was claimed on him talking
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:38.700]  to a little black kid at a community event he went to. Autobots transform and roll out.
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.820]  And I can't do it as good as he does cuz I'm not him.
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:44.560]  Kind of like idiots saying, I can do Beavis and Butt-head better than this Mike Judge
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:52.480]  guy when he was on the show. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm trying to explain to you how
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:58.080]  the NSA grid works. Google, all of it is NSA technology. They monetize, they gave to select
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.080]  insiders.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:04.880]  It's all a front. Microsoft is an IBM front. They didn't think they could sell computers
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:09.560]  and have the software, so they gave it to a subsidiary. Bill Gates is nobody. He invented
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:15.200]  nothing. You understand that? This is on record. This has even come out in PBS, but they just
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:22.320]  kind of hide it in plain view. It's all fake. IBM sworn to bring in a worldwide Nazi tyranny.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:29.980]  Look up the founder of IBM, Watson. Look up the other Watson. The discoverer of DNA says
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:34.440]  black people aren't humans. You need to find out who these people are, folks.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:37.880]  All right, that's enough. I'm gonna shut up. I apologize. Ron, finish your point about
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:42.960]  working at Fort Meade in the NSA. Well, you know they're gonna be listening to this.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:50.160]  You said, yeah, you know, you brought up IBM. You know, people should read the book by Edwin
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:59.800]  Black about IBM and the Holocaust because they ran it. Absolutely. Why do you think
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:07.320]  they knew where everybody was? Those numbers on their wrists or wherever it was, those
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:13.640]  numbers told their location, what their occupation was. It was the punch card. I mean, and now
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:20.680]  they're collecting all this information. They're coming after everyone, just like you said.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:28.120]  My third point, though, you know, things happen in life. And, you know, I don't want to say,
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:36.440]  you know, why did God do this to me? No, things just happen. And it's up to us to choose.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:44.760]  And I choose God. And the one thing I wanted to say, you know, you asked people, why do
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:51.320]  you think the globalists are poisoning everything? It's happening to them, too. And I do have
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:56.240]  a thought on that. You know, you said, you know, blood is taken, you know, at people's
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:02.560]  birth. And I'm wondering if blood is taken at people's death. What do the mortuaries
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:11.360]  do with it? And it's about epigenes and how things in the environment turn off and on
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.360]  epigenes.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.160]  No, no, you're really smart. No, no, no. They do take blood at almost every death.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:21.360]  It is also put in the Pentagon databases that actually came out. You're a really smart guy.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.200]  And what they're doing is they're testing on us with all these poisons how to give themselves
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:33.760]  a cure. And they actually have a absolutely absolutely. You know, they need a huge sample
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:41.360]  base to find the magic genes, to find the magic genes, just like the immortal cell lines.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.480]  They found in the last 70 years of cells you basically cannot kill unless it's in a in
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:55.240]  a blast furnace. They want to transmutate and recombinate cancer cells as the key to
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.240]  immortality.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.200]  That's one of their main study lines. And boy, you want the NSA listening. This is highest
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:06.720]  level security. What we're covering. Go ahead, God. God does not make junk. And your genes
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:14.680]  are not your destiny. You know, your genes are good. And it's it's everybody's screwing
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:20.640]  with them and the chemicals in the environment that are changing those genes, the epigenes.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:26.760]  But your gene is always good. There's no one on earth that that is. That's right. It is
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:32.720]  such a lie to say three thousand increase in breast cancer because you got bad genes.
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:38.880]  You've got genes that if you're fed poison and it's put in your water that you'll die.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.600]  I mean, it's incredible. God bless you. I really appreciate that was a good caller out
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.040]  there. That guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:53.200]  All right. We've got a listener, Regina, listening on shortwave twelve one sixty WWCR in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.280]  Regina, thanks for holding. You're on the air. Thank you, ma'am.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:03.160]  I agree with you, Alex. I mean, I've been praying for him. Praise Jesus for his message.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.720]  I did listen to Sanchez this morning, too, and that's what I wanted to say. I'm answering
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:16.400]  the question. Yes. He, Snowden, is a hero, not a zero. And Sanchez, Congressman Loretta
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:21.680]  Sanchez is her name. I don't know if maybe you want to try to get in touch with her,
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:26.640]  because she proved to me what she said there. She said she didn't vote for the Patriot Act.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:29.080]  She never votes for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.940]  Now let's get her on. OK. And what she said was that she specifically
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:39.880]  designated Section three of five, I believe it was. And she said that what this got proved
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:45.880]  here, she said, yes, they can get this Snowden because they got the power from the Patriot
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.920]  Act. And as he said, the power to snatch and grab him. And that came out in the news. They're
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.720]  saying they want to just disappear him. Why not? You're the good guys. You sure disappear
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.040]  all those little foster kids on the C1 thirties.
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:03.560]  So, you know, why not disappear him for exposing your criminal mafia? Oh, yeah, let's get him.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.160]  Let's put him in a FEMA camp. Let's use NDAA on him.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:13.120]  Well, it's it was just real interesting how she she mentioned, like he said, she has to
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:20.320]  get into these gifts. She has to get she has to get authority from the other party to be
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:25.840]  even allowed to talk to these intelligence people, even though she's under Homeland.
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:30.600]  She's the intelligence committee under Homeland Security. But she says that these contractors
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.840]  will come in and they have so much authority to come in. I mean, if you get a chance, it's
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:39.280]  on Washington Journal this morning. I know you got a million jobs, but she was on with
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.960]  Greta this morning and I figure it was between 830 and 915 a.m.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:50.000]  And you know, she just she exposed exactly to anybody that thinks the Patriot Act is
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.520]  their friend, then they they better realize the Patriot Act says they can break in your
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:50:01.560]  house and plant things. And then if you catch them doing it, it's a felony. If you tell
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:05.840]  anybody they broke in your house, I mean, it's just total criminal government.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:10.600]  And that's why the FBI is now publicly killing FBI agents that know the bombing was staged.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.240]  The Boston bombing is why they're killing witnesses. I mean, God help us, man. This
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.520]  is very dangerous because they're telling them, hey, you have NDAA authorization, you
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:25.520]  know, go kill Alex Jones. Well, I think her testimony was really fundamental, too, because
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.480]  she was you know, she was speaking as a person and a person concerned about individual rights
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:34.680]  and as a person who has access to the classified as a person who everybody's calling about
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.680]  this interview.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.400]  I want to get her on. So we'll definitely call her. Thank you so much as Congresswoman
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:45.360]  Sanchez. I will come back. Thank you, Regina. Let's go to Robert in Texas next. Then Chris,

[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.440]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:11.200]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.480]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:20.960]  obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:25.400]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:34.200]  As we move to the next level, we need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:40.400]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:47.860]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:56.860]  and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:09.860]  the mindset of 1984.
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:15.080]  You know, I mentioned this club never got to it. This is Shia LaBeouf five years ago,
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:22.000]  Angie Leno talking about the FBI advisor to the show about a spy surveillance state bragging
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.200]  and dialing in and showing him his phone conversations. It was the governor. I cover this in Matrix
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:35.040]  of Evil. So I remember it in 2003 of Wisconsin when I love the data centers, the threat vision
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.040]  centers.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:39.920]  I can if I want to find my wife, I just dial in her number and it shows me her location.
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.000]  They're like, sir, shut up. That's classified. It goes way above that. It's like, we're the
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.880]  good guys. You can trust us, as Obama said. You can trust Obama to raise the carbon tax
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:54.900]  to pay it directly to himself. We're going back to your calls in a moment. But here is
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:55.900]  that clip.
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.800]  And I remember we had an FBI consultant on the picture telling me that they can use your
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:04.480]  ADT security box microphone to to get your stuff that's going on in your house or on
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.120]  star. They could shut your car down. And he told me that one in five phone calls that
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:12.880]  you make are recorded and logged. And I laughed at it. No, all about the phone conversation
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:18.000]  I'd had two years prior to joining the picture, the FBI consultant. And it was like one of
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.920]  those it was one of those phone calls was like, you know, what are you wearing type
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.920]  of things.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.920]  Really?
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:23.920]  Yes, it was mad weird.
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:28.080]  So you mean they had a record of you from two years prior to me joining the page and
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:34.120]  being associated with the movie with the movie. Well, that seems extremely creepy. Wow. Yeah.
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:35.120]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.120]  All right.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:42.200]  And he was a consultant. That's good. Wow. He was a consultant on Eagle Eye. And of course,
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.600]  Leno now made the joke last night that, oh, Obama really does listen to the American people.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:53.160]  We can't say he's not listening. And we can really say that he's our big brother. Like
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:57.560]  you kind of saying he's a brother. I mean, just amazing, ladies and gentlemen, but it's
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:59.120]  bigger than Obama.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:07.280]  You've got the Republicans. You've got all of them. The Democrats got a slimeball Matthews.
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:14.480]  You've got a hardball guy. You've got the politically incorrect guy, Bill Maher. You've
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.000]  got them all coming out and supporting this.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.280]  Because they're scared. This could bring them down. These are real whistleblowers. These
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.200]  people are not invincible. They've tried to intimidate the American people, and it has
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:30.260]  angered the population of the world. Now, since I mentioned this earlier, I wanna show
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:31.260]  it to you.
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:39.200]  Here's the New York Times when Mao Tse Tung died, August 10th, 1973. Document can, please,
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:45.680]  for TV viewers. You can just type in the search engine, David Rockefeller on Mao Tse Tung.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:53.120]  And he says here that the social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.320]  one of the most important and successful in human history.
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:01.440]  How extensively China opens up and how the world interprets and reacts to the social
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:07.160]  innovations and the lifestyles she has developed and certain to have a profound impact on the
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:12.360]  future of many of the nations. Cuz China is the model, and he goes on. Now, he killed,
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:20.760]  the Chinese say 84 mil, okay, 84 mil.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:29.840]  The CIA says 64, 65, 66 mil, and about 20 mil with gunshots to the head. Now, this is
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:34.520]  the model. They're planning to shut everything off, then pose as shavers as they starve everybody.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:37.620]  That's why they're digging in, getting ready for it. Where they're probably not gonna get
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:43.520]  away with it cuz we're exposing their whole operation. Better learn about the Ford Foundation,
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.920]  the Carnegie Endowment, all these people, they plan this here.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:51.600]  They admit they've written books bragging, this is the plan. You wonder why I know what's
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:55.320]  gonna happen next, folks, cuz they've got a plan. They're about 10, 12 years behind,
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:00.040]  we're battling them. People say, why hadn't the evil all come yet? I mean, it's bad but
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.280]  not that bad, wins the FEMA camp. So you got an army manual about it. So what, when am
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:10.280]  I getting thrown in it? As soon as I can't hold this door back anymore. It's like, bang,
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.920]  bang, come on everybody, help me. Yeah, you say something's bad on the other side of that
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:21.760]  door. I'm like, help me. I say something happy is on the other side of that door. I say,
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:27.040]  open it up, let them in, I have mass Stockholm syndrome.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:30.200]  Speaking of mass Stockholm syndrome, they do this all over the country now. They have
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.320]  off duty cops, and I've seen these on the news, standing there, and they take your blood
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:40.320]  forcibly. They got a tiny sign down the road saying it's voluntary. We'll be right back.

[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:12.680]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:22.320]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:34.120]  Let's take some more of your phone calls. Robert in Texas, thanks for holding brother.
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:38.240]  You're on the air, so is Snowden a zero or a hero?
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:47.840]  Yes, sir, he is. I mean, he's come out and pretty much uncovered the truth and they're
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:53.360]  just trying to arrest him and do all this other crap to him. I'm sorry about that. And
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:58.800]  I mean, what they're just teaching us is if you snitch on a government, you are a bad
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.120]  person, even though it's for the good.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:06.520]  But you notice the record persecution of Obama. He's attacked more whistleblowers than all
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.560]  presidents before him. I mean, it's a fact. I mean, it's not just that he's a Democrat
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:15.840]  cuz I'm not a Republican. I mean, he is the worst president ever as the front man. And
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.980]  they're going after whistleblowers and what's it doing?
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:21.120]  It's causing more whistleblowers. Cuz I'm here to tell you, the smart globalists know
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:26.560]  how to creep around and just make tyranny easy. But these globalists now wanna really
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:32.280]  push it. And it's not intimidating people. I predict you're gonna see even more whistleblowers.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:36.920]  I mean, record levels now are already going public, but I think it's gonna be explosive,
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:37.920]  okay?
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:41.480]  Because people are tired of being pushed around. And they're like, what, you think I'm scared
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:45.880]  of you? When you're committing crimes, I'm gonna expose you. Go ahead.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:51.960]  Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, we need a lot more people like that because if no one
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:57.200]  steps up, I mean, the government's just gonna keep hiding in the shadows behind the curtains.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:03.120]  And we do need courage people like that. We need a lot of people to stand up. I mean,
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.360]  I believe America's gonna fall either way, I mean, predicting in the Bible.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:13.660]  But if we don't try and do anything, those who do the wrong will get away and we were
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:14.660]  just left with nothing.
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:18.960]  I hear you, Robert. I hear you. Let's go to Chris in Texas. Chris, you're on the air.
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.960]  Thanks for holding. What's your take?
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:25.880]  Thanks, Alex. Quick point. Absolutely, Snowden is a hero. But I think more importantly than
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:31.220]  the information he brought to light is the hope that he would inspire more whistleblowers
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:36.280]  to come forward because we know the government's not gonna incriminate themselves. As a matter
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:39.720]  of fact, they've shown time and time again that they'll lie till they're blue in the
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:44.440]  face to protect themselves, not only because they think we're stupid, but because there's
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.860]  virtually no repercussions. They can get away with anything they want to get away with.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:53.840]  Who got fired after Fast and Furious? All these scandals, nobody gets in trouble. So
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:57.900]  I hope that 20 more Snowdens come forward because that's really the only hope that we
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:59.480]  have of exposing these criminals.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.060]  Yeah, in fact, he should be calling for more whistleblowers to go public. He's made more
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:07.320]  statements today to the South China Morning Post. I'm gonna cover some of those with a
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:12.040]  man who's never blown the whistle on classified info, but who's pointed out things that have
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:14.560]  been leaked so he can cover it.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:19.600]  Who's Wayne Madsen who worked for many years in naval submarine warfare and then worked
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:27.500]  high level at the NSA. And the more I learn, the more I respect this man and his level
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:31.600]  of knowledge. I'm not hyping this next guest coming up, but I'm gonna tell him, go as far
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.800]  as he can with letting us know how bad it is.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:39.120]  He was the guy that said when Obama came in, he hated Bush by the way. I would call Wayne
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.680]  Madsen like a populist real progressive, not like a communist one or a fascist one. But
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:49.560]  Wayne Madsen said that they've set up a special unit, even knew the name of it. And then about
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:55.060]  a week after he did this, I got threatened, one of the real threats, not talk about it,
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.520]  but of course I kept going.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:01.800]  That only encourages me. They got very upset whenever Wayne came on and released the name
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.680]  of the program spying on whistleblowers. So we'll go over all of that with him on the
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:10.320]  other side and where he thinks this is going. Anything else, Chris?
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.840]  That's it. Now Madsen's a patriot, look forward to the interview. That's all I got. Thanks,
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:14.840]  Alex.
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:18.320]  All right, good to hear from you. I really appreciate you being on with us. Yeah, I just
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.440]  call Wayne Madsen up and I don't say what's your view before I put him on. So I don't
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.480]  know what he's gonna say about Snowden. Sometimes he throws me curve balls cuz he really knows
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:27.480]  what he's talking about.
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:31.840]  I mean, he really does. I mean, I remember interviewing Madsen 10 years ago and I'm like,
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:38.800]  this can't be. And then it's just every time, even outlandish stuff, it turns true. And
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.200]  he was the guy who got me in touch with the DC madam. And of course, she ended up getting
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:47.760]  killed. I mean, this is not a game, folks. This show is not a game. We don't tend to
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.880]  build stuff up when we have these type of people on the show, like Colonel Shafer or
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:56.400]  Seabell Edmonds or Wayne Madsen, but they are risking their lives. I mean, he's been
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:02.000]  told they're coming to kill him.

[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:04.600]  that, and I hope you stand with me because it's not courage that brings me here to fight
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:12.200]  these people. It's self-preservation. A rat that tries to swim out of a sinking ship does
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:17.140]  not have courage. It has self-preservation. It takes dumb courage to sit in the bottom
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:23.160]  of the ship while it's sinking. But we don't have to get off the ship, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:27.880]  We have to bring the globalists to justice or they're going to sink this ship collectively.
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:31.480]  Wayne Madsen is the perfect guest to be able to get on right now in the middle of this
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:36.720]  giant ongoing NSA scandal. And let's not forget, they were using it to target the Tea Party,
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:41.040]  the press, right wing groups, left wing groups, pro-life groups. That's already come out.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:47.760]  Now with Snowden, they want to distract away from that. But we had on Monday, Congressman
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:56.320]  from Texas here on the broadcast, Stockman, and he said, yes, we should go after this
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:01.200]  illegal spying and it's horrible. And why is it targeting the Tea Party? He was on with
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.640]  Wayne Madsen sitting in for me when I was flying back from London. And that's good.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:11.200]  See, he's a real libertarian type. Ron Paul, Rand Paul have spoken out. The rest of the
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:16.480]  Republicans are saying that Snowden is a traitor. Democrats are saying he's guilty of treason.
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:21.440]  It's a felony every time they spy on us without even the rubber stamp fake FISA warrant.
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.040]  And then Obama comes out and says, trust us or something bad is gonna happen. We're gonna
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.640]  have a problem, an obvious threat.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:33.280]  Well, Wayne Madsen is a Washington DC investigative journalist. And he's written for the Philadelphia
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:39.800]  Inquirer, the Houston Chronicle, Miami Herald, and hundreds of major publications online.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:45.700]  And he, of course, worked in submarine warfare before joining a high security job managing
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:50.140]  a large team at the National Security Agency.
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:53.800]  He wrote the best-selling book, The Handbook on Personal Data Protection. He also wrote
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:58.640]  other acclaimed books on the data protection law, genocide and covert operations in Africa.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:06.720]  He's a frequent witness before the House of Representatives on UN criminal tribunal law,
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:11.160]  Rwanda massacre, terrorism, international panel for the French government.
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:14.840]  He travels all over the world to war zones to cover things for us and for his own site
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:21.380]  WayneMadsenReports.com, WayneMadsenReport.com. And Madsen is a member of the Society of Professional
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:27.300]  Journalists and the National Press Club. But the real reason he's here is NSA. And he was
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:33.880]  on right after Obama got elected, and he said, they are intensifying persecution of whistleblowers.
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:38.720]  They've set up a classified group. He gulped and gave us the name. I got threats over it.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:44.360]  He had to leave the country for a while because he was told by national security sources they've
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:47.760]  got button men on the street.
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.760]  And you better go public about this, but also give it time for them to call back the hit
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:55.280]  men. And by the way, I've had multiple people he got me in contact with for the show, they
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:01.100]  end up killing. So this isn't a game. And he can really tell you a lot. I mean, I'll
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:06.200]  put it to you that way. He's the guy that told people years ago, meet in parking garages.
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.560]  Like Drudge has been saying, meet in parking garages, because it's all surveilled. And
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.800]  he joins us.
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:16.200]  And I wanna get into working at the NSA. I know it's classified, but I mean, obviously
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:20.800]  this is all coming out. A lot of it's hidden in plain view. What can you talk about that's
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:24.960]  been leaked or declassified or inadvertently declassified? I know that's one way to talk
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:27.880]  about stuff that normally you couldn't talk about.
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:32.000]  What do you think of Snowden? Where's all this going? Is the answer to the persecution
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.040]  of whistleblowers? More people going public because I see that happening. Is the iron
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:41.280]  fish backfiring? Go over it all, Wayne Madsen.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:48.200]  Well, yes, Alex, I wanna congratulate you on giving it to those slack jawed pultrunes
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:56.040]  meeting over at Bilderberg. They need the light of day. But the deal with Mr. Snowden,
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:02.400]  Ed Snowden, I have been in contact over the last several years with many NSA whistleblowers,
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:09.400]  also whistleblowers from other intelligence agencies, CIA and lesser known ones. And I
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:15.400]  mean, he is the typical case, except at least in his case, he took some measures to leave
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:21.040]  the country. I'm not sure about the strategy of going to Hong Kong. He may turn out to
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:27.260]  be a pawn between China and the United States. But everything he said has been verified to
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:32.800]  me by former people who worked at NSA and people who are still there. I'll give you
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:40.840]  an example. I just was contacted by somebody who still works in the NSA community and said
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:46.140]  that there are people who have access to this material, this prism-type metadata, who are
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:52.200]  spying on their spouses, ex-spouses, and even selling some of the information to private
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:54.440]  investigators on the outside.
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:58.280]  Is that terrorism? Is that counterterrorism? I think not.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:04.080]  And that's exactly what Snowden said, and I talked to one of these globalists when I
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:09.080]  was in England. And I brought up the point that I've gotten the calls, my wife's gotten
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:13.360]  them, where they tell you what you were just talking about in a previous phone call to
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:16.920]  then say, hey, do I got your attention? I'm gonna cut your head off if you don't back
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:18.360]  off, buddy.
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:22.780]  And the point is that I know a lot of people. You see cops all the time using the databases
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:27.380]  they have. They're nothing compared to this, to harass ex-wives or husbands or whatever.
[02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:33.520]  And that's what Snowden said. He said, analysts are running around doing whatever they want.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:38.800]  And now they've got Alexander and others at NSA saying that isn't true. Wayne, tell us
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:41.040]  what your whistleblowers are telling you.
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:48.400]  Well, basically they're verifying what Snowden had to say. Now, it's funny how the people
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.640]  who support NSA, the group that's the internal NSA security group, and they obviously went
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.360]  and knocked on his mom's store in Ellicott City, Maryland the other day.
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:03.240]  These people make the FBI look like the Girl Scouts. These Q group people, it's called
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:10.800]  the Q group. They have basically no oversight. They also work closely with a group at NSA
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:16.800]  of psychiatrists and psychologists. So anytime a whistleblower comes forward, they call these
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:20.840]  shrinks, call the people in, and then they're determined to be crazy.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:24.000]  And then they use that as a pretext to take their access away.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.380]  Now, by the way, this is nowhere in the news but the last few years that you broke at Wayne
[02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:33.960]  Madsen report.com and now this will probably break because now attention is on it. I mean,
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:38.440]  we've had so many whistleblowers on but I mean, this is from, tell people specifics
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:42.400]  on the Q group because you're the originator of that information.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:48.320]  You're up there on Capitol Hill. I mean, the Q group, this is the Praetorian Guard of the
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:52.160]  Big Brother Snoop system. Tell us about them.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:58.440]  Well, this is NSA's own little KGB and Stasi all wrapped up in one. They're the internal
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:02.960]  security. Now, when I worked at NSA, it was called the M group. Obviously, an intelligence
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:08.360]  agency like NSA is going to have a group responsible for security and counterintelligence. But
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.680]  now the Q group has grown in size to more than 300 people. It's become a force unto
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:20.680]  itself. It's an intelligence agency within an intelligence agency. And what they do is,
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.560]  the reason you're gonna get more whistleblowers coming forward is the word out of NSA is they're
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:27.100]  now really cracking down.
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:32.200]  Every time there's a leak like this, they really get tougher and tougher on their employees.
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:33.200]  So obviously, you're gonna see-
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:38.320]  Well, it's like ATF a few months ago, that video, it said, A, don't, you know, the acting
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:43.280]  director said, A, don't show people this video, so people released it. And B, you must be
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:48.280]  subservient and do what we say and only talk about corruption through channels, which breeds
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:52.920]  corruption and people are sick of it. I'm sorry, but I mean, you agree with me, the
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:57.560]  reason then that you see so many whistleblowers is that they're harassing people.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:04.080]  Yeah, absolutely. And the other thing, the people on the inside of NSA, whether they're
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:09.800]  military or civilian employees, government employees of NSA or contractors, as was Snowden.
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:17.840]  Now I know he went back and forth between contractor and government employee. They all
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:25.800]  say the same thing. There are abuses taking place. Misters Benny and Weebie and Tice and
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:31.200]  Tom Tam from the Justice Department and Loomis and so many others, Tom Drake, they've all
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.640]  come out and said the same thing. These were senior level people at NSA. So it's across
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:40.200]  the board that the abuses are happening. And you've got what General Alexander, who's I
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:46.840]  think now probably the longest serving director of NSA. Before him, it was General Hayden.
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:52.200]  You've got these guys that are becoming like the FBI director, 10 year terms it seems.
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:56.520]  You got Alexander, how many Bilderberg meetings did he attend in the past? He didn't go this
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:02.280]  year, but I counted them. He's gone to five in the past. So he says he's loyal to the
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:07.080]  constitution. It looks like he's more loyal to the bylaws of the Bilderberg group. I've
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:13.260]  never seen an NSA director go to these groups, these foreign groups where he's obviously
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:18.840]  violating the Logan Act. That's another act that ought to be enforced. These people can't
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:24.160]  conduct their own foreign policy, but he probably has a pass from Obama as he had a pass from
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:29.360]  Bush. The other thing is people are attacking Snowden. They're saying, well, he couldn't
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:34.540]  have had all this access. And he worked at the CIA and he worked here and he said he
[02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:40.600]  made 200K. We know that these contractors raid other contractors. They get signing bonuses
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:44.560]  to go from one contractor to another. The people who are making these comments have
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:47.480]  no knowledge how the NSA world operates.
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:56.240]  They're complete morons. My dad was offered in the 80s, like $400,000 a year as a oral
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:03.440]  surgeon to go work in black operations that involve planning things and spies basically.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.360]  He wasn't told more than that in cybernetic type stuff. And I mean, that was like a million
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:13.920]  dollars back then. People have no idea that the low level contractors now are getting
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:20.080]  like $100,000 a year just to do contract security and that most of them are getting 200,000.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:25.540]  Yeah, and there's something else about Snowden, why they're being very silent at the White
[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:33.480]  House and why they're reacting so fiercely. Dianne Feinstein and this guy Peter King call
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:39.320]  him a traitor and saying that the reporters ought to be also prosecuted. And I haven't
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:44.120]  written about this yet in light of the recent developments, but there is a group that is
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:50.800]  a joint NSA-CIA activity. It's known internally as F6. It's called the Special Collection
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:58.480]  Service. It's located in Beltsville, Maryland, not far from NSA headquarters. And what they
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:04.640]  do is they go abroad and put in bugs. They're like your James Bond type thing. So they have
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:10.040]  the technicians with NSA and then they got the CIA guys that facilitate this. These are
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:16.160]  black bag operators. And the fact that Snowden was stationed in Misawa at the NSA base in
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:22.280]  Japan and he was in Kuneya at what they call NSA Hawaii on the island of Oahu. And then
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:27.600]  he worked at the CIA for a short time and said he did some work in Switzerland and in
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:33.240]  other countries in Europe. He could in fact be the first whistleblower out of the Special
[02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:39.600]  Collection Service, F6. He wouldn't be the first one who ratted this organization out.
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:46.080]  And he says a lot more is coming. What do you think he saw that freaked him out so bad?
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:49.820]  I mean, he's probably had the same access to stuff like Cybele Edmonds. He probably
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:54.000]  knows the things that the shadow government's running.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:59.280]  Yeah. Well, apparently there's a few reports that he actually has a list of people who
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:06.560]  were being surveilled. This has come out before. These leaks have happened over the last several
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:11.320]  decades. I remember there was a woman named Peg Neution that worked at the NSA facility
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:18.680]  in men with ill in the UK. She was a contractor. I believe it was for Lockheed. But she said
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:24.520]  that she overheard Strom Thurmond talking on the phone. So when they talk about we don't
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:30.200]  target Americans, there is enough evidence that that's just a patently false and general
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:31.560]  clapper.
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:35.880]  Like all these guys in the intelligence community, all they do is cover up when they're caught.
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:36.880]  They do this all-
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:39.760]  Can you talk about what you did at the NSA without-
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:45.320]  Yeah, sure. Well, I worked in communications security. So I was on the side of the NSA,
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:50.560]  which, you know, I mean, we have to protect our own communications. That's, I guess, pretty
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:55.640]  much the benign side of it. But I do know that anyone, because of operations security
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:22:01.640]  and communications security, that anyone who used a government telephone or used government
[02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:08.760]  computers was liable to be listened in on by NSA. It's part of the deal. Even the president,
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:12.760]  because the president would speak on something called a secure telephone unit, NSA had the
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:18.080]  codes for that. So conceivably, yes, even then the president could be listened in on.
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:21.800]  But that's not what Snowden was saying here. They're saying that's ridiculous that he could
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:24.720]  listen to the phone calls of the president. That's not what he said. He said, if I had
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:30.120]  a personal email account for President Obama, I could read his email. That's what he said.
[02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:35.480]  But everybody's taken what this guy said out of context. They're attacking the messenger.
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:37.720]  What do you think they'll try to do to him?
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:46.280]  Oh, yeah. Well, I hope he's got another plan. I would not want to see him stay in Hong Kong.
[02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:52.000]  I've made some efforts to try through intermediaries to get in touch with him if he's still in
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:58.400]  Hong Kong. There are other alternatives he should look at. But what the Justice Department
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:04.200]  will do is go to Interpol and get a red notice, an arrest warrant issued. The secretary of
[02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.960]  State Kerry could revoke his passport, which would make him a stateless person and make
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:10.680]  him illegal in Hong Kong.
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:17.020]  He can stay there for 90 days, but if they revoke his passport, his 90 day visa is worthless.
[02:23:17.020 --> 02:23:21.500]  The idea that he might go into the mainland China, he could turn up being a pawn between
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:27.280]  two superpowers. Not a good idea. But this brings up an interesting point, Alex. There's
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:33.120]  not a whole lot of countries where Americans could go to to escape. This is Cuba, maybe
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:34.120]  Venezuela.
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.280]  He owns the member of the Icelandic parliament coming on Friday. She's trying to get him
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:46.000]  to go there. But if that's the case, he'll have to still hide out because they'll just
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.200]  send a woman into his room to claim he raped her.
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:53.200]  Yeah. And the other thing about Iceland, there's a new right wing government there. This isn't
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:59.560]  the former government that had this idea will become a free zone for information. It's a
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:05.640]  new government. It's the right wing government. Iceland's a member of NATO. Some people suggested
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:09.520]  that he go to New Zealand. There's people there that would say they would try to give
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:10.520]  him asylum.
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:13.200]  You got this mega upload guy in New Zealand.
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.440]  What about Sweden? What about Sweden?
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.440]  Yeah, I wouldn't recommend Sweden.
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:18.440]  WikiLeaks.
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:24.120]  Yeah, the WikiLeaks thing. There's not a whole lot of havens for us anymore.
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:26.800]  Is New Zealand good? I mean, where?
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:33.600]  Well, this guy, Mega Upload, who the US wants extradited for, they say, he stole some intellectual
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:38.400]  property from billionaires in Hollywood in the recording industry. The Supreme Court
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:42.160]  in New Zealand, apparently the courts have shot down that extradition request. So he's
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:43.160]  still there.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:49.960]  Yeah, nowadays they would extradite Serpico and probably publicly hang him on television.
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:54.580]  How are things going for the new world order right now? I mean, obviously they cannot be
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:58.520]  happy about everybody was starting to blow the whistle on them and the fact that they've
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:01.200]  been using the NSA against libertarian groups.
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:06.680]  Well, people are getting tired of it. The United States is the bull in a china shop.
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:10.920]  I think it was interesting just the other day that former prime minister of the Netherlands,
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:17.240]  Prime Minister Lubbers said that he revealed that there's 22 US nuclear weapons at a NATO
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:24.400]  base in the Netherlands. And you know, I mean, here's a case where the Dutch Air Force said
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:28.600]  he's not supposed to be talking like that. You know, this is a former prime minister.
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:36.200]  I think more and more people are willing to talk about these things. And as far as Mr.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:41.440]  Snowden's concerned, he's won in a long line of people to come forward. Remember in the
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:49.320]  lead up to the Iraq war, a woman at GCHQ, a Chinese linguist named Catherine Gunn, came
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.160]  forward and said, look, here's the classified emails telling us to eavesdrop on all the
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:58.280]  members of the UN Security Council who are sitting on the fence on that war resolution
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:01.000]  to authorize the invasion of Iraq.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.680]  Everybody knew that she didn't do, she did not do that on her own. That, you know, Robin
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:11.240]  Cook, the foreign secretary that's ultimately in charge of GCHQ, that's Britain's NSA counterpart,
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:15.440]  probably with a wink and a nod said, go ahead and reveal this. And then we all know what
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:19.200]  happened to Robin Cook. They said he died of a sudden heart attack. He fell down, hit
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:20.200]  his head while hiking.
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:25.120]  Well, obviously, the answer to this is not to lay down for people to stand up. But take
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:30.640]  Isabelle Edmonds, where it was white slavery, weapons, running Al-Qaeda. She exposed all
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:35.880]  that. We've got her coming on later in the week. But we've got things like that unfolding.
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:40.600]  What if NSA people, you know, who know what the government's really doing, know what they're
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  into?
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:46.000]  That's why a lot of the top government people have facilities they go to that have no technology
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.640]  in them. A lot of Hollywood people have now done that because they understand it. I mean,
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:58.720]  if I was corrupt globalist, I would not have 800,000 contractors with access to top secret
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:02.080]  stuff and hundreds of thousands that can dial into anything.
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:07.720]  I mean, that just sounds like a recipe for disaster and something that would burn the
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:12.740]  establishment. Because next time it's not going to be NSA leakers that are just releasing
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:16.600]  that they're spying on people. You're going to end up having NSA people, I know they've
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:20.400]  got snoopers that try to pick up on this, that are going to use this to expose dark
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:25.840]  side government and narcotics trafficking, snuff filming, all the stuff these guys are
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:26.840]  into.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:31.400]  So what's your take on that? And what are you hearing from your whistleblower sources?
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:37.240]  Well, you know, it's not been easy for whistleblowers or members of the press recently because,
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:43.800]  as you said, Obama has invoked the Espionage Act of 1917. This was invoked by Woodrow Wilson
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:48.960]  to go after people who did not support the war effort against Germany. And that was a
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:56.140]  needless war for us to get into on behalf of the British Empire in the First World War.
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:28:02.120]  But he's invoked it six times. There are grand juries now impaneled on several other people
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:07.920]  that I'm aware of, whistleblowers and members of the press. We, you know, we had Peter King
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:13.320]  saying he wants to go after Glenn Greenwald and Bart Gellman from the Washington Post.
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:18.760]  This is after what they've done with the AP. Alex, last week I was at the radio and TV
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.760]  Correspondents' Dinner in Washington, D.C. Obama spoke there in 2009. This is not to
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:29.580]  be confused with the White House Press Correspondents' Dinner. That's the big Hollywood glitterati
[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:34.280]  one in April. This is the one where the real working journalists are present. Obama did
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:41.080]  not even RSVP them. They called all afternoon. And he didn't send, last year he sent Biden.
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:46.800]  He didn't send anyone from the administration. I said, hey, what's going on here? Is Obama,
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:51.240]  does he want a war with the media? And the answer was, yeah, obviously. And look what's
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:56.560]  happened. Now we have a leak of a State Department internal report that the U.S. ambassador to
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:03.440]  Belgium is reputedly not only chasing hookers in Brussels parks, but children, a pedophile.
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:08.400]  Right. Exactly. So why do you know what? What are they concerned about with leaks? This
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:13.480]  is exactly. And I'm glad I could gloat and say, look, I report a Q group and I report
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:19.220]  all this years ago. But you know what? I welcome the fact that the corporate media is now focusing
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:23.660]  on these stories. I'm not going to gloat. I'm not going to say I told you so. I welcome
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:29.780]  them. You know, I could say I welcome them waking up to smell the coffee. But I'm sincere
[02:29:29.780 --> 02:29:33.500]  in that. I'm glad they're looking into it. All right. I want to come back and take some
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:38.320]  phone calls with listeners that want to talk to Wayne Madsen. Aaron, devoted allies, Simon

[02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:01.920]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:06.920]  Government is the problem.
[02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:11.920]  Government is the problem.
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:16.920]  From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be
[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:21.920]  managed by self-rule. That government by an elite group is superior to government for,
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:26.920]  by, and of the people.
[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:31.920]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:36.920]  Hello me. Meet the real me.
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:41.920]  In my misfits we've life. A dark black past is mine.
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:46.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, Obama calls Constitution
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:51.920]  Charter of Negative Liberties.
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:56.920]  So now he has openly come out. Let's, let's get the video of that.
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:01.920]  And actually said the Constitution is enslaving him. Don't worry, it's already all been
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:06.920]  thrown out the window and look at all the bad stuff that's happening. DHS wants equipment for
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:11.920]  riot control stations. Yeah, I told you that from one of our
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:16.920]  TSA sources. First I was told it by a caller who worked at a big
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:21.920]  warehouse in Oklahoma and then I got contacted by a source above
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:26.920]  TSA. I'll just say it's one of the companies that manages them. They have contractors. And they said last year
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:31.920]  they're deploying these riot control stations and they're going to have TSA all
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:36.920]  over the place. We broke that. We had an article about it. Boom, that just came out.
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:41.920]  Bombshell on InfoWars.com. Northern Colorado
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:46.920]  ready to secede over intrusive government. That's another article. That's what the riot
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:51.920]  police are for. See, they implode the society then use the crisis as the pretext to
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:56.920]  clamp down. DHS funded exercises portrays free American citizens
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:01.920]  as terrorists sell. That's a big article. In the Boston Globe
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:06.920]  two months before the bombing, they were going to have a drill of people with backpacks bombing a public event
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.920]  who were from the right wing Tea Party militia. And they were going to go
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:16.920]  with that and then we found out about the drill so they backed off and went with the
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:21.920]  Chechen brothers. I want to get back into the NSA and calls
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:26.920]  here with you, Wayne, but I really shook them up and my listeners did
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:31.920]  and the radio show did and they've got articles how we got seven fold record traffic. I mean we
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:36.920]  had one day like it was a ridiculous number. The analytics said
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:41.920]  like 12 million visitors to one site and 5 million or something or the other. It was just insane.
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:46.920]  We got like a million visitors or something. And
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:51.920]  I'm sitting there looking at that and now they've got Bloomberg coming out two days ago
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:56.920]  saying Alex Jones doesn't build bombs. He builds bombers. And they have all these people saying Alex
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:01.920]  Jones is a terrorist and Alex Jones is dangerous. And they had a drill. The brothers
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:06.920]  it turned out were being sent overseas to CIA meetings for destabilization programs.
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:11.920]  That all got that all came out. They've killed two FBI agents that were involved in their arrest. They
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.920]  killed one of the friends shooting him in the top of the head. Wayne Madsen from your
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:21.920]  sources now in hindsight. What are they so scared of in the Boston
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:26.920]  bombing? You've got the Saudi nationals being protected and Michelle visiting them. We're now in hindsight.
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:31.920]  All I know is they're lying. There's evidence of an operation. There
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:36.920]  was a drill. They're covering it up. They're saying don't look at it. It's the classic MO. We don't know
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:41.920]  exactly what they did. At least I don't. From all your sources on Capitol Hill, Wayne,
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:46.920]  what do we best know now in hindsight about the Boston bombing and why now
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:51.920]  are they in a conniption fit with 15, 20 hit pieces a day
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:56.920]  investigative journalists crawling all over me trying to find dirt or manufacturing it
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:01.920]  and saying I'm a terrorist. I mean, they've never come out and said that.
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:06.920]  Should I be worried here, Wayne? Well, we all have to be worried because look what
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.920]  they're doing to Ed Snowden. I mean, we're all subject to that type of psychological
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:16.920]  warfare campaign. I have a story up today on the website.
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:21.920]  We know that the Sarnia brothers, Tamerlan
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:26.920]  and Johar, that their uncle, Uncle Ruslan, who changed his name from Sarnia
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:31.920]  to Sarni, worked and actually was the
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:36.920]  ex-son-in-law of a former CIA guy named Graham Pollard. Now all of that was
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  reported on Graham Pollard, who he was actually doing business
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:46.920]  with, setting up these Chechen NGOs, some of which were accused of being
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:51.920]  linked to terrorism against Russia. We were told Graham
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:56.920]  was the station chief of the CIA in Kabul. I have documents that I just yanked
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:01.920]  recently from CIA sources that show
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:06.920]  that Graham Pollard was a right-hand man of William Casey. Bill Casey, the
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:11.920]  architect of Iran-Contra, the guy who gave a debt-bed interview,
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:16.920]  supposedly to Bob Woodward, if you can believe that.
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:21.920]  But it clearly shows that I've scanned these documents in. You can see that
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:26.920]  in one case, Bill Casey was getting ready to go meet with President Reagan at what
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:31.920]  they call a National Policy Security Group meeting in the White House Situation Room.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.920]  And before Casey went to talk to Reagan, he talked to Graham Pollard.
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:41.920]  That's not a low-level guy by any stretch at the CIA. I was
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:46.920]  also informed that Graham Pollard in 1987 was very instrumental in
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:51.920]  Israel setting up a counterpart to the FATA,
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.920]  the PLO, Yasser Arafat's organization. And we know that group now as Hamas.
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:01.920]  We see the CIA time and time again involved in
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:06.920]  terrorism themselves. That was the fake al-Qaeda network. I mean, even the Jerusalem Post
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:11.920]  admits Israel created in what, 1974, a fake
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:16.920]  group to create the threat. Right. And we know that the CIA,
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:21.920]  where did the al-Qaeda resources come from? The Mujahideen that the CIA supported in the
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:26.920]  war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. We see this time and time again, the
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:31.920]  Kosovo Liberation Army, a terrorist group. And now their former leader is the
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:36.920]  Prime Minister of Kosovo. He's also Madeleine Albright, her one-time
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:41.920]  toy boy. You know, I mean, you look at this stuff and, you know, you've got the toy boys,
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:46.920]  you got the pet arrests. What are they trying to cover up? This is what they're trying to cover up.
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:51.920]  We also know that the State Department's been accused of running drugs out of some of the
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:56.920]  embassies. There's a shocker. You know, this government is absolutely corrupt.
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:40:01.920]  And I used to teach security courses for the Navy. And
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:06.920]  one thing I always said is if you, a computer security officer
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.920]  at a command, discover something, whether it's financial fraud or something against the
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:16.920]  law, it's not only your right, it's your duty if you can't get
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:21.920]  anyone like the IG or the command to take care of it. It's your duty to expose it.
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:26.920]  And I mean that as much today as I did then. And by the way, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.920]  studied the history of it. You lived it up until the last decade. That's what you're supposed to do.
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:36.920]  You become complicit if your chain of command doesn't do the right thing. Exactly. And then
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.920]  as many whistleblowers have stated, the General Counsel, the Inspector General,
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:46.920]  and even the Congress. You look at NSA. Who's the Congressman that represents Fort Meade, Maryland?
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:51.920]  His name is Dutch Ruppersberger. He's a Democrat. But he's one of these
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.920]  keynote types. He's on the NSA payroll. You look at Diane Feinstein.
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:01.920]  Who's her husband? Richard Bloom. He's a war profiteer. He owns these
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:06.920]  major, he's got investments in these major intelligence and military companies.
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.920]  And Peter King. I mean, this guy used to donate money to the provisional wing
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:16.920]  of the IRA, the Irish Republican Army. He's got a lot of nerve accusing people of being,
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.920]  you know, helping terrorists and being traitors. This guy, King, ought to be thrown out.
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:26.920]  But you got to look forward. Who's electing guys like Ruppersberger and Peter King?
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:31.920]  That's the thing. When you look at these guys, they are gangsters and you're up there on Capitol Hill.
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.920]  I've been around some of these guys before. They are arrogant thugs and I'm sick of their garbage.
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.920]  Yeah. Every time I go up there, I make sure my button on my back
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:46.920]  pocket is buttoned because these guys will lift your wallet in a New York heartbeat.
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.920]  Now, I want to go to some phone calls and get to some other news here with you. But one point I wanted to raise. Russia
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:56.920]  may deem civil servants use of Gmail. That's Google mail, folks. And Facebook
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:01.920]  high treason. And the Russians have come out and said, Google, Facebook are basically NSA fronts. Well,
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:06.920]  that's been declassified. So the American people need to understand that foreign
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:11.920]  governments tell people, don't even talk to your wife on Gmail. And people say, well, what do I
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:16.920]  have to hide? They could plant stuff on there. From your research,
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:21.920]  who is Google? Who is Facebook? I mean, from my research, it's not just that they work with the
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:26.920]  government. They were created by the government. Yeah, Google and Oracle actually
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:31.920]  were code names of R&D programs within the CIA
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:36.920]  many, many years ago. And the CIA has a group called In-Q-Tel. They actually go out and look
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:41.920]  for startup companies. They'll pump a few million in. This
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:46.920]  volunteer that is now reported to be the company that developed the
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:51.920]  PRISM system started in 2004 with a $2 million seed
[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:56.920]  contract from the CIA. They're now worth $2 billion. Where did they get $2 billion?
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:01.920]  Because an agency like the NSA gave them these huge contracts. And I thought it was
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.920]  very interesting that their CEO, Alex Karp,
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.920]  was President Bilderberg, the one over in England where you were there. That's right.
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:16.920]  Let's go further, though. And then how it works is the CIO put $2 million, $10 million
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:21.920]  into a company, give it contracts after that. And then lo and behold, five years
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:26.920]  later, CIA guys go into private practice and they get jobs at
[02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:31.920]  Google making $50 million a year. Oh, isn't that just
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:36.920]  cute? Yeah. Well, these are the new contractors. In the old
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:41.920]  days, it was always RCA and Boeing computer
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.920]  systems. But it's the same revolving door. The only way to get rid of
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:51.920]  this system is to get rid of the system. I mean, it's that simple.
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:56.920]  They talk about, well, we need to revise the Patriot Act. No, get rid of the darn
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:01.920]  Patriot Act. Here's the deal. They want us all to line up like prisoners and to have no due
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:06.920]  process. They're the ones staging the Al Qaeda garbage. They're the ones groping
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:11.920]  us at the airport and having the toilet safety to police there. They're the ones ruining our future,
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:16.920]  trying to force vaccines in us, trying to push psychotropic drugs on school kids. They are a pack
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:21.920]  of lunatic scum. You work in and around these people most of your adult life.
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:26.920]  And things just keeps popping up as their pedophiles or their devil worshippers or their sadist.
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:31.920]  I mean, who are these people really? Because they don't want to just steal money. They want to hurt goodness.
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:36.920]  That's why I'm so committed against them. It's not like their boss, Hogg, just want to steal some money.
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:41.920]  I would fight that, but not to the death. I would try to expose it.
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:46.920]  But I mean, these people are so evil. Who are they? I mean, why are they so bad?
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:51.920]  Well, they're exceptional. I mean, they consider themselves to be exceptional. They are the elites.
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:56.920]  You know, you mentioned Mao earlier, Chairman Mao. Well, one of the things he did with the cultural revolution
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:01.920]  back in the 60s, you know, he took all their government people and paraded them in the street,
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:06.920]  in some cases stripped them down to their underwear, made them wear dunce caps. And then the people,
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:11.920]  the Chinese people whacked them with bamboo sticks. Wouldn't you love to do that on Constitution
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:16.920]  Avenue? Have like one parade out of Congress running down towards the White House
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:21.920]  and then getting the other ones coming out of the White House on the way back?
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:26.920]  You know, I'm not saying we need that type of thing, but we do need a cleansing
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:31.920]  of these people. These people are absolutely horrible.
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:36.920]  I've met with them. I know some of them. Some of them are well intentioned when they become members of Congress,
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:41.920]  but it doesn't take long before they start getting sticky fingers and start looking out for themselves
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.920]  instead of the people they were elected to represent. As best you know, though,
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:51.920]  talking to whistleblowers, are more of them planning to go public right now?
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:56.920]  Had you ever heard of Snowden before he went public? I never heard of Snowden, but I'm not
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:01.920]  surprised that somebody like him came forward. What's going on? What's happening now in NSA
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:06.920]  is they're really drilling down once again. You know, you don't talk.
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:11.920]  You sign an oath and they're letting them know how many years they could face in prison.
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:16.920]  So that's going to have some effect in the short term. But as these people
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:21.920]  get more bold with these systems, this Utah data center that's going to come online in
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:26.920]  September, that's going to be the big mother load of data.
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:31.920]  By the way, this is the old trusted information awareness system that Admiral Poindexter
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:36.920]  tried to get started at the Homeland Security Department years ago. And when I was with the Electronic
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:41.920]  Privacy Information Center, we actually submitted a FOIA request on how
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:46.920]  extensive that was. We won that in court before Judge Bates in the District
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:51.920]  of Columbia. And when the information came out on how extensive it was, Congress cut off the funding.
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.920]  But I heard then that what they did is Homeland Security just turned it over to NSA to implement
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:01.920]  and look what they've done. They've implemented. It's called PRISM. It's going to be largely housed at
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:06.920]  that Utah data center that's 17 football fields. Well, they've got a giant one in
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:11.920]  San Antonio and then they've got one outside Austin.
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:16.920]  Yeah. They're building all sorts of little private ones. Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:21.920]  There's a new one there and there's there's a 780 million dollar complex going into Fort
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:26.920]  Meade, which is going to be yet an additional facility at Fort Meade at the
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:31.920]  NSA headquarters campus. So and then you've got Kunia in Hawaii. That's a new
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:36.920]  building where that does eavesdropping. We're going to take calls now. But Wayne Madsen,
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:41.920]  anything else you want to add that after you're gone, you wish you would have had time to talk about?
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:46.920]  Well, I just think that what people
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:51.920]  have to do is get on these members of Congress that are calling
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:56.920]  Snowden a traitor and let them know that, you know, we the
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:48:01.920]  people determine who the traitors are, not people like Peter King who supported Irish terrorism
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:06.920]  blowing up subway trains in London. And certainly not. Look, Diane Feinstein,
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:11.920]  she would have never gone beyond San Francisco politics had she not glommed onto
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:16.920]  that whole George Moscone, Harvey Milk being shot by
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:21.920]  Dan White. It's almost like she may have been forcing the Twinkies down Dan White's throat. I mean, she's
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:26.920]  profited from that double assassination so much. She's a
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:31.920]  polteroon and always has been. She's no liberal from San Francisco.
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:36.920]  She supports every surveillance system that's ever walked down the pike. So people
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.920]  in California need to get after Feinstein and the people in Maryland.
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:46.920]  And Bill Maher, Bill Maher's a pig. Bill Maher, Bill Maher, you know, I mean, what does he know about
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:51.920]  any of this stuff? You see these people, they're talking about, you know,
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:56.920]  Al Franken, Senator Franken said he agrees with the system.
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:01.920]  It's not hurting anyone. It's a scumbag. Wait a minute, a comedian? Comedians
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:06.920]  telling me about NSA systems? What does Gilbert Gottfried have to say? Chris Rock, how about
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:11.920]  Shecky Green? Why don't they ask them while they're at it? Well, Chris Rock says Obama's our father and do
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  what he says. I heard that before in Germany. Aaron in Nevada,
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:21.920]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Welcome.
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:26.920]  Thanks, Alex. And congratulations on your great reception in the United Queendom there, man.
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:31.920]  That was really great. Believe me, it was phenomenal. It really shows people are waking up.
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:36.920]  By the way, Bill Casey did not give a deathbed confession. So Madsen is really kind of irrelevant at this
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:41.920]  point. Snowden is a great American. Let's just be clear about that.
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:46.920]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Aaron. I mean, Madsen doesn't make stuff up.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.920]  I mean, I totally remember. I mean, hold on, hold on, hold on. Back up what you're saying.
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:56.920]  Go ahead. I'll do that. Bill Casey was found dead in his backyard
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:01.920]  pond face down in the water. So Bill Casey could not give a deathbed confession. Sure,
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:06.920]  it was a kayak. Expand on that. I think you're confusing Bill Casey with Bill
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:11.920]  Colby. Yeah, two different people. OK,
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:16.920]  anyways. So you want to apologize, Dwayne? OK, I'm sorry, Mr. Madsen.
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:21.920]  Great work on the other guy up there in Calabria. I'm not trying to be a jerk here. I get names mixed
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:26.920]  up, too. I apologize when I call the Thames the Thames the Thames.
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:31.920]  It gets confusing. Potok is the one. I got this name right.
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:36.920]  Potok is the one who made those defamatory statements about you, not Bloomberg. Let's
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:41.920]  be clear on that. Well, stay there. I'm going to come back to you. No, no. I had discussions
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:46.920]  with them about that statement. And I said, if you put that in there, you've got to put in there that one of their guys
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:51.920]  went and shot up the Family Research Council. And then and they also have quotes about how I influenced the
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:56.920]  the Zarnab brothers. So don't try. No, the article is
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:51:01.920]  written to imply that I'm a terrorist. Stay there. I'll come back to you.
[02:51:01.920 --> 02:51:06.920]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins that bears repeating. Digestive
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:11.920]  health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. And Pro EM-1 daily probiotic
[02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:16.920]  cleanse is the key to digestive health. Pro EM-1 is a powerful liquid probiotic
[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:21.920]  strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day. Pro EM-1 is dairy, wheat

[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:04.920]  Hi, my name is Annette, and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:09.920]  severe heart clashes, which prevented me from sleeping all night. It was so hard to work
[02:53:09.920 --> 02:53:14.920]  because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell. I was exhausted and
[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:19.920]  depleted. After only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:24.920]  normally again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product.
[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:29.920]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content
[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:34.920]  as glutathione, but due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could glutathione
[02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:39.920]  be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body? If you restore the optimal
[02:53:39.920 --> 02:53:44.920]  glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result, your glands and organs
[02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:49.920]  work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have. To order One World Way,

[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:04.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live here
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:09.920]  up on Infowars.com, a public government training camp, has
[02:54:09.920 --> 02:54:14.920]  upheld the suspension of a child who was eating their Pop-Tart and students thought it looked like a gun.
[02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:19.920]  It doesn't even look like the shape of a gun, but now, you know,
[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:24.920]  if your Twinkie has the imprint, not of the Virgin Mary, but of the gun, you're
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:29.920]  take him away. I mean, it's just all thought crime. Everything they're doing is about
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:34.920]  authoritarianism. I want to jam in your calls now and in the next segment, and then we're going to end the main transmission

[02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:09.920]  here. So Aaron in Nevada, real fast, you have a point for Wayne Matson.
[02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:14.920]  You want to go back? When I say Bloomberg, I mean Bloomberg, the publication went with a hit piece.
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:19.920]  Go after Potok. Get yourself a good defamation lawyer
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:24.920]  and go after him. Bankrupt the Southern Poverty Law Center. You could do it. That's a defamation
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:29.920]  per se what he said about you. He went over the line of
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:34.920]  that you're a public figure type of thing into defamation per se. I know I'm looking
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:39.920]  at it. If I sue somebody, I'll have to get the right lawyer, spend the money,
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:44.920]  you know, do it all right to get a judgment and
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:49.920]  I've got to send them letters and make them retracted. My
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:54.920]  point is for them to do stuff like that means they're desperate, especially when the Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:59.920]  was running Elohim City where McVeigh was at. Wayne Matson, you got any comments on that?
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:05.920]  Well, I mean, yeah, you know, suing, I had to get a
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:10.920]  thick skin after doing this for a few years. I mean, you know, let them take their best shot.
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:15.920]  You know, who cares? I mean, no, I hear you. But I mean, but I mean, for them to say that I'm building bombers,
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:20.920]  that is outrageous. That is outrageous. Yeah, I know. And but the one
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:25.920]  thing they do like to do is to get you tied up in court. No, no, I agree. Maybe that's the plan.
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:30.920]  No, I tend to not sue people. You mess with my family, though. I mean, I'll come after you.
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:35.920]  Listen, I appreciate the call, Aaron. Let's talk to Harvey in Florida. You're on the air. Go ahead, Harvey.
[02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:41.920]  Hey, Alex, it's been a long time since I've spoken with you and Wayne, you're like a wealth
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:46.920]  of knowledge, like an encyclopedia of history. The Carlisle
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:51.920]  group owns Booz Allen. Are you familiar with that, Alex?
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:56.920]  Yes. So once again, you see the Bush family entanglements.
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:01.920]  And I'd just like to go through a short history. It'll take me about a minute or two. I know you're short on time.
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:06.920]  Do it. Well, JFK gave the secret society speech
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:11.920]  and Bush being in the secret society. Next thing you know, JFK was dead.
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:16.920]  Then Bush shows up as an ambassador to China and he gives away everything to China.
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:21.920]  He was our first ambassador to China, was he not, Wayne? Yes, he was.
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:26.920]  He was the envoy, right? Mm hmm. Then he shows up as CIA
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:31.920]  head of CIA. Then he shows up again as vice president.
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:36.920]  Then he shows up as president. Then he puts his son on as president. And the world's gone downhill for the
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:41.920]  last 50 years. Well, you know why the Bush's were the last lawyers,
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:46.920]  Prescott, to control a bunch of hidden Nazi wealth. And that's one reason the Bush's are so important,
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:51.920]  Wayne Madsen. Well, yeah, I mean, the Bush's are evil. And, you know, what are we talking about
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:56.920]  in 2016 now? Hillary Clinton. What is this, a monarchy, a duopoly?
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:01.920]  Bush, Clinton, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Clinton, you know, enough of this already. And, you know, and you throw in the Cuomo kid
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:06.920]  and all this. We're not that kind of country. We don't we don't have royal families here.
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:11.920]  What's wrong with Kim Jong on an hereditary inbred dictatorship? Maybe they'll put them on teacups
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:16.920]  if it's ten generations. Caller, what was your final point on that?
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:21.920]  Alice, you have the money to bring down the Bush family and therefore everybody else. Please put your money into
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:26.920]  I don't have it. I'm spending all the money I've got on this radio show. I think people think I'm too
[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:31.920]  powerful. I'm going to bring down the Bush family. I'll tell you, it's one thing to fight the whole new world order.
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:36.920]  If you start going after an individual family. I mean, you heard what the Bush
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:41.920]  patron said on Larry King. Remember what she said?
[02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:45.920]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:50.920]  Visit GCN Live dot com today.
[02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:55.920]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[02:58:55.920 --> 02:59:00.920]  good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact that
[02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:05.920]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:10.920]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:15.920]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:20.920]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[02:59:20.920 --> 02:59:25.920]  Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.

[03:00:00.920 --> 03:00:05.920]  Big
[03:00:05.920 --> 03:00:10.920]  brother mainstream media government cover ups. You want
[03:00:10.920 --> 03:00:15.920]  answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[03:00:15.920 --> 03:00:20.920]  GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas.
[03:00:20.920 --> 03:00:25.920]  Alex Jones. Here's the article from two thousand and three.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:30.920]  We'll put it up on screen here. Barbara Bush threatens Democratic presidential candidates.
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:35.920]  It was on October 22nd, 2003. I've got the transcript there.
[03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:40.920]  And she said, if you mess with my family, I'll have you killed.
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:45.920]  You can go read it. I mean, the Bushes are just unbelievable. I know a lot of people that
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:50.920]  know George W. Bush and they just say he is the nicest guy in the world buying your lunch,
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:55.920]  going golf in a real night. He goes and cries with veterans and people.
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:00.920]  And I don't know what's going on with these people. I mean, I mean, they're definitely Prescott was
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:05.920]  the top Nazi lawyer in the US and he got to keep a lot of their wealth in Latin America when that
[03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:10.920]  when it all fell. That's why they're so rich and why they're their money's hidden. I mean, that's a fact.
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:15.920]  Spent the London Guardian years after we broke it with guests. What's your take on the Bush and the
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:20.920]  Bushes in their their hidden power, Wayne Madsen? Well, I you know, you
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:25.920]  look at you look at the history of this. You know, this is a fiftieth anniversary of
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.920]  JFK being shot to death on the street of Dallas. And, you know, there's there's a
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:35.920]  photograph of the school book depository of a guy that looks an awful lot like
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:40.920]  CIA man, George H.W. Bush, standing there in front of that building.
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:45.920]  I know people say, oh, it's not him. It's another guy. They always have these explanations. And look,
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:50.920]  you know, he was only Ronald Reagan was only president for six
[03:01:50.920 --> 03:01:55.920]  weeks when John Hinckley broke through police lines and managed to put a slug into
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:00.920]  President. And he had dinner with the Bushes the night before. Hinckley, the Hinckley. Yeah,
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:05.920]  Hinckley's son and and what was it? It was Neil Bush had had
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:10.920]  dinner. I mean, you know, there's there's too many coincidences. You know, people say
[03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:15.920]  that's a conspiracy theory. I saw I don't believe in coincidence. Well, that's the Denver Post.
[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:20.920]  Bushes and Hinckley's had dinner that day before Reagan shot. That's that's exactly
[03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:25.920]  exactly. So so, you know, the Bushes are absolutely evil. But, you know,
[03:02:25.920 --> 03:02:30.920]  as I as I wrote this book, The Manufacturing of a President, it's quite clear
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:35.920]  that Obama was deep selected, probably out of Occidental. He was talent
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:40.920]  spotted. And I mean, this guy, his family was CIA.
[03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:45.920]  He was CIA. He worked for a CIA front company after graduating Columbia. Absolutely.
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:50.920]  Absolutely. It's just a private mafia takeover masquerading as government.
[03:02:50.920 --> 03:02:55.920]  Simon in Florida. Real fast. Go ahead. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:03:00.920]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you about the copyright issue. I had the same problem myself.
[03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:04.920]  America Dream. That's a movie that you can go through.
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:09.920]  Your phone's breaking up, brother. I got to let you go. Devoted ally in USA. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:12.920]  Yeah.
[03:03:12.920 --> 03:03:17.920]  Snowden's Ron Paul inspired hero also unselfishly devoting his very
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:22.920]  life to help and protect and defend our once proud U.S. constitutional republic. And God is standing
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:27.920]  behind heroes like Snowden. Satan's servants, of course, include
[03:03:27.920 --> 03:03:32.920]  so-called president, so-called peace prize banner, most prostitutes and way
[03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:37.920]  too many of our brain dead fellow so-called citizens who are lockstep dancing with the stars
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:42.920]  while the rest of us true patriots like you and me, sir, are eagerly putting everything on the
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:47.920]  line to help save our world. Never give up. All right. Thank you so much
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:52.920]  for the call. Real fast. Ron in New York. I'm here with Wayne Madsen. Go ahead.
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:57.920]  Yes. With regards to Ed Snowden, Ed Snowden is an American
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:02.920]  patriot, and he acted in the highest way. The fact of the matter is all these
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:07.920]  people running around and saying he violated his oath. The oath is statutory
[03:04:07.920 --> 03:04:12.920]  law. Statutory law is subordinate to the constitutional law. This is not Europe or one of the
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:17.920]  nations of the old world that doesn't have a constitution. So if he felt that there was
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:22.920]  something that was going on, even if it would seem a violation of his statutory
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.920]  oath that was violating the higher law, which is the United States Constitution, he
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:32.920]  was correct and in fact duty bound to bring that. That's right. If they start trying to use the NDAA
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:37.920]  to kill American citizens, which they're doing, people have a right to resist that. I don't care if they've got some
