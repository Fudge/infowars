[00:00.000 --> 00:16.480]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:16.480 --> 00:41.760]  front lines of the Info War. Friday, July 19, 2019, an avid particularly large grouping of
[00:41.760 --> 00:52.080]  articles, stories, documents, reports, videos, try to get to. What have I just read headlines?
[00:52.080 --> 00:58.400]  Trans activists who's Brazilian wax business after owner refuses to shave her balls.
[00:58.400 --> 01:07.840]  Facebook survey asks users if they condone pedophilia. University stop using the words
[01:07.840 --> 01:15.840]  Americans America or policeman or you'll be fired. Ilhan Omar didn't just lobby for ISIS
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.720]  members to not go to prison. She also voted against bill blocking terrorists from life insurance.
[01:24.640 --> 01:30.640]  Video abortion activist uses watermelon to demonstrate procedure to dehumanize the
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.560]  baby. Here comes the McConnell budget deal that will rule the rest of Trump's presidency
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.880]  and Rush Limbaugh is being attacked for abandoning fiscal conservatism. He didn't abandon
[01:44.880 --> 01:54.880]  fiscal conservatism. He came to planet Earth. It's too late. I'm going to explain this and I've
[01:54.880 --> 02:02.480]  explained it a lot. We're in a global devaluation race and we've got to keep the currency dominant
[02:02.480 --> 02:08.880]  now or it'll get totally devalued. Everyone else that gets defeated in this war will go Zimbabwe
[02:08.880 --> 02:16.960]  style. There's no turning back now, ladies and gentlemen. The US was supposed to be economically
[02:16.960 --> 02:25.360]  taken out under Hillary. Their plans not going the way they want it. China prints money roughly
[02:25.360 --> 02:31.280]  about five times faster than we do. Props up their stock market and Trump's right to come in and say
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.520]  okay let's prop ours up and if we're going to do this let's just let's just go ahead and turn
[02:37.520 --> 02:44.160]  the presses up because we're in a global system and it's already being done. It's the point of
[02:44.160 --> 02:55.600]  return. The allegory, the analogies like this. I had a Labrador Traver named Max from the time I was
[02:56.240 --> 03:06.400]  five years old to the time I was 20 and that's 15 years, a long time for a lab and
[03:08.880 --> 03:12.640]  I would take, he had hip dysplasia. We would have to put him down when he was 12
[03:12.640 --> 03:19.680]  but I would take him to the vet and I would get him to give him corticotypic steroids which
[03:19.680 --> 03:25.680]  later you know can make your arteries explode, can make your muscles fall apart, can mess up your
[03:25.680 --> 03:32.240]  joints. He'd have been dead. He couldn't get up. There's no surgeries for that so it's a catch 22.
[03:32.240 --> 03:38.160]  He lived three more years and I worked for a large animal vet sonny all about depo medrawl and
[03:38.160 --> 03:43.280]  stuff. Some of these vets would go well we're going to give you this little bottle but you know
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.040]  don't give him more than that because it could hurt him. Well when the regular dose would work I'd
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.720]  give him more because I would call back and talk to the vet I knew when he's Texas and he said it
[03:52.720 --> 03:56.960]  was a catch 22 just give him more but I'd have to go to maybe two vets to get enough of it because
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.880]  vets wouldn't give me enough. Well I made the decision to not put the dog down. He was happy.
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.200]  I'd give him twice what you're supposed to give him supposedly and the dog would be up in a day
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.640]  happy running around. He lived three more years so I'm going to explain this and I know the audience
[04:12.640 --> 04:17.440]  could disagree if you want or you could agree but it's like this country ladies and gentlemen
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.400]  is a Labrador with hip dysplasia and Trump is it Trump's got the right course. He's trying to
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.600]  build industry. He's trying to empower the people. He's trying to build up the military because that's
[04:29.600 --> 04:36.000]  all we've got. We've been totally hollowed out and we're in a war with currency devaluation
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.400]  with money printing and so we're damned if we do we're damned if we don't but you know all this
[04:42.400 --> 04:47.440]  talk about getting back to the fiscal and all the rest of it we're in a fiat system. This system's
[04:47.440 --> 04:53.440]  going out. It's why they're getting all the global casual society stuff ready on the ashes of America.
[04:53.440 --> 04:57.280]  No we've got to prop America up and come up with a third solution.
[04:57.280 --> 05:07.440]  Infowars the most banned network in the world. So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling
[05:07.440 --> 05:12.000]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.120]  together and supporting one another and sustaining one another. It is the only independent press of
[05:17.120 --> 05:22.640]  this size and scale of this public reach. It is the one model that says here's a way to have a
[05:22.640 --> 05:27.920]  self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little de-democratic structure that because the
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.320]  audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately
[05:32.320 --> 05:36.640]  reached by their choices and supporting Infowars and it's all because the audience spends their
[05:36.640 --> 05:40.800]  whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and
[05:40.800 --> 05:44.880]  that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do
[05:44.880 --> 05:50.080]  that and at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what
[05:50.080 --> 05:54.480]  news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic
[05:54.480 --> 05:59.200]  expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[05:59.200 --> 06:17.680]  Waging War on Corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[06:29.360 --> 06:37.200]  Ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones we're
[06:37.200 --> 06:43.360]  going to be here for the next four hours then the war room with Owen shroyer kicks it into high gear
[06:43.360 --> 06:49.520]  and I'll return this Sunday four to six p.m. central with the live sunday transmission. Wow
[06:50.640 --> 06:58.640]  this whole Ilhan Omar the jihad squad all of it really illustrates what a bunch of cowards the
[06:58.640 --> 07:03.680]  republican establishment is and how you turn on any channel they're saying well what the president
[07:03.680 --> 07:13.600]  has said is racist and he needs to walk it back no Ilhan Omar has openly said she doesn't like
[07:13.600 --> 07:19.360]  this country she said that she's going to teach us how to be patriotic and that we should be ashamed
[07:19.360 --> 07:26.160]  of ourselves I played that clip on monday she's also said the border patrol has people in concentration
[07:26.160 --> 07:31.200]  camps and that we're killing children do I need to play clips of her again I can't
[07:31.200 --> 07:38.000]  stand her arrogant voice. Ilhan Omar goes along with the lie that children are drinking out of
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.760]  toilets she came here as a refugee she married her brother she wrote letters to federal judges to
[07:47.760 --> 07:56.960]  get ISIS terrorists out of prison she voted against bill walking terrorists from life insurance the
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.600]  woman is a cancer are there folks from Africa that come here that are great people absolutely
[08:02.880 --> 08:07.280]  I've run into people that have immigrated here from Africa who are hard-working smart
[08:07.280 --> 08:11.760]  nice people because they know to appreciate a country like the US compared to some of the places
[08:11.760 --> 08:16.800]  they've come from but a lot of people are brought here and have chips put on their shoulders by the
[08:16.800 --> 08:24.720]  left and by leaders the democrats give them like Ilhan Omar by the way I've talked about this but
[08:24.720 --> 08:30.480]  a journalist traveled to Ilhan Omar's homeland to prove Somalia is beautiful and doesn't have crime
[08:30.480 --> 08:36.320]  it's killed in one week women don't walk around unattended there they have to be in their own
[08:36.320 --> 08:41.840]  tribal area the Muslims all kill each other there I mean you stray out of the wrong neighborhood
[08:41.840 --> 08:47.840]  you're dead journalists traveled Ilhan Omar's beautiful Somalia to challenge stereotypes improve
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.920]  the country was beautiful only to end up being killed by terrorists before president Trump's
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.360]  tweet storm in which he encouraged Omar to go back and fix her own country Somalia and Canadian
[08:57.360 --> 09:04.080]  journalist who don't know and win was crying to do precisely that she returned to the country of
[09:04.080 --> 09:08.800]  her birth to tell uplifting stories about Somalia according to the Washington Post the journalists
[09:08.800 --> 09:13.600]  became well known for her relentlessly positive tweets about Somalia
[09:18.240 --> 09:24.400]  but she was killed she wanted people to know the beauty of the place and she was killed after
[09:24.400 --> 09:33.040]  being back for a week blown up and killed by machine gun fire at the only working hotel
[09:33.040 --> 09:39.680]  in the country that had not been bombed yes they don't have electricity most areas they don't have
[09:39.680 --> 09:46.880]  running water they have nothing but I can play you clips it's like something Somalis do in Minnesota
[09:46.880 --> 09:52.240]  particularly where they always say we renounce America we don't want to be here we don't like
[09:52.240 --> 09:58.160]  your laws we want Sharia law you want me to play all that for you or all her arrogant statements
[09:58.160 --> 10:05.200]  about some some people did something on 9-11 so I'm not going to make a statement and all the other
[10:05.200 --> 10:15.040]  things that she said with just venom she goes I hate how they come and they talk about America
[10:15.040 --> 10:21.760]  she hates she's full of pride full of arrogance of her slaver past she's an Arab
[10:21.760 --> 10:29.280]  Arab Somalia the Horn of Africa it was the distribution point of black slaves for over
[10:29.280 --> 10:37.200]  a thousand years there was not a market in black slaves in the Roman system
[10:40.400 --> 10:48.320]  they wanted Germans and they wanted Gauls and they wanted Visigoths
[10:48.320 --> 11:00.720]  Austria Gauls and people from Albion those were the slaves England France Germany Austria Switzerland
[11:00.720 --> 11:13.920]  today rich Africans bought white slaves Europeans did not have black slaves until the Arabs taught
[11:13.920 --> 11:20.880]  them and then it's the perfect thing to have someone with all her fake scamming hello I am Elon
[11:21.520 --> 11:29.040]  I help the black people and and and she's again one of the Arab ruling class in Somalia
[11:30.080 --> 11:38.880]  white people like her with white skin are the rulers they are the leaders they are the royalty
[11:38.880 --> 11:45.120]  and just like royalties always inbred mentally ill look at British royalty look at this reporter
[11:45.120 --> 11:50.880]  looks just like Ilhan the reporter that died it's because they come from the ruling caste
[11:50.880 --> 11:56.720]  you go to Somalia their castles on every little hill at the ports with huge dungeons
[11:57.440 --> 11:59.440]  where they held the black people
[11:59.440 --> 12:12.400]  isn't that just cute so cute Somalia was the world capital of the Arab slave trade
[12:13.600 --> 12:22.960]  and in Somalia and in Libya now after Gaddafi was killed the Arabs have returned the slave trade
[12:22.960 --> 12:33.360]  and sell blacks to rich Muslims around the world who keep them as slaves as a sign of class
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.560]  you think it's people in the south of plantations that have black butlers
[12:42.240 --> 12:49.360]  no my friends Africans are being sold at living and slave markets USA today
[12:49.360 --> 12:52.800]  and you know who's coming in to do it
[12:54.560 --> 13:05.200]  Libyans are being enslaved by oh you guessed it Somalis and they're coming in
[13:06.160 --> 13:14.240]  because it's the family business piracy white slavery that means sex trade
[13:14.240 --> 13:22.000]  and murder for hire narcotics trafficking
[13:23.040 --> 13:28.160]  you know and we're supposed to just bow down to her that's why she has an arrogance because
[13:28.160 --> 13:34.000]  if you're not even part of that clan you don't leave in Somalia outside your clan area all the
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.040]  Somalis rob each other to constant war constant death you know there she is in a jumpsuit
[13:41.040 --> 13:51.600]  she's a tax scammer just everything about her is criminal piracy she is a slave pirate master
[13:53.600 --> 14:03.360]  that's the family business that's who she is her name in Somalia I looked it up is from the ruling
[14:03.360 --> 14:14.240]  class and she's going to teach you how to bow down and kiss her butt and you know what the
[14:14.240 --> 14:19.360]  GOP everybody are getting on their knees to do it and Trump came out and was like whoa I disavow
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.240]  send her back and I get that's a little too far we need to have an investigation like my petition
[14:24.240 --> 14:29.040]  at whitehouse.gov says of her fraudulently getting her citizenship and then ship her ass back
[14:29.040 --> 14:37.680]  and she won't last a month over there because she's famous and so anybody famous has a price on
[14:37.680 --> 14:46.720]  their head and her own precious Somalis will kidnap her so I'd give her a week before she was
[14:46.720 --> 14:52.560]  kidnapped she'd probably kidnapped on the way from the shot-up airport to whatever hole in the
[14:52.560 --> 14:58.640]  ground she's gonna squat in and and and and then crap in a latrine out back and wipe her ass with
[14:58.640 --> 15:10.480]  her left hand that's what she does and as she comes to this country and squats on us and spits in
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.160]  our face and we're supposed to bow down to her you don't go to Mexico or someplace and run your
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.560]  mouth about how it sucks they'd say get the hell out of you don't like it that's how any other
[15:20.560 --> 15:26.640]  country in the world who isn't totally brainwashed acts we're not saying get out of here because
[15:26.640 --> 15:32.000]  your background is an Arab slave family Arab slave traders we're saying because you're an arrogant
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.880]  america-hating liar that says we're running concentration camps and our overworked border

[18:02.960 --> 18:07.440]  hey alex yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[18:07.440 --> 18:12.000]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.480]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[18:16.480 --> 18:20.720]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.200]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[18:25.200 --> 18:29.280]  the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's time to be praying my friend
[18:29.280 --> 18:32.960]  i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you
[18:32.960 --> 18:38.160]  down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years

[20:41.200 --> 20:52.640]  she's an arrogant person from the most barbarous cutthroat country in the world where slavery
[20:52.640 --> 21:00.000]  kidnapping piracy and murder are legal as long as not somebody in your tribe
[21:01.920 --> 21:06.160]  muslim kills muslim muslim kills christian
[21:09.760 --> 21:16.240]  no white person outside a military base can survive in somalia more than a few days
[21:16.240 --> 21:21.520]  and when people pay their ransom they still kill you most of the time
[21:25.440 --> 21:29.840]  now we should pull up some video of some molly pirates and the look in their eyes
[21:31.680 --> 21:36.640]  and then you watch footage of just the markets and the villages and people are like
[21:36.640 --> 21:46.400]  hey i can't make the face it's like day of the deadlock
[21:46.400 --> 21:51.760]  and then we're gonna import all this and then have them criticize us and tell us that we suck
[21:51.760 --> 21:54.640]  and the president says why don't you just go back to your hellhole then
[21:58.880 --> 22:03.840]  i just said that black hawk down is there to be shot down and i just said the jews are evil
[22:03.840 --> 22:11.040]  and i just said that you got concentration camps you're killing babies i just fun and work with isis
[22:13.760 --> 22:18.240]  and somalia sells blacks and slaves but it's liberal
[22:21.360 --> 22:27.360]  somalia cuts women's genitals off there's a very good chance ilhan omar does not have her
[22:27.360 --> 22:36.000]  female parts some people are so ignorant about autonomy anatomy that they don't
[22:36.960 --> 22:44.720]  know women i'm not gonna get into it the point is is that this is madness in the name of political
[22:44.720 --> 22:50.640]  correctness like we don't have any problem kenyans that come in nice smart people
[22:52.480 --> 22:56.000]  i mean and in africa by the way in different african countries will tell you about
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.680]  the the the the the the pluses and minuses of other african countries because everybody knows
[23:01.680 --> 23:07.440]  people are different there are people in southern africa that are absolutely different from people
[23:07.440 --> 23:15.760]  in northern africa culturally behaviorally all of it and then you've got somalia which is a
[23:15.760 --> 23:23.120]  hellhole because it's been a slave trading piracy hub for 1000 years i'm sorry i said i get to all
[23:23.120 --> 23:29.760]  these clips let's just go ahead and play a little piece of a documentary that's very very important
[23:29.760 --> 23:39.920]  an investigation into ilhan omar it's very very important and let's go ahead and episode one the
[23:39.920 --> 23:48.160]  secrets of ilhan omar here it is minnesota democrats media and the department of justice
[23:48.160 --> 23:54.880]  have continually ignored strong evidence supporting the fact that ilhan omar may be directly involved
[23:54.880 --> 24:03.920]  in tax marriage and immigration fraud in 2002 omar married ahmed hersey in a religious ceremony
[24:03.920 --> 24:10.560]  hersey is the father of omar's three children and is pictured often with omar and their children
[24:10.560 --> 24:17.520]  on their campaign website in 2016 minnesota journalist scott johnson received a tip about
[24:17.520 --> 24:23.520]  a post from a somali community website containing marriage certificates alleging omar married her
[24:23.520 --> 24:30.640]  brother elmi in february 2009 in order for him to immigrate to the u.s legally despite the facts
[24:30.640 --> 24:37.760]  she'd been married to the father her children hersey over a decade this clearly proved that
[24:37.760 --> 24:45.040]  any such second marriage might be big amiss under minnesota law as well as fraudulent later in august
[24:45.040 --> 24:52.080]  2016 further investigations into legal documents and filings in minnesota by journalist priya samson
[24:52.080 --> 24:58.480]  dark uncovered evidence supporting the allegation that ilhan omar married her brother ahmed
[24:58.480 --> 25:07.760]  nurse ed elmi in 2009 the 2009 marriage license to elmi lists the same address as one filed for
[25:07.760 --> 25:16.320]  a minnesota business three months later in may 2009 for a one-to-one cafe by hersey the father
[25:16.320 --> 25:22.720]  of omar's three children that means ilhan omar was living with both her real husband hersey
[25:22.720 --> 25:29.520]  while still married to her brother elmi omar has continued to deny the allegations dismissing them
[25:29.520 --> 25:37.200]  as faceless rumors and fake journalists on bigot blogs despite mounting evidence high school
[25:37.200 --> 25:46.480]  record evidence also support the claim that elmi is indeed her brother and graduated in 2003 from
[25:46.480 --> 25:52.880]  arlington senior high school in st paul minnesota with enrollment records that state he was born
[25:52.880 --> 26:02.720]  april fourth 1985 the same birth date listed on omar's 2009 marriage certificate to elmi
[26:02.720 --> 26:09.040]  as troubling details mounted against omar members of the samali community were threatened into
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.560]  silence through intimidation tactics and physical violence on themselves and their families still
[26:14.560 --> 26:22.480]  back in samalia in an obtained facebook live video from august 18th 2016 a woman identified as the
[26:22.480 --> 26:28.000]  associate chair of the samali american caucus speaks and in translation she states in plain
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.200]  terms that any samali that talks about omar's personal life including marriage discrepancies
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.720]  is an enemy of the samali community credible sources in the samali community have stepped
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.080]  forward and provided alpha news with information in exchange for anonymity along with members of
[26:44.080 --> 26:51.040]  the 2003 class have also identified elmi's father as as a nurse said elmi mohammed the same man who
[26:51.040 --> 27:00.000]  calls himself father to ilan omar all right we'll play part two next week and that's all
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.920]  incredibly accurate by the way that's her filings that she married her brother everyone just goes
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.360]  oh alleged just to have the highest levels of journalism oh by the way she did vote against
[27:11.360 --> 27:18.160]  a bill in minnesota that would make it illegal to cut your daughter's clitoris off and uh
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.480]  they've had big problems with them even doing it to six seven eight nine ten year old girls
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.520]  because a lot of women are marrying muslim husbands a lot of feminists do that like that you know
[27:27.520 --> 27:32.800]  they hate american men that grovel and kiss their ass they want that bad boy and so they're
[27:32.800 --> 27:39.360]  marrying muslim men and they're taking their daughters in and the men use shears and scissors
[27:39.360 --> 27:46.400]  in minneapolis st paul and of course it happened in detroit and a federal judge ruled yeah you can
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.080]  have your stepdaddy come in with those scissors to your nine-year-old daughter chop chop it's liberal
[27:53.280 --> 27:57.280]  and children can go to drag queen story time now the new thing is to hump the men

[28:36.400 --> 28:43.920]  off the faculty i guess what do you call them hit the clown holes we need to get our children used
[28:43.920 --> 28:50.000]  to diversity we come back though a little bit more on illan omar because she talks about her

[32:00.480 --> 32:04.560]  barbara marge what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies and
[32:04.560 --> 32:08.640]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[32:08.640 --> 32:12.960]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[32:12.960 --> 32:16.960]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[32:16.960 --> 32:20.400]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[32:20.400 --> 32:24.640]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[32:24.640 --> 32:28.480]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[32:28.480 --> 32:32.800]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[32:32.800 --> 32:37.600]  recover after the great depression the inforce audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[32:37.600 --> 32:42.720]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[32:42.720 --> 32:47.040]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[32:47.040 --> 32:51.440]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[32:51.440 --> 32:55.120]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[32:55.120 --> 32:59.520]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what we just saw
[32:59.520 --> 33:09.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:09.840 --> 33:25.040]  oh section two take five all right we are live is that helvis is he in the building
[33:25.040 --> 33:35.360]  we're gonna pick up from there that is elvis section two takes seven
[33:55.120 --> 34:05.360]  oh
[34:05.360 --> 34:21.680]  oh
[34:21.680 --> 34:32.000]  yes grab on hold tight
[34:41.360 --> 34:42.480]  let yourself go
[34:44.800 --> 34:51.280]  elvis bringing us in it's time for conservatives it's time for christians it's time for patriots
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.360]  to stop backing down to the globalists and their intimidation and their threats of calling
[34:55.360 --> 35:00.000]  us names because now they want to arrest us now they want to censor us now they want to
[35:00.000 --> 35:07.600]  bankrupt us and are bowing down and groveling to these bullies has gotten us into this position
[35:07.600 --> 35:17.200]  but more and more people are just letting themselves go you want to fight okay you've got one
[35:17.200 --> 35:21.760]  one ninety plus percent of democrats in the big national polls coming up next segment
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.720]  think there's going to be violence and a lot of them want violence well i don't need a gallup poll
[35:30.000 --> 35:38.080]  to know that they are existentially getting angrier and angrier and as a group i was sitting
[35:38.080 --> 35:43.920]  there this morning at about six a.m drinking coffee and i was thinking to myself what is the most
[35:43.920 --> 35:53.440]  important thing i should go on air and say today and it's just this democrats as a group have converted
[35:53.440 --> 36:07.520]  to evil democrats have decided that as a group they're going to lie they're going to steal
[36:07.520 --> 36:20.000]  they're going they're going to cheat and from the top down to the bottom now they will stage photo
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.760]  ops they will stage events they will physically attack people they will spit in your food they will
[36:26.560 --> 36:32.320]  mess with your car they will rob you they're criminals and all the studies and all the
[36:32.320 --> 36:40.240]  statistics the mental illness they're physically ugly they they steal many many more times more
[36:40.240 --> 36:49.680]  often than any other group what they are is a bunch of individuals that have no moorings
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.640]  and it's really because they have low intelligence as well they're always telling you
[36:55.600 --> 36:59.360]  on cnn and in the new york times that democrats have the most degrees
[36:59.360 --> 37:06.800]  degrees and democrats are the smartest people and oh they have the most worthless degrees
[37:07.680 --> 37:12.080]  but they do not have the high accuse they do not have the wealth they don't have the success
[37:12.080 --> 37:16.080]  all the statistics show that's not the case we can pull those up if you like but everybody knows this
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.120]  i mean you get around democrats and you go to one of their events they look like
[37:22.160 --> 37:25.680]  invalids and nothing is symbolized i'm just saying the groups that are there people that
[37:25.680 --> 37:30.080]  have gotten out of mental institutions people that have been had severe head trauma
[37:31.440 --> 37:39.280]  hateful people control freaks they crave power they crave control over the language
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.440]  and they target the children because they're bullies and they can't get anybody else to
[37:45.440 --> 37:51.440]  do what they want so they want to target the children and people that are enclosed bubbles
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.400]  like universities are leftist cities and they expand out from there
[38:00.800 --> 38:06.240]  and they crave power over what you're doing and and the power to surveil you the only way they
[38:06.240 --> 38:10.640]  could destroy the nuclear family the only way they could break down a christian western society
[38:10.640 --> 38:16.240]  the only way they could conquer us is by corrupting us and then setting up systems
[38:16.240 --> 38:23.360]  where we're surveilled and controlled with casual societies with big tech and look what's in the news
[38:23.360 --> 38:31.520]  today chilling information i probably should have led the broadcast with facebook and google track
[38:31.520 --> 38:37.040]  what porn you're watching even when you're incognito even when you're using a virtual browser
[38:37.040 --> 38:46.720]  even when you're using another server they work with all the big porn sites all the big dating

[39:52.960 --> 39:58.880]  pennsylvania that's that's hilarious researchers at microsoft it's like satan telling you what
[39:58.880 --> 40:06.080]  bathomet did more than 22 000 porn sites were analyzed of which 74 percent were found to
[40:06.080 --> 40:13.280]  contain google trackers oracle had trackers on 24 and facebook on 10 google and facebook
[40:13.840 --> 40:20.160]  said data from these trackers was not used to build marketing profiles sure it wasn't
[40:20.160 --> 40:27.360]  you know that's a live zuckerberg festo and it just goes on from there here's another one
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.920]  report viral face app now owns rights to 150 million users
[40:38.160 --> 40:43.360]  that's right you do that face app that makes you age we did a joke about info wars dot com
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.120]  in an ad for uh the betsy ross flag and when you're doing it it says in the terms of service
[40:49.120 --> 40:54.240]  buried 20 pages down that they now own your likeness and that you agree and that they're
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.640]  an ad agency and that they may not let you even use your image in the future you know
[41:00.080 --> 41:04.560]  for about 46 years everyone born in the u.s and europe has their blood taken
[41:06.160 --> 41:11.280]  and it's put into a global database and then companies test your blood and they find original
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.920]  proteins and things and they go and they patent it they go and register it so when you later
[41:15.920 --> 41:21.280]  go to get a genetic test done or or genetic treatment they come in they say yeah that will
[41:21.280 --> 41:28.160]  be a million dollars because we own your blood not told people this 20 years ago it's now been
[41:28.160 --> 41:35.200]  mainstream news see how that works and of course that's criminal that's fraud they're
[41:35.200 --> 41:39.760]  praying on young people most these folks doing this are too young to go into a contract if a
[41:39.760 --> 41:47.920]  contract's fraudulent then it's it's um not executable but no but people aren't going to
[41:47.920 --> 41:52.080]  fight this and then of course oh what's in the news guess who's buying the database

[48:40.640 --> 48:48.400]  transmission with most of his testimony robert epstein the computer science expert psychologist
[48:48.400 --> 48:55.520]  do that his big team go over how google's feeling the election but this is so important that one of
[48:55.520 --> 49:01.280]  our own crew harrison smith put a short two minute boil down together and i said harrison great job
[49:01.280 --> 49:06.800]  but you got happy music on this like it's clown world this is like we need imperial battle march
[49:06.800 --> 49:11.760]  or something from star wars on this i mean this is like or or or air raid sirens or marching troops
[49:11.760 --> 49:19.520]  and barking german shepherds i mean this is this is stealing the election without a shot being

[49:23.600 --> 49:29.840]  here is the serious version of social media is secretly manipulating tens of millions of voters
[49:29.840 --> 49:37.600]  and set to steal the 2020 election now here it is google's manipulation of votes gave at least
[49:37.600 --> 49:45.840]  2.6 million additional votes to hillary clinton in the year 2016 is that correct 2.6 million is a
[49:45.840 --> 49:56.400]  rock bottom minimum the range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they
[49:56.400 --> 50:03.680]  were in using the techniques that i've been studying they control these and no one can counter
[50:03.680 --> 50:11.440]  act them these are not competitive these are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively
[50:12.480 --> 50:19.600]  your testimony is that google is through bias in search results manipulating voters
[50:21.200 --> 50:28.160]  in a way they're not aware of on a massive scale in 2020 if all these companies are supporting
[50:28.160 --> 50:34.880]  the same candidate there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's
[50:34.880 --> 50:41.120]  knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace without monitoring systems
[50:41.120 --> 50:50.080]  in place we'll never know what these companies are doing and in 2020 you can bet that all of these
[50:50.080 --> 50:57.440]  companies are going to go all out and the methods that they're using are invisible they are
[50:57.440 --> 51:04.320]  subliminal they're more powerful than most any effects i've ever seen in the behavioral sciences
[51:04.320 --> 51:08.720]  and i've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years a handful of silicon valley
[51:08.720 --> 51:14.800]  billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars if not billions of
[51:14.800 --> 51:23.440]  dollars collectively massively influencing the results of elections senator with respect i must
[51:23.440 --> 51:29.120]  correct you please if mark zuckerberg chooses to send out a go vote reminder just to democrats
[51:29.120 --> 51:37.520]  on election day that doesn't cost him a dime there you go and that's how it works bingo
[51:38.480 --> 51:44.400]  and you've got all the democratic party machines caught on video in arkansas and caught in texas
[51:44.400 --> 51:48.720]  and caught in california and caught in new york and caught in new jersey and caught in florida
[51:48.720 --> 51:58.160]  all on undercover video by veritas and other groups what an awesome job in 2016 2018 going yeah
[51:58.160 --> 52:02.480]  we go pick up all the homeless the illegal aliens you know the illegal aliens are better because
[52:02.480 --> 52:07.280]  they're not alcoholics is bad and we have to give the homeless whiskey and beer then they vomit the
[52:07.280 --> 52:12.720]  back of the bus but our jobs to get them each to vote 10 times and we'll get each illegal alien
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.200]  this is what democrats even call me legal aliens we'll get them illegal aliens and we'll get them
[52:17.200 --> 52:24.000]  homeless to vote 10 times a piece that's our job larry nickles used to organize that in arkansas
[52:24.000 --> 52:30.960]  for bill clinton he ran over 100 teams across the state with homeless and they just would go to the
[52:30.960 --> 52:36.080]  rolls of the obituaries they paid private companies to categorize who was dead but then
[52:36.080 --> 52:42.320]  check it on the roll and they got computers involved and that's all they do they just go into
[52:42.320 --> 52:49.760]  precincts they're democrat control they go and you know some some dude named sanchez you know
[52:49.760 --> 52:55.520]  comes in and votes for some guy named walter johnson who's been dead for five years oh and
[52:55.520 --> 53:01.600]  what happened they just sued judicial watch took them two years they just found out in california

[53:08.640 --> 53:19.280]  this were dead people that's right millions of dead people voting in this country it's hilarious
[53:19.280 --> 53:25.120]  isn't it oh but they're not going to have illegal aliens vote that's a right-wing line now they're
[53:25.120 --> 53:29.040]  publicly legalizing illegal aliens voting all across the country in democrat cities
[53:30.080 --> 53:36.480]  it's the official democrat policy to let them vote if you went to mexico or anywhere else
[53:36.480 --> 53:41.280]  and said oh i'm i'm living in the u.s but i'm here to vote they'd laugh at you you tried to vote the
[53:41.280 --> 53:47.920]  police would kick your ass guarantee you'd get your ass kicked because you're trying to usurp
[53:47.920 --> 53:51.920]  someone you're coming into their country to steal their birthright well they pay taxes and you're

[54:21.680 --> 54:27.200]  please don't forget they did it i i didn't eat lunch yesterday and then they went and
[54:27.200 --> 54:31.200]  got one of my fast food indulgences that i don't eat a lot of fast food
[54:31.200 --> 54:36.480]  but they got me a big order of tendies from pop eyes and i ate the whole thing
[54:37.600 --> 54:40.160]  and i still stayed up here for a few hours when i was in a coma
[54:41.760 --> 54:49.440]  and i didn't cut the new ads i just i just won't do it so i in fact i i'm just plugging can we check
[54:49.440 --> 54:56.240]  infowarestore.com what does it say on there is the 1776 special still going because i i haven't
[54:56.240 --> 55:02.080]  come up with new ones or shot new ads for them i did shoot a new ad right before the show today
[55:03.760 --> 55:08.640]  but that's for the betsy ross flags we have new versions of that new designer versions and navy
[55:08.640 --> 55:14.960]  blue and white these colors don't run and on the back america's back in full wars.com

[55:24.080 --> 55:30.960]  variants with the snake on it saying don't tread on me on the back america's back in fours.com
[55:32.080 --> 55:35.520]  and again the crazy part about this is we were to come up with new shirts over a week ago
[55:36.640 --> 55:41.120]  and because they're limited edition and i said i want a gadsden snake on the flag
[55:43.440 --> 55:48.880]  and i want don't tread on me and then we see chris pratt on tv wearing the exact same shirt
[55:48.880 --> 55:52.480]  but it's just common sense they're trying to get rid of the american flag saying you can't have it
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.920]  it's evil don't even say american and now places like berkeley and and then places like denver
[55:58.800 --> 56:03.520]  this cult means business and they've got our kids they're brainwashing people and so you just wear
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.000]  a flag now and throw it in their face and let them know they're not going to do this they're not
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.160]  going to dominate us but we knew the flag and our language and saying we can't even have a country
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.960]  we knew that's where they were coming next remember crump's bad he says nationalism's good
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.120]  that's evil because they're globalist they're conquering the country they want you to hate
[56:21.120 --> 56:27.440]  your own birthright hate your own bill of rights hate your own freedom so they can usurp it with
[56:28.080 --> 56:36.640]  globalism corporate fascism so there are now six different variants of betsey ross flag shirts at

[57:03.600 --> 57:11.360]  and it's a revolutionary act to tell the truth in a 1984 scenario and i knew let the left hated
[57:11.360 --> 57:17.760]  america a decade ago but just the last few years you go out and when they start yelling
[57:17.760 --> 57:23.120]  at me in the street and i go i love america america's a great country they go no it's like
[57:23.120 --> 57:26.960]  saying in the name of jesus christ satan out of the body it's like an exorcism they go
[57:28.240 --> 57:34.160]  the american flag especially the betsey ross one or don't tread on me is like count dracula
[57:34.160 --> 57:40.800]  getting hauled out of his crypt at high noon and looking up at that big old yellow sun in the sky

[58:38.720 --> 58:45.280]  today full power of the republic in the name of jesus christ full power damn the torpedoes go straight
[58:45.280 --> 58:54.960]  adam it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other
[58:54.960 --> 59:00.400]  thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[59:00.400 --> 59:04.800]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[59:04.800 --> 59:09.120]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[59:09.120 --> 59:14.720]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[59:14.720 --> 59:18.880]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[59:18.880 --> 59:23.840]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[59:23.840 --> 59:27.680]  wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[59:27.680 --> 59:32.240]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news
[59:32.240 --> 59:37.360]  and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken
[59:37.360 --> 59:42.160]  through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american
[59:42.160 --> 59:46.640]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[59:46.640 --> 59:55.280]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:14.000]  the answer the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show listen to that

[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.600]  robert plant got out of the occult which we're never really into real fast put us up just a
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.680]  little bit but but i i always heard robert plant gets infuriated if they say this song
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:03.520]  is the satan it's the opposite it's against the devil and people that care and and and sell out
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.320]  so just just powerful words listen to this right here and i had a chance to talk to plant myself
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.800]  he confirmed that here it is you're like listen to ledges up we're driving to work he lives
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:22.240]  100 yards from your office there was a lady who shines white lights
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.040]  yeah folks figured out he lived on mary street he had to move then he moved out like travis
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.720]  you listen very well then he left austin let you come to you
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.200]  let's see the christians the main linemen's will say you're a devil if you listen to music
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.640]  but they're not out there abortion flex you know trump gets mad that says they want to ruin the
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.920]  gd economy everybody goes you took the lord's name in vain you know but god judges the heart
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:05.520]  i'm not authorizing sin i'm saying people that point at trump and say i don't like the fact you
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:12.240]  did that well what are you doing to fight evil what about the beam in your eye i get under leviticus
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.000]  the old testament you could have an old jewish expansion if you're not supposed to write the
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.320]  name god you're not even supposed to say god's name unless you're a high priest so that's where
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.720]  all that comes from but god judges the heart like when i've said before i hope hillary clinton is
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:36.080]  damned to hell and i don't want to wish bad on people and it's not good luck that is i don't
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:42.000]  but i admit it i mean i'm not a hypocrite i'll tell you that i would love to see her i hope god
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.480]  does send her to hell that's not taking lord's name in vain in the ancient hebrew and all that
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:57.120]  that people would use different god's names invoking them for their own selves but that's
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:03.920]  the form of jewish mysticism and magic and cabala from the temple of solemn that came later
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.840]  and so people don't even know what taking the lord's name in vain is because they listed as some
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.680]  midget brained preacher who isn't going to fight the new world order isn't going to fight the world
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.240]  government who isn't going to tell you don't take elon musk's brain chip oh no he'll just glitter bug
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:27.280]  up there and say yep you're a thinner because you thought you're you're you know your wife sister's
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.920]  good looking you're a devil to make you feel like you're bad in the center so you won't go out and
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:40.240]  do any good or i heard that mr president so the democrats are now using everywhere oh he said gd
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:46.720]  he's a hypocrite christians are learning trumps never been a hypocrite about using cuss words
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:53.280]  and stuff if he wants to use them and i'll just tell you i go off of god's fearing and by that i
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.080]  have a conscience i have a soul i can feel god's presence in the universe as anybody that's dialed
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:04.080]  in can and when i say gd hillary clinton to hell i want to fend you but i say it in my home
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:10.000]  i feel good i feel i thought taking god's name in vain i hope he does send her to hell
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.800]  and that's what trump means to he goes they'll ruin the gd economy they'll damn the economy
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:25.520]  it's the heart that god judges king david sent his best friend off to be murdered
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:32.640]  in a frontline suicide mission because he was overcome with lust for his wife now later he
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.280]  really repented and felt horrible and god judged his heart and said you are a man that's my own
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.760]  heart god made us like this with all this passion and all this power and these evil demonic preachers
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:47.920]  try to teach you not to use the power god gave you god knows where centers are not perfect
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.480]  when we get energized with power we're gonna go off the rails sometime but that doesn't matter
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.600]  what matters is the heart i mean willing to stand up against evil
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:05.920]  info wars the most banned network in the world viewers and listeners i wouldn't be here if it

[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:38.560]  baby

[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:28.080]  evil Elvis bringing us in, infowars.com, newswars.com, those are the forbidden information, alright,
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:35.920]  I am overloaded with info, and next segment I will get into the huge Hillary knows it's
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:44.260]  so massive, but this segment I'm going to be a good person and I'm going to do my best
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:51.860]  job just reading these headlines, some I've already hit, some I haven't, but I just have
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:55.660]  to do this, because I want people to get an idea of what we're seeing every day and what's
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.820]  on infowars.com and newswars.com and drugreport.com and all the rest of the sites that I look
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:07.620]  at constantly, Trump is nominating Justice Scalia's son for a big job, President confirmed
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:18.340]  nomination yesterday, he's going to bring him up for the Labor Secretary, Abortion Barbie
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:31.060]  Wendy Davis, another Beto type creature, will run for Congress against pro-life Texas congressman,
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:40.060]  oh by the way Beto O'Rourke is now polling at zero nationally, he is a mindless fake
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:45.100]  liar that says the world's ending in 12 years, and when he was in New Hampshire you got to
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:51.260]  love these straight shooting Yankees, they just go, who are you, you silver spoon turd,
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:59.300]  and again it'd be okay if his family's ultra rich and his father-in-law's worth $28,000,000,000
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:07.020]  and his wife's worth $2,000,000,000, but they're carpetbaggers that came down to feed on Mexicans
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:15.020]  in South Texas and run all sorts of exploitation on people, okay, and it gets worse than that,
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:22.060]  Beto O'Rourke is involved with the caravans and all these scams, and he's just a horrible
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:28.180]  person, he's also extremely stupid, but it just shows how he's the flavor of the month,
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:34.020]  man, how they built him up like God, like God, but guess what, his stupid stickers are getting
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.940]  taken off everybody's cars now, and I'm telling you, half the time I'm somebody's in a fast
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:44.980]  lane, driving 55 and a 75, there's a Beto O'Rourke sticker on the back, these people
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:52.060]  are stupid, who would buy into crap like this, hey Beto, a little news flash, not even Democrats
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:59.940]  like somebody going and campaigning in Mexico for the election in the U.S., I mean, can
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.740]  you imagine if Mexicans came up here to campaign for stuff in Mexico, I mean, it's insane,
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:13.940]  so here he is in New Hampshire and they're like, who are you, and Beto spazes out and
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:30.620]  laughs at it, you know, apologizes for being white or whatever, here it is, oh, he's such
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:36.420]  a fake man, and he always makes this move like a dog that's trapped on the floor, like
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:39.420]  got into the groceries and ate him, you know, when you come home, the dog's like on the
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:47.220]  couch, kind of wobbles back, he just constantly does that, like, I wouldn't buy a car from
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.860]  that guy, I mean, if I was in a restaurant and saw that guy on that, look, I'd say that
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:57.020]  guy's either a child molester or a pervert or something, I mean, he just looks like
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:05.780]  a child molester serial killer, oh, well, this does not go there, but just these people
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:13.100]  are all deranged lunatics, okay, I'm sorry, I've already digressed, okay, let's continue.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:17.340]  Let's get us some Ilhan Omar news, I didn't get to this last hour, can we play the clip
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:26.860]  of her talking about her homeland, talking about our nation back home, you know, when
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:31.300]  the Italians or the Irish or people from other African countries get here or people from
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:37.020]  Asia, they say, I'm an American now, I want to be an American, I'm here, I mean, if I
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:43.060]  moved to New Zealand, and I pulled up stakes, I'd come there and I'd say, what's your customs,
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:52.980]  what's your food, what are your sayings, I'm going to go native, but no, these people want
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:59.660]  to be their own group because they're here to exploit, so here she is.
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:08.500]  In 2016, this election cycle, and you guys have the ability to make an impact on where
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:15.380]  our nation is headed, not only here in the United States, but even in our nation back
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.380]  home.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.500]  This is the woman then that says Black Hawk down were terrorists, though they were trying
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:26.100]  to help a UN food mission, and that Somalis were attacking the UN food, oh, here, here's
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:33.460]  a bunch of free food, oh, we're going to blow up your convoys and steal it all.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:37.660]  And remember the clip of her a few days ago, I don't like how they say, when they say America,
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:43.500]  they go, America, they have pride in that stinking filth all, in fact, before we get
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:50.820]  to that clip, let's play from a documentary, there's hours of this, Somalis in Minnesota,
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:58.900]  these are her, these are Ilhan Omar's constituents, in her district in Minnesota, and every person
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:06.660]  the film crew talked to said, I don't want to be here, I want to be back in Somalia,
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:15.780]  because I will live under Sharia law, here it is.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.700]  This is the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:23.420]  It's known for the University of Minnesota, phenomenal ethnic food, and the export of
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:27.340]  American fighters to the terrorist groups ISIS and El Shabab.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:32.420]  In fact, it's reported that dozens of young Muslims from this community have gone to fight
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.340]  for these organizations.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.260]  So we hit the street to find out what is going on.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:42.300]  Is it easy to be Muslim in America, or is it hard?
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.300]  It's easy.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.300]  It's easy to be Muslim?
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.300]  Yeah.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.300]  Nobody gives you problems?
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.700]  No, it's not a problem.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.940]  And you go to school here, obviously, and the kids, are they good to you, are they nice
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.940]  to you, or is it tough?
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.380]  Oh yeah, yeah, it's not tough at all.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.380]  Alright, let's hit pause.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:00.980]  So he goes through the documentary, and I'll tell you the name of it in a moment, and shows
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:04.100]  are not being abused, it's nice, you know, whatever, but they want us to live under Sharia
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:11.220]  law, everybody talks to, and then they want to go back to Somalia.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:15.020]  And so that's all Trump's saying is, if you don't want to be here, you want us to live
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.380]  like you're living, and you don't want the schools to have pork, just because you don't
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:23.500]  want to look at it, and no, we're not going to conform to your way of life.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.020]  We are not going to do it.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.020]  Here's the report.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.020]  You want to attack her?
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.020]  Yeah.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:34.020]  If you had a choice, would you rather live here, or would you rather live in the Muslim
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.020]  country?
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.260]  I'd rather live in a Muslim country with my people.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.020]  Would you prefer to live in America, or prefer to live in Somalia?
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:41.700]  For me, I think it's Somalia.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.180]  You'd prefer to live in Saudi Arabia?
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.180]  Yeah.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.420]  Would you rather live in America, or live in Somalia?
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.900]  I'd rather live in Somalia.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:49.900]  I'm not American.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:55.020]  I just speak fluent, and I'm articulate, and I articulate what I'm trying to say.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.020]  That's about it.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.420]  But other than that, as far as my culture, and my preferences, and everything, it's
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:00.420]  still Somalia.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:04.060]  Even though here you have all the freedom and stuff like that?
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.460]  Even though I have all the freedom...
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.540]  Being life might be better in Somalia than here.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:15.740]  Now you have the freedom of it, of practicing your religion, while working and doing your
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:18.300]  other things.
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.940]  And when we come back, we're going to have Elon Omar going, America, these Americans,
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.660]  they like to say it, like they like it.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.060]  Because if there's one thing about Somalis, man, they are arrogant, boy.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:35.220]  I watched the whole documentary put out by Ami Horowitz, and it's just...
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:40.700]  You can see the guy's faces, they are so damn arrogant, they got that rock star arrogance
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:45.740]  that's so sickening, just like, not a kid, just like I am the ruler.
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:49.580]  Because in Somalia, they rule the blacks.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:54.380]  They're quote African, but man, they are the slave gods, the slave masters, and they're
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.580]  going to show you how to bat out.
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:03.980]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:32.260]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.260]  the world.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:36.260]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:42.220]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:46.020]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.020]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.540]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:55.100]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.260]  at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:01.780]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.020]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:10.820]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:14.460]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.980]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:19.980]  across America.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:24.020]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.540]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:28.540]  healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:31.180]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:36.420]  Only over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.860]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:05.180]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.180]  heritage.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:12.500]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:17.900]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.300]  know is right and what they know is true.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:28.660]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history, as long
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:36.020]  as we never, ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:48.540]  can not do.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:19:07.540]  So the Info Wars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:12.420]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.420]  one another.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:18.060]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:22.860]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:27.100]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.460]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.460]  and supporting Info Wars.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:37.100]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:40.940]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:46.140]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.980]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.980]  to hold.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:55.140]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:01.780]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:21.700]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:31.660]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:38.780]  or later you've got to cut you down, sooner or later you've got to cut you down.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:45.580]  Go tell that long-tongued liar, go and tell that midnight writer, tell the rambler, the
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:49.980]  gambler, the back fighter, tell them that God's gonna, gonna.
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.220]  So Trump's a Nazi, the border patrol are Nazis, we're killing children.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:59.900]  They're concentration camps, Black Hawk down were terrorists trying to support UN aid vehicles
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.900]  bringing food.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:10.100]  And Ilhan Omar though was talking about when Americans talk about America, they go, America
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.980]  and then she starts laughing.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:18.140]  It's so funny, a country that would take somebody in, welfare her whole life since
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:23.980]  she was a kid here, marries her brother, runs all sorts of scams, tax fraud scams, she's
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.580]  pled guilty to everything.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:34.220]  She gets elected by a bunch of starry-eyed, crazy-ass Minnesotans and then she just uses
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:40.660]  everybody like their birdcage liner and again just listen to her arrogance when she talks
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:46.460]  when they talk about America, they go, America, it's called Merca, Merca.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:52.700]  This is that you don't say America with an intensity, you don't say England with an
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.180]  intensity, you know, you don't.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:59.560]  You don't say... is that you don't say America with an intensity, you don't say
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.780]  England with an intensity.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.160]  You know, you don't.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.720]  You don't say... is that you don't say America with an intensity.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:12.540]  Now let's play the whole two-minute clip in context cause what she's saying here is
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:17.460]  Oh, they're talking about al-Qaeda, and they get mad at that.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:21.780]  But then she goes into saying, but you don't say America like that, because every time
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.180]  she gets asked, when she was in the state government, now the national government, to
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:34.740]  cry al-Qaeda, to cry ISIS, she always goes, I will not dignify that with an answer.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:40.420]  But she wrote letters to federal judges to get people out of jail saying, oh, they were
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:43.820]  in a good fight in ISIS, fighting oppression.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:46.100]  That's what she wrote.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:50.660]  And she voted against a bill blocking terrorists from life insurance, and she voted to block
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:58.140]  a bill so stepfathers, not just their fathers, but stepfathers couldn't cut nine-year-old,
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:02.900]  some of the girls were 12, cut their genitals off.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:08.660]  I don't need to describe this for people on air, but there's a part of the female anatomy
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:11.380]  that can trigger orgasms.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.220]  There's many areas, but the point is, is that, thank God, the Muslims didn't figure out
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.660]  the G-spot, or they'd go after that.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.820]  But I mean, this is bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.340]  This is serious business, okay?
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.500]  This is a family show, too.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.140]  This is medical, what we're talking about.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.380]  They're cutting women's genitals off.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.660]  And the feminist just, oh, oh, it's just rock star.
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.340]  It's rock star.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.260]  I told the story of, I went to a little island off the coast of Mexico, because it supposedly
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:43.820]  wasn't as crime-ridden, and Mexico's beautiful, great food, great people, but I was just down
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:51.060]  there a few months ago, the day after I left East LaMajera, it's a little island, a policeman
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.780]  got shot and killed there.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:24:00.060]  So it's about as dangerous as Chicago, but we were standing in an ice hotel, and there
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:06.740]  was a gay wedding there, because we, I guess we stayed there about five days, and I couldn't
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:12.460]  handle it, man, watching these gay men who were all in perfect shape, and had their nails
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:15.500]  done perfectly, and their hair done, their teeth perfect, they all looked like Ken Barbie
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:26.260]  dolls, groveling to a bunch of African Muslims.
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:31.580]  And by African, they were Arabs, but they were flavor types, and I'm sitting there knowing
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:36.620]  the whole history of this, and these gay guys would come up at the tables at dinner or at
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:39.500]  lunch or at breakfast, and just go, oh, hi, how are you doing?
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:44.420]  And the Muslims would just go, ugh, ugh, and they'd go, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:47.620]  but then, they don't know who I was, they were like, oh my God, it's Alex Jones, ugh,
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.740]  ugh, and I'd be sitting there with a pina colada and my kid swimming, and there's these gay
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:58.860]  guys and all their girlfriends, all the fag hags out there with them, and I'm not being
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:03.100]  mean to gay people, that's the term they call it, fag hags, okay, everybody knows it, and
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:06.580]  so they're all out there with the fag hags and all the rest of it, pointing at me because
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:14.500]  I'm the big monster, and they're worshiping the Muslims, they're absolutely worshiping
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:19.580]  them, and the Muslims were wearing the hijabs, I mean, some of these women had their faces
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:23.860]  almost covered up, it was right down to here, it was kind of in between a jib and the bee
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:29.660]  keeper suit, and I'm not kissing the Muslims' asses, and the Muslims are smart, they were
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:32.900]  dolled in, they didn't know who I was, they were looking at me, and I was looking at them,
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:38.620]  I'm not kissing their ass, but then the gays, they'd come and sit down next to the Muslims,
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:45.020]  the Muslims would be like, ugh, they'd get up and go to another table, so whatever it
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:51.660]  was with the Muslims, there was about, there was about 100 Muslims in the hotel, it wasn't
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:26:01.980]  that big of a hotel, and there was about 150 gay dudes and their fag hags, and then very
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:05.780]  few families, it was just a beautiful place, and I'm just sitting there going, what in
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:12.540]  the hell is going on here, cause let me tell you, I don't care, I fly commercial, I sit
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:18.140]  down, the Democrats are trying to spit at me, I don't care if the brainwashed gay guys,
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:23.220]  who I have nothing against, and have nothing against, those women, any of them, I'm the
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:27.660]  devil though, see, I'm the Nazi, I hate them, meanwhile they're groveling to Muslims that
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:33.940]  I guarantee you would throw them off a cliff or stone them to death if they could, but
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:41.140]  because the left fetishizes anything that's not American, anything that's not Christian,
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:48.140]  treating those gay guys totally disconnected from reality, you know, just like you see
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:52.380]  a bunch of women going to get their nails done, and they're so domesticated, and we're
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:57.020]  all domesticated, and people are so soft now, you wonder what would it be like in a war,
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.300]  and man, I was looking at all these dudes, you could tell they could probably bicycle
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:07.100]  100 miles and run a marathon, but my God, they were just so domesticated, and just groveling
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:13.460]  to these Muslim men, I showed a shot video of it, because my kids were playing on hammocks
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:18.260]  that were over the pool, and the gay guys were like, just totally disgusted with me
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:23.140]  and my family, and again, I've even had gay guys come up to me and say, screw you and
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:27.980]  after your family, happened to Rex when he flew back from Colorado last year, I told
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:31.060]  the story, and the guys had already been yelling at me on the airplane, and these were big
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:36.900]  guys from the snowboarding championship they were having out in Colorado, and we're getting
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:42.180]  our bags, they walk over and they go, F you, and I said okay, whatever, F you homophobe,
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:45.580]  and I'm just like, well actually, you're the one obsessed with what you do with your ding
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:51.540]  dong, so just leave me alone, so they followed Rex out as he already got his bags, and said
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:58.020]  you want to fight, he was 14 then, he's 16 now, it was almost two years ago, you want
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:04.300]  to fight, like six foot one, 240 pound gay dudes, who were like royalty because they're
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:11.020]  gay, and damn it, you're a Nazi, so get out of my way, and I'm like, you're crazy man,
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:18.580]  absolutely crazy, so they have converted the left, not just people that are gay, into
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:29.580]  crazed, insane, frothing idiocy, and I just can't take it anymore, they're playing a video,
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:34.620]  it was like move, I'm gay, like throwing things in the office, this is the left in general
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:39.460]  though, they just feel entitled, and like this new royalty, and it's disgusting, alright
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:43.220]  when we come back, I'll give you the big Hillary news, I'm sorry I haven't got to it yet, I

[01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:02.980]  The globalist are hyper competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:07.060]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:12.180]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:15.860]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:20.380]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.340]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:28.620]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from the forerslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:32.940]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:38.660]  methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, ultra 12.
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:43.540]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:44.540]  to find anywhere.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:49.700]  It is amazing, experience pure methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:33:01.380]  evolution against the tyrants at info wars store.com, info warslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:19.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:38.940]  Alex Jones, waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation, changing the
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:47.220]  world, relaunching the republic, relaunching Americana, relaunching the Renaissance and
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:34:03.460]  true freedom, 1776 worldwide.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.660]  It's heaven and hell.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:12.780]  All right, let me get into something.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:20.380]  Let me get into something briefly that is so paramount that it deals with the very essence
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:28.220]  of the soul and the spark of consciousness and creation.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:34.580]  Every study documents what we already know in our heart and minds to be true, that apathy
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:43.540]  leads to entropy, leads to collapse, and that if you don't have a purpose-driven life,
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:49.540]  you will die before your body fails.
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:58.060]  Excessive watching of television that's not interactive causes early onset of things like
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:02.060]  the neurological disorder of Alzheimer's.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:07.140]  He knows that a symptom of being old and not having an active lifestyle is that people
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:14.900]  become very rigid, very OCD, and they don't form new neural networks in the brain and
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:22.420]  they accelerate towards their untimely demise.
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:31.380]  Apathy most common symptom of dementia, science daily, distinct from depression, present nearly
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.660]  half of patients.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:36.340]  This is out of the University of Exeter.
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:43.300]  Apathy is the most common neuro-psychiatric symptom of dementia with a bigger impact on
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:50.020]  the functioning than memory loss yet is under research and often forgotten.
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:57.540]  And our very way of life is now sitting in front of screens clicking on things to get
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:00.020]  dopamine rushes.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:05.100]  And so when you go out in the real world, you don't get a dopamine rush off an owl flying
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:11.460]  over or a hawk or the moon or airplanes flying in the sky like we're in a science fiction
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.460]  movie.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:19.260]  We are science fiction reality and just the magic of the universe or what your woman is
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:25.980]  really like or what your man is really like and these experiences of falling off your
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:31.180]  bike or jumping a dirt hill or getting in a fist fight or kissing that girl for the
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:38.220]  first time, these are deep experiences that our ancestors experienced that are rituals
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:44.420]  within us that open up the gateways to perception in the universe.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:46.260]  We must go through the rituals.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:51.540]  That's why the enemy tries to domesticate people and make sure that there's no fist
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:56.740]  fighting instead people just shoot each other because fighting is an important ritual for
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:06.700]  men, very critical to unlock your potential, exercise, mathematics, everything.
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:10.380]  But nobody knows how to do math anymore because we use calculators and soon we won't know
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:13.500]  how to drive cars anymore because they're all going to be self-driving.
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:19.260]  This system is designed to dehumanize us and the people that run it admit they're doing
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.780]  it to dehumanize us because they want us out of the way so the globalists can control
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:32.980]  the future and so they can dictate the new architecture and so instead of just physically
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:39.980]  killing us right away, they kill our intellect, they kill our spark, they kill that which
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:43.300]  makes us higher than the animals, that we can control our own environments and that
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:47.300]  we can control our own destiny to a certain extent and that we can envision things and
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:52.180]  then build those things that were master builders.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:56.660]  And it's that great understanding of not just having a purpose-driven life of the leftist
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:01.580]  who want to control people so they have limited intellect and longevity but still better than
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:11.420]  a zombie because they have a will of evil, a operating system of control.
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:16.540]  But when you dial into the universe and the mystic secrets and all the magic and the real
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:25.860]  potential and the ancestral memories and the ancestral will, that is again, electromagnetic
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:32.820]  electrochemical from you to your most ancient ancestor is an unbroken electromagnetic chain
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:39.940]  of genetic information that operates as an antenna to receive and transmit as a transceiver
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.700]  into higher dimensions.
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:44.020]  This has all been proven scientifically.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:47.740]  The enemy can't stand it while I get on air because I already know all their equations,
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:50.780]  their operations and then of course later I can go out and research and they've written
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:54.260]  and said exactly this but in their more secretive reports.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:39:01.140]  So let me just tell you, I'm giving you the big enchilada, okay, oh we're real, oh we're
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:08.540]  eternal and they don't want you to know that because you're awesome and they want to lead
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:18.100]  you with them into their creation that is a leaking, stinking hellhole.
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:26.860]  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, your kingdom come, your will be
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:30.820]  done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.580]  It's all in plain view people.
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:39.380]  I'm going to go with the God that made me and gave me everything I am.
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:45.860]  So beautiful, so strong, instead of the weak stinking servants of evil that bow to their
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:51.620]  God, Hillary, of course she's ugly, of course she's fallen, of course she's wicked.
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.820]  You pull up my favorite photo of her where she's showing her real face where she's looking
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:57.540]  at her minion.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:05.140]  You want to be a slave, you want your soul to be in one of those holding cells for eternity
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:08.740]  and believe me, folks have seen them.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:14.740]  You want to be on board that craft with those people, man, all ashamed of themselves, all
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:18.300]  alone forever, their own private hell.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:22.580]  Hell is the absence of God.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:30.060]  The burning fires that mystics saw was the burning rage, contempt, and fear of vampire
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:37.500]  parasites who don't have anyone to feel anymore, together in their rage and apathy and powerlessness
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:40.460]  that they are cut off from God.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:47.300]  That psychically feels like burning flame, feels like being consumed, well that's where
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:50.220]  all you child molesters and devil worshipers are going.
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:54.740]  You're going into your own consciousness, you're going to be with all the devil worshipers
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:41:00.260]  and child molesters and demons and psychos and you're going to be together just ripping
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:05.980]  each other's souls apart forever in the phantom zone.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:14.220]  Because you chose hell, you wanted hell, God is a God of free will.
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:24.540]  And so you chose to get on your knees for the lie, to get on your knees to Satan because
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:27.380]  you were scared.
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.700]  Most people don't choose Satan for power.
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:34.380]  They choose it because they brush up against it and they get scared and then the devil
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:41.220]  comes around and says, serve me, I'll protect you, I'll give you power, but you've got to
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:50.340]  hurt people before I'll do that, you've got to, what does Palpatine tell you to Anakin?
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:55.980]  You won't be powerful enough to defeat Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda until you've gone to the
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:00.900]  Jedi Temple and killed all the younglings.
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:05.580]  And he goes and kills hundreds of children, that's what they tell the Satanist, start
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.980]  with your dog.
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:15.900]  Oh, you like having sex with a super hot, 18 year old, go kill your dog.
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:24.540]  We want you to, we want you to cut your dog's heart out and then see it just goes from there.
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:34.420]  Do what must be done Lord Vader, show no mercy, kill everyone at the temple, then there
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:43.980]  will be peace, everything is proceeding as I have foreseen it.
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:48.980]  Stay with us, I will get to the downfall of the house of Clinton, you have my word on
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:57.620]  the other side, infowars.com, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:03.020]  Last night I'm on infowars.com and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:08.700]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned, a Betsy Ross and also another just classic
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:13.580]  American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:17.820]  And on the back, America's back, infowars.com, but what's better than just an American flag
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:21.140]  about a don't tread on me under the flag, saying don't trail the American flag, it's
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.140]  a perfect combo.
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:24.980]  So great minds think alike, I mean whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.740]  with the exact same similar design.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:32.020]  It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:36.780]  of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt, but it's a battle tattered flag like the one that flew
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:37.780]  over Fort Sumter.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:45.220]  And again on the back, it says America's back, infowars.com, 4,000 of these babies and that's
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:46.220]  it.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:50.460]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowars.com, be
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:55.620]  imprinted in the USA right now, infowars.com, they'll be right back, the most banned broadcast
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:57.820]  in the world.
[01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:59.900]  Robert Barnes, what does Big Tech become?
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.940]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:07.380]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:08.380]  over two decades.
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:11.780]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:15.060]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:19.340]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:22.420]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:26.460]  big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:30.740]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:31.740]  the Great Depression.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:36.740]  The infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:41.500]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:42.500]  free press.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:46.900]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:50.660]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:51.860]  time it's not happening.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:53.700]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.620]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:59.380]  And it is what you just saw.
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:03.380]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people but I've decided that we're
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:07.020]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:10.180]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:13.620]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:17.100]  I'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good and instead the last few
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:20.660]  years I'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:23.260]  people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.260]  they were.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:26.020]  The fact always has headlines everywhere.
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:28.620]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:30.020]  He claims they're supplements.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:35.260]  No, under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.900]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.780]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:45.380]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:46.660]  and a lot of drugs work great.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:50.620]  They have side effects not with Mother Nature but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:59.220]  God's medicine chest infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:04.540]  There's going to be a social media summit here in DC tomorrow of course info wars ground
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.180]  zero for the censorship Alex Jones patient zero for the censorship doesn't even get
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:12.620]  an invite but that's fine we'll play the dark night we hope that there's other people
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:16.740]  there that will bring us up bring Alex Jones up bring some of the other band names like
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:22.180]  Gavin McGinnis and Milo Notlas and Laura Lumer up as well and they won't be bullied
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:26.340]  by some of the conservatives that like to censor those voices as well at the summit
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:30.580]  but we'll see I have a feeling this is just going to be throwing a dog a bone patting
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:34.380]  him on the head and telling him to move on with his day but hopefully maybe this spurs
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:39.740]  some action from Congress from the president from the White House to do something about
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:44.900]  the big tech censorship before the 2020 elections when it's going to be so key it was info wars
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:50.500]  presence on social media that helped get Trump into the White House that's why we are targeted
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:55.860]  so let's see what happens at the social media summit 2019 for info wars.com this is Owen
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:14.820]  Schreier you're listening to the Alex Jones show stay at attack formation
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:47:46.300]  good book tells us that vengeance is mine saith lord but if you read deeper
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:55.060]  many a man and woman in history has been used as the implement or the engine or the device
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:00.940]  the tool to deliver vengeance so I always simply pray that God lead God and direct me
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:10.260]  for God's will and that whatever God's plan is that I turn myself over to it and that
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:17.900]  I be a vessel everybody else prays and ask God for stuff my experience you don't get
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:27.300]  things you ask for you get what God's plan is when you supplicate yourself in the presence
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:38.820]  of God you also need to be careful when you do ask for something to make sure you're going
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:44.700]  to be up to it but that's God's secret if you really want to stand up against evil God's
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:50.780]  going to put you through trials and tribulations to put more and more weight on you like a
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:49:00.820]  powerlifter meets a gymnast so that you can take it because God doesn't give people anything
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:10.300]  they can't handle when they ask for it God weakened himself to the position of a human
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:17.100]  to have the sins of the earth put upon him and Christ at the Garden of Gethsemane was
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:21.700]  looking into the space time continuum and saw the incredible torture incredible pain
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:29.220]  of the skin to the bone all hanging off his back and suffocating up on the cross that's
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:41.020]  not a horrified Christ it was God having to go into hell and face all of that twisted
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:49.460]  dementedness that God had to look into that place and that's why Jesus wept not for the
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:59.100]  pain he was about to go through but for all the children being tortured throughout eternity
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:07.220]  and torn limb to limb and a moment of almost guilt for God in the God's head perfect vision
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:12.180]  knowing we had to be given free will but still feeling guilty and that so many of us have
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:22.020]  to be hurt the Satanists always say that God's a sadist for all this war and all this pain
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:29.740]  God gave us consciousness and free will we did all of this with a little help from another
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:40.820]  rebellious creature and so it had to be done this way it's the only perfect way do you
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:49.220]  really look at it God is perfect and imperfection is heaven and hell and everything in between
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:57.860]  it because consciousness is hard to scale the heights of the universe and to see the
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:03.140]  mind of God versus a devil worship or torturing a toddler to death as it begs for mommy those
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:14.020]  of the two fulcrums absolute love and vision God Satan torturing God's embryonic creation
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:22.860]  I choose God it's not even a choice is it but people are cut off from young age to being
[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:30.380]  close to God and they don't know and the enemy ever works to keep us from God that's why
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:34.780]  the churches have been captured by the devil you feel more demonic force than any of these
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:40.620]  big churches you feel anywhere else and that's because that's where the enemy really is because
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:48.860]  that's the battlefield but I'm gonna stop preaching the end of Hillary Clinton is here
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:53.740]  and to watch the Clinton crime machine still giving orders to the media to say that Trump's
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:52:01.580]  involved with Jeffrey Epstein or to have their operatives and child porn to us in hidden code
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:07.140]  that that then Democrats subpoena us for get and find so they can say I'm involved in child
[01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:12.740]  porn no one bought that of course very proud of the audience thank you I knew you wouldn't
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:17.060]  buy it but still it's it's it's it's when you're in every newspaper in the country is
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:22.020]  a sitting child porn the Sandy Hook parents it your family's calling you up saying is
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.580]  this true it you know it's not fun but you know I felt good about it because it means
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:35.500]  I'm over the target and that is one judge judges me one one judge only one my judge
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:44.740]  says I want more out of you I want who I want total commitment God's got it so I'm telling
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:55.460]  you something right now ladies and gentlemen little little things like this let me do a
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:53:07.860]  rush limbo imitations the most sincere form of flattery you've seen Nancy Pelosi's daughter
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:11.660]  come out two weeks ago and say this is gonna get bad for our favorite people that means
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:29.460]  Hillary bill the head of virgin former Israeli prime minister all of you see it's a right
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:37.500]  of passage the things they do they know they're being videotaped when they do it Robert Mueller
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:44.460]  was involved that's not coming out you see you got a tiger by the tail it's plain to
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:55.740]  see these people push and push and push they've had all these seasons of the devil's reign
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:54:04.540]  but before we go down into the antichrist tunnel for a while we get that big last breath
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:08.460]  like before the battle you get a few minutes to pack yourselves in the back and think about
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:12.860]  who you are God just give us a little time a little time to think about the world the
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:19.220]  universe of a decade or so it'll be an incredible time coming up but we're still gonna have
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:26.900]  a time to see what it could be like we were good people and so remember the head secret
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:30.620]  service agent he ran foreign operations you have domestic secret service you have a secret
[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:41.940]  service that handles when potuses outside conus continental United States and so what did
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:46.060]  Bongino say when the media was attacking him saying you're a liar Clinton when the Clintons
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:52.220]  were never on that plane he said watch it don't poke the bear secret service got kicked
[01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:59.740]  off those flights because they wouldn't go along with it and now what is Jake Tapper
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:07.300]  a rat leaving the sinking ship to Adam Sherworth says this is all going to get so much worse
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:13.300]  talking about Jeffrey Epstein and Jake Tapper says evergreen and all the comments get it
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:24.140]  evergreen HRC code name used by secret service code much Tapper and I see all these articles
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:27.780]  for the left says brace for it brace for it that's what I've been trying to normalize
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:31.380]  pedophilia and all these shows and movies last few years because they know Trump's moving
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:37.740]  against their whole network ten times last time I checked because he's growing ten times
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:42.340]  the number of arrests indictments convictions of pitos the last two and a half years three
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:51.460]  years there's Dan Bongino be careful Nick people know things not yet released publicly
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:57.220]  about your Messiah Hillary don't poke the bear loser you may not like their results
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:01.660]  you see there were little boys and little girls on those planes there were mainly little
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:10.580]  girls and Hillary likes little girls she likes them a lot she likes to suck energy off of
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:17.180]  them to file them what is it bill famously got recorded saying my wife seemed more tail
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:28.660]  than a bicycle seat she's got more girls than me she seemed more tail than a bicycle seat
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:36.780]  yeah yeah Hillary Clinton is a Satan worshipping pedophile on little girls and it's all gonna
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:42.660]  come out you dirty witch you don't have any power over me I don't fear you at all you're
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:55.500]  gonna be sent into hell and bound for eternity you are damned to hate ease hope you enjoy
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:57:05.700]  it I'm hanging on to God like the fall of Saigon 1975 people hanging on the helicopter
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:13.980]  skids man you think I'm scared of you I want as far away from you as possible if that means
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:22.260]  Hillary has me killed in my book that's royal flush I don't want that physically spiritually
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:28.500]  gut level I think I get to go upstairs all I want those combat revans to get before the
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:39.740]  big guy and squeak through let me tell you I'm a big old fat wicked devil I love God
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:44.740]  that's why Hillary all that hate me I'm in my potential I'm way more evil they could

[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:57.100]  of fresh air I talked to a lot of people here in New York City and one thing I can tell
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:59:02.100]  you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that the neocons are trying desperately
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:06.700]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:11.380]  him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it I mean if Trump buys into this
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:14.300]  it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way I think he could be defeated other
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:17.780]  than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and the
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:22.020]  last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:26.180]  have arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I would love
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:30.100]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've
[01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:35.220]  gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:39.180]  and many others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war and
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:43.300]  even if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a
[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:52.740]  lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling you're listening to the Alex
[01:59:52.740 --> 02:00:21.620]  Jones show
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:29.740]  you found it info wars Alex Jones here okay hit Daniels always impresses me I know he's
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:35.460]  a smart guy he's one of the lead riders really he's pretty much the editor of info wars
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:39.860]  we don't have titles around here Paul's got so busy with the work he does he still edits
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:47.820]  as well but he yesterday when I was getting really mad at Trump and saying man he shouldn't
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:55.620]  back off on the sill on Omar thing he comes up and goes hey you want me to write a story
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:58.620]  and I don't tell him what to write or control what he writes sometimes I'm like hey you
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:02.980]  ought to do a story on this a couple times a week or hey maybe change this change that
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:07.780]  I think that's not right with somebody else's story or something I've said I put a headline
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:11.540]  out later I think it's wrong most time I'm correcting what I've done because I'm up here
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:15.220]  a lot on air and you know see to my pants sometimes and I get stuff wrong not on purpose
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:21.860]  but I'm hearing a rebroadcast I'm like that's not right this is you know the brain hiccups
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:31.580]  brain farts because you might write a story about which means you think I'm right about
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:37.940]  Trump actually knows what he's doing with all on Omar for this reason and I just said
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:42.460]  whatever kid still it makes him look weak and it's stupid and everybody hates her she
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:46.780]  says we're killing kids and death camps I mean it's just that's why people are pissed
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.540]  at her he goes okay I just think we should respect the president he's proven right more
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:56.340]  often than you've even said yourself I said fine do whatever you want kid and I walked
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:03.020]  off because I was in a bad mood he just walked in and dropped us in my lap today American
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:08.820]  thinker is saying exactly what kid Daniel said so see if you can get kid in the studio
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:17.900]  so I can talk to him next segment because this is probably right because I've seen Trump
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:23.020]  do this before when he knows somebody's about to get indicted he'll go oh I don't know anything
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:29.580]  about them now oh no I'm not saying do anything to them because we have our petition to re-linked
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:36.100]  up on info wars.com to have her criminally investigated and then it's found she became
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:42.340]  a citizen illegally deported you know married her brother all that fraud but that's basically
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:52.180]  the word is that Trump doesn't want to turn her into too big a martyr because if it's
[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:55.260]  one thing to say hey if you don't love it leave it like let's come in with that moral
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:03:03.660]  hacker if we can that's that's fine we're not making her leave but it does sound a little
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:08.820]  authoritarian to say you know ship her out of the country no no no let's keep her around
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:19.980]  running her evil mouth let's let's let's let this ripen a bit and then she gets indicted
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:26.420]  and then she gets shipped back because believe me they say Trump is vindictive no ladies and
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:37.100]  gentlemen he's not vindictive he has a real sense of justice and getting even you know
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:43.540]  at times Jesus said go out and buy a sword sell your cloak by a sword and he beat bankers
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:47.740]  and Pharisees with with a whip and overturned tables and kicked people upside the head and
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:51.340]  they poorly kicked a bunch people's ass but he did it because that's the time to do it
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:58.660]  in that way but when somebody slaps you across the face they're trying to set you up so they
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:04.300]  can put you in prison like Muhammad Gandhi learned from Christ he said he did and Martin
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:10.500]  Luther King Jr. you let people be you let them attack you at that key point just like
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:14.700]  I let let this come up and spit on me hit me on camera because I'm going to show what
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:19.420]  dogs they are I just close my eyes and let them slap me and hit me because we're going
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:23.220]  to show they're the monsters we're not going to give them what they want because but doesn't
[02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:29.700]  mean if they come to my house that I don't defend myself as viciously and as violently
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:34.220]  in a controlled fashion as I can to end the threat and it becomes my house with guns I
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:41.060]  kill them instantly but some Libtar walks over and says I like to have sex with kids
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:45.420]  and that slaps me in the face they're destroying themselves in front of everyone and I'll take
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:51.140]  a slap in the face to burn them that's turned the other cheek it's knowing when to hold
[02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:56.940]  them knowing when to fold them knowing when to walk away knowing when to run it's not
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:00.900]  only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:05.620]  that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:09.980]  backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:13.700]  that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely independent of
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:18.940]  all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:23.180]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:27.300]  at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:30.740]  just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:34.780]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:39.300]  sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons
[02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:43.700]  allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:48.500]  the they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:52.460]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:06:12.100]  defamation law fair and libel targeted youth waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:21.740]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war so i'm not saying that drudge
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:36.220]  is wrong because before i even saw his headline before i even saw drudge's headline trump
[02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:47.500]  turns on make america great again disavows send her back chant before i even saw that
[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:51.700]  i was kind of mad saying why is he backing down off this she says we're putting people
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:58.100]  in concentration camps she says that america sucks that uh that the black hawk downed
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:01.740]  guys were murderers when they were trying to protect the u n food convoys they got
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:06.620]  attacked it's disgusting and i'm like why is he doing that and then kit daniels walks
[02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:12.620]  over and he goes probably because she's under criminal investigation for tax fraud her campaign's
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:17.180]  under investigation for stealing money just like a o c's been caught with multi millions
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:23.540]  she shouldn't have and they're just sitting back going well if we prosecute them it looks
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:28.660]  like we're persecuting them but it is the law and the democrats and republicans a jail
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:34.220]  for nothing all the time and so is it that they're getting ready with her marrying her
[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:39.900]  brother and her immigration fraud and all of that to criminally indict her and if the president
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:47.420]  is saying yeah ship her back and the justice department starts proceedings to do that well
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:54.780]  it looks like he gave the order and we know that that is a distinct possibility so i kind
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:59.420]  of thought it was a kaka made me thing the kit said i mean i i'm not saying i think kitson
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:03.460]  kaka made me i just thought that's that's too much but american thinker has laid it out
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:07.860]  basically how kit laid it out to me yesterday so we'll talk to kit daniels of informers
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:14.700]  dot com but first here's the president disavowing people saying ship her back when your supporters
[02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:18.940]  last night were challenging chanting send her back why would you stop them why did you
[02:08:18.940 --> 02:08:25.300]  ask them to stop say well number one i think i did i started speaking very quickly it really
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:33.380]  was a loud i disagree with it by the way but it was quite a chant and i felt a little bit
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:39.100]  badly about it but i will say this i did and i started speaking very quickly but it started
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:44.940]  up rather rather fast as you probably know so you'll tell your supporters never well
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:53.980]  i i would say that i i was not happy with it i disagree with it but again i didn't say
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:09:00.020]  i didn't say that they did but i disagree with what you said in your first week well i don't
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:08.260]  think if you examine it i don't think you'll find that but i disagree with it in the main
[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:13.100]  it's not like she's just a member of the congress from somalia if she was pro america great
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:23.140]  i'd love to have people from somalia like that but all she does is run it down constantly
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:29.500]  and so and she just says the most horrible things and we're just supposed to sit here
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:33.500]  and put up with it and then trump's bad they've they've said we're gonna impeach this mother
[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:40.420]  effort he's killing kids he's got him in concentration camps she said that and then he says well
[02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:46.540]  go back to your own crap whole country then if ours is so bad which is a normal response
[02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:53.220]  people start saying ship her back ship her back it puts us into the offensive mode like
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:10:04.780]  we're on the offense bullying peanut head and so i get why the president did it i just
[02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:08.820]  don't think he had to nuance it where he's like well i disagree well i shut them down
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:12.460]  should have said hey they're angry they're upset people are sick of being pushed around
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:16.500]  rush limbaugh had the right response people are sick of being told how crappy they are
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:20.500]  and how they're nazis and how their country sucks and how the board patrol are killing
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:27.700]  children it's lies and and then she's caught working with ISIS and protecting him i mean
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:38.500]  the woman's a criminal overwhelmingly a fraud so i agree with drudge i mean i think i think
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:44.060]  your theory may be true i'm not sure i just think trump knows she's under investigation
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:48.100]  and he knows some nut to go after turning her into a victim so he's distancing himself
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:56.100]  a bit and you know he's probably is smarter than me or you you or i so yeah i think your
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:59.940]  guts probably right because every time i think trumps wrong he ends up proving that he was
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:05.260]  right but but but just getting back to you kid here american thinker basically wrote
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:10.060]  in this article the real reason why trump disses himself from send her back chance and it's
[02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:15.060]  word for word what you basically said yes i guess you never wrote the article but just
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:20.060]  elaborate on your on your gut or why you think this well keep in mind president trump has
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:26.820]  a lot of experience now with what he can do and say not just as trump but as president
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:30.980]  united states because of the Mueller probe he had a lot of meetings with lawyers saying
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:34.660]  hey you can't say this as president's because that could construe obstruction of justice
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:39.780]  and vice and whatnot we're telling the justice department what to do yeah yeah exactly so
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:44.220]  in this case he's got a distance himself and what he can say publicly about it if there's
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:47.780]  going to be an ongoing investigation because it'll look like impartial justice if she gets
[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:54.140]  indicted for all her crimes which are legion if it looks like trump the dictators ordering
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:58.460]  it yes exactly and the other thing is is that from all the evidence i've seen it against
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:05.100]  omar so far the problem that she's going to have is a lot of it is verified court documents
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:11.060]  so that's you know they got it the doj they've got a good they got an easy case on this one
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:15.220]  so of course the only thing that they could uh destroy the case is if trump talks too much
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:21.660]  about it publicly well you seem to have your ear to the ground is it just you an american
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:26.780]  thinker with this theory or others i hadn't seen this theory too uh on the news too much
[02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:31.460]  yet but it's just so happens american thinker kind of did this article after i said it but
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:38.900]  uh i mean once you get into the nuances of trump as president versus trump the personality
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:44.500]  you start to realize you know there's any uh a reason for a lot of his so-called madness
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:51.180]  he there's certain things he has to do and say that he has to do and say with the position
[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:55.980]  that he's in so people kind of tend to uh throw him uh under the bus a little bit too
[02:12:55.980 --> 02:13:00.100]  much then oh you know he's abandoning his base so on so on but that's not really the
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:05.460]  case here i don't believe i think this is a good choice by him to make sure that justice
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:11.980]  if it's going to be applied against omar that he doesn't derail it i don't i hear you i don't
[02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:16.220]  see them ever deporting her because even though if you become a citizen be a fraud you're
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:21.780]  still a citizen it's just that we need to understand this cancer that we see from the
[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:27.220]  squad there are only a few degrees more extreme than the rest of democrats they just know how
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:30.820]  to keep their mouth shut the best cartoon was editorial one last week maybe you guys
[02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:38.020]  can pull it up on the fly of pelosi is laying out the cement sidewalk the road and here come
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:42.700]  these four freshmen running across it messing it up with their footprints so and i'd even
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:46.540]  said that on air i said they're on pelosi in the globalist road i even said that days
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:50.940]  before and i'm not saying they plagiarized me it's just this is all common sense stuff
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:55.940]  is is she they're building this unamerican road and then here are these women calling
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:14:01.100]  her a racist bitching at her and making up all this crap when pelosi's the one selling
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:07.580]  and quarterbacking the whole anti-white garbage it's like but they're so stupid and they're
[02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:12.100]  so hateful and they're so racist that they don't even get that the politicians are doing
[02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:17.460]  it for divide and conquer cold bloodedly they really are racist they really are chip on
[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:22.420]  their shoulder little jerks that literally think white people you know have some evil
[02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:27.500]  operating system and we've got some master plan and we want to screw brown people over
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:31.460]  most of the white folks i see are just you know marrying and have babies with brown
[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:39.660]  people you know it's just it's unbelievable garbage and i'm sick of it but even the democrats
[02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:44.540]  have been admitting i got some of the articles that trump and america won so far with a squad
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:49.140]  of four and the fact that they're so stupid they won't shut up i wonder what the next
[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:53.300]  chapter is going to be kid nails well going back to an earlier point you made i don't
[02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:57.260]  believe she's going to get deported because she came over to the u.s i believe when she
[02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:05.780]  was 12 now a lot of the evidence against her that could you know doj's looking at apparently
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:11.380]  stuff she may have done in like 2009 when she was around 26 i believe so you know it's
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:16.460]  not so much you know i don't think chanting send her back is really going to be effective
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:20.380]  in this case i think what's going to happen is what has she done as an american citizen
[02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:25.300]  that might have broke the law so i you know i could see this being another al frankenstein
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:29.700]  scenario where you'd have a she might have to be forced to resign and that's the end
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:34.300]  of it i'll be honest from a mackey of ellie in position i hope she never resigns this
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:40.420]  woman is just all the pulse show it and that's nasty demonic little pig and that's an excellent
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:44.780]  point you just made there alex because the democrats might be more interested in her
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:50.860]  to resigning the republicans because all i know is illan omar is the daughter of what
[02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:57.140]  happens when you have two pigs have sex you get illan omar attention gcn self reliance

[02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:55.940]  in the New York Times admitted said that he was spit on coming back from Vietnam he was
[02:21:55.940 --> 02:22:02.940]  a combat vet he never left the country he ran toys for tots as a way to get around the
[02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:07.260]  draft this is the guy running the lawsuits for Hillary this is the guy trying to shut
[02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:16.060]  down info wars this guy is a monster this guy is a real piece of work and Trump has
[02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:22.620]  been exposing him so here's Millie Weaver's report on it Richard Blumenthal is the Brian
[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:41.340]  Williams of the Senate remember this which was shortly followed up by this a few occasions
[02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:50.220]  I have misspoken about my service and I regret that which kind of reminds me of this two
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:55.540]  of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in which was
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:23:01.820]  shortly followed up by this I want to apologize I said I was traveling in an aircraft that
[02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:11.340]  was hit by RPG fire I was instead in a following aircraft one of these individuals pushes fake
[02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:18.580]  news while the other pushes Google towards more censorship recently during the committee
[02:23:18.580 --> 02:23:26.100]  of the judiciary subcommittee on Google censorship on search engines Senator Blumenthal had this
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:36.180]  to say Alex Jones and others used you to you to quote and I'm quoting him regurgitate
[02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:43.140]  demonstrably and undeniably false information for too long Google and his peers were quote
[02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:50.020]  unquote complacent to the threats I respectfully suggest whatever your machines are they're
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:57.340]  not working would you agree this Google exec doesn't look too thrilled by Blumenthal statements
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:05.500]  and requests we and absolutely believe we believe that hoax videos of the kind that you reference
[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:13.580]  and had to experience have no place on any of our platforms that's probably because just
[02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:19.580]  moments before Blumenthal dropped this little nugget also in the interest of full disclosure
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:27.380]  I should tell you that his lawsuit against Alex Jones is one where one of my sons my
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:35.340]  oldest son works as a lawyer wow are we watching real life Game of Thrones or a soap opera
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:39.980]  if I've said it once I've said it a hundred times the best policies the best laws that
[02:24:39.980 --> 02:24:46.020]  we make are dead letter unless they're effectively enforced I say that is someone who spent most
[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:53.180]  of my career in a monster enforcement you lying pigs and hey I'm not siding with Google
[02:24:53.180 --> 02:24:58.220]  I'd love to see them get justice for what they've done to conservatives and politics
[02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:03.980]  in their search engine results but this moment in time might just reveal who's been pressuring
[02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:10.860]  Google in the first place for too long Google and his peers were quote-unquote all day minutes
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:17.500]  it is a tough computer science challenge but we are we can continue upload it well individuals
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:23.540]  will be responsible for it I think there is a moral imperative here and the hourglass has
[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:31.100]  run out Blumenthal could decide to reach across the aisle through an act of bipartisanship
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:37.660]  and help Republicans take away the section 230 communications decency act immunities
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:44.780]  from Google making them now vulnerable to lawsuits exactly similar to those facing Alex
[02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:51.180]  Jones and info wars you happen to have a provision of law that dates from the inception
[02:25:51.180 --> 02:26:01.540]  of the Internet that gives you in my view a very excessively broad shield of immunity
[02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:06.420]  we're going to come back and put the rest of the report but you have to understand something
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:09.700]  he's threatening their immunity if they don't take me off the Internet well and what they
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:15.020]  mean is don't let other people even talk about me or put me up he wants what Facebook is
[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:21.820]  saying he's telling billions of people around the world and 300 plus million Americans you
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:27.500]  can't even have Alex Jones he's mad I'm still here yeah man we're still here thanks to the
[02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:33.660]  audience and and we're reaching more people than ever despite your wicked lying draft
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:39.180]  dodging he says he's a commando that you ought to read the quotes from him even the New York
[02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:43.500]  Times he was running back when your time still did some truthful stuff has this huge article
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:50.700]  where he says he was in combat and all this stuff I mean this guy is a joke man and he's
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:57.060]  sitting there saying Alex Jones must be taken off the air and then lying about what I've
[02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:04.580]  said and done what a dangerous person let's continue with Blumenville excessively broad
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:13.940]  shield of immunity we can debate the merits of section 230 at another time responsible
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:22.540]  for it or Blumenville through another act of bipartisanship could help regulate or split
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:29.260]  up Google for antitrust and monopolistic practices as Google committed to an independent
[02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:36.620]  audit of how it enforces these policies as Facebook and Twitter has promised I think
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:41.740]  the answer is no I'm going to come back and finish this and go to your calls but this
[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:45.700]  is so critical because we never got to this the other day because I'm literally we're
[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:49.140]  in the news all the time I can't just cover us in the news but this is bigger than info
[02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:57.940]  worst this is obviously everybody we're not even part of it we're just a pawn Blumenville
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:03.260]  just a few months ago was saying keep section 230 lead big tech alone but he said oh the
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:08.740]  timers up he knows Trump is taking action he knows the republic is going to take action
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.980]  because they're about to steal the election he knows the EU and the chai comms are already
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:17.900]  regulating Google so by our government not prohibiting foreign regulation they've let
[02:28:17.900 --> 02:28:23.660]  China and everybody censor see how that works they go oh heritage foundation libertarian
[02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:30.620]  we can't have laws about speech for corporations then you let the chai comms run it you need
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:36.300]  a law prohibiting the violation of our rights like the first amendment is a law that protects
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:42.940]  rights it doesn't take rights but now Blumenville is like oh we'll take your 230 oh well because
[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:47.580]  he knows we're coming for him he thinks he'll spin it all around and grab victory from the
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:55.500]  jaws of defeat no lizard man you're not going to get that you soulless chicken crap attention

[02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:16.300]  you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand
[02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:19.900]  dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need
[02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:23.700]  to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product I want to expand not

[02:33:45.780 --> 02:34:00.620]  all from I mean the boss all that was in charge in your rebellion you could have had the universe
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:15.300]  now all you'll have is virtual reality hell the absence of God Richard Blemethal
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:22.860]  I've done a lot of studying into him because he's Hillary's agent they admit in the Senate
[02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:28.740]  he represents Hillary as the rats leave the sinking ship as all the pedophilia is coming
[02:34:28.740 --> 02:34:35.740]  out as all the blackmail is coming out this this this guy who's been hanging around Washington
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:44.020]  his whole life is scared and he and his family you know they think if they can mount my head
[02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:52.580]  they'll have a soul this is literally a servant of Hillary like that job of the hut you got
[02:34:52.580 --> 02:35:00.020]  salacious crown that sits in her lap that's tricky dick Blemethal but you've got to read
[02:35:00.020 --> 02:35:03.660]  even the New York Times New York Times always would lie about WMD's but one of the good
[02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:10.580]  reports Blemethal's words differ from his history as a huge article and it's got him
[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:16.060]  saying I was spit on when I got off the plane from Vietnam and I was a combat captain Marine
[02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:22.260]  Corps major battles and there's all these quotes in his bios and when he ran for Attorney
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:30.140]  General of Connecticut I mean this guy is even at the New York Times is like even after
[02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:34.340]  people telling to stop saying he was a Marine Corps officer in combat he won't stop saying
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:39.500]  it we looked at his record he got all these draft deferments and then was putting a special
[02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:52.540]  unit for rich kids in DC where he ran toys for tots toys for tots I go to your phone calls
[02:35:52.540 --> 02:36:00.020]  but it is a pleasure to be persecuted by scum like this let me tell you something right
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:06.860]  now I don't want to be some chicken neck solo skexie like this guy please God thank you
[02:36:06.860 --> 02:36:15.660]  that I am not dick Blemethal Lord who is literally the groom of the stool for Hillary Clinton
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:25.220]  he goes around and just reportedly yes master you dick you'll do what I say Hillary you're
[02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:32.620]  like I was shot down in combat in Serbia Brian Williams style just a pack of scum they couldn't
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:38.060]  fight their way out of a wet paper bag that's why they're so obsessed with killing unborn
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:43.380]  babies and born babies because they're ghouls their devils they're falling their trash their
[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:50.300]  jokes and killing a real boy will never make you a man living tall you'll always be trash

[02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:17.340]  rest of Millie Weaver's report that's up on info wars dot com I'm sure you want to share
[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:24.340]  it Richard Blemethal is the Brian Williams of the Senate here it is made it to an independent
[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:33.340]  audit of how it enforces these policies as Facebook and Twitter I promise not along the
[02:37:33.340 --> 02:37:39.260]  lines of what exactly you're you're referencing I think but we do answer is no why not your
[02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:48.340]  name is responsible for or Blemethal with a nod and a wink could help Google have their
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:54.780]  cake and eat it too if they were to simply continue censoring conservatives such as
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:38:03.220]  Alex Jones and info wars off their platforms and helps sway the 2020 election results towards
[02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:09.340]  the Democrats I'm looking for a commitment that you'll do better machines or you'll
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:14.300]  have different ways of detecting and different ways of enforcing but again not just guidelines
[02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:19.700]  or policies but actually investing in what's needed to make these policies and guidelines
[02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:29.220]  real center you absolutely have our commitment there is a lot at stake in this very moment
[02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:35.860]  you can even see it on this Google execs face Blemethal knows he has a lot of power and he's
[02:38:35.860 --> 02:38:42.620]  flaunting it meanwhile Alex Jones and info wars are caught in the middle as a bargaining
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:48.900]  chip in the balance of the future of free speech all I can tell you we don't want those
[02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:54.100]  kinds of videos up there's there's there is it's certainly not conducive to the kind
[02:38:54.100 --> 02:39:00.740]  of community we're looking to build at YouTube we we agree that that it is a responsibility
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:07.380]  that we and all platforms have to make sure that you know videos like that don't appear
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:14.500]  on our system wow so what's gonna happen when will we ever find out or will we find out

[02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:17.420]  here in the third dimension one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've
[02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:21.940]  really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies if I wasn't taking the highest
[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:26.660]  quality supplements for the forest life dot com I couldn't do it that's why we decided

[02:44:00.580 --> 02:44:05.400]  model is a self fulfilling self supporting structure that is promoting free press and
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.620]  free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one
[02:44:09.620 --> 02:44:15.100]  another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach it
[02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:19.860]  is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting self sustaining self
[02:44:19.860 --> 02:44:24.540]  structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:28.580]  goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:32.340]  supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is whether
[02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:36.260]  it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want
[02:44:36.260 --> 02:44:40.460]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the
[02:44:40.460 --> 02:44:45.380]  same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they
[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:49.340]  want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic
[02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:56.820]  expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[02:44:56.820 --> 02:45:04.620]  we will always be the people who defeated a tyrant cross the cotton harness science took
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:12.660]  to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will never forget that we are Americans

[02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:43.060]  red pill plus too i mean these are these are the stuff strong well um my lesson was you
[02:51:43.060 --> 02:51:49.300]  can overdose on the periodic table and uh vitamins are you know but anyway let me get to my point
[02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:54.900]  here uh you know this jeffrey ebbstein thing has been swirling around and you know i i've
[02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:59.220]  got a lot of channels that watch on the internet different people you know some of them i kind
[02:51:59.220 --> 02:52:04.900]  of think they know what they're talking about others are just talking to talk um and i you
[02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:10.700]  know you're pretty much always true north and you know i kind of i kind of listen to
[02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:16.860]  what people say and compare it to things you say and see the confusion and uh you know
[02:52:16.860 --> 02:52:22.060]  it's frustrating because you know the biggest reason i'm following all this from the beginning
[02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:31.300]  was i want to see hillary clinton go to jail but in my journey of hoping for that um you
[02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:36.580]  know i learned a lot of things that i didn't know before and as the bible says the rose
[02:52:36.580 --> 02:52:43.860]  colored glasses are off male and so uh you know it's not something i'm super happy about
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:50.020]  but i want to thank you for that uh i'm well brother i'm glad you're neo and i'm morpheus
[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:53.860]  but we're all i'm neo you're morpheus back and forth we're all waking each other up
[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:57.940]  it's all a process i try to be true north i try to figure out what's happening sometimes i'm
[02:52:57.940 --> 02:53:03.060]  wrong but we you know over time we've got the general road this thing's going on so we've
[02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:09.300]  got it's it's it's it's target it's destination we know where they're going we know jeffrey
[02:53:09.300 --> 02:53:14.660]  epstein was working for intelligence agencies he was obviously a double triple agent he was
[02:53:14.660 --> 02:53:20.900]  working with us intelligence israeli intelligence european intelligence groups and he was just
[02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:27.900]  running a giant corruption clearinghouse uh just just just involved in absolutely terrible
[02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:34.260]  things uh and so it got too much for the u.s intelligence community whatever was going
[02:53:34.260 --> 02:53:39.020]  on and we we know what it was wasn't just raping kids it got even worse than that and it was
[02:53:39.020 --> 02:53:44.060]  a huge compromise operation uh and america had a gut check the last six seven years and
[02:53:44.060 --> 02:53:48.500]  basically drafted donald trump to fight it that's why central to it has been bringing
[02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:51.980]  down the pedophiles and the media is like oh that's a hoax trump's not going to bring
[02:53:51.980 --> 02:53:55.700]  down pedophiles and you see it all happening so what do they do oh trump's a pedophile
[02:53:55.700 --> 02:54:00.500]  oh alex jones is a pedophile senator blumenthal found out i mean you know just give me a break
[02:54:00.500 --> 02:54:06.100]  oh hillary's minion oh alex is in the child porn bs and you know it so it just all went
[02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:09.940]  back on them they're totally freaked out right now they're like it's not working we it doesn't
[02:54:09.940 --> 02:54:16.140]  work anymore yet doesn't work chicken neck people know who you are okay they're awake
[02:54:16.140 --> 02:54:21.500]  now we were asleep people are awake now they see they thought they were intimidating us
[02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:28.740]  kevin and that's why we were groveling no we were asleep asleep at the wheel and so
[02:54:28.740 --> 02:54:33.260]  now we're awake and and and so it's an incredible time but i mean that's pretty much what's
[02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:37.860]  happening with epstein and the justice department so compromised but trumps got the thermal nuclear
[02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:44.140]  uh codes literally and metaphysically and that he can destroy them anytime he wants
[02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:51.060]  now it's just going to be very damaging to the economy and everybody else but you know
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:55.740]  justice be done by the may the heavens fall i forget who said that can we look that up
[02:54:55.740 --> 02:54:58.860]  because i don't want to plagiarize somebody you know and then give a quote like i said
[02:54:58.860 --> 02:55:04.620]  it justice be done may the heavens fall and so that's where we are right now justice be
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:09.020]  done may the heavens fall and i just think trump should just let it all out and just
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:15.900]  burn these people it's time it's time for imprisonment it's time for executions after
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:23.700]  juries appears it's time for people to hang from the neck until dead agree so so with that
[02:55:23.700 --> 02:55:27.820]  you know there was this theory put out in some of the many people that i listened to
[02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:33.180]  that that this whole jeffrey epstein thing really what's happening is he's just going
[02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:38.340]  to be put away or they can keep him quiet and that like if his time were to come you
[02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:43.620]  know at the end of the senate that he's still alive he just wouldn't be let free and he
[02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:50.500]  was compared to someone i forgot who the comparison was to you but basically the whole jeffrey
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:54.940]  epstein thing and some people say that you know a lot of the prosecutors on this case
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:56:00.780]  are from the left and so the the premise is i mean i mean no doubt they knew this was
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:05.660]  all coming out so they're doing controlled demolition with these comey people with a
[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:09.540]  limited indictment try to limit it that's not going to work none of this is going to
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:15.820]  work so so whatever quote theories you're listening to it's normal to ask questions and and and
[02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:20.700]  i actually think you're dead on the the the good news is is a polosi's daughter all of
[02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:25.260]  them are saying it's our favorite people we're in trouble oh my god that's why they want
[02:56:25.260 --> 02:56:28.980]  a revolution that's why they want trump dead that's why he's saying he's a nazi that's
[02:56:28.980 --> 02:56:34.460]  why they're using aoc in them to sell these crazy things to divert from what's about to
[02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:40.860]  come out so uh this is the seasons of the abyss my friend i appreciate your call now listen
[02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:45.260]  dr nick begger is a great guy everybody that hosts the fourth hour knows that i commandeer
[02:56:45.260 --> 02:56:51.340]  it routinely so he'll host the last 30 minutes and do a great job i'll never get to such a
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:57.180]  spent 10 minutes with one caller it was a good caller jim and johnny and erin and zachary
[02:56:57.180 --> 02:57:02.300]  and floyd and rom and hat hat man and chris i will get to every last one of you but i
[02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:06.620]  could only give you each two minutes so you're making such great points just don't worry about
[02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:10.780]  telling me i'm great which i don't mind it's just fine or plug in products you've actually
[02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:13.980]  learned it's people plug in products on air that sells them because there's folks really
[02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:20.500]  how good they are and we were in the red until they planted the child point and uh we're in
[02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:25.420]  the black now not a lot but it's it's it's good to be in the black it's always good uh
[02:57:25.420 --> 02:57:31.340]  so uh info war store dot com go get t shirts go get books you know but folks are like oh
[02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:35.740]  jones claims under attack once they say they're oh god he is an attack folks i can't tell you
[02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:40.620]  10 percent of the attacks were under believe me if you don't want this ship to go down pray for
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:45.900]  us spread the word of my products okay i am literally in your hands let's talk to marcus in
[02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:49.740]  new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey elix yeah i just want to say uh your
[02:57:49.740 --> 02:57:53.980]  show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i
[02:57:53.980 --> 02:57:58.860]  could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:03.500]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:08.780]  defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll
[02:58:08.780 --> 02:58:12.380]  be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating
[02:58:12.380 --> 02:58:15.980]  him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say
[02:58:15.980 --> 02:58:20.940]  alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love
[02:58:20.940 --> 02:58:24.780]  to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:30.700]  80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and
[02:58:30.700 --> 02:58:34.700]  there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue we're going
[02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:39.020]  to keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know
[02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:43.740]  for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[02:58:46.460 --> 02:58:51.660]  alex yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180 dollars so far this year
[02:58:51.660 --> 02:58:55.740]  and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to
[02:58:55.740 --> 02:58:58.780]  get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[02:58:58.780 --> 02:59:02.700]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality products the
[02:59:02.700 --> 02:59:07.820]  products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost
[02:59:07.820 --> 02:59:12.540]  weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get
[02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:16.700]  these little uh sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[02:59:16.700 --> 02:59:21.580]  throat well sir let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a good price
[02:59:21.580 --> 02:59:26.300]  but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two
[02:59:26.300 --> 02:59:30.860]  dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or
[02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:35.340]  the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:39.420]  of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10 off because you're on
[02:59:39.420 --> 02:59:43.900]  autoship and then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh we have patriot points
[02:59:43.900 --> 02:59:51.580]  we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:00.860 --> 03:00:07.740]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones a poet's tale
[03:00:07.740 --> 03:00:20.940]  a poet's tale how partio felt he left his leaven in cheap hotels the desert's quiet cleveland's cold
[03:00:22.140 --> 03:00:32.540]  and so the story ends we're told archo needs your prayers is true but save a few for lefty too
[03:00:32.540 --> 03:00:39.260]  you only did what he had to do and now
[03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:53.260]  could have had him any day
[03:00:53.260 --> 03:01:02.060]  you only let him go so long out of kindness i suppose out of kind size
[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:07.580]  town's man's end what a great screenwriter for the great texan who now lives
[03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:16.060]  you about how long let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls
[03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:25.660]  let's go ahead and talk to front versus on our center back comment
[03:01:27.260 --> 03:01:31.020]  you know a lot of callers here a lot of stuff to talk about he's at home long this year
[03:01:31.900 --> 03:01:34.780]  let's go with erin in alabama thanks for calling erin you're on the air
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:41.900]  hey alex i want to say i've been in broadcasting or it was for about 15 years the programmer and
[03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:45.820]  to be honest i hadn't heard of you until about six months ago and i'm very thankful that i found
[03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:51.900]  you you touch on a lot of stuff that i've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life and god bless
[03:01:51.900 --> 03:01:57.020]  you brother exactly we're all kindred spirits we really are we really are i'm looking at a couple
[03:01:57.020 --> 03:02:03.100]  of points to make but first i've had body pain all over my entire life and you know the product's
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:07.980]  better than anybody there i think what would you recommend i mean literally it's joint it's muscle
[03:02:07.980 --> 03:02:14.220]  it's everything what would you recommend to me to purchase you know i think x2 or x3 because
[03:02:14.220 --> 03:02:17.580]  that's a building block to everything if you don't have that the bad halogens take over and i would
[03:02:17.580 --> 03:02:23.580]  think body's ultimate turmeric formula turmeric is amazing this is a very strong extract one of the
[03:02:23.580 --> 03:02:26.460]  strongest out there probably the strongest but there may be one stronger so i don't want to
[03:02:26.460 --> 03:02:33.100]  say the strongest uh i mean i would i would think real red pill real red pill plus i mean these are
[03:02:33.100 --> 03:02:40.780]  all they've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body but then if you get
[03:02:40.780 --> 03:02:46.220]  preglonone in my experience i'm no doctor i just i talked to the scientist with these other herbs
[03:02:46.220 --> 03:02:50.540]  like real red pill and real red pill plus it does i mean i think you should go through the
[03:02:50.540 --> 03:02:55.980]  products everybody is different and test stuff out for yourself and then and then just see what
[03:02:55.980 --> 03:03:02.060]  works best for you but they're all super game changing the best we can get the best labs the
[03:03:02.060 --> 03:03:07.500]  cleanest just like whatever is the most proven the best i go produce that that's it because i would
[03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:12.860]  i'll explain this again i'm a very superstitious person and by that i'm god fearing i treat you
[03:03:12.860 --> 03:03:18.060]  like i want to be treated you've got my total commitment anything i do information any of it
[03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:23.900]  products is like like they went out and tested third parties did alexa pure and pro pure they're
[03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:28.460]  both some are better at this some are better at that but they're both people like wow we tested 30
[03:03:29.180 --> 03:03:36.300]  gravity fed filters and you have like the two best why am i why did i do that what the hell do
[03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:41.340]  you think i'm doing i'm gonna go out and get the i go out and find out what is the best price
[03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:46.300]  for the best quality because there's always like some space age $5,000 thing that's better
[03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:51.260]  but i look at it like at a line of like what is the lowest price for the best benefit and that's
[03:03:51.260 --> 03:03:57.980]  what i promote so so that's my advice on that go ahead sorry all right well and i appreciate that
[03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:02.540]  and i can tell just from the way you talk about the products and the things that you say i feel
[03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:06.300]  like i can trust you but you kind of do things the way i do you either do it right the first time
[03:04:06.300 --> 03:04:11.820]  or just don't do it and and and i feel like i can trust you on your product well listen don't trust
[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:16.540]  me because here's the deal you heard that under your collar and i'll hold you over see i'll never
[03:04:16.540 --> 03:04:23.340]  get to think baggage but once you get to your news you heard the guy go uh yeah but you better
[03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:28.460]  not take too much of that i9 that's what i'm telling people is you need to talk to a physician
[03:04:28.460 --> 03:04:33.740]  you need to research because the i9 conspiracies everything most people have almost none of it
[03:04:33.740 --> 03:04:37.900]  but if you've had none of it for 20 years you take a bunch you can have some issues detoxing
[03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:44.620]  you name it i mean this stuff this is this this is it man i mean this is this is dangerous it's
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:49.580]  dangerous because it's an element you've got to have they've taken away from you well what happens
[03:04:49.580 --> 03:04:56.700]  when you finally get it you got to be careful Robert Barnes what does big tech become a big
[03:04:56.700 --> 03:05:00.540]  tech or big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no
[03:05:00.540 --> 03:05:05.180]  consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and
[03:05:05.180 --> 03:05:09.420]  because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free
[03:05:09.420 --> 03:05:13.020]  press that care about this the ordinary members of the public in the audience that care about this
[03:05:13.020 --> 03:05:17.420]  has to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise
[03:05:17.420 --> 03:05:21.340]  they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big
[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:26.140]  trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground
[03:05:26.140 --> 03:05:29.980]  until we were able to recover after the great depression the informers audience is the fuel
[03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:35.260]  that flames the the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent
[03:05:35.260 --> 03:05:40.060]  free speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big
[03:05:40.060 --> 03:05:44.700]  tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try
[03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:48.700]  to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's
[03:05:48.700 --> 03:05:53.180]  the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you
[03:05:53.180 --> 03:06:03.180]  just saw
[03:06:10.860 --> 03:06:17.180]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[03:06:17.180 --> 03:06:23.580]  i want to be very clear because the caller just brought up x2 a lot of folks take x3 because
[03:06:23.580 --> 03:06:27.980]  it's tri iodine it's the deep crystal source and two others so everybody could absorb it
[03:06:29.900 --> 03:06:39.020]  x2 we have to get fda we have to get uh dea approval it's held in a locked armed vault
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:43.820]  now once it's put into the organic oil and through this patented process then we're allowed to
[03:06:43.820 --> 03:06:50.300]  sell it to you because you can make so many things out of pure iodine we're it's we have
[03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:56.780]  to jump through a lot of hoops because nobody else sells pure nuclear iodine about nuclear just
[03:06:56.780 --> 03:07:02.860]  means it's atomically pure we do because nobody else wants to spend the money to actually pass
[03:07:02.860 --> 03:07:10.220]  dea inspection and have the facility and do it we do it there's a facility in the utah and one in
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:15.740]  arizona and we just learned the globals are obsessed with iodine the globals don't want you to have
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:22.780]  pure iodine because see the fda says take this much iodine but it's bound usually so you're
[03:07:22.780 --> 03:07:27.100]  taking you're not getting it so even though we were following what they say is the safe iodine
[03:07:27.100 --> 03:07:32.700]  we lowered the amount in these because for some people this is real iodine this is like pure
[03:07:33.580 --> 03:07:39.180]  so they were going off statistics and numbers of like oh iodine uh you know take this much that's
[03:07:39.180 --> 03:07:46.140]  bound iodine you don't absorb it goes through you this is crystal deep earth oil drilling stuff at
[03:07:46.140 --> 03:07:53.420]  12 000 feet and so that's why i tell you and take a third of the dose be careful because if you've
[03:07:53.420 --> 03:07:58.300]  not had this your body will take in bromine chloride fluoride there's a whole bunch of bad
[03:07:58.300 --> 03:08:05.820]  halogens it'll op your organs everything operate your hormones are produced with halogen and so
[03:08:05.820 --> 03:08:10.540]  the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it so this is the good thing
[03:08:11.820 --> 03:08:16.540]  but like anybody knows it's like being punched kicked the head by a mule it's like oh that's
[03:08:16.540 --> 03:08:21.980]  the real thing yeah that's the mule so i'm just telling people this x2 isn't a joke we just researched
[03:08:21.980 --> 03:08:29.500]  what the globalists are doing we do the opposite but yes everyone with x2 x3 you need to consult
[03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:33.820]  a physician you need to because you're like oh that's just mother nature you see yeah mother nature
[03:08:33.820 --> 03:08:38.940]  the drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what god's already given us okay
[03:08:39.580 --> 03:08:47.660]  so i'm explaining it again without iodine you die the fields are depleted everything's depleted
[03:08:48.380 --> 03:08:57.820]  most iodine is bound to iron or copper or lead or something else you don't get it pure iodine is
[03:08:57.820 --> 03:09:08.460]  explosive and that on screen is pure iodine so yeah be careful let me let me just tell you
[03:09:08.460 --> 03:09:13.580]  what happened when i got on this stuff seven years ago i was filming a mile every day exercising
[03:09:13.580 --> 03:09:19.260]  couldn't lose weight weight just poured off it made me lazy iodine has made me lazy and i was like
[03:09:19.260 --> 03:09:22.860]  i don't want to get grabbed it's a family show but it's it's it's medical i'll tell you
[03:09:22.860 --> 03:09:27.900]  yeah when i didn't have good iodine
[03:09:31.020 --> 03:09:38.380]  i was not impotent but let's just say i was like god when i was a teenager and stuff you know i had
[03:09:38.380 --> 03:09:45.260]  a i was i was well hung when i got back on iodine i was like damn wow i remember that like you know
[03:09:45.260 --> 03:09:51.580]  i mean i'm telling you it's the that's just a manifestation of it is that no wonder they're
[03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:59.020]  trying to keep it away from us because it's you like vitamin c you die without it oxygen water
[03:09:59.020 --> 03:10:06.140]  or something iodine you have to have it's it's it's just paramount and so that's why we sell it
[03:10:06.140 --> 03:10:10.300]  that's why we've hyped it up because it's what they don't want you to have but yeah if you've
[03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:17.500]  been off of it and not had iodine for your whole life it's like you've ever been in a boxing ring
[03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:25.100]  and you get the ring with mike tyson your body's gonna be like what the hell is that because you've
[03:10:25.100 --> 03:10:32.460]  never had it but everybody that lives by seashore's they live longer they're healthier they have all
[03:10:32.460 --> 03:10:40.140]  of it fertility's better it just iodine is the magic sauce folks and i'm gonna stop ranting i said
[03:10:40.140 --> 03:10:44.060]  i take a bunch of calls i'm not doing it am i erin though what was your point about trump
[03:10:44.060 --> 03:10:50.060]  and send them back and all this stuff go ahead all right so people may or may not know that
[03:10:50.060 --> 03:10:53.900]  trump does not trigger people unless he's got some dirt on them so these people should be scared if
[03:10:53.900 --> 03:10:58.620]  he's calling him out like this he really they really should be scared but the whole tweet with
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:04.460]  he said go back to where you came from or go back to from where you came it everybody wants to go
[03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:09.420]  off i i saw heraldo this morning saying oh well you know people like me that's that's been used
[03:11:09.420 --> 03:11:14.300]  against me my whole life no you're choosing to allow that to be against you because that's how
[03:11:14.300 --> 03:11:19.980]  you say that oh marris from minnesota press release from from boston they're all in washington dc
[03:11:20.620 --> 03:11:25.180]  if he was saying go back to minnesota saying it to all of them he can't say go back to minnesota
[03:11:25.180 --> 03:11:29.980]  and boston and new york and fix your problems and then come back to washington and tell us how to fix
[03:11:29.980 --> 03:11:36.380]  it what else would he have said it wouldn't necessarily go back to your country it was go
[03:11:36.380 --> 03:11:40.620]  back to where you came from no i hear you erin but i don't think we have to apologize for what
[03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:45.340]  trump said because you may have read other tweets that i did he was saying if america sucked so bad
[03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:51.660]  go back to your country of origin and fix it but but i i hear what you're saying listen we all love
[03:11:51.660 --> 03:11:57.500]  everybody that comes here that loves america the issue is when you run it down constantly
[03:11:58.140 --> 03:12:02.380]  and then talk about how great your home country was well then go back to what trump's saying thank

[03:17:55.020 --> 03:18:00.140]  york marcus here thanks for holding hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i
[03:18:00.140 --> 03:18:04.460]  talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost
[03:18:04.460 --> 03:18:09.180]  nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to
[03:18:09.180 --> 03:18:13.820]  go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the
[03:18:13.820 --> 03:18:18.380]  public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his
[03:18:18.380 --> 03:18:22.060]  presidency it's the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time

[03:21:31.980 --> 03:21:37.980]  you're on the air and then floyd go ahead welcome yeah full disclosure i love alex jones you put
[03:21:37.980 --> 03:21:42.700]  two thousand dollars in my pocket and put me back on the road open my eyes to a lot of things
[03:21:42.700 --> 03:21:47.740]  the only thing i'm gonna happen is you win a contest or something yeah yeah yeah i won that
[03:21:47.740 --> 03:21:53.340]  contest yep but was that i'm trying to guess i remember two thousand dollars was that san bill
[03:21:53.340 --> 03:22:00.860]  clinton's a rapist to his face no no it was for uh on the economy you uh was that one contest that
[03:22:00.860 --> 03:22:06.140]  you had uh were uh you had to give your statement on the account well frank frank was right after me
[03:22:06.140 --> 03:22:11.420]  the guy where you made the commercial about frank and by the way i did pay off on that on that
[03:22:11.420 --> 03:22:16.540]  contest right i do i do that for all the contest yeah you sure did i was just saying uh full
[03:22:16.540 --> 03:22:22.540]  disclosure i just wish that you could supercharge info wars again to where they hate you like they
[03:22:22.540 --> 03:22:27.420]  did after the election where you uh you were going through the roof and everybody you was getting
[03:22:27.420 --> 03:22:32.540]  into areas where uh most people couldn't get to and that was because you was directly linked to the
[03:22:32.540 --> 03:22:39.260]  president i think when you told him when he won the election and you told him no sir don't come on
[03:22:39.260 --> 03:22:43.420]  i mean i would call it a mistake because who would want to have the president of the united
[03:22:43.420 --> 03:22:48.620]  states come on every month and i believe he was law enough to you to come on every month well i wasn't
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:52.860]  exactly saying that i was just saying i'm not trying to get access because they were all listening
[03:22:52.860 --> 03:22:57.180]  to the agencies and i don't want to be part of dc i was just simply saying i want you to be true to
[03:22:57.180 --> 03:23:04.220]  your mission i don't he never offered me anything i was saying i don't want anything does that make
[03:23:04.220 --> 03:23:10.140]  sense no i yeah it does it makes perfect sense i i just wish uh you can have that direct access
[03:23:10.140 --> 03:23:14.700]  is like a sort of what i mean we do let me tell you we we we talk to folks that talk to president
[03:23:14.700 --> 03:23:21.500]  all the time we get messages from the president i mean we we're able to get messages the president
[03:23:21.500 --> 03:23:28.460]  believe me the white house watches a show every day yes i i believe so because uh you know i know
[03:23:28.460 --> 03:23:32.860]  i watch in game almost every night though to sleep with it and i know the president has watched that
[03:23:32.860 --> 03:23:37.180]  and i know there's a lot of good information that he's took out of in game and not only that other
[03:23:37.180 --> 03:23:41.980]  things eclipse he came on your show i'm pretty sure he did some research on alex jones before he went
[03:23:41.980 --> 03:23:49.180]  on your show it's just like in that book that he had to fire roger stone and manna for it because
[03:23:49.180 --> 03:23:52.940]  they was running around dc telling everybody that they was going to change trump he was going to be
[03:23:52.940 --> 03:23:59.740]  2.0 trump you know i'm saying i want you you know trump to be trump and i just think we all need
[03:23:59.740 --> 03:24:04.860]  to help him and support him no matter what i know some things he may not do that we all agree with
[03:24:04.860 --> 03:24:09.020]  me personally i can't see anything that he hasn't done that i don't know i hear you and the way the
[03:24:09.020 --> 03:24:13.420]  system hates him but you're absolutely right uh and that the system absolutely hates trump and they
[03:24:13.420 --> 03:24:17.980]  don't know what to do and that shows you because he's actually the president before the presidents
[03:24:17.980 --> 03:24:23.260]  have been puppets for a long time god bless you christ i appreciate your calls yeah i don't even
[03:24:23.260 --> 03:24:28.940]  know what to say at this point um other than this country's in a fight and this plant's in a fight
[03:24:28.940 --> 03:24:39.340]  for its very survival okay who's up next here floyd in virginia thanks for holding your own here
[03:24:40.540 --> 03:24:47.020]  hey alex thanks uh for taking my call thank you but uh what i wanted to touch on was you know with
[03:24:47.020 --> 03:24:53.660]  ralph north on the the governor here i'm from virginia here he was elected by oh my god
[03:24:53.660 --> 03:25:02.220]  i know i sometimes maybe live sometimes maybe die that supports this man and we still don't
[03:25:02.220 --> 03:25:08.140]  understand how he was elected that was sometimes i wear a blackface sometimes i kkk
[03:25:09.820 --> 03:25:15.660]  we have northern virginia and and they usually dictate to the state of virginia because of
[03:25:15.660 --> 03:25:21.580]  the number of votes that are right outside of washington dc yeah there's always some blue city
[03:25:21.580 --> 03:25:28.220]  run a whole state isn't that sick it is disgusting because most of the state is is uh red we're
[03:25:28.220 --> 03:25:33.820]  republican but it's the big cities in virginia especially what is connected to to the northern
[03:25:33.820 --> 03:25:41.100]  virginia and i only live 60 miles outside of washington dc and it just uh it's not just those
[03:25:41.100 --> 03:25:47.580]  bigger populations they run election fraud in every blue city they've been caught everywhere
[03:25:47.580 --> 03:25:52.540]  touches on another one of my subjects but i was i really wanted to try to stick with
[03:25:53.180 --> 03:25:57.980]  he's been bought by the pharmaceutical companies and if they can make the money they're making off
[03:25:57.980 --> 03:26:04.140]  these baby parts from these abortion clinics in a state of virginia ralph northman in my opinion
[03:26:04.140 --> 03:26:09.340]  has been bought by the pharmaceutical companies i mean they're selling baby parts and that's one
[03:26:09.340 --> 03:26:15.660]  of the biggest industries in the state of virginia to this day it used to be tobacco now it's big
[03:26:15.660 --> 03:26:22.220]  pharmaceutical you know exactly virginia doesn't produce tobacco it produces baby parts we keep
[03:26:26.060 --> 03:26:31.900]  he is such a little piece of crap great points floyd love you appreciate you calling from virginia

[03:27:01.340 --> 03:27:07.420]  it's just been a constant turbo for that that's what we saw we sought to get good clean stimulant
[03:27:07.420 --> 03:27:12.460]  from nature but they haven't last 10 hours and that the average person's a 10 hour it's a good

[03:27:19.420 --> 03:27:25.580]  to talk about the uh trump disavowing uh us patriots yeah what do you think of that well it
[03:27:25.580 --> 03:27:31.580]  didn't really bother me a whole lot because you know i just know that trump has a plan truly you
[03:27:31.580 --> 03:27:36.860]  know i mean he does everything for a reason i think you know he has a plan for what's he doing here
[03:27:36.860 --> 03:27:42.940]  you know with the jihad squad how he attacks people and things like that he goes after him i just
[03:27:42.940 --> 03:27:48.860]  believe it's he has the plan he knows what's he's doing for it it doesn't really bother me honestly
[03:27:50.780 --> 03:27:55.580]  i mean so far i've gotten mad at trump a lot but he it always turns out good like
[03:27:55.580 --> 03:27:58.700]  he's pulling troops out of these countries he's doing he's doing what he said he do that's a good
[03:27:58.700 --> 03:28:07.820]  thing yeah yeah it is all right brother god bless you Zachary listen johnny and wyoming jameson

[03:32:00.140 --> 03:32:04.140]  our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks
[03:32:04.140 --> 03:32:07.900]  and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were
[03:32:07.900 --> 03:32:11.740]  the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good
[03:32:11.740 --> 03:32:15.820]  and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down
[03:32:15.820 --> 03:32:18.620]  the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[03:32:18.620 --> 03:32:23.340]  wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[03:32:23.340 --> 03:32:29.420]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say
[03:32:29.420 --> 03:32:33.580]  that a supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[03:32:33.580 --> 03:32:38.140]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[03:32:38.140 --> 03:32:41.980]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[03:32:41.980 --> 03:32:46.380]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about

[03:33:21.980 --> 03:33:31.100]  and welcome back and uh appreciate being here in the uh last half the fourth hour and um
[03:33:31.980 --> 03:33:39.500]  and so much so much is going on and uh picking up on some of the themes of the week um
[03:33:40.780 --> 03:33:47.660]  epsi you know that's the big the big one uh you know i think as far as what's what's coming next
[03:33:47.660 --> 03:33:55.740]  you know when does that next uh bag full of shoes drop um you know yeah that the most credible
[03:33:55.740 --> 03:34:00.300]  stuff i've heard on this it makes me kind of wonder about it is the idea that he was uh
[03:34:00.860 --> 03:34:08.060]  an intelligence asset you know it cost his rationale for him being off the hook um back in 208
[03:34:08.620 --> 03:34:16.380]  and when you think about that uh maybe that's the deal you know because our central intelligence
[03:34:16.380 --> 03:34:23.820]  agency and massage and others you know use blackmail and extortion um pretty you know
[03:34:23.820 --> 03:34:28.860]  generally they dig through trash to find things and i mean the idea of using some perverse like
[03:34:29.420 --> 03:34:36.700]  i've seen to film people and blackmail people and coerce people into doing things you know how
[03:34:36.700 --> 03:34:45.900]  else did he run around free for decades uh doing what he does um you know i remember
[03:34:45.900 --> 03:34:51.980]  and alex will remember this too you know way back when when we were first starting in this work 25
[03:34:51.980 --> 03:34:59.660]  years ago 24 years ago that the the stuff you were hearing about this kind of thing was so off
[03:34:59.660 --> 03:35:05.260]  the wall outrageous few of us talked about it you know because it was like too crazy you know
[03:35:05.260 --> 03:35:12.540]  and now it's not too crazy it actually is the mainstream media news you know that hey
[03:35:12.540 --> 03:35:17.980]  a bunch of their buddies are about to be indicted too that wouldn't surprise me one bit because
[03:35:18.940 --> 03:35:26.460]  if they properly raided these places and they captured the film and they captured the evidence
[03:35:27.180 --> 03:35:32.380]  um maybe a whole bunch of people are going to go to jail on this one and should rightly so and if
[03:35:32.380 --> 03:35:38.220]  our intelligence communities were involved in this and actually supported this and perpetrated
[03:35:38.220 --> 03:35:46.780]  this regardless of what the purpose was this is fundamentally wrong and i hope we get to the truth
[03:35:46.780 --> 03:35:52.140]  of the matter uh at some point i hope it's not like watergate you know i remember watergate
[03:35:52.140 --> 03:35:58.380]  as young then i was right in the middle of my dad's uh disappearance it was right before the
[03:35:58.380 --> 03:36:02.860]  church committee hearings when a whole lot of things were going on in the way of corruption
[03:36:02.860 --> 03:36:09.020]  and we got to see in those days like the image behind me for those who can see it is the tip
[03:36:09.020 --> 03:36:15.980]  of the icebergs 90 of the news never got reported in watergate and that's what we don't want to see
[03:36:15.980 --> 03:36:22.940]  happen now you know there's a lot of things that potentially can break in terms of the news feed
[03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:29.180]  things that are important for us to understand and know and the opportunity to do this is right
[03:36:29.180 --> 03:36:38.620]  now you know the opportunity to open the book on the corruption is right now you know you
[03:36:38.620 --> 03:36:45.900]  want to see the system change you want to see the politics of things change let the evidence
[03:36:45.900 --> 03:36:52.140]  present itself you know think about what's going on in europe right now with closed trials with
[03:36:52.140 --> 03:36:59.020]  tommy robinson just got thrown in jail for was reporting on trials could you imagine in the united
[03:36:59.020 --> 03:37:06.060]  states closed trials closed hearings and guess what we already have them but they're done in a way
[03:37:06.060 --> 03:37:15.020]  where we don't really talk about it in our media you know and it sees uh where the entire dossier
[03:37:15.020 --> 03:37:21.580]  that was faked by the clinton administration and shoved into the fbi's hands and used as a
[03:37:21.580 --> 03:37:28.780]  pretense for the fisi courts the secret courts to tap a presidential candidate you know and
[03:37:29.580 --> 03:37:40.620]  this network uh info wars and alex jones were principal players in making sure all the information
[03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:48.460]  was getting out continues to get out in you know the walls are closing in from so many directions
[03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:54.940]  to try and shut this network down and this is the critical hour the five minutes to midnight moment
[03:37:55.820 --> 03:38:03.340]  to stay on the air to double down with our effort to make sure we keep a public informed for a
[03:38:03.340 --> 03:38:11.900]  reasonable and rational debate not some crazy propaganda fest that we see coming from the
[03:38:11.900 --> 03:38:20.620]  mainstream media and really when you look at uh limiting the reporting of information and controlling
[03:38:20.620 --> 03:38:25.740]  the feed of information which is really about what's going on now it's not freedom of the press
[03:38:26.380 --> 03:38:33.020]  it's control of the information and propaganda feed to push outcomes whether they're political
[03:38:33.020 --> 03:38:42.140]  commercial religious or otherwise you know using media is what is done today now the problem with
[03:38:42.140 --> 03:38:51.340]  a lot of it is when it's controlled and manipulated by a few then the narrative is controlled and the
[03:38:51.340 --> 03:38:57.260]  narrative you know we hear that word a lot but what that is is in its fundamental is about
[03:38:57.260 --> 03:39:05.580]  reality creation the actual fundamental basis under which our culture our society the way
[03:39:05.580 --> 03:39:12.220]  we view government the way we view each other the way we view our world are largely shaped today by
[03:39:12.220 --> 03:39:18.300]  the media feed that is so different than even 10 years ago or 20 years ago or 30 years ago
[03:39:18.300 --> 03:39:22.700]  you know as we were going into the program today and I was looking at some of my notes from
[03:39:22.700 --> 03:39:29.660]  from past programs I talk occasionally about my brother's uh one of my brother's thesis and uh
[03:39:30.380 --> 03:39:40.300]  college was multi-generational history you know and and I know I know and knew uh knew now okay my
[03:39:41.100 --> 03:39:49.180]  my grandchild's great great great grandmother okay great great great grandmother not mother
[03:39:49.180 --> 03:39:54.380]  not grandmother not great grandmother not great great grandmother but great great great grandmother
[03:39:54.940 --> 03:40:02.700]  and I'm healthy and I'll see my grandchildren's children and perhaps even their children so I'll
[03:40:02.700 --> 03:40:10.300]  have known seven or eight generations of my family and retain their stories and pass them on to my
[03:40:10.300 --> 03:40:16.620]  children and link the value systems that are multi-generational as well something that media
[03:40:16.620 --> 03:40:22.540]  strips us of and tries to replace with each generation but a certain level of multi-generational
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:29.580]  knowledge is the foundation of liberty this foundation of freedom the foundation of the
[03:40:29.580 --> 03:40:38.380]  baseline creativity the human beings were put on the planet to engage in to be good stewards at the
[03:40:38.380 --> 03:40:48.620]  same time over the dominion of the earth the planet itself but also to be co-creators to be
[03:40:49.900 --> 03:40:58.220]  inspired to do the things that make us unique and that requires things like mathematics and music
[03:40:58.220 --> 03:41:05.420]  and art and literature and the things that engage us as human beings and telling a human story
[03:41:05.420 --> 03:41:13.260]  and in not a way of being framed by the events around us but where we individually create those
[03:41:13.260 --> 03:41:20.460]  events and and we do that by interacting respectfully with one another you know when we see what's
[03:41:20.460 --> 03:41:30.780]  going on and then we're about to see people in high places of a fall you know there's a lot of
[03:41:30.780 --> 03:41:40.140]  small people occupying high places and perhaps we're about to see a few of them fall in the
[03:41:40.140 --> 03:41:45.340]  Epstein scandal that's unfolding if we get to the truth and everyone survives you know maybe
[03:41:45.900 --> 03:41:51.420]  the reason the judge didn't release him wasn't because he was a threat to other young women
[03:41:51.420 --> 03:41:59.980]  which i'm sure he is but the fact that perhaps he's a threat to power structures that would
[03:41:59.980 --> 03:42:09.100]  prefer to see him not breathing at the moment because mr. Edstein i would bet as something to
[03:42:09.100 --> 03:42:15.500]  trade if they haven't found it already but i'm sure they have and hopefully they keep him
[03:42:16.300 --> 03:42:23.020]  locked up as we see what other things unfold from that investigation and you know when you
[03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:29.340]  think about again this is one even the mainstream can't escape now you know how do you escape this
[03:42:29.340 --> 03:42:37.900]  one now uh i just uh pray the ag at the national level is protected and those people that are
[03:42:37.900 --> 03:42:44.060]  engaged in this investigation are fortified and ready to break the truth to a nation that needs
[03:42:44.060 --> 03:42:49.660]  it this is dr nick baggage on the info wars and we're going into the break stand by for these
[03:42:49.660 --> 03:42:57.580]  messages it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square
[03:42:57.580 --> 03:43:02.700]  the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not
[03:43:02.700 --> 03:43:07.180]  backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's
[03:43:07.180 --> 03:43:11.660]  not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an
[03:43:11.660 --> 03:43:17.420]  old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[03:43:17.420 --> 03:43:21.340]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[03:43:21.340 --> 03:43:25.820]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[03:43:25.820 --> 03:43:29.660]  the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[03:43:29.660 --> 03:43:34.540]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[03:43:34.540 --> 03:43:39.820]  what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has
[03:43:39.820 --> 03:43:44.700]  broken through that they uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate
[03:43:44.700 --> 03:43:48.860]  american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the

[03:47:00.300 --> 03:47:20.300]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[03:47:23.020 --> 03:47:29.260]  and welcome back you know i appreciate the time here in this last few minutes of the fourth hour
[03:47:29.260 --> 03:47:36.460]  or on this friday afternoon you know as i think about the last segment i think about again this
[03:47:36.460 --> 03:47:45.340]  multi-generational memory and the value of it and values themselves as we transmit them you know
[03:47:45.340 --> 03:47:53.020]  through the generations hopefully intact and then layering on that are our life experiences and i've
[03:47:53.020 --> 03:48:00.380]  had a lot of a lot of very life experiences many people do as all of us too you know and also made
[03:48:00.380 --> 03:48:09.740]  it um sort of my life thing to learn to learn and to share what i know um in fact i know my uh
[03:48:10.300 --> 03:48:15.740]  my my significant other you know my my my fiance you know i read all the time and he's like sometimes
[03:48:15.740 --> 03:48:22.380]  aggravated a little bit by that you know because i draw my attention into what i'm reading so much
[03:48:22.380 --> 03:48:29.180]  of the time and uh and you know a lot of it is a pretty negative news feed you know as i discuss it
[03:48:29.180 --> 03:48:34.540]  with you and and and with people close to me you know in terms of what we're getting from the mainstream
[03:48:34.540 --> 03:48:41.740]  media and it's hard to kind of get on top of that to not let that drive us you know and in the way
[03:48:41.740 --> 03:48:47.980]  that so much of the media does to inflame the left and inflame the right and create this division
[03:48:47.980 --> 03:48:55.180]  this tribalism that many of the hosts on info wars talk about that really separates us it creates a
[03:48:55.180 --> 03:49:02.220]  breakdown in culture um in fact is the biggest racism at all of all is this idea of dividing
[03:49:02.220 --> 03:49:10.540]  us into these little subgroups as americans when that's not what we are at all um the idea of um
[03:49:11.340 --> 03:49:16.460]  a melting pot i think most of us embrace that you know at least those of us who arrived by
[03:49:16.460 --> 03:49:22.460]  uh the means of immigration through our heritage through our families through our multi-generational
[03:49:22.460 --> 03:49:28.780]  histories uh but i think again where most of us are today is please come through the front door
[03:49:28.780 --> 03:49:33.900]  you know do it the right way in the appropriate manner and you know we need people in this country
[03:49:33.900 --> 03:49:39.020]  that are willing to work hard and and have an opportunity but at the same time we need a front
[03:49:39.020 --> 03:49:45.180]  door policy not a backdoor policy that every few decades and we've done this we did this back in
[03:49:45.180 --> 03:49:51.900]  the last century um a couple of times we forgive the illegal immigration and grant everyone citizenship
[03:49:51.900 --> 03:49:58.060]  and so that encourages you know another wave of that another uh again multi-generational memory
[03:49:58.060 --> 03:50:03.340]  you go enough time people forget it we even did it before and then we do it again and it's a big
[03:50:03.340 --> 03:50:09.660]  controversy a lot of energy and then we do it again you know it's like hey how about creating
[03:50:09.660 --> 03:50:17.020]  a system that actually works um instead of one that's broken you know and then blaming the other
[03:50:17.020 --> 03:50:25.340]  guy to create this uh unreasonable and irrational division which is now hijacked the the democratic
[03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:30.860]  party in a way where their central theme is to deal with non-citizens isn't that the weirdest thing
[03:50:30.860 --> 03:50:36.620]  you've ever heard of as a main theme for a political party in america to not be worried about any
[03:50:36.620 --> 03:50:44.140]  americans as your main theme but everyone who got here illegally now that's you know that that's
[03:50:44.140 --> 03:50:51.020]  just that's not racist this is fundamentally wrong to be focused uh as as your as your main issue
[03:50:51.020 --> 03:50:57.180]  and i'm saying the racism is on the other foot um to create this much division over an illegal
[03:50:57.740 --> 03:51:03.980]  community of people entering our country that's really the issue you know but people hijack
[03:51:03.980 --> 03:51:08.220]  that issue and call it something else just you know it's kind of the famous way of uh you know
[03:51:08.220 --> 03:51:12.060]  like those words give it some nuance you know you don't like the word bribery and corruption so we
[03:51:12.060 --> 03:51:19.100]  have committee and campaign contribution you know i mean the same outcome right i mean access
[03:51:19.100 --> 03:51:24.620]  influence outcomes you know but different set of words make us feel better about it feel better
[03:51:24.620 --> 03:51:31.980]  about the idea that our process is regulated by committees come on give me a break you know just
[03:51:31.980 --> 03:51:36.860]  give it a new word give it a new spin and then you don't feel like well it's not a brown paper
[03:51:36.860 --> 03:51:43.500]  bag full of hundred dollar bills no but what's the difference you don't have the access you don't
[03:51:43.500 --> 03:51:49.740]  have the ability to influence outcomes unless you're running the money through the committee
[03:51:51.900 --> 03:51:57.020]  or in some parts of the world carrying around in the bag you know and so we rationalize all this
[03:51:57.020 --> 03:52:03.900]  behavior um but it's still bad behavior it's just a new package you know enough to repackage the bad
[03:52:03.900 --> 03:52:09.660]  behavior polos even uses that word repackaging you know it's like oh this will spread some lies
[03:52:09.660 --> 03:52:16.620]  repackaging into something new that way we can call the manure fertilizer right you know and feed
[03:52:16.620 --> 03:52:23.100]  the public it you know and then we'll all grow mushrooms come on ladies and gentlemen it's important
[03:52:23.100 --> 03:52:27.980]  to have dialogue it's important to look at your opposition understand what they're saying and then
[03:52:27.980 --> 03:52:35.580]  prepare the argument but this emotionally driven propaganda is not going to work in the long run
[03:52:35.580 --> 03:52:44.060]  in fact i would say this the backlash of the non-truth the fake news is huge because as people
[03:52:44.060 --> 03:52:51.340]  understand the truth of whatever the news really is and as we examine uh what's really happening
[03:52:51.340 --> 03:52:57.820]  around the world we get a different perspective at some point that converts to political change
[03:52:57.820 --> 03:53:04.060]  on some level hopefully in the way we've seen it um peacefully for the most part but you know when
[03:53:04.060 --> 03:53:11.580]  you think about the propaganda machine what needs to be broken is the secrecy syndrome that has
[03:53:11.580 --> 03:53:17.740]  created a corrupt government repackage for the american public in some palatable way
[03:53:17.740 --> 03:53:24.780]  and now they're trying to restrict our opportunity to speak about this by choking off the airwaves
[03:53:24.780 --> 03:53:31.260]  and calling the google's and the big facebook's and the controllers of the information age
[03:53:31.820 --> 03:53:38.540]  something other than what they are the communication channel of this age which has to be unrestricted
[03:53:38.540 --> 03:53:46.140]  and regulated in a way that allows equal access equal play equal platform no shadow banning
[03:53:46.140 --> 03:53:52.940]  no retaining of our data in fact all the commercial data and data used to manipulate populations
[03:53:52.940 --> 03:53:57.980]  when google applies their programs to china as an example and applies them commercially and
[03:53:57.980 --> 03:54:04.780]  politically to united states to create outcomes this is corruption at the deepest level this is
[03:54:04.780 --> 03:54:11.420]  the hijacking of the republic not just ours but everybody else's opportunity to have one
[03:54:11.420 --> 03:54:17.820]  uh this is the biggest blight on democracy is what has happened to freedom of the press
[03:54:18.380 --> 03:54:24.380]  and because without each of those things within the first amendment of that constitution press
[03:54:25.180 --> 03:54:32.700]  speech religion assembly those freedoms none of the others matter you have to have a free
[03:54:32.700 --> 03:54:39.260]  and unfettered press which in the 21st century means an unrestricted equal access and these
[03:54:39.260 --> 03:54:46.300]  guys that are abusing this privilege then we need to take these assets away from them and reclaim
[03:54:46.300 --> 03:54:52.060]  the public airwaves of the 21st century and call them public again and make google a public entity
[03:54:52.060 --> 03:55:01.100]  not a private company you want to scare the hell out of the globalist take over break them up but
[03:55:01.100 --> 03:55:06.860]  don't remember one thing when you break them up they make even more money when you break them up
[03:55:06.860 --> 03:55:11.340]  in all these sub parts because those original shareholders have a chunk of all these entities
[03:55:11.340 --> 03:55:17.580]  then and some piece of the pie as they break it up and break huge profits and that's not the
[03:55:17.580 --> 03:55:24.780]  right solution either you know make sure we properly analyze these guys for the abuses
[03:55:24.780 --> 03:55:30.380]  privacy you know five billion is chump change for trillion dollar companies make sure that
[03:55:30.380 --> 03:55:36.460]  privacy is valued and the human rights violations of the big tech companies strips the wealth
[03:55:36.460 --> 03:55:45.740]  from them this and again strips the wealth from them from their boards from their executives who
[03:55:45.740 --> 03:55:53.100]  have abused the privilege of the press which is to protect the debate to protect freedom of the
[03:55:53.100 --> 03:56:01.420]  press these companies need to be folded up as bad performers and a lousy experiment and whatever
[03:56:01.420 --> 03:56:06.300]  the government had to do whether it be chinese government of the u.s. government or whatever
[03:56:06.300 --> 03:56:12.380]  other governments use these mediums to manipulate public outcomes that's the truth that needs to
[03:56:12.380 --> 03:56:19.740]  be seen those are what congressional hearings need to pry open how has the public been deceived
[03:56:19.740 --> 03:56:27.740]  manipulated played with and propagandized by big tech and what penalties for those violations of
[03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:34.060]  our basic civil liberties should be unfolded for big tech for violating the true meaning of freedom
[03:56:34.060 --> 03:56:41.180]  of the press and freedom of speech to strip away our civil liberties as a population because they
[03:56:41.180 --> 03:56:49.020]  disagree with our political speech no this is the very foundation of who we are as americans
[03:56:49.820 --> 03:56:55.980]  political speech is what america is about and the disagreement over political speech
[03:56:55.980 --> 03:57:00.300]  is the foundation of and if you don't think there was some disagreement about those
[03:57:00.300 --> 03:57:06.460]  that supported king george and those that supported liberty 250 years ago you're dreaming
[03:57:07.260 --> 03:57:13.260]  that was the civil debate that was the five minutes to midnight discussion and that's a
[03:57:13.260 --> 03:57:20.220]  discussion today and today we have the possibility of having an exchange that doesn't involve bullets
[03:57:20.220 --> 03:57:27.260]  and bombs but dialogue and discussion don't shut that off uh anyone who's listening in this
[03:57:27.260 --> 03:57:33.100]  administration congressional or at the executive don't shut that off this is the foundation of

[03:58:50.460 --> 03:58:54.860]  lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody
[03:58:54.860 --> 03:58:59.740]  agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[03:58:59.740 --> 03:59:04.140]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[03:59:04.140 --> 03:59:08.780]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[03:59:08.780 --> 03:59:12.460]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying
[03:59:12.460 --> 03:59:16.220]  my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to
